Before reviewing the financials, I wanted to comment on the company's delayed filings and restatement of prior periods. We are obviously very d",1932,"Thank you, Jourdan, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our fiscal fourth quarter conference call. Before reviewing the financials, I wanted to comment on the company's delayed filings and restatement of prior periods. We are obviously very disappointed by the restatement, which resulted in both internal control deficiencies and employee misconduct. Specifically, after the discovery of misconduct by employees, we identified the single long-term contract of which a forward loss provision should have been recorded in 2009 and the impact on subsequent periods of the adjustment of the forward loss provisions as products were delivered when this conduct and its related financial impacts were concealed from Ducommun senior management, our internal auditors and our external auditors. And this conduct by these employees is not the way we do business. Ducommun is dedicated to the utmost integrity in everything that we do. We have begun the process of taking corrective actions, including termination of employees involved and dedicated -- and we are dedicated to committing the necessary resources to ensure that this never ever happens again. To be clear, our investigation revealed no other programs were involved in this misconduct, and there was no impact to our customers. 
At the same time and unrelated to the employees' misconduct, we discovered errors in our income tax accounting. These errors are also unacceptable, and we're committed to enhancing our controls and our technical expertise to ensure that they are not repeated. In addition, the restatement includes previously identified and disclosed immaterial adjustments. 
Now turning to our financial results. Ducommun's fourth quarter benefited from improved mix and modest sequential increase in our operating margins. However, the quarter also has several unusual items that somewhat aided these performance gains as Joe will review in a minute. Review of the quarter -- our revenue for the quarter was $188 million, our operating cash flow was $32.5 million, and including the various one-time items, we reported earnings at $0.46 per share. 
While 2014 is now behind us and we can look back and assess our overall accomplishment as well as areas needing further improvement, we ended the year with $742 million in sales, essentially flat with 2013, while recording $1.79 of earnings per diluted share. All in all, we had a number of important success while withstanding a significant decline in our military business. The growth in our commercial aerospace operations was certainly a highlight. We posted a record revenue of $242 million driven by higher product shipments of large commercial aircraft and modest growth in our regional and business jet markets, helping to offset a $32 million decline in military sales as compared to 2013. 
During the year, we noted many significant wins such as on the 737 MAX and Airbus A320, A320 NEO and A350 platforms. We also made some excellent inroads penetrating the engine market positioning us for growth going forward. In addition, we have signed or we are in the process of finalizing long-term supply agreement with Airbus, Boeing, United Technologies, Spirit and Parker Aerospace. 
Turning to the non-A&D markets, we continue to see positive results from our efforts while targeting major strategic industrial customers. The catalyst behind our success here has been our constant focus on providing innovative solutions and outstanding service with growth fueled by strong customer relationships and a surge in new business development activity. This was exemplified by the fact that during the year, Ducommun earned preferred supplier status from key industrial customers. We have positioned ourselves to reposit the results from cost savings and efficiency improvement initiatives across the company and saw excellent working capital gains in several key areas, but we still have more work to do here. We continue to look closely at our manufacturing footprint, and as an example, have initiated the facility consolidation in one of our structural solutions business units aggregating the operation from 3 buildings into 1. This effort will be finalized earlier in the second half of 2015 as we will continue to focus on driving operational efficiency and margin enhancements going forward. 
Improvements already achieved in working capital helped propel operating cash flow to $53 million and free cash flow to $35 million in 2014. We also paid down nearly $43 million of our credit facility last year and in 2014 with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio slightly under 3 to 1 from a high of 4.5 to 1 following the acquisition of LaBarge in 2011. We have consistently called our shareholders and our lenders that we are committed to reducing our leverage ratio to less than 3x by the end of 2015, and we are on schedule to hit that target. In addition, we are now planning to refinance our debt and its entirety as soon as practical, which we expect will result in significant interest expense savings going forward.  Joe is going to talk about this more in a moment. 
Looking ahead, we will focus on top line growth across our commercial aerospace market, engine market and the non-A&D segments to offset the headwinds caused by declining military programs and the sunsetting of certain platforms, which will impact our sales and margins during the first half of 2015 as we adjust the mix changes and invest in new commercial programs. We look to drive higher growth and improve operating performance in the second half of the year concentrating our efforts on expanding margins, growing the business and ensuring customer satisfaction through operational excellence. In short, this will be a transition year for Ducommun as we work to refinance our debt and position the company for higher returns to 2016 and beyond. 
Now let me provide some color on the markets and our products, and of course, our progress. Starting with our military and space markets in 2014, revenue fell 8% or $32 million year-over-year. The fourth quarter was down 18% or $18 million versus 2013, reflecting the many challenges we discussed previously, including the wind down of the Boeing C-17 program for which we made our last shipments in the fourth quarter. We also saw lower revenue within our military helicopter space, which included the Apache main rotor blade down in the fourth quarter. We expect -- we expect this business to remain at current levels during 2015. These changes cost our military structures business to decline more than our electronic segment last year, although the electronic segment was impacted by lower radar shipment, particularly for the F-18 and the F-15 program. 
Going forward, we expect that revenue within the military and space markets will continue to somewhat lower reflecting budget realities and platform curtailments with sales stabilizing in the second half of 2015. 
While the President's latest budget includes increased defense spending for fiscal 2016, it's clearly too soon to say whether this will actually happen, and if it does, whether Ducommun will see any meaningful increase in orders near term. That said, we are encouraged by the budget emphasis on equipment modernization which plays to our strength, and the fact that it includes substantial increase in funding for a number of programs we currently support. In any event, we believe the ongoing conditions in the Middle East, combined with the commercial nature of the platforms we serve support our base level demand even in budget negotiations play out in the Washington. Electronic upgrades to such aircraft as the F-18 and the F-15 we believe will continue. 
Our missile defense business revenue was slightly down in 2014, and we expect this market to stabilize going forward. We also continue to bid on new opportunities with the military and missile-defense space, and believe our customer relationships and quality recognition put us in a solid footing to win additional content. We are targeting applications that best leverage our technology advances and our structural expertise. The bottom line is that even in the current budget environment, there will always be room to expand our defense business on the right programs and platforms, and we intend to do just that. Positioning the company for higher growth when spending in Washington is better to find. In the meantime, we're actively taking steps across our facilities to reduce cost, increase efficiency and expand our margins. We know we can do this even as run rates start to drop on certain platforms as we look to reduce working capital and drive higher cash flow for investment elsewhere. 
In one place we're certainly investing is within the commercial aerospace arena, where, as I noted earlier, were ahead of our best year ever. Revenue in the fourth quarter rose to nearly $65 million, also a record, up 25% year-over-year from 2013 and driving a full year revenue of $242 million, up 14% year-over-year. The growth across our large commercial airplane platforms, as evidenced by our business program, the 737, which rose to nearly $60 [ph] million sales in 2014. The consistent growth in our commercial programs deserves to somewhat offset decline in the military sales. 
We will continue to look for further growth in both commercial aircraft as well as the engine markets. I've spoken in the past about the many opportunities we're working on to expand, particularly with Airbus, and we're clearly focus on increasing our penetration with this important customer. At the same time, we're bidding on new electronic and structural solutions for Boeing, Spirit and Bombardier as well as major engine OEMs where we are working to build on our already existing partnerships. We feel confident that even in current levels, our business can expand substantially within this space driven by increased content as well as higher build rates. 
Moving to our non-A&D business. The end of 2014 saw a continued upward momentum with Q4 revenue of nearly $38 million as the highest since the third quarter of 2012. In addition, our backlog within these markets rose 25% year-over-year, which bodes well for Boeing into 2015. We remain focused on winning new customers within the space and have made good inroads into several heavy industrial markets. However, within the natural resources markets, we're fully aware of the implication inherent in the slightly lower oil prices and cutbacks slightly significantly lower oil prices and cutbacks in the future capital spending. This business represented about 6% of our total revenue in '14, but we have strategy in place to deal with the current market fluctuation, which will likely negatively impact demand near term. In fact, we project sales for us in the oil market could drop 30% to 40% during the first 3 quarters, but we feel confident the success we've taken over the past year will broaden our business base and expand our industrial segment market penetration. 
For Ducommun, in total, in 2014, topline was characterized by solid growth in our commercial aerospace and non-A&D market offsetting softer revenue within the defense area. I think you'll note that as sales were flat, we offset $32 million of drop sales in the military with our growth in the commercial market. We see the trend continue in 2015 with year-over-year comps a bit tougher, particularly during the first 2 quarters. But due to the impact of the Legacy C-17, Apache and Radar Rack business. As I said, earlier, we view 2015 as a transition. We will focus on replacing reduced military sales and offsetting oil and gas sales by leveraging strong customer relationships and aggressively pursuing new business development opportunities. Overall, we feel robust plan that we have in place will improve margins and drive growth positioning the company for higher returns. With that, I would now like to have Joe review our financial results. Joe?"

We appreciate you being on the call this early. As Tony mentioned, we are deeply disappointed in the employees' misconduct and the weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that have led to",1917,"Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everybody. We appreciate you being on the call this early. As Tony mentioned, we are deeply disappointed in the employees' misconduct and the weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that have led to restatements in certain prior periods. We take this matter very seriously and are working diligently to implement the necessary corrective actions. We're in the process of remediating 4 material weaknesses, 3 related to a long-term contract initiated in prior periods following the discovery of misconduct by employees, which resulted in the identification of a forward loss reserve and that should have been recorded in 2009, a prior period.  In addition, our fourth material weakness was recognized related to income tax errors in the year-end reconciliation of income taxes for payables and deferred assets and deferred tax balances primarily in 2013, 2012 and 2011. 
We expect to remediate the forward loss contract material weaknesses by the end of the third quarter of this year and the tax adjustment weaknesses by year end as year-end entity controls. 
The 10-K results, which we released this morning for fiscal 2014, include restatements of certain previously issued financial statements and its selected financial data. I want to quantify the effect of that. The restatement has the following effect on our financial statements: The net income increased $1 million or $0.09 per fully diluted share for the 9 months ended September 27, 2014. Net income increased $2 million or $0.19 a share per fully diluted share for fiscal 2013. Net income increased $1.2 million or $0.11 per fully diluted share for fiscal 2012, these are all compared to what was previously recorded. Our shareholders equity was reduced by $4.4 million as of September 27, 2014. The restatement had no effects on our revenues or our cash flows from operations. 
Now turning to our financial results. Looking at the fourth quarter results. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $188 million, that was very similar to last year's fourth quarter. The revenue does reflect the continuing shift in demand we've seen throughout the second half of 2014 with a strong 25% increase in revenues for the commercial aerospace shipments and they're being offset by an 18% decrease in military and space sales, both structural and electronics products. 
Within the commercial aerospace sector, we saw increases in both structures and electronic solutions as we continue to benefit from higher airframe build rates and increased content. Conversely, in the military and space sector, we have seen reduced demand in both structural solutions and technology applications reflecting lower aggregate demand for government defense spending. We expect these mixed shift trends as well as overall levels of demand to continue through the first half of 2015. 
Ducommun's net income for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $5.2 million, that's $0.46 per fully diluted share compared to a loss of $5.2 million or $0.49 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2013. As previously recorded in '13 when we reported our results for the fourth quarter, the net loss included charges of $8.8 million or $0.51 per share after-tax and was comprised of 2 pretax program-related charges of $14 million that were somewhat offset by reduced accrued compensation expenses in that period of approximately $5.3 million. 
Fourth quarter 2014 net income was favorably impacted by an insurance recovery we also saw one in the third quarter and increases in income from a favorable customer settlement resulting in a modest benefit from the reversal of a forward loss reserve. The fourth quarter also benefited from a favorable income tax rate, which was partially offset by higher accrued compensation and benefit cost in our fourth quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, legislation was passed to approve the research and development tax credit, and we recognized a $2.4 million or $0.21 per fully diluted share benefit as compared to the last year's comparable period where we had recognized a $0.8 million benefit in the fourth quarter or approximately $0.07 per diluted share. The reason I talked about these are that in 2013, the legislation was approved on January 2, so we took approximately $0.7 million, $0.8 million a period or $0.07 a share throughout the fourth quarter was in '13 whereas in '14, we only recognized the R&D tax credit benefit of $0.21 to a net debt period. So as we look at it, the delta was $0.14 on a true [ph] run rate year-over-year. 
Regarding the availability of federal R&D tax credit in 2015 as legislation has not been passed this year, we do not expect to record any related R&D tax benefit until, or if, such legislation is passed. As a result, we expect a normalized tax rate of 31% throughout each reporting period in 2015. 
Operating income for the fourth quarter was $10 million or 5.4% of revenues, very similar to the amount reported in the third quarter 2014. This reflects the environment and the shift in business mix we experienced in the latter half of the year, including the 2 military programs that Tony spoke about that are winding down. Our gross margin is 17.9%, it was slightly higher than the 17.6% gross margin in the third quarter of 2014. We are addressing the impact of mixed shift and gross margin levels and taking action date by rightsizing our manufacturing cost structure to adapt to these changes. 
Higher accrued compensation costs resulted in selling, general and administrative expenses running about 12.6% of revenues resulting in an operating margin of 5.4%. Again, this was very similar to the amount we reported on our third quarter of 2014. Included in the current quarter results was a $1 million insurance recovery related to property and equipment, which is classified in other income.  EBITDA was $18.2 million or approximately 9.7% of revenues in our fourth quarter. 
In reviewing results by each of the business segments. First, Ducommun AeroStructures, DAS. DAS reported sales of $78 million in the fourth quarter, as compared to $81 million in last year's prior period. DAS revenue was unfavorably impacted by a 27% decrease in military and space sales primarily due to the reductions in the C-17 as the contract ended in the fourth quarter and the Apache main roller, which has seen reduced customer requirement. Partially offsetting the military and space declines was an 18% increase in commercial aerospace revenues driven by solid growth of Boeing and Airbus shipments, along with an increase in sales of regional and business jet applications. DAS's operating income was $6.9 million or 8.8% of revenues, similar to the third quarter of 2014. Segment operating income was favorably impacted by the reversal of a forward loss reserves as a result of a customer settlement, partially offset by higher accrued compensation and benefit cost. Our EBITDA in the DAS sector was $10.5 million or 13.5% of revenues. 
Now next in reviewing the Ducommun LaBarge Technologies, or DLT segment. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $109 million, that's a 2% increase compared to last year's comparable period. That said, we are also seeing a modest shift as defense electronic sales declined by $8 million, they are offset by increases in commercial aerospace, electronics revenue which were up $5 million and a $5 million increase in non-A&D sales. We attribute the decrease in defense technologies applications revenues primarily because of reductions in funding for F-18 modernizations affecting our radar rack applications and softness in military helicopter demand. In recent years, we have seen sequential declines in our defense electronics backlog, but we continue to see higher demand for our commercial aerospace electronics and our non-A&D offerings, both a result of recent business development initiatives. However, while revenue within the national -- within the natural resources sector was solid for the quarter and for the year, we are now seeing the adverse impact of the changing dynamics in the energy markets, including higher oil prices, and this is being reflected on our sequential decline in current backlog. 
DLT's operating income for the fourth quarter '14 was $8.5 million or 7.8% of revenue. That compares to $9.4 million or 8.8% of revenue in '13. The decrease reflects an unfavorable product mix, higher manufacturing costs and accrued compensation and benefit expenses. They are partially offset by higher revenues. We're currently addressing and taking action on the level of manufacturing expenses and are aggressively pursuing cost-reduction activities and supply chain initiatives aimed at improving operating performance.  EBITDA was $13 million during the quarter or 11.9% of revenue compared to $13.9 million or 13% of revenue in last year's comparable period.
Corporate, general and administrative expenses, which are unallocated to business segments for the fourth quarter of 2014, were $5.3 million or 2.8% of revenues compared to $3.5 million or 1.9% of revenues in last year's comparable period, primarily as a result of higher accrued compensation and benefit expenses this year as compared to last year. Our overall backlog at the end of the quarter was $559 million. This equates to a sequential decrease of $10 million versus Q3 2014 and reflects the $13 million decline in our military and space backlog, a $7 million increase in commercial aerospace products and a $4 million reduction in demand for industrial and energy application. As I mentioned, most of those are really related to the slowdown in backlogs from the energy sector. We're working diligently to finalize additional orders across various commercial aerospace and defense technologies platforms in the upcoming half of this year, consistent with normal seasonal patterns. 
We now turn to liquidity and capital resources. Earlier, Tony mentioned that during the quarter, we continue to de-lever our balance sheet and generate very solid cash flows. In 2014, we generated a record $53 million in cash flow from operations compared to just under $46 million in full year 2013. We generated approximately $38 million in free cash flow, which is approximately $3.40 per fully diluted share and used all of that and some cash on hand in our balance sheet to repay nearly $43 million in debt in 2014. We remain diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect historic seasonal patterns. We ended the year with sufficient cash balances and expect to continue deleveraging the balance sheet. At year end, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was approximately 3:1.  During the first quarter of 2015, we also made another $10 million prepayment on our term loan debt and we have now reduced our total funded debt to $280 million. At this stage, we are in schedule with regards to our goal of deleveraging the targets of 2.75 to 3 by year-end 2015. In addition, we recognized that we may have the opportunity this year to refinance our debt and reduced interest expenses significantly going forward as well as our -- as well as increase our ability to execute on our strategic growth initiatives.  Capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 were $18 million. We expect them to be $15 million in fiscal 2015. 
In closing, as we continue to focus on managing the changing mix on our business, addressing manufacturing cost and pursue supply chain savings and opportunities to support our goal of achieving sustained operating and EBITDA margin, which, along with diligent and frugal expense management and a focus on working capital efficiency, should permit the company to generate meaningful free cash flow going forward. And with that, I'd like to turn it back to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

Almost all customers, and we talked about this, and Boeing has a partner for success and United Technologies have what they call their B squared program. Spirit  has a program very similar. And as we work with them for the long-term, there's clearly -- they look at 3 things. One is your expertise in delivering on time, your ability to maintain excellent quality, and then how do you manage our cost structure. And as we look forward, we've set long-term agreements with our customers, and in some cases, there are 3-year supply agreements where we set up an opportunity to not only maintain the business that we have, but also secure some enhancement and growth across the board. So there'll be more predictability on platforms that we currently serve and there'll be more predictability for us in terms of opportunities to get new business. Of course, you always have to be competitive in those marketplaces and you'll always have to win the business. But we've really put ourselves in a position where we've improved our quality over the year, we've improved our deliver performance over the year, and we've put ourselves in a position where we think we can be successful in capturing a business.

Your question is where is the growth in the backlog coming from. On the commercial aerospace is coming from a combination of some higher build rates from the large airframe manufacturers and increased content. I made those in my earlier remarks. But even as we saw in the first quarter here, we saw that Boeing increased their shipments, it was primarily in the 737, and then the larger growth was in the Dreamliner where they delivered 30 planes versus 18 last year. And in Airbus, their A320 family of products single out carriers are seeing nice growth and increased build rates as well as the A350s coming on. The reason I mentioned those, those are the 2 programs that we're really focused on. On Boeing's 777, we -- it's been pretty flat. So that's what we're seeing the growth. But also over the years, we've been obtaining more content with our -- primarily our titanium forming solutions, thermoforming solutions. So we expect those trends to continue.

The reason I said those is, if you quantify those, just little over 2 years ago in September of '13, we had about 142 -- $164 million of inventory, and we're down to $142 million. And we think that there's more opportunities there to reduce our inventory dollars and improve our returns, which will free up more cash flow. That's certainly one area that we look at. I also mentioned supply chain initiatives, and our supply chain initiatives are not only in bringing more value to our improvement in profitability to our operations, but more value to our customers by a more robust supply chain. We will see not only, we believe, some cost savings but we'll see some cash flow savings of us not having to stock so much in raw material picture. So we're really excited about our opportunities there. And so we've looked at this since consolidated businesses in 2012, and it has been -- it certainly follows that cash profiles, the seasonal patterns they have in '12, '13 and '14.

But the supply chain initiatives that Joe talked about, and the things that Joe and Doug, our Chief Financial -- our Chief Accounting Officer, are driving just really the management of not only the receivables and the payables, but how we're managing the inventory coming in, we're looking at what we call sales order and operating planning so that we can reduce our queue times. So we are really concentrating on trying to stay level or increase the cash flow. To give you a number there, we increased by 4 next year, I think, for this year, we really have more work in front of us. But I would say that it would be safe to say that in terms of the pickups we see that right in front of us toward the end of the year, we think will pick up some additional savings on the inventory turns, and of course, the savings that we anticipate from the refinancing. So I would say that if you look at normal cash flow for the year, our goal is to try and stable with what we did last year even with the decline on the military side. There's a significant loss of business if you look at -- we have about a $32 million in sales, but we still have the front-end of the year when we have significant military sales that drove some cash.

But as that wind down, what we've done, particularly with the machine tools and new programs and therefore, the Bombardier 7000 new business Jets, the A320 or A319 program that we picked up, we pick up some of that use of the capital equipment. So I think we're moving through and refilling shop revenue orders we've got a couple of things in the engine market that we're working on and haven't been announced that are taking up some of the footprint. So I think we plan on having the opportunity to fill that shop as we go forward and it creates opportunities for us, that's the way we look at that, and I think that we'll be just fine as we go forward. And if you remember, from a press standpoint, we've got some of the largest presses in the United States from a forming standpoint. So we are well positioned to grow that business with the current requirement in the marketplace."

Before reviewing the financials, I wanted to comment on the company's delayed filings and restatement of prior periods. We are obviously very di",1932,"Thank you, Jordan, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our fiscal fourth quarter conference call. Before reviewing the financials, I wanted to comment on the company's delayed filings and restatement of prior periods. We are obviously very disappointed by the restatement, which resulted in both internal control deficiencies and employee misconduct. 
Specifically, after the discovery of misconduct by employees, we identified a single long-term contract of which a forward loss provision should have been recorded in 2009 and the impact on subsequent periods of the adjustment of the forward loss provisions as products were delivered. The misconduct and its related financial impacts were concealed from Ducommun senior management, our internal auditors and our external auditors. The misconduct by these employees is not the way we do business. Ducommun is dedicated to the utmost integrity in everything that we do. We have begun the process of taking corrective actions, including termination of employees involved and dedicated -- and we are dedicated to committing the necessary resources to ensure that this never ever happens again. To be clear, our investigation revealed no other programs were involved in this misconduct and there was no impact to our customers.  
At the same time and unrelated to the employees' misconduct, we discovered errors in our income tax accounting. These errors are also unacceptable. And we're committed to enhancing our controls and our technical expertise to ensure that they are not repeated. In addition, the restatement includes previously identified and disclosed immaterial adjustment.  
Now turning to our financial results. Ducommun's fourth quarter benefited from improved mix and modest sequential increase in our operating margins. However, the quarter also has several unusual items that somewhat aided these performance gains, as Joe will review in a minute. Review of the quarter -- or revenue for the quarter was $188 million. Our operating cash flow was $32.5 million. And including the various one-time items, we reported earnings at $0.46 per share.  
While 2014 is now behind us and we can look back and assess our overall accomplishments as well as areas needing further improvement, we ended the year with $742 million in sales, essentially flat with 2013, while recording $1.79 of earnings per diluted share. All in all, we had a number of important success while withstanding a significant decline in our military business. The growth in our commercial aerospace operations was certainly a highlight. We posted a record revenue of $242 million, driven by higher product shipments of large commercial aircraft and modest growth in our regional and business jet markets, helping to offset a $32 million decline in military sales as compared to 2013.  
During the year, we noted many significant wins, such as on the 737 MAX and Airbus A320, A320neo and the A350 platforms. We also made some excellent inroads penetrating the engine markets, positioning us for growth going forward. In addition, we have signed or we are in the process of finalizing long-term supply agreements with Airbus, Boeing, United Technologies, Spirit and Parker Aerospace.  
Turning to the non-A&D markets. We continued to see positive results from our efforts while targeting major strategic industrial customers. The catalyst behind our success here has been our constant focus on providing innovative solutions and outstanding service with growth fueled by strong customer relationships and a surge in new business development activity. This was exemplified by the fact that during the year, Ducommun earned preferred supplier status from key industrial customers. We have positioned ourselves to reposit the results from cost savings and efficiency improvement initiatives across the company and saw excellent working capital gains in several key areas. But we still have more work to do here. We continue to look closely at our manufacturing footprint, and as an example, have initiated a facility consolidation in one of our structural solutions business units, aggregating the operation from 3 buildings into 1. This effort will be finalized earlier in the second half of 2015 as we will continue to focus on driving operational efficiencies and margin enhancements going forward.  
Improvements already achieved in working capital helped propel operating cash flow to $53 million and free cash flow to $35 million in 2014. We also paid down nearly $43 million of our credit facility last year, ending 2014 with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio slightly under 3:1 from a high of 4.5:1 following the acquisition of LaBarge in 2011. We have consistently told our shareholders and our lenders that we are committed to reducing our leverage ratio to less than 3x by the end of 2015. And we are on schedule to hit that target. In addition, we are now planning to refinance our debt and its entirety as soon as practical, which we expect will result in significant interest expense savings going forward. Joe is going to talk about this more in a moment.  
Looking ahead, we will focus on top line growth across the commercial aerospace market, engine markets and the non-A&D segments to offset the headwinds caused by declining military programs and the sunsetting of certain platforms, which will impact our sales and margins during the first half of 2015 as we adjust the mix changes and invest in new commercial programs. We'll look to drive higher growth and improved operating performance in the second half of the year, concentrating our efforts on expanding margins, growing the business and ensuring customer satisfaction through operational excellence. In short, this will be a transition year for Ducommun as we work to refinance our debt and position the company for higher returns in 2016 and beyond.  
Now let me provide some color on the markets and our products, and of course, our programs. Starting with our military and space markets in 2014, revenue fell 8% or $32 million year-over-year. The fourth quarter was down 18% or $18 million versus 2013, reflecting the many challenges we've discussed previously, including the wind-down of the Boeing C-17 program for which we made our last shipments in the fourth quarter. We also saw lower revenue within our military helicopter space, which included the Apache main rotor blade, down in the fourth quarter. We expect this business to remain at current levels during 2015. These changes caused our military structures business to decline more than our electronic segment last year, although the electronic segment was impacted by lower radar racks shipped, particularly for the F-18 and the F-15 program. 
Going forward, we expect that revenue within the military and space markets will continue to trend somewhat lower, reflecting budget realities and platform curtailments with sales stabilizing in the second half of 2015. While the President's latest budget includes increased defense spending for fiscal 2016, it's clearly too soon to say whether this will actually happen. And if it does, whether Ducommun will see any meaningful increase in orders near term. That said, we are encouraged by the budget's emphasis on equipment modernization, which plays to our strengths and the fact that it includes substantial increase in funding for a number of programs we currently support. In any event, we believe that ongoing conditions in the Middle East, combined with the crucial nature of the platforms we serve support a base level demand even as the budget negotiations play out in Washington. Electronic upgrades to such aircraft as the F-18 and the F-15, we believe, will continue.  
Our missile defense business revenue was slightly down in 2014. And we expect this market to stabilize going forward. We also continue to bid on new opportunities with the military and missile defense space and believe our customer relationships and quality reputation put us in a solid footing to win additional content. We are targeting applications that best leverage our technology advances and our structural expertise. The bottom line is that even in the current budget environment, there will always be room to expand our defense business on the right programs and platforms, and we intend to do just that, positioning the company for higher growth when spending in Washington is better to find. In the meantime, we're actively taking steps across our facilities to reduce cost, increase efficiency and expand our margins. We know we can do this even as run rates start to drop on certain platforms as we look to reduce working capital and drive higher cash flow for investment elsewhere.  
And one place we're certainly investing is within the commercial aerospace arena, where as I noted earlier, where we had our best year ever. Revenue in the fourth quarter rose to nearly $65 million, also a record, up 25% year-over-year from 2013 and driving a full year revenue of $242 million, up 14% year-over-year. The growth across our large commercial airframe platforms was evidenced by our biggest program, the 737, which rose to nearly $60 million in sales in 2014. The consistent growth in our commercial programs have served to somewhat offset the decline in the military sales. We will continue to look for further growth in both commercial aircraft as well as the engine markets. I've spoken in the past about the many opportunities we are working on to expand, particularly with Airbus. And we're clearly focused on increasing our penetration with this important customer. At the same time, we are bidding on new electronic and structural solutions for Boeing, Spirit and Bombardier as well as major engine OEMs, where we are working to build on our already existing partnerships. We feel confident that even in current levels, our business can expand substantially within this space driven by increased content as well as higher build rates.  
Moving to our non-A&D business. The end of 2014 saw a continued upward momentum with Q4 revenue of nearly $38 million as the highest since the third quarter of 2012. In addition, our backlog within these markets rose 25% year-over-year, which bodes well for going into 2015. We remain focused on winning new customers within this space and have made good inroads into several heavy industrial markets. However, within the natural resources markets, we're fully aware of the implication inherent in the slightly lower oil prices and cutbacks -- slightly significantly lower oil prices and cutbacks in the future capital spending. This business represented about 6% of our total revenue in '14, but we have strategy in place to deal with the current market fluctuations, which will likely negatively impact demand near term. In fact, we project sales for us in the oil market could drop 30% to 40% during the first 3 quarters. But we feel confident of the steps we've taken over the past year will broaden our business base and expand our industrial segment market penetration.  
For Ducommun, in total in 2014, top line was characterized by solid growth in our commercial aerospace and non-A&D markets offsetting softer revenue within the defense area. I think you will note that as sales were flat, we offset $32 million of dropped sales in the military with our growth in the commercial market. We see the trend continue in 2015 with year-over-year comps a bit tougher, particularly during the first 2 quarters due to the impact of the legacy C-17, Apache and radar rack business. As I said earlier, we view 2015 as a transition. We will focus on replacing reduced military sales and offsetting oil and gas sales by leveraging strong customer relationships and aggressively pursuing new business development opportunities. Overall, we feel the robust plan that we have in place will improve margins and drive growth, positioning the company for higher returns. 
With that, I would now like to have Joe review our financial results. Joe?"

As Tony mentioned, we are deeply disappointed in the employees' misconduct and the weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that have led to",1907,"Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everybody. We appreciate you being on the call this early. As Tony mentioned, we are deeply disappointed in the employees' misconduct and the weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that have led to restatements in certain prior periods. We take this matter very seriously and are working diligently to implement the necessary corrective actions. We're in the process of remediating 4 material weaknesses, 3 related to a long-term contract initiated in prior periods following the discovery of misconduct by employees, which resulted in the identification of a forward loss reserve and that should have been recorded in 2009, a prior period. In addition, a fourth material weakness was recognized related to income tax errors in the year-end reconciliation of income taxes for payables and deferred assets and deferred tax balances primarily in 2013, 2012 and 2011. We expect to remediate the forward loss contract material weaknesses by the end of the third quarter this year and the tax adjustment weaknesses by year end as they are year-end entity controls.  
The 10-K results, which we released this morning for fiscal 2014, include restatements of certain previously issued financial statements and selected financial data. I want to try to quantify the effect of that. The restatement has the following effect on our financial statements. Net income increased $1 million or $0.09 per fully diluted share for the 9 months ended September 27, 2014. Net income increased $2 million or $0.19 a share per fully diluted share for fiscal 2013. Net income increased $1.2 million or $0.11 per fully diluted share for fiscal 2012. These are all compared to what was previously reported. Our shareholders' equity was reduced by $4.4 million as of September 27, 2014. The restatement had no effects on our revenues or our cash flows from operations.  
Now turning to our financial results. Looking at the fourth quarter results. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $188 million. That was very similar to last year's fourth quarter. The revenue does reflect though a continuing shift in demand we've seen throughout the second half of 2014 with a strong 25% increase in revenues for the commercial aerospace shipments. And they are being offset by an 18% decrease in military and space sales, both structural and electronics products. Within the commercial aerospace sector, we saw increases in both structures and electronic solutions as we continue to benefit from higher airframe build rates and increased content. Conversely, in the military and space sector, we have seen reduced demand in both structural solutions and technology applications, reflecting lower aggregate demand for government defense spending. We expect these mix shift trends as well as overall levels of demand to continue through the first half of 2015.  
Ducommun's net income for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $5.2 million. That's $0.46 per fully diluted share compared to a loss of $5.2 million or $0.49 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2013. As previously reported in '13, when we reported our results for the fourth quarter, the net loss included charges of $8.8 million or $0.51 per share after tax and was comprised of 2 pretax program-related charges of $14 million that were somewhat offset by reduced accrued compensation expenses in that period of approximately $5.3 million. Fourth quarter 2014 net income was favorably impacted by an insurance recovery, we also saw one in the third quarter, and increases in income from a favorable customer settlement resulting in a modest benefit from the reversal of a forward loss reserve. The fourth quarter also benefited from a favorable income tax rate, which was partially offset by higher accrued compensation and benefit costs in our fourth quarter.  
In the fourth quarter, legislation was passed to approve the research and development tax credit. And we recognized a $2.4 million or $0.21 per fully diluted share benefit as compared to the last year's comparable period, where we had recognized a $0.8 million benefit in the fourth quarter or approximately $0.07 per diluted share. The reason I talk about these are that in 2013, the legislation was approved on January 2, so we took approximately $0.7 million, $0.8 million a period or $0.07 a share throughout the fourth quarters in '13, whereas in '14, we only recognized the R&D tax credit benefit of $0.21 in that period. So as we look at it, the delta was $0.14 on a true run rate year-over-year. Regarding the availability of federal R&D tax credits in 2015 as legislation has not been passed this year, we do not expect to record any related R&D tax benefit until or if such legislation is passed. As a result, we expect a normalized tax rate of 31% throughout each reporting period in 2015. 
Operating income for the fourth quarter was $10 million or 5.4% of revenues, very similar to the amount reported in the third quarter 2014. This reflects the environment and the shift in business mix we experienced in the latter half of the year, including the 2 military programs that Tony spoke about that are winding down. Our gross margin of 17.9% was slightly higher than the 17.6% gross margin in the third quarter of 2014. We are addressing the impact of mix shift and gross margin levels and taking action by rightsizing our manufacturing cost structure to adapt to these changes. Higher accrued compensation costs resulted in selling, general and administrative expenses running about 12.6% of revenues, resulting in an operating margin of 5.4%. Again this was very similar to the amount we reported in our third quarter of 2014. Included in the current quarter results was a $1 million insurance recovery related to property and equipment, which is classified in other income. EBITDA was $18.2 million or approximately 9.7% of revenues in our fourth quarter.  
In reviewing results by each of the business segments, first, Ducommun AeroStructures, DAS. DAS reported sales of $78 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $81 million in last year's prior period. DAS revenue was unfavorably impacted by a 27% decrease in military and space sales primarily due to the reductions in the C-17 as the contract ended in the fourth quarter and the Apache main rotor, which has seen reduced customer requirements. Partially offsetting the military and space declines was an 18% increase in commercial aerospace revenues driven by solid growth of Boeing and Airbus shipments, along with an increase in sales of regional and business jet applications. DAS's operating income was $6.9 million or 8.8% of revenues, similar to the third quarter of 2014. Segment operating income was favorably impacted by the reversal of a forward loss reserve as a result of a customer settlement, partially offset by higher accrued compensation and benefit costs. Our EBITDA in the DAS sector was $10.5 million or 13.5% of revenues.  
Now next, in reviewing the Ducommun LaBarge Technologies or DLT segment. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $109 million. That's a 2% increase compared to last year's comparable period. That said, we are also seeing a modest shift as defense electronic sales declined by $8 million. They were offset by increases in commercial aerospace electronics revenue, which were up $5 million, and a $5 million increase in non-A&D sales. We attribute the decrease in defense technologies applications revenues primarily because of reductions in funding for F-18 modernizations affecting our radar rack applications and softness in military helicopter demand. In recent years, we have seen sequential declines in our defense electronics backlog, but we continue to see higher demand for our commercial aerospace electronics and our non-A&D offerings, both a result of recent business development initiatives. However, while revenue within the natural resources sector was solid for the quarter and for the year, we are now seeing the adverse impact of the changing dynamics in the energy markets, including higher oil prices. And this is being reflected on our sequential decline in current backlog.  
DLT's operating income for the fourth quarter of '14 was $8.5 million or 7.8% of revenue. That compares to $9.4 million or 8.8% of revenue in '13. The decrease reflects an unfavorable product mix, higher manufacturing costs and accrued compensation and benefit expenses. They're partially offset by higher revenues. We are currently addressing and taking action on the level of manufacturing expenses and are aggressively pursuing cost-reduction activities and supply chain initiatives aimed at improving operating performance. EBITDA was $13 million during the quarter or 11.9% of revenue compared to $13.9 million or 13% of revenue in last year's comparable period.
Corporate, general and administrative expenses, which are unallocated to business segments, for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $5.3 million or 2.8% of revenue compared to $3.5 million or 1.9% of revenue in last year's comparable period, primarily as a result of higher accrued compensation and benefit expenses this year as compared to last year. Our overall backlog at the end of the quarter was $559 million. This equates to a sequential decrease of $10 million versus Q3 2014 and reflects the $13 million decline in our military and space backlog, a $7 million increase in commercial aerospace products and a $4 million reduction in demand for industrial and energy application. As I mentioned, most of those are really related to the slowdown in backlogs from the energy sector. We're working diligently to finalize additional orders across various commercial aerospace and defense technology platforms in the upcoming half of this year, consistent with normal seasonal patterns.  
We now turn to liquidity and capital resources. Earlier, Tony mentioned that during the quarter, we continued to delever our balance sheet and generate very solid cash flows. In 2014, we generated a record $53 million in cash flow from operations compared to just under $46 million in full year 2013. We generated approximately $38 million in free cash flow, which is approximately $3.40 per fully diluted share and used all of that and some cash on hand in our balance sheet to repay nearly $43 million in debt in 2014. We remain diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect historic seasonal patterns. We ended the year with sufficient cash balances and expect to continue deleveraging the balance sheet. 
At year end, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was approximately 3:1. During the first quarter of 2015, we also made another $10 million prepayment on our term loan debt. And we have now reduced our total funded debt to $280 million. At this stage, we are on schedule with regard to our goal of deleveraging to targets of 2.75 to 3 by year-end 2015. In addition, we recognized that we may have the opportunity this year to refinance our debt and reduce interest expenses significantly going forward as well as increase our ability to execute on our strategic growth initiatives. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 were $18 million. We expect them to be $15 million in fiscal 2015.  
In closing, as we continue to focus on managing the changing mix on our business, addressing manufacturing costs and pursue supply chain savings and opportunities to support our goal of achieving sustained operating and EBITDA margin, which along with diligent and frugal expense management and a focus on working capital efficiency, should permit the company to generate meaningful free cash flow going forward. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it back to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

We faced many challenges these past few years while building a solid business across multitude of platforms and technologies. And we are dedicated to improving performance across all aspects of our operations. In addition, we've realigned our company to offer faster, more innovative responses to our customers and build a real strong management team. Our commercial aerospace business is firing on all cylinders. And we've grown this part of our business over 50% organically in the past 5 years through a combination of broader structural offerings, advanced technology applications, higher run rates and excellent customer service. 
At the same time, our non-A&D operations have rebounded. And we see further room for growth by targeting electronic solutions for advanced automation within the industrial, energy and medical end markets. That said, we believe the first half of 2015 will be negatively impacted in terms of both top line revenue as well as margins by lower defense spending versus 2014. In addition, our non-A&D business is seeing some softness with the energy space due to the lower oil prices while at the same time, we're investing in ramping up on new programs. We see plenty of room for operational improvement and margin expansion in this year. And as Joe indicated, we're looking forward to refinancing our debt, unlocking further value for our shareholders. This is something we are committed to doing.  
We want to thank our shareholders for their continued interest in Ducommun. Our employees are dedicated to our success and that of our customers. And we believe 2015 will lay the groundwork for higher growth and improved margins in 2016 and beyond.

But probably the more important aspect of that is they put us in a position to grow our business significantly with that customer, almost all customers. And we've talked about this, Boeing has their Partnering For Success and United Technologies have what they call their V2 program. Spirit has a program very similar. And as we work with them for the long term, there's clearly -- they look at 3 things. One is your expertise in delivering on time, your ability to maintain excellent quality, and then how do you manage your cost structure. And as we look forward, we've set long-term agreements with our customers. And in some cases, they are 3-year supply agreements, where we set up an opportunity to not only maintain the business that we have but also secure some enhancement and growth across the board. So there will be more predictability on platforms that we currently serve and there will be more predictability for us in terms of opportunities to get new business. Of course, you always have to be competitive in those marketplaces and you always have to win the business.

Your question is where is the growth in the backlog coming from. On the commercial aerospace, it's coming from a combination of some higher build rates from the large airframe manufacturers and increased content. I made those in my earlier remarks. But even as we saw in the first quarter here, we saw that Boeing increased their shipments, it was primarily in the 737. And then the larger growth was in the Dreamliner, where they delivered 30 planes versus 18 last year. And in Airbus, their A320 family of products single-aisle carriers are seeing nice growth and increased build rates as well as the A350 is coming on. The reason I mentioned those, those are the 2 programs that we're really focused on. On Boeing's 777, we -- it's been pretty flat. So that's what we're seeing the growth.

So we had a couple of big wins last year and we had some of the capital expenses there associated with this. If you look at 2014, our capital is actually up to about $18 million versus our normal run rate, around somewhere between $12 million and $15 million. But we think that -- we don't think most of the capital that's allocated for 2015 were primarily -- in addition to the maintenance capital, will primarily be dedicated to growth on the commercial side of the business. There are a couple of new military programs we're working on, but I don’t believe there's too much capital expense related to those programs."

The reason I tell those is if you quantify those, about just a little over 2 years ago in September of '13, we had about 142 -- $164 million of inventory and we're down to $142 million. And we think that there's more opportunities there to reduce our inventory dollars and improve our returns, which will free up more cash flow. That's certainly one area that we look at. I also mentioned supply chain initiatives. And our supply chain initiatives are not only in bringing more value to our improvement in profitability to our operations but more value to our customers by a more robust supply chain. We will see not only, we believe, some cost savings, but we'll see some cash flow savings of us not having to stock so much incoming raw material. So we're really excited about our opportunities there. And so we've looked at this since the consolidated business since 2012, and it has been -- it certainly follows the cash profiles, the seasonal patterns they have in '12, '13 and '14. But our discipline on working capital effectiveness has allowed us to always generate this kind of cash. And at the end of the year, we had, as you see, $45 million in cash."

We're looking at what we call the sales order and operating planning so that we can reduce our queue times. So we are really concentrating on trying to stay level or increase the cash flow. And to give you a number that would increased by -- for next year, I think -- or for this year, I think we really have more work in front of us. But I would say that it would be safe to say that in terms of the pickups we see that are right in front of us towards the end of the year, we think we'll pick up some additional savings on the inventory returns, and of course, the savings that we anticipate from the refinancing. So I would say that if you look at normal cash flow for the year, our goal is to try and stay stable with what we did last year even with the decline on the military side. There's a significant loss of business if you look at -- we have about a $32 million in sales, but we still have the front end of the year, where we have significant military sales that drove some cash.

We haven't announced any of this, but we had been able to pick up a nice win there. So if you look at the 3 primary engine manufacturers that we're working with, General Electric, we have some structural equipment that we're working with them on. Pratt & Whitney is primarily structural. And then Rolls-Royce is both structural and electronics in our electronics background. So we're working with all 3. And fortunately, Joel Benkie, when he came in, had a terrific background in the engine market so that's really helped us kind of get some entries in there. And we've been able to do a real nice job of penetrating that market. And our business development team has done an excellent job in the last 1.5 years with really getting in and reestablishing. We've always had great relationships with both Pratt and GE, but we've been able to increase our relationship with Rolls-Royce. So now we look at as the 3 major engine manufacturers. And we're able to work with them on hot sections. We also have penetrated in the cell business deeper. So I think -- and we look at that as being part of the engine market. So as we look at those markets, we've been able to do a nice work, both on the structure side and the electronic systems group has really penetrated those markets well. So when you look at where LaBarge was when we bought them, they had like 0 commercial aerospace sales. And because of the contacts that we've been able to pick up, we've grown that business significantly in the last 2 years, almost fifteenfold from [indiscernible] million."

267761,285666166,788689,"Ducommun Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 10, 2015",2015-04-10,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Jordan, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our fiscal fourth quarter conference call.

We are obviously very di",1929,"Thank you, Jordan, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our fiscal fourth quarter conference call. Before reviewing the financials, I wanted to comment on the company's delayed filings and restatement of prior periods. We are obviously very disappointed by the restatement, which resulted in both internal control deficiencies and employee misconduct. 
Specifically, after the discovery of misconduct by employees, we identified a single long-term contract of which a forward loss provision should have been recorded in 2009, and the impact on subsequent periods of the adjustment of the forward loss provisions as products were delivered. The misconduct and its related financial impacts were concealed from Ducommun senior management, our internal auditors and our external auditors. The misconduct by these employees is not the way we do business. Ducommun is dedicated to the utmost integrity in everything that we do. We have begun the process of taking corrective actions, including termination of employees involved and dedicated -- and we are dedicated to committing the necessary resources to ensure that this never ever happens again. To be clear, our investigation revealed no other programs were involved in this misconduct, and there was no impact to our customers.  
At the same time and unrelated to the employees' misconduct, we discovered errors in our income tax accounting. These errors are also unacceptable, and we're committed to enhancing our controls and our technical expertise to ensure that they are not repeated. In addition, the restatement includes previously identified and disclosed immaterial adjustments.  
Now turning to our financial results. Ducommun's fourth quarter benefited from improved mix and modest sequential increase in our operating margins. However, the quarter also has several unusual items that somewhat aided these performance gains, as Joe will review in a minute. Review of the quarter -- or revenue for the quarter was $188 million. Our operating cash flow was $32.5 million. And including the various onetime items, we reported earnings at $0.46 per share.  
While 2014 is now behind us and we can look back and assess our overall accomplishments as well as areas needing further improvement, we ended the year with $742 million in sales, essentially flat with 2013, while recording $1.79 of earnings per diluted share. All in all, we had a number of important successes while withstanding a significant decline in our military business. The growth in our commercial aerospace operations was certainly a highlight. We posted a record revenue of $242 million, driven by higher product shipments of large commercial aircraft and modest growth in our regional and business jet markets, helping to offset a $32 million decline in military sales as compared to 2013.  
During the year, we noted many significant wins, such as on the 737 MAX and Airbus A320, A320neo and the A350 platforms. We also made some excellent inroads penetrating the engine markets, positioning us for growth going forward. In addition, we have signed or we are in the process of finalizing long-term supply agreements with Airbus, Boeing, United Technologies, Spirit and Parker Aerospace.  
Turning to the non-A&D markets. We continued to see positive results from our efforts of targeting major strategic industrial customers. The catalyst behind our success here has been our constant focus on providing innovative solutions and outstanding service, with growth fueled by strong customer relationships and a surge in new business development activity. This was exemplified by the fact that during the year, Ducommun earned preferred supplier status from key industrial customers. We have positioned ourselves to reap positive results from cost savings and efficiency improvement initiatives across the company and saw excellent working capital gains in several key areas. But we still have more work to do here. We continue to look closely at our manufacturing footprint, and as an example, have initiated a facility consolidation in one of our structural solutions business units, aggregating the operation from 3 buildings into 1. This effort will be finalized earlier in the second half of 2015 as we will continue to focus on driving operational efficiencies and margin enhancements going forward.  
Improvements already achieved in working capital helped propel operating cash flow to $53 million and free cash flow to $35 million in 2014. We also paid down nearly $43 million of our credit facility last year, ending 2014 with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio slightly under 3.3:1 from a high of 4.5:1 following the acquisition of LaBarge in 2011. We have consistently told our shareholders and our lenders that we are committed to reducing our leverage ratio to less than 3x by the end of 2015, and we are on schedule to hit that target. In addition, we are now planning to refinance our debt in its entirety as soon as practical, which we expect will result in significant interest expense savings going forward. Joe is going to talk about this more in a moment.  
Looking ahead, we will focus on top line growth across the commercial aerospace market, engine markets and the non-A&D segments to offset the headwinds caused by declining military programs and the sunsetting of certain platforms, which will impact our sales and margins during the first half of 2015 as we adjust to mix changes and invest in new commercial programs. We'll look to drive higher growth and improved operating performance in the second half of the year, concentrating our efforts on expanding margins, growing the business and ensuring customer satisfaction through operational excellence. In short, this will be a transition year for Ducommun as we work to refinance our debt and position the company for higher returns in 2016 and beyond.  
Now let me provide some color on the markets and our products, and of course, our programs. Starting with our military and space markets, in 2014, revenue fell 8% or $32 million year-over-year. The fourth quarter was down 18% or $18 million versus 2013, reflecting the many challenges we've discussed previously, including the wind-down of the Boeing C-17 program for which we made our last shipments in the fourth quarter. We also saw lower revenue within our military helicopter space, which included the Apache main rotor blade, down in the fourth quarter. We expect this business to remain at current levels during 2015. These changes caused our military structures business to decline more than our electronic segment last year, although the electronic segment was impacted by lower radar racks shipped, particularly for the F-18 and the F-15 program. 
Going forward, we expect that revenue within the military and space markets will continue to trend somewhat lower, reflecting budget realities and platform curtailments, with sales stabilizing in the second half of 2015. While the President's latest budget includes increased defense spending for fiscal 2016, it's clearly too soon to say whether this will actually happen, and if it does, whether Ducommun will see any meaningful increase in orders near term. That said, we are encouraged by the budget's emphasis on equipment modernization, which plays to our strengths, and the fact that it includes substantial increase in funding for a number of programs we currently support. In any event, we believe that ongoing conditions in the Middle East, combined with the crucial nature of the platforms we serve, support a base-level demand even as the budget negotiations play out in Washington. Electronic upgrades to such aircraft as the F-18 and the F-15, we believe, will continue.  
Our missile defense business revenue was slightly down in 2014, and we expect this market to stabilize going forward. We also continue to bid on new opportunities within military and missile defense space and believe our customer relationships and quality reputation put us on a solid footing to win additional content. We are targeting applications that best leverage our technology advances and our structural expertise. The bottom line is that even in the current budget environment, there will always be room to expand our defense business on the right programs and platforms, and we intend to do just that, positioning the company for higher growth when spending in Washington is better defined. In the meantime, we're actively taking steps across our facilities to reduce cost, increase efficiency and expand our margins. We know we can do this even as run rates start to drop on certain platforms as we look to reduce working capital and drive higher cash flow for investment elsewhere.  
And one place we're certainly investing is within the commercial aerospace arena, where as I noted earlier, we had our best year ever. Revenue in the fourth quarter rose to nearly $65 million, also a record, up 25% year-over-year from 2013, and driving a full year revenue of $242 million, up 14% year-over-year. The growth across our large commercial airframe platforms was evidenced by our biggest program, the 737, which rose to nearly $60 million in sales in 2014. The consistent growth in our commercial programs have served to somewhat offset the decline in the military sales. We will continue to look for further growth in both commercial aircraft as well as the engine markets. I've spoken in the past about the many opportunities we are working on to expand, particularly with Airbus, and we're clearly focused on increasing our penetration with this important customer. At the same time, we are bidding on new electronic and structural solutions for Boeing, Spirit and Bombardier as well as major engine OEMs, where we are working to build on our already existing partnerships. We feel confident that even at current levels, our business can expand substantially within this space, driven by increased content as well as higher build rates.  
Moving to our non-A&D business. The end of 2014 saw a continued upward momentum, with Q4 revenue of nearly $38 million as the highest since the third quarter of 2012. In addition, our backlog within these markets rose 25% year-over-year, which bodes well for going into 2015. We remain focused on winning new customers within this space and have made good inroads into several heavy industrial markets. However, within the natural resources markets, we're fully aware of the implication inherent in the slightly lower oil prices and cutbacks -- not slightly, significantly lower oil prices and cutbacks in the future capital spending. This business represented about 6% of our total revenue in '14, but we have strategies in place to deal with the current market fluctuations, which will likely negatively impact demand near term. In fact, we project sales for us in the oil market could drop 30% to 40% during the first 3 quarters. But we feel confident that the steps we've taken over the past year will broaden our business base and expand our industrial segment market penetration.  
For Ducommun in total, in 2014, top line was characterized by solid growth in our commercial aerospace and non-A&D markets offsetting softer revenue within the defense area. I think you will note that as sales were flat, we offset $32 million of dropped sales in the military with our growth in the commercial market. We see the trend continue in 2015 with year-over-year comps a bit tougher, particularly during the first 2 quarters due to the impact of the legacy C-17, Apache and radar rack business. As I said earlier, we view 2015 as a transition. We will focus on replacing reduced military sales and offsetting oil and gas sales by leveraging strong customer relationships and aggressively pursuing new business development opportunities. Overall, we feel the robust plan that we have in place will improve margins and drive growth, positioning the company for higher returns. 
With that, I would now like to have Joe review our financial results. Joe?"

We appreciate you being on the call this early. As Tony mentioned, we are deeply disappointed in the employees' misconduct and the weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that have led to restatements in certain prior periods. We take this matter very seriously and are working diligently to implement the necessary corrective actions. We're in the process of remediating 4 material weaknesses, 3 related to a long-term contract initiated in prior periods following the discovery of misconduct by employees, which resulted in the identification of a forward loss reserve and that should have been recorded in 2009, a prior period. In addition, a fourth material weakness was recognized related to income tax errors in the year-end reconciliation of income taxes for payables and deferred assets and deferred tax balances, primarily in 2013, 2012 and 2011. We expect to remediate the forward loss contract material weaknesses by the end of the third quarter this year and the tax adjustment weaknesses by year end, as they are year-end entity controls.  
The 10-K results, which we released this morning for fiscal 2014, include restatements of certain previously issued financial statements and selected financial data. I want to try to quantify the effect of that. The restatement has the following effect on our financial statements. Net income increased $1 million or $0.09 per fully diluted share for the 9 months ended September 27, 2014. Net income increased $2 million or $0.19 a share -- per fully diluted share for fiscal 2013. Net income increased $1.2 million or $0.11 per fully diluted share for fiscal 2012. These are all compared to what was previously reported. Our shareholders' equity was reduced by $4.4 million as of September 27, 2014. The restatement had no effect on our revenues or our cash flows from operations.  
Now turning to our financial results. Looking at the fourth quarter results. Net sales for the quarter were approximately $188 million. That was very similar to last year's fourth quarter. The revenue does reflect, though, a continuing shift in demand that we've seen throughout the second half of 2014 with a strong 25% increase in revenues for the commercial aerospace shipments. And they are being offset by an 18% decrease in military and space sales, both structural and electronics products. Within the commercial aerospace sector, we saw increases in both structures and electronic solutions as we continue to benefit from higher airframe build rates and increased content. Conversely, in the military and space sector, we have seen reduced demand in both structural solutions and technology applications, reflecting lower aggregate demand for government defense spending. We expect these mix shift trends as well as overall levels of demand to continue through the first half of 2015.  
Ducommun's net income for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $5.2 million. That's $0.46 per fully diluted share compared to a loss of $5.2 million or $0.49 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2013. As previously reported in '13, when we reported our results for the fourth quarter, the net loss included charges of $8.8 million or $0.51 per share after tax and was comprised of 2 pretax program-related charges of $14 million that were somewhat offset by reduced accrued compensation expenses in that period of approximately $5.3 million. Fourth quarter 2014 net income was favorably impacted by an insurance recovery, we also saw one in the third quarter, and increases in income from a favorable customer settlement resulting in a modest benefit from the reversal of a forward loss reserve. The fourth quarter also benefited from a favorable income tax rate, which was partially offset by higher accrued compensation and benefit costs in our fourth quarter.  
In the fourth quarter, legislation was passed to approve the research and development tax credit. And we recognized a $2.4 million or $0.21 per fully diluted share benefit as compared to the last year's comparable period, where we had recognized a $0.8 million benefit in the fourth quarter or approximately $0.07 per diluted share. The reason I talk about these are that in 2013, the legislation was approved on January 2, so we took approximately $0.7 million to $0.8 million a period or $0.07 a share throughout the four quarters in '13, whereas in '14, we only recognized the R&D tax credit benefit of $0.21 in that period. So as we look at it, the delta was $0.14 on a true run rate year-over-year. Regarding the availability of federal R&D tax credits in 2015, as legislation has not been passed this year, we do not expect to record any related R&D tax benefit until or if such legislation is passed. As a result, we expect a normalized tax rate of 31% throughout each reporting period in 2015. 
Operating income for the fourth quarter was $10 million or 5.4% of revenues, very similar to the amount reported in the third quarter 2014. This reflects the environment and the shift in business mix we experienced in the latter half of the year, including the 2 military programs that Tony spoke about that are winding down. Our gross margin of 17.9% was slightly higher than the 17.6% gross margin in the third quarter of 2014. We are addressing the impact of mix shift and gross margin levels and taking action by rightsizing our manufacturing cost structure to adapt to these changes. Higher accrued compensation costs resulted in selling, general and administrative expenses running about 12.6% of revenues, resulting in an operating margin of 5.4%. Again this was very similar to the amount we reported in our third quarter of 2014. Included in the current quarter results was a $1 million insurance recovery related to property and equipment, which is classified in other income. EBITDA was $18.2 million or approximately 9.7% of revenues in our fourth quarter.  
In reviewing results by each of the business segments, first, Ducommun AeroStructures, DAS. DAS reported sales of $78 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $81 million in last year's prior period. DAS revenue was unfavorably impacted by a 27% decrease in military and space sales, primarily due to the reductions in the C-17 as the contract ended in the fourth quarter, and the Apache main rotor, which has seen reduced customer requirements. Partially offsetting the military and space declines was an 18% increase in commercial aerospace revenues driven by solid growth of Boeing and Airbus shipments, along with an increase in sales of regional and business jet applications. DAS's operating income was $6.9 million or 8.8% of revenues, similar to the third quarter of 2014. Segment operating income was favorably impacted by the reversal of a forward loss reserve as a result of a customer settlement, partially offset by higher accrued compensation and benefit costs. Our EBITDA in the DAS sector was $10.5 million or 13.5% of revenues.  
Now next, in reviewing the Ducommun LaBarge Technologies or DLT segment. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $109 million. That's a 2% increase compared to last year's comparable period. That said, we are also seeing a modest shift as defense electronic sales declined by $8 million. They were offset by increases in commercial aerospace electronics revenue, which were up $5 million, and a $5 million increase in non-A&D sales. We attribute the decrease in defense technologies applications revenues primarily because of reductions in funding for F-18 modernizations affecting our radar rack applications and softness in military helicopter demand. In recent years, we have seen sequential declines in our defense electronics backlog, but we continue to see higher demand for our commercial aerospace electronics and our non-A&D offerings, both a result of recent business development initiatives. However, while revenue within the natural resources sector was solid for the quarter and for the year, we are now seeing the adverse impact of the changing dynamics in the energy markets, including higher oil prices. And this is being reflected in our sequential decline in current backlog.  
DLT's operating income for the fourth quarter of '14 was $8.5 million or 7.8% of revenue. That compares to $9.4 million or 8.8% of revenue in '13. The decrease reflects an unfavorable product mix, higher manufacturing costs and accrued compensation and benefit expenses that are partially offset by higher revenues. We are currently addressing and taking action on the level of manufacturing expenses and are aggressively pursuing cost-reduction activities and supply chain initiatives aimed at improving operating performance. EBITDA was $13 million during the quarter or 11.9% of revenue compared to $13.9 million or 13% of revenue in last year's comparable period.
Corporate, general and administrative expenses, which are unallocated to the business segments for the fourth quarter of 2014, were $5.3 million or 2.8% of revenue compared to $3.5 million or 1.9% of revenue in last year's comparable period, primarily as a result of higher accrued compensation and benefit expenses this year as compared to last year. Our overall backlog at the end of the quarter was $559 million. This equates to a sequential decrease of $10 million versus Q3 2014 and reflects a $13 million decline in our military and space backlog, a $7 million increase in commercial aerospace products and a $4 million reduction in demand for industrial and energy applications. As I mentioned, most of those are really related to the slowdown in backlogs from the energy sector. We're working diligently to finalize additional orders across various commercial aerospace and defense technology platforms in the upcoming half of this year, consistent with normal seasonal patterns.  
We now turn to liquidity and capital resources. Earlier, Tony mentioned that during the quarter, we continued to delever our balance sheet and generate very solid cash flows. In 2014, we generated a record $53 million in cash flow from operations compared to just under $46 million in full year 2013. We generated approximately $38 million in free cash flow, which is approximately $3.40 per fully diluted share, and used all of that and some cash on hand in our balance sheet to prepay nearly $43 million in debt in 2014. We remain diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect historic seasonal patterns. We ended the year with sufficient cash balances and expect to continue deleveraging the balance sheet. 
At year end, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was approximately 3:1. During the first quarter of 2015, we also made another $10 million prepayment on our term loan debt, and we have now reduced our total funded debt to $280 million. At this stage, we are on schedule with regard to our goal of deleveraging to targets of 2.75 to 3 by year-end 2015. In addition, we recognized that we may have the opportunity this year to refinance our debt and reduce interest expenses significantly going forward, as well as increase our ability to execute on our strategic growth initiatives. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 were $18 million. We expect them to be $15 million in fiscal 2015.  
In closing, as we continue to focus on managing the changing mix on our business, addressing manufacturing costs and pursue supply chain savings and opportunities to support our goal of achieving sustained operating and EBITDA margin, which along with diligent and frugal expense management and a focus on working capital efficiency, should permit the company to generate meaningful free cash flow going forward. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it back to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

I think the long-term agreements do 2 things for us. First of all, they guarantee the supply base, I think. But probably the more important aspect of that is they put us in a position to grow our business significantly with that customer. Almost all customers -- and we've talked about this, Boeing has their Partnering For Success and United Technologies have what they call their V2 program. Spirit has a program very similar. And as we work with them for the long term, there's clearly -- they look at 3 things. One is your expertise in delivering on time, your ability to maintain excellent quality, and then how you manage your cost structure. And as we look forward, we've set long-term agreements with our customers. And in some cases, they are 3-year supply agreements, where we set up an opportunity to not only maintain the business that we have but also secure some enhancement and growth across the board. So there will be more predictability on platforms that we currently serve and there will be more predictability for us in terms of opportunities to get new business. Of course, you always have to be competitive in those marketplaces and you always have to win the business. But we've really put ourselves in a position where we've improved our quality over the year, we've improved our delivery performance over the year, and we've put ourselves in a position where we think we can be successful in capturing new business.

Your question is where is the growth in the backlog coming from. On the commercial aerospace, it's coming from a combination of some higher build rates from the large airframe manufacturers and increased content. I made those in my earlier remarks. But even as we saw in the first quarter here, we saw that Boeing increased their shipments, it was primarily in the 737. And then the larger growth was in the Dreamliner, where they delivered 30 planes versus 18 last year. And in Airbus, their A320 family of products single-aisle carriers are seeing nice growth and increased build rates, as well as the A350 is coming on. The reason I mentioned those, those are the 2 programs that we're really focused on. On Boeing's 777, we -- it's been pretty flat. So that's where we're seeing the growth. But also over the years, we've been obtaining more content with primarily our titanium forming solutions, thermoforming solutions. And so we expect those trends to continue.

But I would say that it would be safe to say that in terms of the pickups we see that are right in front of us towards the end of the year, we think we'll pick up some additional savings on the inventory returns, and of course, the savings that we anticipate from the refinancing. So I would say that if you look at normal cash flow for the year, our goal is to try and stay stable with what we did last year even with the decline on the military side. There's a significant loss of business if you look at -- we have about a $32 million in sales, but we still have the front end of the year, where we have significant military sales that drove some cash.

I'll begin by providing an overview of the quarter, including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino to go over our financial results in detail. Let me start off by saying that we are extremely disappointed with our financial and operational performance this quarter. While we continue to benefit from robust growth in our commercial aerospace operations and experience modest decline in overall revenue year-over-year, this was accompanied by a significant decline in margins. The margin compression was particularly acute in our AeroStructures segment primarily due to weak military and space demand which negatively impacted our operating leverage at a faster rate than we were able to counteract with our cost reduction efforts. Bottom line results were further impacted by production inefficiencies on certain legacy programs and onetime development costs at new technologies. But having said that, our performance for this quarter was simply unacceptable. 
We talked in the past about the pressure on margins that would come from lower defense spending as some very attractive programs wind down or go through a period of lower demand. These platforms like the C-17, F-15, Apache and the Black Hawk. During the quarter, total military shipments were down 22% year-over-year. While we expected a falloff in defense revenue, the actual decline was greater than anticipated due to schedule softness on some ongoing programs, and we are not able to reduce costs as quickly as necessary to counteract the revenue decline. We are taking aggressive actions to offset the lower profitability performance and bolster cost-reduction initiatives already underway. We've identified the root causes of the inefficiencies and are working on specific plans to mitigate them. On top of those actions already taken to reduce expenses, we have reevaluated our structural cost drivers and enacted measures to further streamline operations and reduce additional headcount, all in an effort to bring our overhead structure more in line with the lower than projected military sales. We anticipate that these cost reduction efforts will improve operating profit through the year by approximately $4 million to $5 million. In those areas where we are already planning major manufacturing efficiency improvements, we are redoubling our efforts to get the job done more quickly. We will also continue to reduce our working capital. We have also enacted plans to further streamline our supply chain, improving cost and performance from our suppliers and we expect the initial benefits to positively impact the second half of 2015. Overall, we're taking actions to resolve or mitigate the factors that impeded our execution during the first quarter and position us for a stronger second half of the year. 
Let me provide some color on our end markets and products and programs. In the military and space sector, which is now about 41% of our total business, revenue was down significantly both year-over-year and sequentially from Q4. And our backlog here also declined to approximately $249 million versus nearly $318 million at the same time last year. Our AeroStructures and technology segments have each been impacted with lower backlogs reflecting lower government spending in this sector. We expect on a year-over-year basis revenue comparisons will get better as 2015 progresses, as will the margins. We continue to work through this transition and anticipate the second quarter will be an improvement over the first and through our actions, the second half of 2015 will show further sequential improvements. 
Now moving to some brighter news, let me talk about for a moment about the commercial aerospace operations, where revenue rose to $68 million, up 20% for the same quarter in 2014. We continue to benefit from higher build rates and additional content across the board, particularly on the 737 and 787 platforms as well as on Airbus A320 and A350 programs. We remain very well-positioned for further growth in this area, particularly on the large fixed wing aircraft platforms with Boeing and with Airbus. We are bidding on additional electronic and structural content and believe our strong relationship with these customers, as well as with Spirit and with the major engine OEMs, formed the basis for higher top line growth going forward. Our recently announced long-term supply agreements with United Technologies and Rolls-Royce strengthened our outlook for growth with these strategic partners on major commercial platforms. We see no reason to believe that our commercial aerospace business shouldn't continue to expand in 2015 and for the next several years based on our business development efforts and solid aircraft demand. While additional content and higher build rates are obviously something we applaud, the company has experienced lower margins near term because investments in new product development and program rollout. Therefore our new product introduction process is another specific area we are targeting for improvement. We will shorten our learning curve on new products and reduce upfront development costs. 
Turning to our non-A&D business, we are generally pleased with our performance this quarter. Revenue rose 8% year-over-year to approximately $34 million. What this equates to is pretty strong growth trends across our industrial offerings, offsetting its softer demand within our energy markets as anticipated. Low oil prices continue to negatively impact the drilling market in North America and resulted in reduced shipments and lower backlog in this area for us. We expect such trends to continue for the balance of 2015. However, our industrial backlog is at the highest level it's been in years, and we anticipate growth here will largely offset any energy-related weaknesses for the foreseeable future. Finally, as stated in our previous calls, we're looking to refinance the company's debt market conditions permitting which will lower interest expense and help improve our profitability going forward. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Joe Bellino to go through our financials. Joe?"

After the market closed today, we reported our earnings and our loss of -- net loss of $2 million or $0.18 per share for the current quarter. That compares to $5.2 million or $0.46 per diluted share in last year's first quarter. I will go into the details in a moment, but clearly, we were disappointed with our current quarter financial results. Net sales for the quarter -- first quarter of 2015 were approximately $173 million. That's 4% lower than last year's first quarter. The revenue decline reflected a continuing shift in demand for our products, including a $20 million decrease in military and space sales, offset by an $11 million increase in commercial aerospace sales and a slight uptick of $2 million on our non-A&D revenue. In the military and space sector, we have seen reduced demand for both structural solutions and technology electronics platforms, reflecting lower aggregate government defense spending. Within the commercial aerospace arena by contrast, we have seen increases in both our AeroStructures commercial business, as well as our electronic solutions as we continue to benefit from a combination of higher airframe build rates and increased content. We expect these mix shift trends to continue throughout the balance of 2015. We have previously indicated in the first half of 2015, it would be a transition period and we will work through this mix shift and other short-term issues. During the quarter, in addition to the unfavorable product mix, we experienced a loss of efficiencies from lower manufacturing volumes, as well as higher accrued compensation and benefit costs along with higher professional services fees. Partially offsetting these factors were a 35% income tax rate benefit as compared to an income tax rate of 33% in last year's first quarter. We believe that while a portion of the first quarter 2015 results were an anomaly, we need to swiftly address the issues in front of us and return the company to profitability levels for which we're capable. This includes taking headcount reductions, lowering of indirect labor costs and improving our manufacturing performance, as well as our execution on certain new programs. In addition, we have launched a company-wide supply chain improvement process which will contribute to our profitability enhancement initiatives beginning in the third quarter. 
Operating income for the current quarter was $4 million or 2.1% of revenues compared to approximately $15 million or 8.2% of revenue in the first quarter of 2014. Our gross margin was 15.5% as compares to 20% in the first quarter of 2014. The actions we are taking and the improvements we are seeing in the second quarter already indicate that gross margins are headed to the direction of the levels we experienced in the second half of 2014. And we believe that through additional work, they will continue to improve sequentially. We expect the supply chain initiatives currently being implemented and the realization of our business development effort will have a positive impact on our second-half financial performance. 
Higher accrued compensation and benefit costs and higher professional services costs year-over-year resulted in SG&A running at 13.4% of revenue as compared to a more normalized rate we experienced in last year's first quarter of 11.7%. EBITDA for the current quarter was $10.5 million or approximately 6.1% of revenue this quarter. 
Our working capital execution during the quarter resulted in cash flow of operations of $3.5 million as compared to a cash usage of just under $10 million in the first quarter of 2014. As a result of continued solid cash flow generation, we made a voluntary prepayment on our term loan of $10 million, and we have reduced our outstanding total debt to approximately $280 million. 
In looking at the results by business segment, first, the Ducommun AeroStructures, or DAS business segment, that segment faced most of the challenges during the current quarter as operating income was approximately $2 million or 3% of revenues compared to last year's first quarter where operating income was approximately $11 million or 13.6% of revenues. EBITDA was approximately $5.5 million or 6.5% of revenues this quarter as compared to nearly $14 million or 16.5% of revenues in last year's first quarter. The unfavorable results year-over-year were primarily the result of unfavorable product mix shift, lower revenue, the loss of efficiencies from lower manufacturing volume and higher development costs of new technologies. DAS reported revenue for the current quarter of approximately $72 million, down nearly $10 million from the $82 million recorded in last year's first quarter. In previous calls, we have mentioned that the sunsetting of 2 long cycle defense programs would impact us in early 2015. In addition, we have seen some reductions in revenue across our military helicopter applications. This resulted in a revenue decline in military and space structural products year-over-year of approximately $15 million, which were offset by a $5 million increase year-over-year in sales of our commercial aerospace structured applications. 
Historically, our gross margins have been somewhat higher in our military and space products as compared to commercial aerospace applications. And the unfavorable product mix is reflected in this quarter's results. In addition, we saw greatly reduced operating leverage due to reduced overall volumes that we were not able to offset through our current cost structure reduction initiatives. We are aggressively addressing these manufacturing issues and expect sequential improvement in operating margins in the DAS segment beginning this quarter and continuing through the second half of 2015. Commercial aerospace orders remain solid, parallel like the growth we see in both Boeing and Airbus, with most of the growth coming from existing contracts. Going forward, we expect commercial aerospace demand to continue to rise at a 3% to 5% annual growth rate, which would be accompanied by an expansion of margins as we rightsize our cost structure. Now turning to the Ducommun LaBarge Technologies or DLT business segment, net sales for the first quarter  of 2015 increased nearly 3% to approximately $101 million as compared to approximately $98 million in last year's first quarter. The higher revenue reflected a solid increase in our commercial aerospace electronics applications and a nearly 8% increase in our non-A&D revenue partially offset by a 10% decrease in military and space electronics revenue. This corresponds to modest mix shift as defense electronic sales declined by $6 million, commercial aerospace electronics grew by a similar $6 million and non-A&D revenues increased by $2 million. The decrease in defense technologies revenue primarily reflects reduced demand for F-15 modernizations, which affects our radar rack applications and softness in military helicopter demand. Offsetting these trends somewhat, we continued to see slightly higher demand for our missile defense electronics applications. Through recent marketing development activities, we also saw increased demand for our commercial aerospace and industrial electronics applications with new customers. Going forward, we expect to see further sequential reductions in our defense electronics backlog, with an increase in our commercial aerospace backlog and our non-A&D offerings, we've seen a slightly higher backlog in our industrial sector but a pronounced decline of demand for our energy-related products where the backlogs declined sequentially in the natural resources area by $7 million since the end of 2014, primarily reflecting the adverse impact of lower oil prices. 
DLT's operating income for the current quarter was approximately $6 million or 6.2% of revenue. This compares to $7 million or 7.2% of revenue in last year's comparable period. The decrease reflects an unfavorable product mix that was partially offset by higher revenue. We are currently addressing and taking action on the level of manufacturing expenses within this business segment and are aggressively pursuing cost-reduction activities and supply chain initiatives aimed at improving operating performance. EBITDA was approximately $11 million or 10.6% of revenues compared to $12 million or 12.3% of revenues in the 2014 comparable period. 
Corporate, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter where $4.8 million or 2.8% of revenue compared to $3.3 million or 1.8% of revenue in last year's comparable period. They were primarily due to higher accrued compensation and benefit expenses and higher professional services expenses. 
Now turning to backlog, our overall backlog at quarter's end was $538 million. This equates to a sequential decline of $21 million from the December 2014 period, broken down by an $11 million decline in our military and space backlog, a 9% decrease -- a $9 million decrease in commercial aerospace products. For clarification purposes, we report backlogs based on firm purchase orders from our customers. The backlog decline in commercial aerospace sector reflects a change by our customers in recent quarters in that they placed their orders with us on a quarterly basis rather than traditionally where they placed them on an annual basis. As a result and an upshot of this is there are quarterly backlogs even on our long-term programs tend to be shorter in duration and in lower amounts than was previously the case. We continue to work diligently to win new orders across both our diverse commercial aerospace end markets and our defense technology platforms. 
Culminating on liquidity and capital resources. During the quarter, we continued to delever our balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2015, as I mentioned, we generated $3.5 million in positive cash from operations compared to a usage of cash of just under $10 million in last year's first quarter. We remain diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash flow profile going forward to reflect historic seasonal patterns. We ended the quarter with sufficient cash balances and expect to continue deleveraging the balance sheet going forward. During the first quarter of 2015, we also made another $10 million voluntary prepayment on our debt reducing our funded debt to $280 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was approximately 3.3 to 1. At this stage, we are on schedule with regard to our goal of deleveraging to targets of net debt-to-EBITDA of 2.75 to 3 by the end of 2015. In addition, we recognize that we have the opportunity this year, subject to market conditions, to refinance our debt and reduce interest expenses significantly going forward, as well as increase our ability to execute on strategic growth initiatives. CapEx for the quarter was approximately $5 million and we forecast approximately $15 million of CapEx in fiscal 2015. Our CapEx is used to support the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and to support new contract awards. 
In closing, we continue to focus on managing the changing mix in our business and are working diligently to lower manufacturing costs throughout our operations. We also intend to realize an annual cost savings of $4 million to $5 million, as well as improve quality and cycle times through supply chain initiatives to support our goals of higher operating income and higher EBITDA margins. In addition, we remain diligent with expense management and a focus on working capital efficiencies which, along with the prospect of lower interest expenses from a potential refinancing of our debt, should generate meaningful cash flow going forward. 
Now I'd like to turn the program back over to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

Let me say once again that our shortfall this quarter was an acceptable. We knew that certain military programs are being dramatically scaled back and we anticipated the potential impact to margins. However, cost-reduction efforts put in place last year were unable to offset the loss of operating leverage caused by the large drop in shipments. In addition, the change in mix across some of the legacy programs, caused efficiencies that were simply inexcusable. Having said that we are working on specific plants to reduce costs, lower headcount where required, streamline operations, increase asset utilization and lower working capital. Some of these goals will take a little longer to achieve due to lower military volumes and the change in product mix, but we envision better results for the second half of 2015 based on cost savings initiatives already underway. As I said earlier, we anticipate that our cost reduction efforts will improve operating profit by $4 million to $5 million this year. Our commercial aerospace operations will continue to benefit from strong demand and our industrial business is also expected to post further growth. And lastly, as Joe mentioned, we have an opportunity to realize lower interest expenses by refinancing our debt by Q3. 
Overall, we are taking the disciplined, proactive approach to improve bottom line results for the remainder of 2015 and we believe the company is still well-positioned for long-term growth and higher returns for our investors. With that, Alex, I'd like to open up the call for questions, please."

And as we always do, we true up the quarters similar to what we do year end. And, for example, on the SG&A expenses that I spoke about, we had higher professional costs related to getting the books closed, as well as we recognize some PSUs, performance share units which is in our proxy. That contributed to some of them. Some of the others, as we look at the closing, we look at in truing up our books, we looked at the amount of relative indirect costs and we expensed those and those as well as the costs that went into our development during the quarter of a new product technologies. And we recognize all those costs whereas you can make a case where some of those would be capitalizable but we're investing in those but the way the accounting is, we expensed those amounts. So those contributed probably the 30% to 40% the delta between last year's first quarter and this year's first quarter. The balance of that was, as we did see the changing mix and we analyzed as I commented on my statements, that, that lower margins we generate from commercial aerospace and the higher margins from the declining military and space sales, those numbers did have an impact on our performance."

So we didn't quite get back to all the cost-cutting so some of them -- some of the profitability would have been down regardless just because of the last of those 2 major programs. But when you look at the existing programs where we had lower inefficiency and all that, that was another factor and another 20% of those numbers if you look at it. So when you base these numbers together, you had the loss of the C-17 and the Apache. That's coming down and we should be picking up efficiency on those programs. We have inefficiencies due to schedule slides. We have some non-recurring with regards to the SG&A expenses, the development cost for the new technology is in the area of about $1 million.

I'll begin by providing an overview of the quarter, including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino to go over our financial results in detail. 
Let me start off by saying that we are extremely disappointed with our financial and operational performance this quarter. While we continued to benefit from robust growth in our commercial aerospace operations and experience modest decline in overall revenue year-over-year, this was accompanied by a significant decline in margins. The margin compression was particularly acute in our AeroStructures segment primarily due to weak military and space demand, which negatively impacted our operating leverage at a faster rate than we were able to counteract with our cost-reduction efforts. Bottom line results were further impacted by production inefficiencies on certain legacy programs and onetime development costs of new technologies. But having said that, our performance for this quarter was simply unacceptable. 
We talked in the past about the pressure on margins that would come from lower defense spending as some very attractive programs wind down or go through a period of lower demand, these platforms like the C-17, F-15, Apache and the Black Hawk. During the quarter, total military shipments were down 22% year-over-year. While we expected a falloff in defense revenue, the actual decline was greater than anticipated due to schedule softness on some ongoing programs and we are not able to reduce costs as quickly as necessary to counteract the revenue decline. 
We are taking aggressive actions to offset the lower profitability performance and bolster cost-reduction initiatives already underway. We've identified the root causes of the inefficiencies and are working on specific plans to mitigate them. On top of those actions already taken to reduce expenses, we have reevaluated our structural cost drivers and enacted measures to further streamline operations and reduce additional headcount, all in an effort to bring our overhead structure more in line with the lower-than-projected military sales. We anticipate that these cost-reduction efforts will improve operating profit through the year by approximately $4 million to $5 million. 
In those areas where we are already planning major manufacturing efficiency improvements, we are redoubling our efforts to get the job done more quickly. We will also continue to reduce our working capital. We have also enacted plans to further streamline our supply chain, improving costs and performance from our suppliers and we expect the initial benefits to positively impact the second half of 2015. 
Overall, we're taking actions to resolve or mitigate the factors that impeded our execution during the first quarter and position us for stronger second half of the year. 
Let me provide some color on our end markets and products and programs. In the military and space sector, which is now about 41% of our total business, revenue was down significantly both year-over-year and sequentially from Q4 and our backlog here also declined to approximately $249 million versus nearly $318 million at the same time last year. Our AeroStructures and technology segments have each been impacted with lower backlogs reflecting lower government spending in this sector. 
We expect on a year-over-year basis revenue comparisons will get better as 2015 progresses as will the margins. We continue to work through this transition and anticipate the second quarter will be an improvement over the first, and through our actions, the second half of 2015 will show further sequential improvements. 
Now moving to some brighter news, let me talk about for a moment about the commercial aerospace operations where revenue rose to $68 million, up 20% for the same quarter of -- over -- in 2014. We continued to benefit from higher build rates and additional content across-the-board, particularly on the 737 and 787 platforms as well as on the Airbus A320 and A350 programs. We remain very well positioned for further growth in this area, particularly on the large fixed-wing aircraft platforms with Boeing and with Airbus. We are bidding on additional electronic and structural content and believe our strong relationship with these customers as well as with Spirit and with the major engine OEMs form the basis for higher top line growth going forward. Our recently announced long-term supply agreements with United Technologies and Rolls-Royce strengthened our outlook for growth with these strategic partners on major commercial platforms. 
We see no reason to believe that our commercial aerospace business shouldn't continue to expand in 2015 and for the next several years based on our business development efforts and solid aircraft demand. While additional content and higher build rates are obviously something we applaud, the company has experienced lower margins near term because of investments in new product development and program rollout. Therefore, our new product introduction process is another specific area we are targeting for improvement. We will shorten our learning curve on new products and reduce up front development costs. 
Turning to our non-A&D business, we are generally pleased with our performance this quarter. Revenue rose 8% year-over-year to approximately $34 million. What this equates to is pretty strong growth trends across our industrial offerings, offsetting a softer demand within our energy markets as anticipated. Low oil prices continued to negatively impact the drilling market in North America and resulted in reduced shipments and lower backlog in this area for us. We expect such trends to continue for the balance of 2015. However, our industrial backlog is at the highest level it's been in years, and we anticipate growth here will largely offset any energy-related weaknesses for the foreseeable future. 
Finally, as stated in our previous calls, we are looking to refinance the company's debt, market conditions permitting, which will lower interest expense and help improve our profitability going forward. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Joe Bellino to go through our financials. Joe?"
267761,291995043,813067,"Ducommun Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 12, 2015",2015-05-12,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good day, everyone. After the market closed today, we reported our earnings and our loss of -- net loss of $2 million or $0.18 per share for the current quarter, that compares to $5.2 million or $0.46 per diluted share in last year's fir",1859,"Thanks, Tony, and good day, everyone. After the market closed today, we reported our earnings and our loss of -- net loss of $2 million or $0.18 per share for the current quarter, that compares to $5.2 million or $0.46 per diluted share in last year's first quarter. I will go into the details in a moment, but clearly, we were disappointed with our current quarter financial results. 
Net sales for the quarter -- first quarter of 2015 were approximately $173 million, that's 4% lower than last year's first quarter. The revenue decline reflected a continuing shift in demand for our products, including a $20 million decrease in military and space sales offset by an $11 million increase in commercial aerospace sales and a slight uptick of $2 million on our non-A&D revenue. 
In the military and space sector, we have seen reduced demand for both structural solutions and technology electronics platforms, reflecting lower aggregate government defense spending. Within the commercial aerospace arena, by contrast, we have seen increases in both our AeroStructures commercial business as well as our electronic solutions as we continue to benefit from a combination of higher airframe build rates and increased content. We expect these mix shift trends to continue throughout the balance of 2015. 
We have previously indicated in the first half of 2015 it would be a transition period and we will work through this mix shift and other short-term issues. During the quarter, in addition to the unfavorable product mix, we experienced a loss of efficiencies from lower manufacturing volumes as well as higher accrued compensation and benefit costs, along with higher professional services fees. Partially offsetting these factors were a 35% income tax rate benefit as compared to an income tax rate of 33% in last year's first quarter. 
We believe that while a portion of the first quarter 2015 results were an anomaly, we need to swiftly address the issues in front of us and return the company to profitability levels for which we're capable. This includes taking headcount reductions, lowering of indirect labor costs and improving our manufacturing performance as well as our execution on certain new programs. In addition, we have launched a company-wide supply chain improvement process, which will contribute to our profitability enhancement initiatives beginning in the third quarter. 
Operating income for the current quarter was $4 million or 2.1% of revenues compared to approximately $15 million or 8.2% of revenue in the first quarter of 2014. 
Our gross margin was 15.5%, this compares to 20% in the first quarter of 2014. The actions we are taking and the improvements we are seeing in the second quarter already indicate that gross margins are headed in the direction of the levels we experienced in the second half of 2014, and we believe that through additional work, they will continue to improve sequentially. We expect the supply chain initiatives currently being implemented and the realization of our business development efforts will have a positive impact on our second half financial performance. 
Higher accrued compensation and benefit costs and higher professional services costs year-over-year resulted in SG&A running at 13.4% of revenue as compared to a more normalized rate we experienced in last year's first quarter of 11.7%. EBITDA for the current quarter was $10.5 million or approximately 6.1% of revenue this quarter. 
Our working capital execution during the quarter resulted in cash flow operations of $3.5 million as compared to a cash usage of just under $10 million in the first quarter of 2014. As a result of continued solid cash flow generation, we made a voluntary prepayment on our term loan of $10 million and we have reduced our outstanding total debt to approximately $280 million. 
In looking at our results by business segment, first, the Ducommun AeroStructures or DAS business segment, that segment faced most of the challenges during the current quarter as operating income was approximately $2 million or 3% of revenues compared to last year's first quarter where operating income was approximately $11 million or 13.6% of revenues. EBITDA was approximately $5.5 million or 6.5% of revenues this quarter as compared to nearly $14 million or 16.5% of revenues in last year's first quarter. The unfavorable results year-over-year were primarily the result of unfavorable product mix shift, lower revenue, the loss of efficiencies from lower manufacturing volume and higher development costs of new technologies. 
DAS reported revenue for the current quarter of approximately $72 million, down nearly $10 million from the $82 million recorded in last year's first quarter. In previous calls, we had mentioned that the sunsetting of 2 long-cycle defense programs would impact us in early 2015. In addition, we have seen some reductions in revenue across our military helicopter applications. This resulted in a revenue decline in military and space structural products year-over-year of approximately $15 million, which were offset by a $5 million increase year-over-year in sales of our commercial aerospace structured applications. 
Historically, our gross margins have been somewhat higher in our military and space products as compared to commercial aerospace applications, and the unfavorable product mix is reflected in this quarter's results. In addition, we saw greatly reduced operating leverage due to reduced overall volumes that we were not able to offset through our current cost structure reduction initiatives. 
We are aggressively addressing these manufacturing issues and expect sequential improvement in operating margins in the DAS segment beginning this quarter and continuing through the second half of 2015. Commercial aerospace orders remained solid, parallelling the growth that we see in both Boeing and Airbus with most of the growth coming from existing contracts. Going forward, we expect commercial aerospace demand to continue to rise at a 3% to 5% annual growth rate, which would be accompanied by an expansion of margins as we rightsize our cost structure. 
Now turning to the Ducommun LaBarge Technologies or DLT business segment, net sales for the first quarter of 2015 increased nearly 3% to approximately $101 million as compared to approximately $98 million in last year's first quarter. The higher revenue reflected a solid increase in our commercial aerospace electronics applications and a nearly 8% increase in our non-A&D revenue, partially offset by a 10% decrease in military and space electronics revenue. This corresponds to modest mix shift as defense electronic sales declined by $6 million, commercial aerospace electronics grew by a similar $6 million and non-A&D revenues increased by $2 million. 
The decrease in defense technologies revenue primarily reflects reduced demand for F-15 modernizations, which affects our radar rack applications and softness in military helicopter demand. Offsetting these trends somewhat, we continued to see slightly higher demand for our missile defense electronics applications. Through recent marketing development activities, we also saw increased demand for our commercial aerospace and industrial electronics applications with new customers. 
Going forward, we expect to see further sequential reductions in our defense electronics backlog with an increase in our commercial aerospace backlog. In our non-A&D offerings, we've seen a slightly higher backlog in our industrial sector, but a pronounced decline in demand for energy-related products where the backlogs declined sequentially in the natural resources area by $7 million since the end of 2014, primarily reflecting the adverse impact of lower oil prices. 
DLT's operating income for the current quarter was approximately $6 million or 6.2% of revenue, this compares to $7 million or 7.2% of revenue in last year's comparable period. The decrease reflects an unfavorable product mix that was partially offset by higher revenue. We are currently addressing and taking action on the level of manufacturing expenses within this business segment and are aggressively pursuing cost-reduction activities and supply chain initiatives aimed at improving operating performance. EBITDA was approximately $11 million or 10.6% of revenues compared to $12 million or 12.3% of revenues in the 2014 comparable period. 
Corporate General and Administrative expenses for the first quarter were $4.8 million or 2.8% of revenue compared to $3.3 million or 1.8% of revenue in last year's comparable period. They were primarily due to higher accrued compensation and benefit expenses and higher professional services expenses. 
Now turning to backlog. Our overall backlog at quarter's end was $538 million. This equates to a sequential decline of $21 million from the December 2014 period, broken down by: an $11 million decline in our military and space backlog, a 9% decrease -- a $9 million decrease in commercial aerospace products. For clarification purposes, we report backlogs based on firm purchase orders from our customers. The backlog decline in commercial aerospace sector reflects a change by our customers in recent quarters in that they place their orders with us on a quarterly basis rather than traditionally where they place them on an annual basis. As a result and an upshot of this is there are quarterly backlogs even though our -- even on our long-term programs tend to be shorter in duration and in lower amounts than was previously the case. We continue to work diligently to win new orders across both our diverse commercial aerospace end markets and our defense technology platforms. 
Commenting on liquidity and capital resources. During the quarter, we continued to delever our balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2015, as I mentioned, we generated $3.5 million in positive cash from operations compared to a usage of cash of just under $10 million in last year's first quarter. We remain diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash flow profile going forward to reflect historic seasonal patterns. We ended the quarter with sufficient cash balances and expect to continue deleveraging the balance sheet going forward. 
During the first quarter of 2015, we also made another $10 million voluntary prepayment on our debt, reducing our funded debt to $280 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was approximately 3.3:1. At this stage, we are on schedule with regard to our goal of deleveraging to targets of net debt-to-EBITDA of 2.75 to 3 by the end of 2015. 
In addition, we recognize that we have the opportunity this year, subject to market conditions, to refinance our debt and reduce interest expenses significantly going forward, as well as increase our ability to execute on strategic growth initiatives. 
CapEx for the quarter was approximately $5 million and we forecast approximately $15 million of CapEx in fiscal 2015. Our CapEx is used to support the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and to support new contract awards. 
In closing, we continue to focus on managing the changing mix in our business and are working diligently to lower manufacturing costs throughout our operations. We also intend to realize an annual cost savings of $4 million to $5 million as well as improve quality and cycle times through supply chain initiatives to support our goals of higher operating income and higher EBITDA margins. In addition, we remain diligent with expense management and a focus on working capital efficiencies, which, along with the prospect of lower interest expenses from a potential refinancing of our debt, should generate meaningful cash flow going forward. 
Now I'd like to turn the program back over to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

So let me just say once again that our shortfall this quarter was unacceptable. We knew that certain military programs are being dramatically scaled back and we anticipated the potential impact to margins. However, cost-reduction efforts put in place last year were unable to offset the loss of operating leverage caused by the large drop in shipments. In addition, the change in mix across some of the legacy programs caused efficiencies that were simply inexcusable. 
Having said that we are working on specific plans to reduce costs, lower headcount where required, streamline operations, increase asset utilization and lower working capital. Some of these goals will take a little longer to achieve due to lower military volumes and the change in product mix, but we envision better results for the second half of 2015 based on cost-savings initiatives already underway. As I said earlier, we anticipate that our cost reduction efforts will improve operating profit by $4 million to $5 million this year. Our commercial aerospace operations will continue to benefit from strong demand and our industrial business is also expected to post further growth. 
And lastly, as Joe mentioned, we have an opportunity to realize lower interest expenses by refinancing our debt by Q3. 
Overall, we are taking the disciplined, proactive approach to improve bottom line results for the remainder of 2015 and we believe the company is still well positioned for long-term growth and higher returns for our investors.

Some of the others is we look at the closing -- we look at -- in truing up our books, we looked at the amount of relative indirect costs and we expensed those and those as well as the costs that went into our development during the quarter of a new product technologies. And we recognize all those costs whereas you can make a case that some of those would be capitalizable, but -- and we are investing in those, but the way the accounting is we expense those amounts. So those contributed probably 30% to 40% of the delta between last year's first quarter and this year's first quarter. The balance of that was as we did see the changing mix and we analyzed, as I commented on my statements, the lower margins we generate from commercial aerospace and the higher margins from the declining military and space sales, those numbers did have an impact on our performance."

The inefficiencies and the product mix kind of developed the rest of it, but there were schedule slides in there that caused -- and this is where it's very difficult and this is why we don't break these numbers down because it becomes -- when you're inefficient you increase higher overhead costs, so you put yourself in a position where the overhead is driven higher because you're not performing at the labor rate requirements that you need. And so with additional schedule slides on some major programs on the military side that were not anticipated, we were not able to catch up. Trust me when I tell you that we had a pretty solid cost-reduction program. We've taken out probably, well, suffice to say we've taken out a significant number of headcount at the end of the year last year, last 2 quarters the last year, and no one's anticipated that we had some early in this first quarter, but they did not come out fast enough in order to be able to offset the overhead costs that were impacted by the shift in revenue base and the product mix shift."

So when you look at product inefficiencies, you also have to take into consideration that in the first quarter last year, there was a significant number of dollars in revenue in the Apache and the C-17, which generated pretty solid profit. Now that is gone. And remember, as we looked at it, that dissipated over the year. So those programs in the second quarter was less than the first quarter. So we lost the revenue, but we also lost the margins that went with that, but then we tried to make up margins by the cost-cutting, right? So we didn't quite get back through all the cost-cutting. So some of them -- some of the profitability would have been down regardless just because of the loss of those 2 major programs. But when you look at the existing programs where we had lower inefficiency, that was another factor and another 20% off those numbers if you look at it. So when you base these numbers together, you had the loss of the C-17 and the Apache, that's coming down and we should be picking up efficiency on those programs. We had inefficiencies due to schedule slides. You have some nonrecurring with regards to the SG&A, the expenses, the development cost for the new technology is in the area of about $1 million. So those are maybe about $1.8 million when you add in some of the other aspects of it. So those are areas where the adjustments would not return."

I'll begin by providing an overview of the quarter, including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino to go over our financial results in detail. 
Let me start off by saying that we are extremely disappointed with our financial and operational performance this quarter. While we continued to benefit from robust growth in our commercial aerospace operations and experience modest decline in overall revenue year-over-year, this was accompanied by a significant decline in margins. The margin compression was particularly acute in our AeroStructures segment primarily due to weak military and space demand, which negatively impacted our operating leverage at a faster rate than we were able to counteract with our cost-reduction efforts. Bottom line results were further impacted by production inefficiencies on certain legacy programs and onetime development costs of new technologies. But having said that, our performance for this quarter was simply unacceptable. 
We talked in the past about the pressure on margins that would come from lower defense spending as some very attractive programs wind down or go through a period of lower demand, these platforms like the C-17, F-15, Apache and the Black Hawk. During the quarter, total military shipments were down 22% year-over-year. While we expected a falloff in defense revenue, the actual decline was greater than anticipated due to schedule softness on some ongoing programs and we are not able to reduce costs as quickly as necessary to counteract the revenue decline. 
We are taking aggressive actions to offset the lower profitability performance and bolster cost-reduction initiatives already underway. We've identified the root causes of the inefficiencies and are working on specific plans to mitigate them. On top of those actions already taken to reduce expenses, we have reevaluated our structural cost drivers and enacted measures to further streamline operations and reduce additional headcount, all in an effort to bring our overhead structure more in line with the lower-than-projected military sales. We anticipate that these cost-reduction efforts will improve operating profit through the year by approximately $4 million to $5 million. 
In those areas where we are already planning major manufacturing efficiency improvements, we are redoubling our efforts to get the job done more quickly. We will also continue to reduce our working capital. We have also enacted plans to further streamline our supply chain, improving costs and performance from our suppliers and we expect the initial benefits to positively impact the second half of 2015. 
Overall, we're taking actions to resolve or mitigate the factors that impeded our execution during the first quarter and position us for stronger second half of the year. 
Let me provide some color on our end markets and products and programs. In the military and space sector, which is now about 41% of our total business, revenue was down significantly both year-over-year and sequentially from Q4 and our backlog here also declined to approximately $249 million versus nearly $318 million at the same time last year. Our AeroStructures and technology segments have each been impacted with lower backlogs reflecting lower government spending in this sector. 
We expect on a year-over-year basis revenue comparisons will get better as 2015 progresses as will the margins. We continue to work through this transition and anticipate the second quarter will be an improvement over the first, and through our actions, the second half of 2015 will show further sequential improvements. 
Now moving to some brighter news, let me talk about for a moment about the commercial aerospace operations where revenue rose to $68 million, up 20% for the same quarter of -- over -- in 2014. We continued to benefit from higher build rates and additional content across-the-board, particularly on the 737 and 787 platforms as well as on the Airbus A320 and A350 programs. We remain very well positioned for further growth in this area, particularly on the large fixed-wing aircraft platforms with Boeing and with Airbus. We are bidding on additional electronic and structural content and believe our strong relationship with these customers as well as with Spirit and with the major engine OEMs form the basis for higher top line growth going forward. Our recently announced long-term supply agreements with United Technologies and Rolls-Royce strengthened our outlook for growth with these strategic partners on major commercial platforms. 
We see no reason to believe that our commercial aerospace business shouldn't continue to expand in 2015 and for the next several years based on our business development efforts and solid aircraft demand. While additional content and higher build rates are obviously something we applaud, the company has experienced lower margins near term because of investments in new product development and program rollout. Therefore, our new product introduction process is another specific area we are targeting for improvement. We will shorten our learning curve on new products and reduce up front development costs. 
Turning to our non-A&D business, we are generally pleased with our performance this quarter. Revenue rose 8% year-over-year to approximately $34 million. What this equates to is pretty strong growth trends across our industrial offerings, offsetting a softer demand within our energy markets as anticipated. Low oil prices continued to negatively impact the drilling market in North America and resulted in reduced shipments and lower backlog in this area for us. We expect such trends to continue for the balance of 2015. However, our industrial backlog is at the highest level it's been in years, and we anticipate growth here will largely offset any energy-related weaknesses for the foreseeable future. 
Finally, as stated in our previous calls, we are looking to refinance the company's debt, market conditions permitting, which will lower interest expense and help improve our profitability going forward. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Joe Bellino to go through our financials. Joe?"
267761,291995043,813110,"Ducommun Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 12, 2015",2015-05-12,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good day, everyone. After the market closed today, we reported our earnings and our loss of -- net loss of $2 million or $0.18 per share for the current quarter, that compares to $5.2 million or $0.46 per diluted share in last year's fir",1860,"Thanks, Tony, and good day, everyone. After the market closed today, we reported our earnings and our loss of -- net loss of $2 million or $0.18 per share for the current quarter, that compares to $5.2 million or $0.46 per diluted share in last year's first quarter. I will go into the details in a moment, but clearly, we were disappointed with our current quarter financial results. 
Net sales for the quarter -- first quarter of 2015 were approximately $173 million, that's 4% lower than last year's first quarter. The revenue decline reflected a continuing shift in demand for our products, including a $20 million decrease in military and space sales offset by an $11 million increase in commercial aerospace sales and a slight uptick of $2 million on our non-A&D revenue. 
In the military and space sector, we have seen reduced demand for both structural solutions and technology electronics platforms, reflecting lower aggregate government defense spending. Within the commercial aerospace arena, by contrast, we have seen increases in both our AeroStructures commercial business as well as our electronic solutions as we continue to benefit from a combination of higher airframe build rates and increased content. We expect these mix shift trends to continue throughout the balance of 2015. 
We have previously indicated in the first half of 2015 it would be a transition period and we will work through this mix shift and other short-term issues. During the quarter, in addition to the unfavorable product mix, we experienced a loss of efficiencies from lower manufacturing volumes as well as higher accrued compensation and benefit costs, along with higher professional services fees. Partially offsetting these factors were a 35% income tax rate benefit as compared to an income tax rate of 33% in last year's first quarter. 
We believe that while a portion of the first quarter 2015 results were an anomaly, we need to swiftly address the issues in front of us and return the company to profitability levels for which we're capable. This includes taking headcount reductions, lowering of indirect labor costs and improving our manufacturing performance as well as our execution on certain new programs. In addition, we have launched a company-wide supply chain improvement process, which will contribute to our profitability enhancement initiatives beginning in the third quarter. 
Operating income for the current quarter was $4 million or 2.1% of revenues compared to approximately $15 million or 8.2% of revenue in the first quarter of 2014. 
Our gross margin was 15.5%, this compares to 20% in the first quarter of 2014. The actions we are taking and the improvements we are seeing in the second quarter already indicate that gross margins are headed in the direction of the levels we experienced in the second half of 2014, and we believe that through additional work, they will continue to improve sequentially. We expect the supply chain initiatives currently being implemented and the realization of our business development efforts will have a positive impact on our second half financial performance. 
Higher accrued compensation and benefit costs and higher professional services costs year-over-year resulted in SG&A running at 13.4% of revenue as compared to a more normalized rate we experienced in last year's first quarter of 11.7%. EBITDA for the current quarter was $10.5 million or approximately 6.1% of revenue this quarter. 
Our working capital execution during the quarter resulted in cash flow operations of $3.5 million as compared to a cash usage of just under $10 million in the first quarter of 2014. As a result of continued solid cash flow generation, we made a voluntary prepayment on our term loan of $10 million and we have reduced our outstanding total debt to approximately $280 million. 
In looking at our results by business segment, first, the Ducommun AeroStructures or DAS business segment, that segment faced most of the challenges during the current quarter as operating income was approximately $2 million or 3% of revenues compared to last year's first quarter where operating income was approximately $11 million or 13.6% of revenues. EBITDA was approximately $5.5 million or 6.5% of revenues this quarter as compared to nearly $14 million or 16.5% of revenues in last year's first quarter. The unfavorable results year-over-year were primarily the result of unfavorable product mix shift, lower revenue, the loss of efficiencies from lower manufacturing volume and higher development costs of new technologies. 
DAS reported revenue for the current quarter of approximately $72 million, down nearly $10 million from the $82 million recorded in last year's first quarter. In previous calls, we had mentioned that the sunsetting of 2 long-cycle defense programs would impact us in early 2015. In addition, we have seen some reductions in revenue across our military helicopter applications. This resulted in a revenue decline in military and space structural products year-over-year of approximately $15 million, which were offset by a $5 million increase year-over-year in sales of our commercial aerospace structured applications. 
Historically, our gross margins have been somewhat higher in our military and space products as compared to commercial aerospace applications, and the unfavorable product mix is reflected in this quarter's results. In addition, we saw greatly reduced operating leverage due to reduced overall volumes that we were not able to offset through our current cost structure reduction initiatives. 
We are aggressively addressing these manufacturing issues and expect sequential improvement in operating margins in the DAS segment beginning this quarter and continuing through the second half of 2015. Commercial aerospace orders remained solid, parallelling the growth that we see in both Boeing and Airbus with most of the growth coming from existing contracts. Going forward, we expect commercial aerospace demand to continue to rise at a 3% to 5% annual growth rate, which would be accompanied by an expansion of margins as we rightsize our cost structure. 
Now turning to the Ducommun LaBarge Technologies or DLT business segment, net sales for the first quarter of 2015 increased nearly 3% to approximately $101 million as compared to approximately $98 million in last year's first quarter. The higher revenue reflected a solid increase in our commercial aerospace electronics applications and a nearly 8% increase in our non-A&D revenue, partially offset by a 10% decrease in military and space electronics revenue. This corresponds to modest mix shift as defense electronic sales declined by $6 million, commercial aerospace electronics grew by a similar $6 million and non-A&D revenues increased by $2 million. 
The decrease in defense technologies revenue primarily reflects reduced demand for F-15 modernizations, which affects our radar rack applications and softness in military helicopter demand. Offsetting these trends somewhat, we continued to see slightly higher demand for our missile defense electronics applications. Through recent marketing development activities, we also saw increased demand for our commercial aerospace and industrial electronics applications with new customers. 
Going forward, we expect to see further sequential reductions in our defense electronics backlog with an increase in our commercial aerospace backlog. In our non-A&D offerings, we've seen a slightly higher backlog in our industrial sector, but a pronounced decline in demand for our energy-related products where the backlogs declined sequentially in the natural resources area by $7 million since the end of 2014, primarily reflecting the adverse impact of lower oil prices. 
DLT's operating income for the current quarter was approximately $6 million or 6.2% of revenue, this compares to $7 million or 7.2% of revenue in last year's comparable period. The decrease reflects an unfavorable product mix that was partially offset by higher revenue. We are currently addressing and taking action on the level of manufacturing expenses within this business segment and are aggressively pursuing cost-reduction activities and supply chain initiatives aimed at improving operating performance. EBITDA was approximately $11 million or 10.6% of revenues compared to $12 million or 12.3% of revenues in the 2014 comparable period. 
Corporate General and Administrative expenses for the first quarter were $4.8 million or 2.8% of revenue compared to $3.3 million or 1.8% of revenue in last year's comparable period. They were primarily due to higher accrued compensation and benefit expenses and higher professional services expenses. 
Now turning to backlog. Our overall backlog at quarter's end was $538 million. This equates to a sequential decline of $21 million from the December 2014 period, broken down by: an $11 million decline in our military and space backlog, a 9% decrease -- a $9 million decrease in commercial aerospace products. For clarification purposes, we report backlogs based on firm purchase orders from our customers. The backlog decline in commercial aerospace sector reflects a change by our customers in recent quarters in that they place their orders with us on a quarterly basis rather than traditionally where they place them on an annual basis. As a result and an upshot of this is there are quarterly backlogs even though our -- even on our long-term programs tend to be shorter in duration and in lower amounts than was previously the case. We continue to work diligently to win new orders across both our diverse commercial aerospace end markets and our defense technology platforms. 
Commenting on liquidity and capital resources. During the quarter, we continued to delever our balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2015, as I mentioned, we generated $3.5 million in positive cash from operations compared to a usage of cash of just under $10 million in last year's first quarter. We remain diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash flow profile going forward to reflect historic seasonal patterns. We ended the quarter with sufficient cash balances and expect to continue deleveraging the balance sheet going forward. 
During the first quarter of 2015, we also made another $10 million voluntary prepayment on our debt, reducing our funded debt to $280 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was approximately 3.3:1. At this stage, we are on schedule with regard to our goal of deleveraging to targets of net debt-to-EBITDA of 2.75 to 3 by the end of 2015. 
In addition, we recognize that we have the opportunity this year, subject to market conditions, to refinance our debt and reduce interest expenses significantly going forward, as well as increase our ability to execute on strategic growth initiatives. 
CapEx for the quarter was approximately $5 million and we forecast approximately $15 million of CapEx in fiscal 2015. Our CapEx is used to support the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and to support new contract awards. 
In closing, we continue to focus on managing the changing mix in our business and are working diligently to lower manufacturing costs throughout our operations. We also intend to realize an annual cost savings of $4 million to $5 million as well as improve quality and cycle times through supply chain initiatives to support our goals of higher operating income and higher EBITDA margins. In addition, we remain diligent with expense management and a focus on working capital efficiencies, which, along with the prospect of lower interest expenses from a potential refinancing of our debt, should generate meaningful cash flow going forward. 
Now I'd like to turn the program back over to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

So let me just say once again that our shortfall this quarter was unacceptable. We knew that certain military programs are being dramatically scaled back and we anticipated the potential impact to margins. However, cost-reduction efforts put in place last year were unable to offset the loss of operating leverage caused by the large drop in shipments. In addition, the change in mix across some of the legacy programs caused inefficiencies that were simply inexcusable. 
Having said that we are working on specific plans to reduce costs, lower headcount where required, streamline operations, increase asset utilization and lower working capital. Some of these goals will take a little longer to achieve due to lower military volumes and the change in product mix, but we envision better results for the second half of 2015 based on cost-savings initiatives already underway. As I said earlier, we anticipate that our cost reduction efforts will improve operating profit by $4 million to $5 million this year. Our commercial aerospace operations will continue to benefit from strong demand and our industrial business is also expected to post further growth. 
And lastly, as Joe mentioned, we have an opportunity to realize lower interest expenses by refinancing our debt by Q3. 
Overall, we are taking the disciplined, proactive approach to improve bottom line results for the remainder of 2015 and we believe the company is still well positioned for long-term growth and higher returns for our investors. 
With that, Alex, I'd like to open up the call for questions, please."

And for example, on the SG&A expenses that I spoke about, we had higher professional costs related to getting the books closed as well as we recognized some PSUs, performance share units, which is in our proxy, that contributed to some of them. Some of the others is we look at the closing -- we look at -- in truing up our books, we looked at the amount of relative indirect costs and we expensed those and those as well as the costs that went into our development during the quarter of a new product technologies. And we recognize all those costs whereas you can make a case that some of those would be capitalizable, but -- and we are investing in those, but the way the accounting is we expense those amounts. So those contributed probably 30% to 40% of the delta between last year's first quarter and this year's first quarter. The balance of that was as we did see the changing mix and we analyzed, as I commented on my statements, the lower margins we generate from commercial aerospace and the higher margins from the declining military and space sales, those numbers did have an impact on our performance."

So when you look at product inefficiencies, you also have to take into consideration that in the first quarter last year, there was a significant number of dollars in revenue in the Apache and the C-17, which generated pretty solid profit. Now that is gone. And remember, as we looked at it, that dissipated over the year. So those programs in the second quarter was less than the first quarter. So we lost the revenue, but we also lost the margins that went with that, but then we tried to make up margins by the cost-cutting, right? So we didn't quite get back to all the cost-cutting. So some of them -- some of the profitability would have been down regardless just because of the loss of those 2 major programs. But when you look at the existing programs where we had lower inefficiency, that was another factor and another 20% off those numbers if you look at it. So when you base these numbers together, you had the loss of the C-17 and the Apache, that's coming down and we should be picking up efficiency on those programs. We had inefficiencies due to schedule slides. You have some nonrecurring with regards to the SG&A, the expenses, the development cost for the new technology is in the area of about $1 million.

I'll begin by providing an overview of the quarter, including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino to go over our financial results in detail. 
Let me start off by saying that we are extremely disappointed with our financial and operational performance this quarter. While we continued to benefit from robust growth in our commercial aerospace operations and experience modest decline in overall revenue year-over-year, this was accompanied by a significant decline in margins. The margin compression was particularly acute in our AeroStructures segment primarily due to weak military and space demand, which negatively impacted our operating leverage at a faster rate than we were able to counteract with our cost-reduction efforts. Bottom line results were further impacted by production inefficiencies on certain legacy programs and onetime development costs of new technologies. But having said that, our performance for this quarter was simply unacceptable. 
We talked in the past about the pressure on margins that would come from lower defense spending as some very attractive programs wind down or go through a period of lower demand, these platforms like the C-17, F-15, Apache and the Black Hawk. During the quarter, total military shipments were down 22% year-over-year. While we expected a falloff in defense revenue, the actual decline was greater than anticipated due to schedule softness on some ongoing programs and we are not able to reduce costs as quickly as necessary to counteract the revenue decline. 
We are taking aggressive actions to offset the lower profitability performance and bolster cost-reduction initiatives already underway. We've identified the root causes of the inefficiencies and are working on specific plans to mitigate them. On top of those actions already taken to reduce expenses, we have reevaluated our structural cost drivers and enacted measures to further streamline operations and reduce additional headcount, all in an effort to bring our overhead structure more in line with the lower-than-projected military sales. We anticipate that these cost-reduction efforts will improve operating profit through the year by approximately $4 million to $5 million. 
In those areas where we are already planning major manufacturing efficiency improvements, we are redoubling our efforts to get the job done more quickly. We will also continue to reduce our working capital. We have also enacted plans to further streamline our supply chain, improving costs and performance from our suppliers and we expect the initial benefits to positively impact the second half of 2015. 
Overall, we're taking actions to resolve or mitigate the factors that impeded our execution during the first quarter and position us for stronger second half of the year. 
Let me provide some color on our end markets and products and programs. In the military and space sector, which is now about 41% of our total business, revenue was down significantly both year-over-year and sequentially from Q4 and our backlog here also declined to approximately $249 million versus nearly $318 million at the same time last year. Our AeroStructures and technology segments have each been impacted with lower backlogs reflecting lower government spending in this sector. 
We expect on a year-over-year basis revenue comparisons will get better as 2015 progresses as will the margins. We continue to work through this transition and anticipate the second quarter will be an improvement over the first, and through our actions, the second half of 2015 will show further sequential improvements. 
Now moving to some brighter news, let me talk about for a moment about the commercial aerospace operations where revenue rose to $68 million, up 20% for the same quarter of -- over -- in 2014. We continued to benefit from higher build rates and additional content across-the-board, particularly on the 737 and 787 platforms as well as on the Airbus A320 and A350 programs. We remain very well positioned for further growth in this area, particularly on the large fixed-wing aircraft platforms with Boeing and with Airbus. We are bidding on additional electronic and structural content and believe our strong relationship with these customers as well as with Spirit and with the major engine OEMs form the basis for higher top line growth going forward. Our recently announced long-term supply agreements with United Technologies and Rolls-Royce strengthened our outlook for growth with these strategic partners on major commercial platforms. 
We see no reason to believe that our commercial aerospace business shouldn't continue to expand in 2015 and for the next several years based on our business development efforts and solid aircraft demand. While additional content and higher build rates are obviously something we applaud, the company has experienced lower margins near term because of investments in new product development and program rollout. Therefore, our new product introduction process is another specific area we are targeting for improvement. We will shorten our learning curve on new products and reduce up front development costs. 
Turning to our non-A&D business, we are generally pleased with our performance this quarter. Revenue rose 8% year-over-year to approximately $34 million. What this equates to is pretty strong growth trends across our industrial offerings, offsetting a softer demand within our energy markets as anticipated. Low oil prices continued to negatively impact the drilling market in North America and resulted in reduced shipments and lower backlog in this area for us. We expect such trends to continue for the balance of 2015. However, our industrial backlog is at the highest level it's been in years, and we anticipate growth here will largely offset any energy-related weaknesses for the foreseeable future. 
Finally, as stated in our previous calls, we are looking to refinance the company's debt, market conditions permitting, which will lower interest expense and help improve our profitability going forward. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Joe Bellino to go through our financials. Joe?"
267761,291995043,815870,"Ducommun Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 12, 2015",2015-05-12,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good day, everyone. After the market closed today, we reported our earnings and our loss of -- net loss of $2 million or $0.18 per share for the current quarter, that compares to $5.2 million or $0.46 per diluted share in last year's fir",1860,"Thanks, Tony, and good day, everyone. After the market closed today, we reported our earnings and our loss of -- net loss of $2 million or $0.18 per share for the current quarter, that compares to $5.2 million or $0.46 per diluted share in last year's first quarter. I will go into the details in a moment, but clearly, we were disappointed with our current quarter financial results. 
Net sales for the quarter -- first quarter of 2015 were approximately $173 million, that's 4% lower than last year's first quarter. The revenue decline reflected a continuing shift in demand for our products, including a $20 million decrease in military and space sales offset by an $11 million increase in commercial aerospace sales and a slight uptick of $2 million on our non-A&D revenue. 
In the military and space sector, we have seen reduced demand for both structural solutions and technology electronics platforms, reflecting lower aggregate government defense spending. Within the commercial aerospace arena, by contrast, we have seen increases in both our AeroStructures commercial business as well as our electronic solutions as we continue to benefit from a combination of higher airframe build rates and increased content. We expect these mix shift trends to continue throughout the balance of 2015. 
We have previously indicated in the first half of 2015 it would be a transition period and we will work through this mix shift and other short-term issues. During the quarter, in addition to the unfavorable product mix, we experienced a loss of efficiencies from lower manufacturing volumes as well as higher accrued compensation and benefit costs, along with higher professional services fees. Partially offsetting these factors were a 35% income tax rate benefit as compared to an income tax rate of 33% in last year's first quarter. 
We believe that while a portion of the first quarter 2015 results were an anomaly, we need to swiftly address the issues in front of us and return the company to profitability levels for which we're capable. This includes taking headcount reductions, lowering of indirect labor costs and improving our manufacturing performance as well as our execution on certain new programs. In addition, we have launched a company-wide supply chain improvement process, which will contribute to our profitability enhancement initiatives beginning in the third quarter. 
Operating income for the current quarter was $4 million or 2.1% of revenues compared to approximately $15 million or 8.2% of revenue in the first quarter of 2014. 
Our gross margin was 15.5%, this compares to 20% in the first quarter of 2014. The actions we are taking and the improvements we are seeing in the second quarter already indicate that gross margins are headed in the direction of the levels we experienced in the second half of 2014, and we believe that through additional work, they will continue to improve sequentially. We expect the supply chain initiatives currently being implemented and the realization of our business development efforts will have a positive impact on our second half financial performance. 
Higher accrued compensation and benefit costs and higher professional services costs year-over-year resulted in SG&A running at 13.4% of revenue as compared to a more normalized rate we experienced in last year's first quarter of 11.7%. EBITDA for the current quarter was $10.5 million or approximately 6.1% of revenue this quarter. 
Our working capital execution during the quarter resulted in cash flow operations of $3.5 million as compared to a cash usage of just under $10 million in the first quarter of 2014. As a result of continued solid cash flow generation, we made a voluntary prepayment on our term loan of $10 million and we have reduced our outstanding total debt to approximately $280 million. 
In looking at our results by business segment, first, the Ducommun AeroStructures or DAS business segment, that segment faced most of the challenges during the current quarter as operating income was approximately $2 million or 3% of revenues compared to last year's first quarter where operating income was approximately $11 million or 13.6% of revenues. EBITDA was approximately $5.5 million or 6.5% of revenues this quarter as compared to nearly $14 million or 16.5% of revenues in last year's first quarter. The unfavorable results year-over-year were primarily the result of unfavorable product mix shift, lower revenue, the loss of efficiencies from lower manufacturing volume and higher development costs of new technologies. 
DAS reported revenue for the current quarter of approximately $72 million, down nearly $10 million from the $82 million recorded in last year's first quarter. In previous calls, we had mentioned that the sunsetting of 2 long-cycle defense programs would impact us in early 2015. In addition, we have seen some reductions in revenue across our military helicopter applications. This resulted in a revenue decline in military and space structural products year-over-year of approximately $15 million, which were offset by a $5 million increase year-over-year in sales of our commercial aerospace structured applications. 
Historically, our gross margins have been somewhat higher in our military and space products as compared to commercial aerospace applications, and the unfavorable product mix is reflected in this quarter's results. In addition, we saw greatly reduced operating leverage due to reduced overall volumes that we were not able to offset through our current cost structure reduction initiatives. 
We are aggressively addressing these manufacturing issues and expect sequential improvement in operating margins in the DAS segment beginning this quarter and continuing through the second half of 2015. Commercial aerospace orders remained solid, parallelling the growth that we see in both Boeing and Airbus with most of the growth coming from existing contracts. Going forward, we expect commercial aerospace demand to continue to rise at a 3% to 5% annual growth rate, which would be accompanied by an expansion of margins as we rightsize our cost structure. 
Now turning to the Ducommun LaBarge Technologies or DLT business segment, net sales for the first quarter of 2015 increased nearly 3% to approximately $101 million as compared to approximately $98 million in last year's first quarter. The higher revenue reflected a solid increase in our commercial aerospace electronics applications and a nearly 8% increase in our non-A&D revenue, partially offset by a 10% decrease in military and space electronics revenue. This corresponds to modest mix shift as defense electronic sales declined by $6 million, commercial aerospace electronics grew by a similar $6 million and non-A&D revenues increased by $2 million. 
The decrease in defense technologies revenue primarily reflects reduced demand for F-15 modernizations, which affects our radar rack applications and softness in military helicopter demand. Offsetting these trends somewhat, we continued to see slightly higher demand for our missile defense electronics applications. Through recent marketing development activities, we also saw increased demand for our commercial aerospace and industrial electronics applications with new customers. 
Going forward, we expect to see further sequential reductions in our defense electronics backlog with an increase in our commercial aerospace backlog. In our non-A&D offerings, we've seen a slightly higher backlog in our industrial sector, but a pronounced decline in demand for our energy-related products where the backlogs declined sequentially in the natural resources area by $7 million since the end of 2014, primarily reflecting the adverse impact of lower oil prices. 
DLT's operating income for the current quarter was approximately $6 million or 6.2% of revenue, this compares to $7 million or 7.2% of revenue in last year's comparable period. The decrease reflects an unfavorable product mix that was partially offset by higher revenue. We are currently addressing and taking action on the level of manufacturing expenses within this business segment and are aggressively pursuing cost-reduction activities and supply chain initiatives aimed at improving operating performance. EBITDA was approximately $11 million or 10.6% of revenues compared to $12 million or 12.3% of revenues in the 2014 comparable period. 
Corporate General and Administrative expenses for the first quarter were $4.8 million or 2.8% of revenue compared to $3.3 million or 1.8% of revenue in last year's comparable period. They were primarily due to higher accrued compensation and benefit expenses and higher professional services expenses. 
Now turning to backlog. Our overall backlog at quarter's end was $538 million. This equates to a sequential decline of $21 million from the December 2014 period, broken down by: an $11 million decline in our military and space backlog, a 9% decrease -- a $9 million decrease in commercial aerospace products. For clarification purposes, we report backlogs based on firm purchase orders from our customers. The backlog decline in commercial aerospace sector reflects a change by our customers in recent quarters in that they place their orders with us on a quarterly basis rather than traditionally where they place them on an annual basis. As a result and an upshot of this is there are quarterly backlogs even though our -- even on our long-term programs tend to be shorter in duration and in lower amounts than was previously the case. We continue to work diligently to win new orders across both our diverse commercial aerospace end markets and our defense technology platforms. 
Commenting on liquidity and capital resources. During the quarter, we continued to delever our balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2015, as I mentioned, we generated $3.5 million in positive cash from operations compared to a usage of cash of just under $10 million in last year's first quarter. We remain diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash flow profile going forward to reflect historic seasonal patterns. We ended the quarter with sufficient cash balances and expect to continue deleveraging the balance sheet going forward. 
During the first quarter of 2015, we also made another $10 million voluntary prepayment on our debt, reducing our funded debt to $280 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was approximately 3.3:1. At this stage, we are on schedule with regard to our goal of deleveraging to targets of net debt-to-EBITDA of 2.75 to 3 by the end of 2015. 
In addition, we recognize that we have the opportunity this year, subject to market conditions, to refinance our debt and reduce interest expenses significantly going forward as well as increase our ability to execute on strategic growth initiatives. 
CapEx for the quarter was approximately $5 million and we forecast approximately $15 million of CapEx in fiscal 2015. Our CapEx is used to support the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and to support new contract awards. 
In closing, we continue to focus on managing the changing mix in our business and are working diligently to lower manufacturing costs throughout our operations. We also intend to realize an annual cost savings of $4 million to $5 million as well as improve quality and cycle times through supply chain initiatives to support our goals of higher operating income and higher EBITDA margins. In addition, we remain diligent with expense management and a focus on working capital efficiencies, which, along with the prospect of lower interest expenses from a potential refinancing of our debt, should generate meaningful cash flow going forward. 
Now I'd like to turn the program back over to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

So let me just say once again that our shortfall this quarter was unacceptable. We knew that certain military programs are being dramatically scaled back and we anticipated the potential impact to margins. However, cost-reduction efforts put in place last year were unable to offset the loss of operating leverage caused by the large drop in shipments. In addition, the change in mix across some of the legacy programs caused inefficiencies that were simply inexcusable. 
Having said that we are working on specific plans to reduce costs, lower headcount where required, streamline operations, increase asset utilization and lower working capital. Some of these goals will take a little longer to achieve due to lower military volumes and the change in product mix, but we envision better results for the second half of 2015 based on cost-savings initiatives already underway. As I said earlier, we anticipate that our cost reduction efforts will improve operating profit by $4 million to $5 million this year. Our commercial aerospace operations will continue to benefit from strong demand and our industrial business is also expected to post further growth. 
And lastly, as Joe mentioned, we have an opportunity to realize lower interest expenses by refinancing our debt by Q3. 
Overall, we are taking the disciplined, proactive approach to improve bottom line results for the remainder of 2015 and we believe the company is still well positioned for long-term growth and higher returns for our investors.

And as we always do, we true up the quarters similar to what we do year-end.

Some of the others is we look at the closing -- we look at -- in truing up our books, we looked at the amount of relative indirect costs and we expensed those and those as well as the costs that went into our development during the quarter of a new product technologies. And we recognize all those costs whereas you can make a case that some of those would be capitalizable, but -- and we are investing in those, but the way the accounting is we expense those amounts. So those contributed probably 30% to 40% of the delta between last year's first quarter and this year's first quarter. The balance of that was as we did see the changing mix and we analyzed, as I commented on my statements, the lower margins we generate from commercial aerospace and the higher margins from the declining military and space sales, those numbers did have an impact on our performance."

So when you look at product inefficiencies, you also have to take into consideration that in the first quarter last year, there was a significant number of dollars in revenue in the Apache and the C-17, which generated pretty solid profit. Now that is gone. And remember, as we looked at it, that dissipated over the year. So those programs in the second quarter was less than the first quarter. So we lost the revenue, but we also lost the margins that went with that, but then we tried to make up margins by the cost-cutting, right? So we didn't quite get back to all the cost-cutting.

So when you base these numbers together, you had the loss of the C-17 and the Apache, that's coming down and we should be picking up efficiency on those programs. We had inefficiencies due to schedule slides. You have some nonrecurring with regards to the SG&A, the expenses, the development cost for the new technology is in the area of about $1 million. So those are maybe about $1.8 million when you add in some of the other aspects of it. So those are areas where the adjustments would not return."

I'll begin by providing an overview of the quarter, including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino to go over our financial results. 
While facing a slowdown in our military and oil and gas markets but seeing new business growth in our commercial aerospace, we focused on improving bottom line results in streamlining certain operations to ensure that Ducommun is right sized with the current economic environment. The good news is that we have accomplished what we set out to do this quarter, cutting costs and expanding margins while at the same time evaluating our facilities rationalization opportunities. 
In addition, I'm pleased to say that our New York facility consolidation, bringing 3 facilities into 1 newer, more advanced and more efficient manufacturing operation is on schedule for completion this year. We have also now reduced headcount 10% year-over-year and implemented corporate-wide supply chain initiatives. As a result of these actions and as committed to, we are on track to remove $4 million to $5 million of annualized costs from our operations this year. And this is already showing up in our terms of our margin expansion. 
So our revenue and income, net of onetime items, were down when compared to last year. We showed vast improvements sequentially versus the first quarter 2015. Commercial aerospace demand remains strong and our other end markets appear to be stabilizing. Another very important element of our focus this quarter was completing our debt refinancing on schedule. We accomplished this goal at very attractive rates that are expected to save the company an estimated $14 million to $15 million in adjusted annually. It's a tremendous achievement and one that we are very proud of. 
So we made progress this quarter on improving both our balance sheet and our operational performance. Now let me put a little color on our end markets and our products and programs. In the Military and Space sector, we saw some modest growth across -- versus Q1, but we're still down year-over-year as expected, given the legacy programs we discussed in the past. In fact, you've likely already heard from other government contractors, our defense related business is down double-digits year-to-date and we're starting to see some the stabilization in terms of run rates across the board, but still anticipate lower revenue in these markets during the second half of 2015. 
Our military backlog in both the aerostructures and technologies remains just north of $250 million. There's no surprise in this part of the business, but this is an area that remains a core focus in our efforts to right size operations, so they're in my what we call the new normal of lower defense spending. In fact, we're looking at additional streamline initiatives including cost cutting measures, about which I'll be able to provide more color later on this year. I also want to mention the recent industry development with regard to our Military and Space business, specifically the recently announced deal with Lockheed Martin to purchase Sikorsky from United Technologies. As many of you already know, Sikorsky has been and remains one of our key customers here at Ducommun. 
The Black Hawk is our largest military program and we have received several prestigious supplier awards from Sikorsky over the past decades. So we now look forward to working with its new owner and believe our relationship with both Sikorsky and Lockheed will continue to strengthen in the years to come. 
Now moving to our commercial aerospace operations. I'm pleased to say that once again, we posted year-over-year revenue growth on the strength of a diverse number of high platform -- high-profile platforms, such as the Boeing 737, the 777 and the 787 programs. Our commercial aerospace backlog remains solid under $200 million and we expect to see this grow over the next 2 quarters with revenue expansion as well during the remainder of 2015. 
We continue to win new content on the new 737 MAX as well as various Airbus aircraft and since May have announced a number of awards in this space, including a contract from Spirit to produce Titanium auxilliary power unit exhaust bearing assemblies housing the tail cone on the 737 MAX. This adds to our content on the MAX platform, which already includes spoilers and other structural assemblies. 
We also announced that the Paris Air Show, a cooperative research with Airbus, under which we will jointly develop applications using Ducommun's full matrix technology and advanced resin transfer molding process, which brings both weight and cost savings into a higher strength assembly. We see this as the beginning of entirely new chapter within our collaboration with Airbus. 
Now last but not least, we also recently announced a multimillion dollar contract with Gulfstream Aerospace to support the upcoming G500 and G600 aircraft, a new family a large cabin long-range business jets. Ducommun will be the sole source supplier of the titanium auxilliary power unit in dock and the cooler dock for these platforms. It's a great win for Ducommun and it will significantly expand our presence with Gulfstream going forward. And these wins come on top of our previously announced supply agreements with both United Technologies and Rolls-Royce. 
So we're very pleased with our increased visibility and content within the entire commercial aerospace arena and we currently have 30 to 40 brand development programs in place. We continue to see plenty of business opportunities Boeing, particularly on the 737 MAX and the 787. And with Airbus on the A320 Neo, A330 Neo and the A350. 
Our focus for the balance of the year will be managing these new startup programs and other new development programs that have initial production revenues for 2016. 
Turning to our non-A&D business. We saw a mixed performance this quarter as a anticipated. With our energy-related end markets, we're down double-digits year-over-year due primarily to the negative impact of the oil market. We saw a modest growth in our industrial end markets and our medical end markets. Again, both versus 2014 and sequentially along with strengthening backlogs. The bottom line though is that we expect the non-A&D areas to remain mixed but stable, likely without much meaningful improvement until 2016. 
As with our military and space markets, we are using this opportunity to assess our facilities for additional rationalization and take increased steps to increase our asset utilization. 
With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Joe for our quarter financial results. Joe?"
267761,306834909,850076,"Ducommun Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Tony, and good day, everyone. We reported net income of $1.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the current quarter compared to net income of $6.6 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2014. I'll get into the details i",2190,"Thank you, Tony, and good day, everyone. We reported net income of $1.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the current quarter compared to net income of $6.6 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2014. I'll get into the details in a moment, but directionally it shows conservative goal improvement from the first quarter's results and also includes certain debt extinguishment expenses incurred related to our new credit agreement, which we finalized during the quarter. 
Net sales for the quarter of 2015 were approximately $175 million, that was 6% down from last year's comparable quarter. As we've reached the revenue decline, it's reflected -- it's reflecting a continuing shift in demand for our products, including a nearly $16 million decrease in military and space sales and approximate $2 million decline in non-aerospace and defense revenue, partially offset by an approximate $6 million increase in commercial aerospace revenue. 
In the military and space sector, we have seen reduced demand for both structural solutions and technology applications, reflecting lower aggregate demand in the government defense spending sector. Within the commercial aerospace arena, by contrast, we continue to experience growing revenues as we benefit from higher airframe build rates and increased content. We expect these mix shift trends to continue throughout the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. Overall, the macro environment reflects softer demand as compared to the historic levels. We have previously indicated that in the first half of 2015 would be a transition period as we work through this makeshift and other short-term issues. 
During the second quarter, we began to see benefits from actively managing this transition and from our efforts to reduce manufacturing expenses. This resulted in a 17.8% gross margin, which although down from last year's 20.2%, the 17.8% gross margin was a significant improvement from the 2015 first quarter's gross margin of 15.5%. We continue to work to address the issues in front of us to return the company to profitability levels of which we're capable. This could include further headcount reductions, lowering of indirect labor costs and improving our manufacturing performance as well as the execution on certain new programs. In addition, we have launched a companywide supply chain improvement process during the quarter and we expect the chain improvement efforts to contribute to enhancing our profitability beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Operating income for the current quarter was approximately $11 million or 6.2% of revenue as compared to approximately $17 million or 9% of revenue in last year's comparable quarter. The actions taken during the quarter are improving operating margins, which are now returning to levels similar to those in the second half of 2014. In addition to the focus on gross margin improvement, we have worked to lower our SG&A expenses, which were 11.6% of revenues in the current second quarter as we continue to right size our overall cost structure. 
The second quarter 2015 pretax results include 2 items on separate lines in our statement of operations, the first being a $2.8 million loss on the extinguishment of debt related to our new credit agreement, which I'll discuss in a bit, and the second, a $1.5 million insurance recovery listed as other income. 
Our effective tax rate during the quarter was nearly 42% compared to 32.6% for the comparable period last year. The higher rate reflects the lower levels of pretax income this year compared to last and the associated limitations on certain deductions. We expect the effective tax rate for the balance of 2015 to average approximately 37% excluding any potential benefit from the federal research and development tax credits. These federal R&D tax credits are gaining traction in Congress for approval and this would benefit us -- it would be a benefit to us in the -- it could be a 2-year or so impact us favorably 2015 and 2016. 
EBITDA was approximately $19 million or 10.8% of revenues in the second quarter of 2015. Our effective working capital execution continued in the quarter, resulting in cash flow from operations of $14 million and for the year-to-date 6 months, $17.6 million versus $15.5 million during the comparable 6-month period of 2014. 
Now reviewing the results by business segment. First, Ducommun AeroStructures or DAS. DAS posted revenues of approximately $76 million for the quarter, down nearly $3 million versus $79 million in the second quarter of 2014. In addition to the previously mentioned sunsetting of 2 long cycle defense programs, we have seen some reductions in revenue across our military helicopter platforms due to lower defense spending. This results to revenue decrease in military and space structural products year-over-year of a total of nearly $8 million. This was partially offset by a $5 million increase in the sales of commercial aerospace structured applications, primarily on the Boeing and Airbus large commercial airframe applications. DAS's operating income was approximately $7 million or 9% of revenues versus operating income of approximately $10 million or 12.8% of revenues for the second quarter of 2014. The negative margin comparison year-over-year was primarily a result of an unfavorable mix shift, higher forward loss reserves, the loss of efficiencies from slightly lower manufacturing volume and lower overall volume, which was partially offset by lower compensation and benefit costs. 
Although still below 2014 results, DAS's operating income improved significantly for the first quarter of 2015 as the benefits of our cost-cutting efforts begin to take effect. We continue to aggressively address our manufacturing efficiency issues and expect sequential improvement in operating margins throughout the second half of 2015. EBITDA was approximately $11 million or $13.8 million -- 13.8% of revenue as compared to nearly $14 million or 17.3% of revenue in the second quarter of 2014. We expect military and space demand to remain soft throughout 2015. 
On the other hand, commercial aerospace orders remained solid with most of the growth coming from existing contracts. Going forward, we expects commercial aerospace demand to continue to rise over the next several years at a 3% to 5% annual rate, which would be accompanied by expansion of margins as we've right sized our cost structure. 
Ducommun LaBarge Technologies results or DLT segment sales for the second quarter decreased 8.5% to approximately $99 million as compared to approximately $108 million in the comparable period last year. The lower revenue reflects the nearly 13% decline in military and space electronics revenue and an almost 30% increase in oil and gas applications. This was due to a modest shift as defense electronics sales fell by $8 million, commercial aerospace electronics grew almost $1 million and non-aerospace and defense revenues declined by nearly $2 million. The decrease in the defense technologies revenue primarily reflects reduced demand for F-15 and F-18 modernizations affecting our radar rack applications and softness in military helicopter demand. Offsetting this trend somewhat, we continue to see slightly higher demand for our missile defense electronics applications. 
The recent market development activities we continue to enjoy increased demand for our commercial aerospace of choice applications with new customers. Going forward, in the DLT segment, we expect to see stabilization in our defense electronics backlog with trends similar to those so we have reported in the last 4 quarters and a dthe solid commercial aerospace backlog. 
In our non-A&D offerings, we have a pronounced decline in demand for energy-related prodcuts, reflecting the adverse impact of the combination of lower oil prices and lower rig accounts. Offsetting this, we are experiencing strong growth in other areas including medical and industrial applications, resulting in higher backlogs in those segments. DLT's operating income for the second quarter 2015 was approximately $8 million or 7.8% of revenue compared to approximately $11 million or 10% of revenue in last year's comparable period. The decrease reflects a loss of efficiencies resulting from lower manufacturing volumes and lower revenue. We continue to reduce operating expenses and are aggressively pursuing additional cost reduction activities, while also expecting our supply chain initiatives to contribute in improving operating margins beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
EBITDA was approximately $12 million in the quarter or 12.2% of revenue compared to approximately $15 million or 13.7% of revenue in last year's comparable period. 
Looking at corporate, general and administrative expenses, they were -- they ran at the rate of $3.7 million for the quarter or 2.1% of revenue and it was a decrease from $4 million or 2.2% of revenue in last year's comparable period, primarily due to lower compensation and benefit expenses. 
Next, looking at our backlog. Overall, at the end of the quarter, backlog tallied $524 million. This equates to essential decrease of $35 million versus the end of 2014, but mostly within the DAS business of related to large commercial airframes. The backlog decline in our DAS commercial aerospace sector reflects the change by our large airframe manufacturing customers in placing their orders with us on a quarterly rather than the traditional annual basis. This is more of a timing difference accounting for about $25 million of the lower commercial aerospace bookings and does not reflect the strong underlying long-term demand transfer of large airframe products. As a result for early backlog, even if we look at it on a long-term programs, tend to be shorter in duration and lower in amounts than was previously the case. 
We continue to work diligently to win additional orders across both our diverse commercial aerospace end markets and defense technology platforms. 
Liquidity and capital resource is very important to us and in the first half of 2015, as I've mentioned, we generated $17.6 million of cash flow from operations, $2.1 million more than the comparable first half of last year. We remain diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect historic seasonal patterns. 
At the end of the quarter, our net to adjusted EBITDA as defined was approximately 3.4:1. Our financial highlight of the quarter involves entering into new 5-year $475 million secured credit facility, which we announced on June 26. The new credit facility consists of a $200 million revolving credit line in the $75 million term loan with mandatory prepayments, both of which mature in June of 2020. With the new credit facility in place prior to quarter end, we refinanced the existing $80 million outstanding term loan that was due in 2017. In Q3, we redeemed all $200 million of senior notes due 2018. 
During the second quarter, we incurred a $2.8 million loss on the extinguishment of debt related to the unamortized deferred financing cost in connection with the prior financing that was retired. On June 29, we issue -- we initiated a call notice for the -- to retire all the $200 million senior notes. As previously announced, this transaction closed on July 27. The notes were redeemed by paying a $9.75 million call premium and we will record an additional $2.1 million loss on the extinguishment of this debt. The total aggregate amount related to retiring the senior notes of approximately $11.9 million will be recorded in the third quarter. 
Upon completion of refinancing on July 27, we now have $275 million outstanding on the term loan and an unused balance on the revolving credit facility resulting in approximately $198 million of liquidity under the new credit agreement. The refinancing resulted in very favorable economics for Ducommun as the initial effective interest rate will be approximately 3.5% per annum compared to the average prior rate of approximately 9% on our old debt. We expect interest savings annually to be approximately $14 million to $15 million as compared to our prior debt. 
We estimate that interest expenses will be approximately $3.5 million for the third quarter, which has a blended interest rates of all debt and new debt and, in the fourth quarter, with all new debt, we estimate interest expenses will be approximately $2.5 million. This compares favorably to the $6.7 million of expenses that we incurred in the second and first quarters of this year. 
We're very pleased with the execution of this new credit agreement and subsequent refinancing as it provides us significantly reduced expenses in greater finance flexibility to pursue strategic objective and, in addition, create shareholder value. 
At this stage, we continue towards our goal of deleveraging to targets of $2.25 million to $2.5 million over the next few years. Capital expenditures year-to-date were $8 million and we expect to spend a total of $15 million in CapEx in 2015, similar to historic levels. 
In closing, we continue to focus on managing the changing mix in our business and work to realize lower manufacturing costs throughout our operations. We also expect to see annualized cost savings of $4 million to $5 million beginning in the fourth quarter through our supply chain initiatives to help drive higher operating margins and higher EBITDA margins. In addition, we remain diligent with regard to expense management and working capital efficiencies, which along with significant and lower interest rates, should generate meaningful free cash flow going forward. 
I like to now turn it back over to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

Before turning the call over for our questions, let me just reiterate that while we accomplished a good deal this quarter, we are by no means done with our performance improvement initiatives. As I mentioned earlier, we've already cut headcount 10% year-over-year and will continue to look at the potential for further reductions while strengthening our operations. We're evaluating our facilities for additional rationalization opportunities and given the current outlook for lower defense spending and reduced demand in certain industrial end markets particularly the oil and gas, we think that we have an opportunity to really take a look at asset utilization that will significantly improve going across the board. 
We have begun to process the rightsizing our operations for a new normal and are on target to achieve our $4 million to $5 million cost savings this year, which should be evident in improved margins sequentially during the second half even with the revenue headwinds previusly discussed. Our supply chain initiatives are also expected to reduce costs beginning in the fourth quarter, leading to improved bottom line results heading into 2016. And our commercial aerospace business remains very robust. And we're looking at our other end markets that we believe are now stable and have stable run rates. 
This continues to be a transition year for Ducommun and as we stated beginning at 2015, we are evaluating the business in all stages to resize the business for our long-term growth and margin expansion. Given current demand dynamics, it is essential that we stay focused on asset utilization across our facilities and our product lines. We intend to update our investors on future calls with reversed our initiatives. 
In the meantime, we continue to make progress towards achieving improved financial results and I'm pleased that we closed our $475 million credit agreement refinancing that will significantly reduce interest expense for Ducommun going forward. This is something that we're very proud of, as Joe indicated, and it improves our financial profile and benefits our shareholders. We are now more nimble and faster moving company than just a few quarters ago and we're transforming Ducommun into an organization that is leaner and able to rapidly adapt to fluctuations in the market.

I'll begin by providing an overview of the quarter, including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino to go over our financial results. 
While facing a slowdown in our military and oil and gas markets but seeing new business growth in our commercial aerospace, we focused on improving bottom line results and streamlining certain operations to ensure that Ducommun is rightsized for the current economic environment. The good news is that we accomplished what we set out to do this quarter, cutting costs and expanding margins while at the same time evaluating our facilities for rationalization opportunities.
In addition, I'm pleased to say that our New York facility consolidation, bringing 3 facilities into 1 newer, more advanced and more efficient manufacturing operation, is on schedule for completion this year. We have also now reduced headcount 10% year-over-year and implemented corporate-wide supply chain initiatives. As a result of these actions and as committed to, we are on track to remove $4 million to $5 million of annualized costs from our operations this year. And it is -- and this is already showing up in our terms of our margin expansion.
So our revenue and income, net of one-time items, were down when compared to last year. We showed vast improvement sequentially versus the first quarter 2015. Commercial aerospace demand remains strong, and our other end markets appear to be stabilizing. Another very important element of our focus this quarter was completing our debt refinancing on schedule. We accomplished this goal at very attractive rates that are expected to save the company an estimated $14 million to $15 million in interest annually. It's a tremendous achievement and one that we are very proud of. 
So we made progress this quarter on improving both our balance sheet and our operational performance. 
Now let me put a little color on our end markets and our products and programs. In the military and space sector, we saw some modest growth across -- versus Q1, but we're still down year-over-year as expected, given the legacy programs we discussed in the past. In fact, you've likely already heard from other government contractors, our defense-related business is down double digits year-to-date, and we're starting to see some the stabilization in terms of run rates across the board, but still anticipate lower revenue in these markets during the second half of 2015. 
Our military backlog in both AeroStructures and Technologies remains just north of $250 million. There's no surprise in this part of the business, but this is an area that remains a core focus in our efforts to rightsize operations, so they're in line with what we call the new normal of lower defense spending. In fact, we're looking at additional streamline initiatives including cost-cutting measures, about which I'll be able to provide more color later on this year. I also wanted to mention a recent industry development with regard to our military and space business, specifically the recently announced deal with Lockheed Martin to purchase Sikorsky from United Technologies. As many of you already know, Sikorsky has been and remains one of our key customers here at Ducommun. 
The Black Hawk is our largest military program, and we have received several prestigious supplier awards from Sikorsky over the past decades. So we now look forward to working with its new owner and believe our relationship with both Sikorsky and Lockheed will continue to strengthen in the years to come. 
Now moving to our commercial aerospace operations. I'm pleased to say that once again, we posted year-over-year revenue growth on the strength of a diverse number of high-profile platforms, such as the Boeing 737, the 777 and the 787 programs. Our commercial aerospace backlog remains solid just under $200 million, and we expect to see this grow over the next 2 quarters with revenue expansion as well during the remainder of 2015. 
We continue to win new content on the new 737 MAX as well as various Airbus aircraft and since May have announced a number of awards in this space, including a contract from Spirit to produce titanium auxiliary power unit, exhaust bearing assemblies housing the tail cone on the 737 MAX. This adds to our content on the MAX platform, which already includes spoilers and other structural assemblies. 
We also announced that the Paris Air Show, a cooperative research agreement with Airbus, under which we will jointly develop applications using Ducommun's full matrix technology and advanced resin transfer molding process, which brings both weight and cost savings into a higher strength assembly. We see this as the beginning of an entirely new chapter within our collaboration with Airbus.
Now last but not least, we also recently announced a multimillion dollar contract with Gulfstream Aerospace to support the upcoming G500 and G600 aircraft, a new family of large cabin long-range business jets. Ducommun will be the sole source supplier of the titanium auxiliary power unit inlet duct and the cooler duct for these platforms. It's a great win for Ducommun, and it will significantly expand our presence with Gulfstream going forward. And these wins come on top of our previously announced supply agreements with both United Technologies and Rolls-Royce.
So we're very pleased with our increased visibility and content within the entire commercial aerospace arena and we currently have 30 to 40 brand new development programs in place. We continue to see plenty of business opportunities with Boeing, particularly on the 737 MAX and the 787. And with Airbus on the A320neo, A330neo and the A350. 
Our focus for the balance of the year will be managing these new startup programs and other new development programs that have initial production revenues for 2016. 
Turning to our non-A&D business. We saw a mixed performance this quarter as a anticipated. With our energy-related end markets, we're down double digits year-over-year, due primarily to the negative impact of the oil market. We saw a modest growth in our industrial end markets and our medical end markets, again, both versus 2014 and sequentially along with strengthening backlogs. The bottom line though always we expect the non-A&D areas to remain mixed but stable likely without much meaningful improvement until 2016.
As with our military and space markets, we are using this opportunity to assess our facilities for additional rationalization and take increased steps to increase our asset utilization. 
With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Joe to go through our financial results. Joe?"

We reported net income of $1.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the current quarter compared to net income of $6.6 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2014. I'll get into the details i",2188,"Thank you, Tony, and good day, everyone. We reported net income of $1.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the current quarter compared to net income of $6.6 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2014. I'll get into the details in a moment, but directionally it shows considerable improvement from the first quarter's results and also includes certain debt extinguishment expenses incurred related to our new credit agreement, which we finalized during the quarter.
Net sales for the quarter of 2015 were approximately $175 million, that was 6% down from last year's comparable quarter. As we've bridged the revenue decline, it's reflected -- it's reflecting a continuing shift in demand for our products, including a nearly $16 million decrease in military and space sales and approximate $2 million decline in nonaerospace and defense revenue, partially offset by an approximate $6 million increase in commercial aerospace revenue. 
In the military and space sector, we have seen reduced demand for both structural solutions and technology applications, reflecting lower aggregate demand in the government defense spending sector. 
Within the commercial aerospace arena, by contrast, we continue to experience growing revenues as we benefit from higher airframe build rates and increased content. We expect these mix shift trends to continue throughout the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. Overall, the macro environment reflects softer demand as compared to historic levels. We have previously indicated that in the first half of 2015 would be a transition period as we work through this mix shift and other short-term issues.
During the second quarter, we began to see benefits from actively managing this transition and from our efforts to reduce manufacturing expenses. This resulted in a 17.8% gross margin, which although down from last year's 20.2%, the 17.8% gross margin was a significant improvement from the 2015 first quarter's gross margin of 15.5%. We continue to work to address the issues in front of us to return the company to profitability levels of which we're capable. This could include further headcount reductions, lowering of indirect labor costs and improving our manufacturing performance as well as the -- our execution on certain new programs. In addition, we have launched a companywide supply chain improvement process during the quarter, and we expect these supply chain improvement efforts to contribute to enhancing our profitability, beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Operating income for the current quarter was approximately $11 million or 6.2% of revenue as compared to approximately $17 million or 9% of revenue in last year's comparable quarter. The actions taken during the quarter are improving operating margins, which are now returning to levels similar to those in the second half of 2014. In addition to the focus on gross margin improvement, we have worked to lower our SG&A expenses, which were 11.6% of revenues in the current second quarter as we continue to rightsize our overall cost structure.
The second quarter 2015 pretax results include 2 items on separate lines in our statement of operations: the first being a $2.8 million loss on the extinguishment of debt related to our new credit agreement, which I'll discuss in a bit; and the second, a $1.5 million insurance recovery listed as other income. 
Our effective tax rate during the quarter was nearly 42% compared to 32.6% for the comparable period last year. The higher rate reflects the lower levels of pretax income this year compared to last and the associated limitations on certain deductions. We expect the effective tax rate for the balance of 2015 to average approximately 37% excluding any potential benefit from the federal research and development tax credit. These federal R&D tax credits are gaining traction in Congress for approval and this would benefit us -- it will be a benefit to us in the -- it could be a 2-year or so impact us favorably in 2015 and 2016. 
EBITDA was approximately $19 million or 10.8% of revenues in the second quarter of 2015. Our effective working capital execution continued in the quarter, resulting in cash flow from operations of $14 million and for the year-to-date 6 months, $17.6 million versus $15.5 million during the comparable 6-month period of 2014. 
Now reviewing the results by business segment. First, Ducommun AeroStructures or DAS. DAS posted revenues of approximately $76 million for the quarter, down nearly $3 million versus $79 million in the second quarter of 2014. In addition to the previously mentioned sunsetting of 2 long cycle defense programs, we have seen some reductions in revenue across our military helicopter platforms due to lower defense spending. This resulted in revenue decrease in military and space structural products year-over-year of total of nearly $8 million. This was partially offset by a $5 million increase in the sales of commercial aerospace structured applications, primarily on the Boeing and Airbus large commercial airframe applications. DAS' operating income was approximately $7 million or 9% of revenues versus operating income of approximately $10 million or 12.8% of revenues for the second quarter of 2014. The negative margin comparison year-over-year was primarily a result of an unfavorable mix shift, higher forward loss reserves, the loss of efficiencies from slightly lower manufacturing volume and lower overall volume, which was partially offset by lower compensation and benefit costs. 
Although still below 2014 results, DAS' operating income improved significantly from the first quarter of 2015 as the benefits of our cost-cutting efforts begin to take effect. We continue to aggressively address our manufacturing efficiency issues and expect sequential improvement in operating margins throughout the second half of 2015. 
EBITDA was approximately $11 million or $13.8 million -- 13.8% of revenue as compared to nearly $14 million or 17.3% of revenue in the second quarter of 2014. We expect military and space demand to remain soft throughout 2015. 
On the other hand, commercial aerospace orders remained solid with most of the growth coming from existing contracts. Going forward, we expect commercial aerospace demand to continue to rise over the next several years at a 3% to 5% annual rate, which would be accompanied by expansion of margins as we rightsized our cost structure. 
Ducommun LaBarge Technologies results or DLT.  Segment sales for the second quarter decreased 8.5% to approximately $99 million as compared to approximately $108 million in the comparable period last year. The lower revenue reflects the nearly 13% decline in military and space electronics revenue and an almost 30% increase in oil and gas applications. This was due to a modest shift as defense electronics sales fell by $8 million, commercial aerospace electronics grew almost $1 million and nonaerospace and defense revenues declined by nearly $2 million. The decrease in the defense technologies revenue primarily reflects reduced demand for F-15 and F-18 modernizations affecting our radar rack applications and softness in military helicopter demand. Offsetting this trend somewhat, we continue to see slightly higher demand for our missile defense electronics applications. 
The recent market development activities we continue to enjoy increased demand for our commercial aerospace electronics applications with new customers. Going forward, in the DLT segment, we expect to see stabilization in our defense electronics backlog with trends similar to those that we have reported in the last 4 quarters and a solid commercial aerospace backlog. 
In our non-A&D offerings, we have a pronounced decline in demand for energy-related products, reflecting the adverse impact of the combination of lower oil prices and lower rig accounts. Offsetting this, we are experiencing strong growth in other areas including medical and industrial applications, resulting in higher backlogs in those segments. DLT's operating income for the second quarter 2015 was approximately $8 million or 7.8% of revenue compared to approximately $11 million or 10% of revenue in last year's comparable period. The decrease reflects a loss of efficiencies resulting from lower manufacturing volumes and lower revenue. We continue to reduce operating expenses and are aggressively pursuing additional cost reduction activities while also expecting our supply chain initiatives to contribute in improving operating margins beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
EBITDA was approximately $12 million in the quarter or 12.2% of revenue compared to approximately $15 million or 13.7% of revenue in last year's comparable period. 
Looking at corporate, general and administrative expenses, they were -- they ran at the rate of $3.7 million for the quarter or 2.1% of revenue and it was a decrease from $4 million or 2.2% of revenue in last year's comparable period, primarily due to lower compensation and benefit expenses. 
Next looking at our backlog. Overall, at the end of the quarter, backlog tallied $524 million. This equates to essential decrease of $35 million versus the end of 2014, but it's mostly within the DAS business segment related to large commercial airframes. The backlog decline in our DAS commercial aerospace sector reflects the change by our large airframe manufacturing customers in placing their orders with us on a quarterly rather than our traditional annual basis. This is more of a timing difference accounting for about $25 million of the lower commercial aerospace bookings and does not reflect strong underlying long-term demand transfer of large airframe products. As a result for early backlog, even if we look at on long-term programs tend to be shorter in duration and lower in amounts than was previously the case. 
We continue to work diligently to win additional orders across both our diverse commercial aerospace end markets and defense technology platforms. 
Liquidity and capital resource is very important to us and in the first half of 2015, as I mentioned, we generated $17.6 million of cash flow from operations, $2.1 million more than the comparable first half of last year. We remain diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect historic seasonal patterns. 
At the end of the quarter, our net to adjusted EBITDA as defined was approximately 3.4:1. Our financial highlight of the quarter involved entering into new 5-year $475 million secured credit facility, which we announced on June 26. The new credit facility consists of a $200 million revolving credit line and the $275 million term loan with mandatory prepayments, both of which mature in June of 2020. With the new credit facility in place prior to quarter end, we refinanced the existing $80 million outstanding term loan that was due in 2017. In Q3, we redeemed all $200 million of senior notes due 2018.
During the second quarter, we incurred a $2.8 million loss on the extinguishment of debt related to the unamortized deferred financing cost in connection with the prior financing that was retired. On June 29, we issue -- we initiated a call notice for the -- to retire all the $200 million senior notes. As previously announced, this transaction closed on July 27. The notes were redeemed by paying a $9.75 million call premium, and we recorded an additional $2.1 million loss on the extinguishment of this debt. The total aggregate amount related to retiring the senior notes of approximately $11.9 million will be recorded in the third quarter. 
Upon completion of the refinancing on July 27, we now have $275 million outstanding on the term loan and an unused balance on the revolving credit facility resulting in approximately $198 million of liquidity under the new credit agreement. The refinancing resulted in very favorable economics for Ducommun as the initial effective interest rate will be approximately 3.5% per annum compared to the average prior rate of approximately 9% on our old debt. We expect interest savings annually to be approximately $14 million to $15 million as compared to our prior debt. 
We estimate that interest expenses will be approximately $3.5 million for the third quarter, which has a blended interest rates of all debt and new debt, and in the fourth quarter, with all new debt, we estimate interest expenses will be approximately $2.5 million. This compares favorably to the $6.7 million of expenses that we incurred in the second and first quarters of this year. 
We are very pleased with the execution of this new credit agreement and subsequent refinancing as it provides us significantly reduced expenses and greater financial flexibility to pursue strategic objective and in addition, create shareholder value. 
At this stage, we continue towards our goal of deleveraging to targets of $2.25 million to $2.5 million over the next few years. Capital expenditures were -- year-to-date were $8 million and we expect to spend a total of $15 million in CapEx in 2015, similar to historic levels. 
In closing, we continue to focus on managing the changing mix in our business and work to realize lower manufacturing costs throughout our operations. We also expect to see annualized cost savings of $4 million to $5 million beginning in the fourth quarter through our supply chain initiatives to help drive higher operating margins and higher EBITDA margins. In addition, we remain diligent with regard to expense management and working capital efficiencies, which along with significantly lower interest rates, should generate meaningful free cash flow going forward.
I like to now turn it back over to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

Before turning the call over for our questions, let me just reiterate that while we accomplished a good deal this quarter, we are by no means done with our performance improvement initiatives. As I mentioned earlier, we've already cut headcount 10% year-over-year and will continue to look at the potential for further reductions while strengthening our operations. We're evaluating our facilities for additional rationalization opportunities and given the current outlook for lower defense spending and reduced demand in certain industrial end markets, particularly the oil and gas, we think that we have an opportunity to really take a look at asset utilization that will significantly improve going across the board. 
We've begun the process of rightsizing our operations for a new normal and are on target to achieve our $4 million to $5 million cost savings this year, which should be evident in improved margins sequentially during the second half even with the revenue headwinds previously discussed. Our supply chain initiatives are also expected to reduce costs beginning in the fourth quarter leading to improved bottom line results heading into 2016. And our commercial aerospace business remains very robust, and we're looking at our other end markets that we believe are now stable and had stable run rates. 
This continues to be a transition year for Ducommun and as we stated beginning at 2015, we are evaluating the business in all stages to resize the business for our long-term growth and margin expansion. Given current demand dynamics, it is essential that we stay focused on asset utilization across our facilities and our product lines. We intend to update our investors on future calls with regards to our initiatives. 
In the meantime, we continue to make progress towards achieving improved financial results, and I'm pleased that we closed our $475 million credit agreement refinancing that will significantly reduce interest expense for Ducommun going forward. This is something that we're very proud of, as Joe indicated, and it improves our financial profile and benefits our shareholders. We are now more nimble and faster moving company than just a few quarters ago, and we're transforming Ducommun into an organization that is leaner and able to rapidly adapt to fluctuations in the market. Over time, this will lead to more consistent results, increased customer satisfaction and we believe we are going to be delivering higher returns to our shareholders. 
With that, Chris, I will turn the call over to questions."

But as you look at it, you're looking at what's it going to cost, it's a complete this and then we'll take a reserve to cover all the costs that will overrun the program, if you will, and try to take that out to the completion of the contracts so that -- or over the development contract, if you will, so that we cover the cost and then we don't revisit that. So with the number of development programs you [indiscernible] here that the -- there's some opportunities in the preproduction phases that we look at.

I'll begin by providing an overview of the quarter, including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino to go over our financial results. 
While facing a slowdown in our military and oil and gas markets but seeing new business growth in our commercial aerospace, we focused on improving bottom line results and streamlining certain operations to ensure that Ducommun is rightsized for the current economic environment. The good news is that we accomplished what we set out to do this quarter, cutting costs and expanding margins while at the same time evaluating our facilities for rationalization opportunities.
In addition, I'm pleased to say that our New York facility consolidation, bringing 3 facilities into 1 newer, more advanced and more efficient manufacturing operation, is on schedule for completion this year. We have also now reduced headcount 10% year-over-year and implemented corporate-wide supply chain initiatives. As a result of these actions and as committed to, we are on track to remove $4 million to $5 million of annualized costs from our operations this year. And it is -- and this is already showing up in our terms of our margin expansion.
So our revenue and income, net of one-time items, were down when compared to last year. We showed vast improvement sequentially versus the first quarter 2015. Commercial aerospace demand remains strong, and our other end markets appear to be stabilizing. Another very important element of our focus this quarter was completing our debt refinancing on schedule. We accomplished this goal at very attractive rates that are expected to save the company an estimated $14 million to $15 million in interest annually. It's a tremendous achievement and one that we are very proud of. 
So we made progress this quarter on improving both our balance sheet and our operational performance. 
Now let me put a little color on our end markets and our products and programs. In the military and space sector, we saw some modest growth across -- versus Q1, but we're still down year-over-year as expected, given the legacy programs we discussed in the past. In fact, you've likely already heard from other government contractors, our defense-related business is down double digits year-to-date, and we're starting to see some stabilization in terms of run rates across the board, but still anticipate lower revenue in these markets during the second half of 2015. 
Our military backlog in both AeroStructures and Technologies remains just north of $250 million. There's no surprise in this part of the business, but this is an area that remains a core focus in our efforts to rightsize operations, so they're in line with what we call the new normal of lower defense spending. In fact, we're looking at additional streamline initiatives including cost-cutting measures, about which I'll be able to provide more color later on this year. I also wanted to mention a recent industry development with regard to our military and space business, specifically the recently announced deal with Lockheed Martin to purchase Sikorsky from United Technologies. As many of you already know, Sikorsky has been and remains one of our key customers here at Ducommun. 
The Black Hawk is our largest military program, and we have received several prestigious supplier awards from Sikorsky over the past decades. So we now look forward to working with its new owner and believe our relationship with both Sikorsky and Lockheed will continue to strengthen in the years to come. 
Now moving to our commercial aerospace operations. I'm pleased to say that once again, we posted year-over-year revenue growth on the strength of a diverse number of high-profile platforms, such as the Boeing 737, the 777 and the 787 programs. Our commercial aerospace backlog remains solid just under $200 million, and we expect to see this grow over the next 2 quarters with revenue expansion as well during the remainder of 2015. 
We continue to win new content on the new 737 MAX as well as various Airbus aircraft and since May have announced a number of awards in this space, including a contract from Spirit to produce titanium auxiliary power unit, exhaust bearing assemblies housing the tail cone on the 737 MAX. This adds to our content on the MAX platform, which already includes spoilers and other structural assemblies. 
We also announced at the Paris Air Show, a cooperative research agreement with Airbus, under which we will jointly develop applications using Ducommun's full matrix technology and advanced resin transfer molding process, which brings both weight and cost savings into a higher strength assembly. We see this as the beginning of an entirely new chapter within our collaboration with Airbus.
Now last but not least, we also recently announced a multimillion dollar contract with Gulfstream Aerospace to support the upcoming G500 and G600 aircraft, a new family of large cabin long-range business jets. Ducommun will be the sole source supplier of the titanium auxiliary power unit inlet duct and the cooler duct for these platforms. It's a great win for Ducommun, and it will significantly expand our presence with Gulfstream going forward. And these wins come on top of our previously announced supply agreements with both United Technologies and Rolls-Royce.
So we're very pleased with our increased visibility and content within the entire commercial aerospace arena and we currently have 30 to 40 brand new development programs in place. We continue to see plenty of business opportunities with Boeing, particularly on the 737 MAX and the 787. And with Airbus on the A320neo, A330neo and the A350. 
Our focus for the balance of the year will be managing these new startup programs and other new development programs that have initial production revenues for 2016. 
Turning to our non-A&D business. We saw a mixed performance this quarter as a anticipated. With our energy-related end markets, we're down double digits year-over-year, due primarily to the negative impact of the oil market. We saw a modest growth in our industrial end markets and our medical end markets, again, both versus 2014 and sequentially along with strengthening backlogs. The bottom line though always we expect the non-A&D areas to remain mixed but stable likely without much meaningful improvement until 2016.
As with our military and space markets, we are using this opportunity to assess our facilities for additional rationalization and take increased steps to increase our asset utilization. 
With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Joe to go through our financial results. Joe?"
267761,306834909,850352,"Ducommun Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Tony, and good day, everyone. We reported net income of $1.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the current quarter compared to net income of $6.6 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2014. I'll get into the details i",2187,"Thank you, Tony, and good day, everyone. We reported net income of $1.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the current quarter compared to net income of $6.6 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2014. I'll get into the details in a moment, but directionally it shows considerable improvement from the first quarter's results and also includes certain debt extinguishment expenses incurred related to our new credit agreement, which we finalized during the quarter.
Net sales for the quarter of 2015 were approximately $175 million, that was 6% down from last year's comparable quarter. As we've bridged the revenue decline, it's reflected -- it's reflecting a continuing shift in demand for our products, including a nearly $16 million decrease in military and space sales and approximate $2 million decline in nonaerospace and defense revenue, partially offset by an approximate $6 million increase in commercial aerospace revenue. 
In the military and space sector, we have seen reduced demand for both structural solutions and technology applications, reflecting lower aggregate demand in the government defense spending sector. 
Within the commercial aerospace arena, by contrast, we continue to experience growing revenues as we benefit from higher airframe build rates and increased content. We expect these mix shift trends to continue throughout the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. Overall, the macro environment reflects softer demand as compared to historic levels. We have previously indicated that in the first half of 2015 would be a transition period as we work through this mix shift and other short-term issues.
During the second quarter, we began to see benefits from actively managing this transition and from our efforts to reduce manufacturing expenses. This resulted in a 17.8% gross margin, which although down from last year's 20.2%, the 17.8% gross margin was a significant improvement from the 2015 first quarter's gross margin of 15.5%. We continue to work to address the issues in front of us to return the company to profitability levels of which we're capable. This could include further headcount reductions, lowering of indirect labor costs and improving our manufacturing performance as well as the -- our execution on certain new programs. In addition, we have launched a companywide supply chain improvement process during the quarter, and we expect these supply chain improvement efforts to contribute to enhancing our profitability, beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Operating income for the current quarter was approximately $11 million or 6.2% of revenue as compared to approximately $17 million or 9% of revenue in last year's comparable quarter. The actions taken during the quarter are improving operating margins, which are now returning to levels similar to those in the second half of 2014. In addition to the focus on gross margin improvement, we have worked to lower our SG&A expenses, which were 11.6% of revenues in the current second quarter as we continue to rightsize our overall cost structure.
The second quarter 2015 pretax results include 2 items on separate lines in our statement of operations: the first being a $2.8 million loss on the extinguishment of debt related to our new credit agreement, which I'll discuss in a bit; and the second, a $1.5 million insurance recovery listed as other income. 
Our effective tax rate during the quarter was nearly 42% compared to 32.6% for the comparable period last year. The higher rate reflects the lower levels of pretax income this year compared to last and the associated limitations on certain deductions. We expect the effective tax rate for the balance of 2015 to average approximately 37% excluding any potential benefit from the federal research and development tax credit. These federal R&D tax credits are gaining traction in Congress for approval and this would benefit us -- it will be a benefit to us in the -- it could be a 2-year or so impact us favorably in 2015 and 2016. 
EBITDA was approximately $19 million or 10.8% of revenues in the second quarter of 2015. Our effective working capital execution continued in the quarter, resulting in cash flow from operations of $14 million and for the year-to-date 6 months, $17.6 million versus $15.5 million during the comparable 6-month period of 2014. 
Now reviewing the results by business segment. First, Ducommun AeroStructures or DAS. DAS posted revenues of approximately $76 million for the quarter, down nearly $3 million versus $79 million in the second quarter of 2014. In addition to the previously mentioned sunsetting of 2 long cycle defense programs, we have seen some reductions in revenue across our military helicopter platforms due to lower defense spending. This resulted in revenue decrease in military and space structural products year-over-year of total of nearly $8 million. This was partially offset by a $5 million increase in the sales of commercial aerospace structured applications, primarily on the Boeing and Airbus large commercial airframe applications. DAS' operating income was approximately $7 million or 9% of revenues versus operating income of approximately $10 million or 12.8% of revenues for the second quarter of 2014. The negative margin comparison year-over-year was primarily a result of an unfavorable mix shift, higher forward loss reserves, the loss of efficiencies from slightly lower manufacturing volume and lower overall volume, which was partially offset by lower compensation and benefit costs. 
Although still below 2014 results, DAS' operating income improved significantly from the first quarter of 2015 as the benefits of our cost-cutting efforts begin to take effect. We continue to aggressively address our manufacturing efficiency issues and expect sequential improvement in operating margins throughout the second half of 2015. 
EBITDA was approximately $11 million or $13.8 million -- 13.8% of revenue as compared to nearly $14 million or 17.3% of revenue in the second quarter of 2014. We expect military and space demand to remain soft throughout 2015. 
On the other hand, commercial aerospace orders remained solid with most of the growth coming from existing contracts. Going forward, we expect commercial aerospace demand to continue to rise over the next several years at a 3% to 5% annual rate, which would be accompanied by expansion of margins as we rightsized our cost structure. 
Ducommun LaBarge Technologies results or DLT.  Segment sales for the second quarter decreased 8.5% to approximately $99 million as compared to approximately $108 million in the comparable period last year. The lower revenue reflects the nearly 13% decline in military and space electronics revenue and an almost 30% increase in oil and gas applications. This was due to a modest shift as defense electronics sales fell by $8 million, commercial aerospace electronics grew almost $1 million and nonaerospace and defense revenues declined by nearly $2 million. The decrease in the defense technologies revenue primarily reflects reduced demand for F-15 and F-18 modernizations affecting our radar rack applications and softness in military helicopter demand. Offsetting this trend somewhat, we continue to see slightly higher demand for our missile defense electronics applications. 
The recent market development activities we continue to enjoy increased demand for our commercial aerospace electronics applications with new customers. Going forward, in the DLT segment, we expect to see stabilization in our defense electronics backlog with trends similar to those that we have reported in the last 4 quarters and a solid commercial aerospace backlog. 
In our non-A&D offerings, we have a pronounced decline in demand for energy-related products, reflecting the adverse impact of the combination of lower oil prices and lower rig accounts. Offsetting this, we are experiencing strong growth in other areas including medical and industrial applications, resulting in higher backlogs in those segments. DLT's operating income for the second quarter 2015 was approximately $8 million or 7.8% of revenue compared to approximately $11 million or 10% of revenue in last year's comparable period. The decrease reflects a loss of efficiencies resulting from lower manufacturing volumes and lower revenue. We continue to reduce operating expenses and are aggressively pursuing additional cost reduction activities while also expecting our supply chain initiatives to contribute in improving operating margins beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
EBITDA was approximately $12 million in the quarter or 12.2% of revenue compared to approximately $15 million or 13.7% of revenue in last year's comparable period. 
Looking at corporate, general and administrative expenses, they were -- they ran at the rate of $3.7 million for the quarter or 2.1% of revenue and it was a decrease from $4 million or 2.2% of revenue in last year's comparable period, primarily due to lower compensation and benefit expenses. 
Next looking at our backlog. Overall, at the end of the quarter, backlog tallied $524 million. This equates to essential decrease of $35 million versus the end of 2014, but it's mostly within the DAS business segment related to large commercial airframes. The backlog decline in our DAS commercial aerospace sector reflects the change by our large airframe manufacturing customers in placing their orders with us on a quarterly rather than our traditional annual basis. This is more of a timing difference accounting for about $25 million of the lower commercial aerospace bookings and does not reflect strong underlying long-term demand trends for large airframe products. As a result, quarterly backlog, even if we look at on long-term programs tend to be shorter in duration and lower in amounts than was previously the case. 
We continue to work diligently to win additional orders across both our diverse commercial aerospace end markets and defense technology platforms. 
Liquidity and capital resource is very important to us and in the first half of 2015, as I mentioned, we generated $17.6 million of cash flow from operations, $2.1 million more than the comparable first half of last year. We remain diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect historic seasonal patterns. 
At the end of the quarter, our net to adjusted EBITDA as defined was approximately 3.4:1. Our financial highlight of the quarter involved entering into new 5-year $475 million secured credit facility, which we announced on June 26. The new credit facility consists of a $200 million revolving credit line and the $275 million term loan with mandatory prepayments, both of which mature in June of 2020. With the new credit facility in place prior to quarter end, we refinanced the existing $80 million outstanding term loan that was due in 2017. In Q3, we redeemed all $200 million of senior notes due 2018.
During the second quarter, we incurred a $2.8 million loss on the extinguishment of debt related to the unamortized deferred financing cost in connection with the prior financing that was retired. On June 29, we issue -- we initiated a call notice for the -- to retire all the $200 million senior notes. As previously announced, this transaction closed on July 27. The notes were redeemed by paying a $9.75 million call premium, and we recorded an additional $2.1 million loss on the extinguishment of this debt. The total aggregate amount related to retiring the senior notes of approximately $11.9 million will be recorded in the third quarter. 
Upon completion of the refinancing on July 27, we now have $275 million outstanding on the term loan and an unused balance on the revolving credit facility resulting in approximately $198 million of liquidity under the new credit agreement. The refinancing resulted in very favorable economics for Ducommun as the initial effective interest rate will be approximately 3.5% per annum compared to the average prior rate of approximately 9% on our old debt. We expect interest savings annually to be approximately $14 million to $15 million as compared to our prior debt. 
We estimate that interest expenses will be approximately $3.5 million for the third quarter, which has a blended interest rates of old debt and new debt, and in the fourth quarter, with all new debt, we estimate interest expenses will be approximately $2.5 million. This compares favorably to the $6.7 million of expenses that we incurred in the second and first quarters of this year. 
We are very pleased with the execution of this new credit agreement and subsequent refinancing as it provides us significantly reduced expenses and greater financial flexibility to pursue strategic objective and in addition, create shareholder value. 
At this stage, we continue towards our goal of deleveraging to targets of $2.25 million to $2.5 million over the next few years. Capital expenditures were -- year-to-date were $8 million and we expect to spend a total of $15 million in CapEx in 2015, similar to historic levels. 
In closing, we continue to focus on managing the changing mix in our business and work to realize lower manufacturing costs throughout our operations. We also expect to see annualized cost savings of $4 million to $5 million beginning in the fourth quarter through our supply chain initiatives to help drive higher operating margins and higher EBITDA margins. In addition, we remain diligent with regard to expense management and working capital efficiencies, which along with significantly lower interest rates, should generate meaningful free cash flow going forward.
I like to now turn it back over to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

Before turning the call over for our questions, let me just reiterate that while we accomplished a good deal this quarter, we are by no means done with our performance improvement initiatives. As I mentioned earlier, we've already cut headcount 10% year-over-year and will continue to look at the potential for further reductions while strengthening our operations. We're evaluating our facilities for additional rationalization opportunities and given the current outlook for lower defense spending and reduced demand in certain industrial end markets, particularly the oil and gas, we think that we have an opportunity to really take a look at asset utilization that will significantly improve going across the board. 
We've begun the process of rightsizing our operations for a new normal and are on target to achieve our $4 million to $5 million cost savings this year, which should be evident in improved margins sequentially during the second half even with the revenue headwinds previously discussed. Our supply chain initiatives are also expected to reduce costs beginning in the fourth quarter leading to improved bottom line results heading into 2016. And our commercial aerospace business remains very robust, and we're looking at our other end markets that we believe are now stable and have stable run rates. 
This continues to be a transition year for Ducommun and as we stated beginning at 2015, we are evaluating the business in all stages to resize the business for our long-term growth and margin expansion. Given current demand dynamics, it is essential that we stay focused on asset utilization across our facilities and our product lines. We intend to update our investors on future calls with regards to our initiatives. 
In the meantime, we continue to make progress towards achieving improved financial results, and I'm pleased that we closed our $475 million credit agreement refinancing that will significantly reduce interest expense for Ducommun going forward. This is something that we're very proud of, as Joe indicated, and it improves our financial profile and benefits our shareholders. We are now more nimble and faster moving company than just a few quarters ago, and we're transforming Ducommun into an organization that is leaner and able to rapidly adapt to fluctuations in the market. Over time, this will lead to more consistent results, increased customer satisfaction and we believe we are going to be delivering higher returns to our shareholders.

267761,314056497,892551,"Ducommun Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Today, Chris, and thank you, everyone for joining us today for our fiscal third quarter conference call. I'll begin by providing an overview of the quarter, including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino to go through the",1331,"Today, Chris, and thank you, everyone for joining us today for our fiscal third quarter conference call. I'll begin by providing an overview of the quarter, including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino to go through the financial results in detail.
Let me start by acknowledging that we had several onetime charges this quarter which were preannounced,  amounting to some $22.7 million on a pretax basis. Nearly $12 million of this was related to the previously discussed extinguishment of our debt and the implementation of the new credit facilities, which will save the company around $15 million annually going forward.
But the other cost bear some further discussion. We booked a $10 million charge within our AeroStructures unit related to estimated cost overruns for the remainder contract period of the regional jet program. This is a program that has been problematic for quite some time and was aggressively bid originally.
While we remain in discussions with our customers about potential price adjustments, we're not optimistic that such negotiations will make this program profitable. So we're taking this charge even as we continue our discussions and we'll proceed through the contracted period, which is approximately one year. This is obviously a major disappointment.
We also booked a restructuring charge of approximately $800,000 related to the closure of 2 facilities over the coming months. The first being a small administrative office in St. Louis, and the second plant in Houston that primarily served the company's oil and gas market. Both locations are within the Ducommun and LaBarge Technologies units. We expect these closures and related organizational realignment to result in cost-benefit that should save the company $2 million to $3 million annually when fully implemented.
The Houston plant will cease operations at the end of October, and was closed because it was not seen as being core to our business operations. The St. Louis facility closure will be completed in the first quarter of 2016.
Turning to our results. We experienced a significant drop in sales this period both the year-over-year and sequentially from the second quarter. Revenue was $162 million, reflecting a 27% year-over-year decrease in sales within our military and space and use markets.
This is a recurring theme that impacted nearly every platform we serve. The military decline in corporates canceled programs, lower demand and schedule slides, which results in a larger than expected drops particularly across certain defense-related helicopter platforms.
We were unable to offset such shortfalls with the growth of our commercial aerospace markets, which remains robust, but will not see significant increases in the sales until late 2016. The good news is that our backlog for the company has rebounded to the best level this year over $550 million due to strong commercial aerospace bookings in both the structures and electronics businesses.
We have more work to do as we prepare to emerge in this challenging period. We previously announced the headcount reductions and streamlining actions and supply chain initiatives that were to move $4 million to $5 million of annualized costs from our operations over and above the additional $2 million to $3 million I just mentioned.
So we have total budgets of some $6 million to $8 million in cost reductions for the company with more work to be done in the fourth quarter. We're on schedule for the consolidation of our 3 upstate New York facilities this year, resulting in a state-of-the-art advanced titanium products manufacturing center. We expect to see efficiencies from this facility improving DAS margins in 2016.
We continue to assess every aspect of our organization for cost reductions, consolidation opportunities and working capital improvements, and this means that we're also evaluating our product portfolio to determine what areas of our business are noncore, low-margin, low growth or otherwise not seen in keeping with what we see as a future for Ducommun.
With sales being adversely impacted by the military slowdown, now it's clearly the time to rightsize our company and make it stronger, leaner and more nimble. Obviously, we'll keep our shareholders appraise of any additional actions we deem more going forward. 
Now I'll provide some market color for you on products and programs.
In the military and space sector, in the current environment, with lower overseas, general budget curtailments and shifting spending priorities has impacted both our fixed wing and our helicopter platforms across the board. Some of our longest-serving programs were down significantly this quarter compared to 2014. And the underlying reality is that such conditions are likely to continue to exist in the next year. We believe that current levels are our baseline for us, and we are not optimistic that near-term growth opportunities given the current defense spending moving forward. This is why we're undertaking an across-the-board look at our facilities and product portfolio. Nothing is being spared in our assessment of any ways to improve our performance for other areas for consolidation. In the meantime, we remain cautiously optimistic about the recently passed budget deal in Washington. We hope that this long-term agreement will bring some stability to the defense industry and presumably lead to possible procurements of upgrades and replacements for the many key aircraft platforms we serve. But this is clearly too early to have any clear picture in this regard.
Now we move to our commercial aerospace operations. Revenue this quarter was essentially flat year-over-year, primarily due to shipment timing as well as continued weakness in our commercial helicopter business. But we remain upbeat about our overall commercial aerospace operations. We're on track to post our highest annual revenue in this year. Our total company backlog, as I mentioned earlier,  has rebounded to the best point in 2015 due to stronger commercial bookings and our backlog here now stands at over $250 million. This reflects solid orders across many of our large platforms, including the Boeing 737, the 777 and the 787 programs as well as the A320 and various other Airbus programs. We continue to win additional content on these and other platforms, and believe the company remains in solid shape for further growth going forward. 
We have strong and growing relationships with Boeing, Spirit, Airbus, Gulf Stream, Rolls-Royce, United Technologies and others. And we have over 30 new development programs in place, much of which we expect to benefit from the top line starting late next year and into 2017.
In the interim, we will pursue additional opportunities to leverage our expense, structure and electronics capabilities in this marketplace. 
Turning to our non-A&D business, we again saw a mixed performance this quarter with continued weakness in our energy markets, somewhat offset by stability within areas such as the industrial and medical fields. As I mentioned previously, we'll exit a large portion of the commodity energy business when we close our Houston facility. However, we still see opportunities for growth in this marketplace even given current market conditions. 
Our non-A&D backlog stands of around $63 million as we target new business for this sector. We're also looking at additional cost reductions and consolidation opportunities as well as possible portfolio considerations.
Now I'll be turning the call over to Joe. Let me just mentioned that this is his last earnings call with us, as he's retiring at the end of 2015. I want to commend Joe for all he's done for Ducommun this past 7 years. He truly has been an inspiration and an asset to the company as well as a personal friend. He's been instrumental in the completion of 2 acquisitions, 3 debt refinancings, which have been critical to strengthen our overall financial position. He is very well-respected by everyone here as well as our investors, and we certainly wish him the best going forward. I will introduce his replacement, our current Chief Accounting Officer, Doug Groves next quarter, but we're all very pleased with the company's careful executed financial succession plan. 
Now I like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?"

Looking at the third quarter 2015 results, earlier today, we reported a net loss of $9.5 million or $0.86 per share for the current quarter. This compares to net income of $2.9 millio",1938,"Thank you, Tony, and good day, everyone, and thanks for the kind words. Looking at the third quarter 2015 results, earlier today, we reported a net loss of $9.5 million or $0.86 per share for the current quarter. This compares to net income of $2.9 million or $0.26 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2014. I'll get into the details in a moment, but as Tony mentioned, this reflects a pretax charge of $22.7 million, which is $1.28 per share on an after-tax basis and includes the following pretax charges: The recording of a $10 million forward loss reserve on a regional jet program; a $0.8 million restructuring charge; and an $11.9 million charge for debt extinguishment expenses incurred relative to our new debt structure, which we finalized during here in the third quarter. 
Net sales for the third quarter of 2015 were approximately $162 million, that's roughly 14% lower than the comparable period in 2014. The revenue decline reflected a $26 million decrease in military and space revenues. In this area, we have seen reduced demand for both structural solutions and technology applications. This reflects lower aggregate government defense curtailments and shifting spending priorities.
Within the commercial aerospace arena by contrast, which was up slightly year-over-year, we continue to experience solid revenues as we benefit from the sustainable large commercial airframe build rates and increased content. During the quarter, we experienced significant growth in our commercial aerospace bookings, both in the structural and electronics solutions, largely contributing to our total backlog at quarter end being nearly identical to year end 2014.
We expect the current macro environment to be similar over the next few quarters. We had previously indicated that 2015 would be a transition year as we work through the decline in demand with our military and space end-use markets, streamlining operations, realizing supply chain efficiencies and cut costs to strengthen the company.
Excluding the forward loss reserve, our adjusted gross margins were 18.6% as compared to 17.6% in last year's comparable quarter, as we realize the benefits from actively managing this transition and from efforts to improve product mix, eliminate lower-margin products and reduce manufacturing expenses.
As we continue with profit improvement initiatives, we expect to sustain or potentially improve these gross margin levels. 
We remain committed to addressing the issues in front of us and to return the company to profitability levels in which we're capable. This means further headcount reductions, lowering of indirect labor costs, improving our manufacturing performance and effective execution on certain new programs. 
As Tony summarized, we have a total target of some $6 million to $8 million in cost reductions for the company with additional work underway. Our cost-cutting activities will continue as we remain committed to improving financial results in the fourth quarter of 2015 and beyond. We expect our New York facility consolidation project to be completed in the next few months. As a result of this move and other restructuring actions in progress, we expect to take an additional $1.7 million to $2 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter.
Ducommun's operating loss for the current quarter was approximately $1 million as compared to operating income of approximately $10 million in the third quarter of 2014. Excluding the $10 million forward loss reserve and a $0.8 million restructuring expenses, which did totaled $10.8 million, the current quarter operating income would be $9.6 million or 6% of revenues as compared to 5.3% of revenues in last year's third quarter. We are now seeing the benefits of the completion of our refinancing midyear, and with the new debt structure, interest expense is $3.4 million or 2% of revenue as compared to $7 million or 3.7% of revenue in last year's third quarter. We estimate interest expenses will be approximately $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Our effective income tax benefit during the quarter was 42.1% compared to 37.4% effective income tax rate for the comparable period last year. The higher rate reflects the pretax loss this year compared to pretax income in 2014. We expect the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 to average approximately 37%, excluding any potential benefit from the federal research and development tax credits. There is traction in Congress for approval of these credits for 2015 and 2016, which would be an additional benefit to us.
EBITDA was $5.5 million or 3.4% of revenue in the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the forward loss reserve and restructuring expenses, EBITDA would have been approximately $16 million or 10% of revenues as compared to $18.4 million or 9.8% of revenues in the third quarter of 2014.
Now looking at the individual business segments starting first with Ducommun AeroStructures or DAS, our Ducommun AeroStructures posted revenues of approximately $64 million for the quarter compared to $81.4 million in the third quarter of 2014. The lower revenue was primarily due to reductions in demand for our military helicopter applications, coincident with lower defense spending levels and sunsetting of 2 long cycle defense programs. Our commercial aerospace structural applications remain at record levels, while up just slightly year-over-year, they reflect certain timing differences regarding shipments.
We continue to meet the delivery requirements of the large commercial airfreight manufacturers, primarily Airbus and Boeing, and we are positioned well to support the next level of increased build rates beginning in late 2016 and extending into 2017 and beyond.
The DAS operating segment loss for the quarter was $6 million compared to an operating income of $6.9 million for the third quarter of 2014. This decrease to an operating loss was primarily the result of a $9 million increase over last year's comparable quarter and forward loss reserves related to the region jet program. In addition, DAS was impacted by approximately $3 million from an unfavorable product mix shift and $1 million in net expenses as we work through our cost-cutting efforts. 
EBITDA for the DAS segment was a negative $3.6 million for the quarter compared to $10.8 million or 13.3% of revenue for last year's third quarter.
Now turning to the Ducommun LaBarge Technologies, DLT business segment. Our DLT segment posted solid results, with operating income, EBITDA and corresponding margin improvement this quarter as compared to last year's comparable quarter. Revenue for the third quarter was $97.5 million compared to $106.8 million for the third quarter of 2014. The lower net revenue was primarily due to an approximate 14.6% decrease in military and space revenue, mainly due to lower sales of radar rack and defense helicopter electronic applications and an approximate 2% decrease in our overall nonaerospace and defense revenue, primarily from the energy sector, which is partially offset by a 5% increase in our commercial aerospace electronics solutions. 
Through recent market development activities, we continue to enjoy increased demand for our commercial aerospace electronics applications with new customers.
In our non-A&D offerings, we have seen lower demand for our energy-related products over the last few quarters and expect that trend to continue well into 2016. However, offsetting this, we are experiencing solid backlog in other areas, including our medical and in our industrial applications. 
DLT's operating income for the third quarter was $8.6 million or 8.8% of revenues compared to $8.3 million or 7.8% of revenues for the comparable period in 2014. As you heard earlier from Tony, that there was also in our results for this quarter $0.8 million of the restructuring charges were within this segment. We did benefit in all those key profitability measures due to a favorable product mix and lower compensation and benefit expenses, partially offset by loss of efficiencies from the lower manufacturing volumes.
EBITDA was approximately $13 million or 13.1% of revenue, an improvement from the $12.7 million or 11.9% of revenue in last year's comparable period.
We continue to focus on product mix improvement in achieving the supply chain savings to sustain profitability in the segment.
Corporate General and Administrative expenses that were allocated to the business for the third quarter were $3.7 million or 2.3% of total company revenue, a decrease from $5.1 million or 2.7% of total company revenue in the comparable period.
Now turning to our backlog. Our overall backlog at the end of the quarter was $553 million, up from $524 million at the end of this year's second quarter. This was primarily driven by a significant commercial aerospace orders. The increase reflects a combination of orders for existing programs and recent new awards as we continue to build our pipeline.
As I mentioned in previous calls, timing differences may impact quarterly reporting of backlogs, and at times, it may not truly reflect the strong underlying long term demands for large commercial airframe products. Quarterly backlogs, even the long term programs now we tend to be shorter in duration and lower in amounts than was previously the case. Despite that, we continue to work diligently to win additional orders across both our diverse commercial aerospace end markets and defense technology platforms.
Regarding liquidity and capital resources, in the first 9 months of 2015, we generated $12 million of cash from operations, including the $9.8 million that we used for the redemption of the $200 million senior unsecured notes in July. Excluding this $9.8 million redemption payment, we generated approximately $18.2 million in cash from operations for the first 9 months compared to $20.8 million during the comparable period in 2014. We remain diligent in effective working capital management, and we expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect historic seasonal patterns.
At the end of the quarter, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA as defined was approximately 4.2:1. 
One of the real financial highlights was our new capital structure, which involve completing a new credit facility at the end of the second quarter and finalizing with the redemption of new capital structure by taking out and redeeming in late July the 9.75% senior unsecured notes and replacing that with lower interest, new credit facilities, which we put in place in June. Upon completion of the refinancing, we had $275 million outstanding on the term loan and an unused balance on our revolver. Since that time, we have paid down $25 million in the third quarter, and here in the fourth quarter already, we have paid down an additional $10 million since then, reducing our outstanding debt currently to $250 million. In addition, we have approximately $198 million of liquidity.
We are very pleased with the debt structure as it provides greater financial flexibility to execute strategic initiatives and it create shareholder value by significantly reducing interest expenses.
At this stage, we continue toward our goal of deleveraging the target of $2.25 million to $2.5 million by the end of 2017. Capital expenditures year-to-date for the 9 months were just under $13 million, and for the year, we expect this amount to be around $15 million. Our capital expenditure spending this year primarily reflect the consolidation and expansion of our upstate New York operations, resulting in a state-of-the-art advanced titanium products center of excellence.
In closing, we continue to focus on managing the changing mix in our business and are working to realize lower manufacturing costs throughout our operations. We also expect to see annualized cost-savings of $6 million to $8 million beginning in the fourth quarter through our streamlining initiatives to help drive higher operating and EBITDA margins. 
In addition, we remain diligent with regard to expense management and working capital efficiencies, which, along with our significantly lower interest expenses, should generate meaningful free cash flow going forward.
Now I'd like to turn the program back over to Tony. Tony?"

Before turning the call over to questions, let me briefly reiterate that we are committed to rightsizing Ducommun quickly and appropriately given the current market dynamics. Even as the company's commercial aerospace business continues to grow, headwinds caused by our defense and our non-A&D end markets may mean that quarterly revenue remain similar to the current level for the foreseeable future. So we look to further streamline our operations, realize supply chain efficiencies and reduce working capital, while assessing our product portfolio and manufacturing footprint to strengthen the company.
This has been a challenging period, but 2015 remains a year of transition, and we will do whatever we have to make sure that we ensure renewed growth, improved performance and margin expansion and higher cash flow for 2016 and beyond.

So on the programs going forward, we have double check system that we are going back and making sure that we are getting the margins that we quoted and in terms of our cost inputs and coming down the learning curves that we anticipated. So we do thorough reviews on in some cases on a monthly basis and in some cases on a quarterly basis depending on the program. So I think, that internally, there has [indiscernible] program reduce.

We're going through rate readiness with both customers, both Airbus and Boeing as we look at tuning [indiscernible] Maybe some adjustments in tooling to make sure that we hit those higher rates and then work our way through that. But in terms of capitalization, we're pretty well capitalized. We will be capitalizing over the next year and the following year for new business programs that we brought on line. But those are for brand-new applications as opposed to existing business base. But that's all part of the bid process when we did the program. Now in terms of the commercial market and where we see that in terms of the growth rates, again, I think it depends on 2 things. We talked about that internally a lot. But it really depends on how the capital markets are behaving. And the capital available for, say the emerging markets, so that this issue with Exim Bank, has not helped the Boeing Company, for example, and then, therefore, has a direct reflection on us in terms of financing customers overseas. So hopefully, we get through that, we change that from [indiscernible] standpoint and get that past. I think that would benefit that. So that has a bearing in terms of how these things are financed, and I think that's one aspect. The other aspect is how strong-willed emerging markets in particular China, be going forward because I think, our major trust in terms of selling [indiscernible] out there is in China. But I will say that both Boeing and Airbus have 5 to 6 years of solid backlog. So I hope to see a crash here. And so if there's some slowdown for whatever reason, we will enjoy the current rates that we're at per share."

Nearly $12 million of this was related to the previously discussed extinguishment of our debt and the implementation of a new credit facilities, which will save the company around $15 million annually going forward.
But the other costs bear us some further discussion. We booked a $10 million charge within our AeroStructures unit related to estimated cost overruns for the remaining contract period of the regional jet program. This is a program that has been problematic for quite some time and was aggressively bid originally.
While we remain in discussions with our customers about potential price adjustments, we're not optimistic that such negotiations will make this program profitable. So we're taking this charge even as we continue our discussions and we'll proceed through the contracted period, which is approximately one year. This is obviously a major disappointment.
We also booked a restructuring charge of approximately $800,000 related to a closure of 2 facilities over the coming months. The first being a small administrative office in St. Louis, and the second plant in Houston that primarily served the company's oil and gas market. Both locations are within the Ducommun and LaBarge Technologies units. We expect these closures and related organizational realignments to result in cost-benefits that should save the company $2 million to $3 million annually when fully implemented.
The Houston plant ceased the operations at the end of October, and was closed because it was not seen as being core to our business operations. The St. Louis facility closure will be completed in the first quarter of 2016.
Turning to our results. We experienced a significant drop in sales this period, both year-over-year and sequentially from the second quarter. Revenue was $162 million, reflecting a 27% year-over-year decrease in sales within our military and space end-use markets.
This is a recurring theme that has impacted nearly every platform we serve. The military decline and corporate's canceled programs, lower demand and schedule slides, which resulted in larger-than-expected drops, particularly across certain defense-related helicopter platforms.
We were unable to offset such shortfalls with the growth of our commercial aerospace markets, which remains robust, but we'll not see significant increases in sales until late 2016. The good news is that our backlog for the company has rebounded to the best level this year, over $550 million, due to strong commercial aerospace bookings in both the structures and electronics businesses.
We have more work to do as we prepare to emerge in this challenging period. We previously announced the headcount reductions and streamlining actions and supply chain initiatives that were to move $4 million to $5 million of annualized costs from our operations, over and above the additional $2 million to $3 million I just mentioned.
So we have a total budget of some $6 million to $8 million in cost reductions for the company with more work to be done in the fourth quarter. We're on schedule for the consolidation of our 3 upstate New York facilities this year, resulting in the state-of-the-art advanced titanium products manufacturing center. We expect to see efficiencies from this facility improving DAS margins in 2016.
We continue to assess every asset of our organization for cost reductions, consolidation opportunities and working capital improvements, and this means that we're also evaluating our product portfolio to determine what areas of our business are noncore, low-margin, low growth or otherwise not seen in keeping with what we see as a future for Ducommun.
With sales being adversely impacted by the military slowdown, now it's clearly the time to rightsize our company and make it stronger, leaner and more nimble. Obviously, we'll keep our shareholders appraise of any additional actions we deem more going forward.
Now I'll provide some market color for you on products and programs.
In the military and space sector, in the current environment, with lower U.S. military involvement overseas, general budget curtailments and shifting spending priorities has impacted both our fixed wing and our helicopter platforms across the board. Some of our longest-serving programs were down significantly this quarter compared to 2014. And the underlying reality is that such conditions are likely to continue to exist in the next year. We believe that current levels are our baseline for us, and we are not optimistic that near-term growth opportunities given the current defense spending moving forward. This is why we're undertaking an across-the-board look at our facilities and product portfolio. Nothing is being spared in our assessment of any ways to improve our performance or other areas for consolidation. In the meantime, we remain cautiously optimistic about the recently passed budget deal in Washington. We hope that this long-term agreement will bring some stability to the defense industry and presumably lead to possible procurements of upgrades and replacements for the many key aircraft platforms we serve. But this is clearly too early to have any clear picture in this regard.
Now we move to our commercial aerospace operations. Revenue this quarter was essentially flat year-over-year, primarily due to shipment timing as well as continued weakness in our commercial helicopter business. But we remain upbeat about our overall commercial aerospace operations. We're on track to post our highest annual revenue in this year. Our total company backlog, as I mentioned earlier, has rebounded to the best point in 2015 due to strong commercial bookings and our backlog here now stands at over $250 million. This reflects solid orders across many of our large platforms, including the Boeing 737, the 777 and the 787 programs as well as the A320 and various other Airbus programs. We continue to win additional content on these and other platforms, and believe the company remains in solid shape for further growth going forward.
We have strong and growing relationships with Boeing, Spirit, Airbus, Gulf Stream, Rolls-Royce, United Technologies and others. And we have over 30 new development programs in place, much of which we expect to benefit from the top line, starting late next year and into 2017.
In the interim, we will pursue additional opportunities to leverage our expanses [ph] , structure [ph] and electronics capabilities in this marketplace.
Turning to our non-A&D business, we again saw a mixed performance this quarter with continued weakness in our energy markets, somewhat offset by stability within areas, such as the industrial and medical fields. As I mentioned previously, we'll exit a large portion of the commodity energy business when we close our Houston facility. However, we still see opportunities for growth in this marketplace even given current market conditions.
Our non-A&D backlog stands at around $63 million as we target new business for this sector. We're also looking at additional cost reductions and consolidation opportunities as well as possible portfolio considerations.
Now I [indiscernible] turning the call over to Joe. Let me just mention that this is his last earnings call with us, as he's retiring at the end of 2015. I want to commend Joe for all he's done for Ducommun in this past 7 years. He truly has been an inspiration and an asset to the company as well as a personal friend. He's been instrumental in the completion of 2 acquisitions, 3 debt refinancings, which have been critical to strengthen our overall financial position. He is very well respected by everyone here as well as our investors, and we certainly wish him the best going forward. I will introduce his replacement, our current Chief Accounting Officer, Doug Groves next quarter, but we're all very pleased with the company's careful executed financial succession plan.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?"
267761,314056497,892813,"Ducommun Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Tony, and good day, everyone, and thanks for the kind words. Looking at the third quarter 2015 results, earlier today, we reported a net loss of $9.5 million or $0.86 per share for the current quarter. This compares to net income of $2.9 millio",1936,"Thank you, Tony, and good day, everyone, and thanks for the kind words. Looking at the third quarter 2015 results, earlier today, we reported a net loss of $9.5 million or $0.86 per share for the current quarter. This compares to net income of $2.9 million or $0.26 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2014. I'll get into the details in a moment, but as Tony mentioned, this reflects a pretax charge of $22.7 million, which is $1.28 per share on an after-tax basis and includes the following pretax charges: the recording of a $10 million forward loss reserve on a regional jet program; a $0.8 million restructuring charge; and an $11.9 million charge for debt extinguishment expenses incurred relative to our new debt structure, which we finalized during here in the third quarter.
Net sales for the third quarter of 2015 were approximately $162 million, that's roughly 14% lower than the comparable period in 2014. The revenue decline reflected a $26 million decrease in military and space revenues. In this area, we have seen reduced demand for both structural solutions and technology applications. This reflects lower aggregate government defense curtailments and shifting spending priorities.
Within the commercial aerospace arena by contrast, which was up slightly year-over-year, we continue to experience solid revenues as we benefit from the sustainable large commercial airframe build rates and increased content. During the quarter, we experienced significant growth in our commercial aerospace bookings, both in the structural and electronics solutions, largely contributing to our total backlog at quarter-end being nearly identical to year-end 2014.
We expect the current macro environment to be similar over the next few quarters. We had previously indicated that 2015 would be a transition year as we work through the decline in demand with our military and space end-use markets, streamlining operations, realizing supply chain efficiencies and cut costs to strengthen the company.
Excluding the forward loss reserve, our adjusted gross margins were 18.6% as compared to 17.6% in last year's comparable quarter, as we realize the benefits from actively managing this transition and from efforts to improve product mix, eliminate lower-margin products and reduce manufacturing expenses.
As we continue with profit improvement initiatives, we expect to sustain or potentially improve these gross margin levels.
We remain committed to addressing the issues in front of us and return to company a profitability levels of which we're capable. This means further headcount reductions, lowering of indirect labor costs, improving our manufacturing performance and effective execution on certain new programs.
As Tony summarized, we have a total target of some $6 million to $8 million in cost reductions for the company with additional work underway. Our cost-cutting activities will continue as we remain committed to improving financial results in the fourth quarter of 2015 and beyond. We expect our New York facility consolidation project to be completed in the next few months. As a result of this move and other restructuring actions in progress, we expect to take an additional $1.7 million to $2 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter.
Ducommun's operating loss for the current quarter was approximately $1 million as compared to operating income of approximately $10 million in the third quarter of 2014. Excluding the $10 million forward loss reserve and a $0.8 million restructuring expenses, which did totaled $10.8 million, the current quarter operating income would be $9.6 million or 6% of revenues as compared to 5.3% of revenues in last year's third quarter. We are now seeing the benefits of the completion of our refinancing mid-year, and with the new debt structure, interest expenses were $3.4 million or 2% of revenue as compared to $7 million or 3.7% of revenue in last year's third quarter. We estimate interest expenses will be approximately $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Our effective income tax benefit during the quarter was 42.1% compared to 37.4% effective income tax rate for the comparable period last year. The higher rate reflects the pretax loss this year compared to pretax income in 2014. We expect the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 to average approximately 37%, excluding any potential benefit from the federal research and development tax credits. There is traction in Congress for approval of these credits for 2015 and 2016, which would be an additional benefit to us.
EBITDA was $5.5 million or 3.4% of revenue in the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the forward loss reserve and restructuring expenses, EBITDA would have been approximately $16 million or 10% of revenues as compared to $18.4 million or 9.8% of revenues in the third quarter of 2014.
Now looking at the individual business segments starting first with Ducommun and AeroStructures or DAS, our Ducommun and AeroStructures segment posted revenues of approximately $64 million for the quarter compared to $81.4 million in the third quarter of 2014. The lower revenue was primarily due to reductions in demand for our military helicopter applications, coincident with lower defense spending levels and sunsetting of 2 long cycle defense programs. Our commercial aerospace structural applications remain at record levels, while up just slightly year-over-year, they reflect certain timing differences regarding shipments.
We continue to meet the delivery requirements of the large commercial airframe manufacturers, primarily Airbus and Boeing, and we are positioned well to support the next level of increased build rates beginning in late 2016 and extending into 2017 and beyond.
The DAS operating segment loss for the quarter was $6 million compared to an operating income of $6.9 million for the third quarter of 2014. This decrease to an operating loss was primarily the result of a $9 million increase over last year's comparable quarter and forward loss reserves related to the regional jet program. In addition, DAS was impacted by approximately $3 million from an unfavorable product mix shift and $1 million in net expenses as we work through our cost-cutting efforts.
EBITDA for the DAS segment was negative $3.6 million for the quarter compared to $10.8 million or 13.3% of revenue for last year's third quarter.
Now turning to the Ducommun LaBarge Technologies, DLT business segment. Our DLT segment posted solid results, with operating income, EBITDA and corresponding margin improvement this quarter as compared to last year's comparable quarter. Revenue for the third quarter was $97.5 million compared to $106.8 million for the third quarter of 2014. The lower net revenue was primarily due to an approximate 14.6% decrease in military and space revenue, mainly due to lower sales of radar rack and defense helicopter electronic applications and an approximate 2% decrease in our overall nonaerospace and defense revenue, primarily from the energy sector, which is partially offset by a 5% increase in our commercial aerospace electronics solutions.
Through recent market development activities, we continue to enjoy increased demand for our commercial aerospace electronics applications with new customers.
In our non-A&D offerings, we have seen lower demand for our energy-related products over the last few quarters and expect that trend to continue well into 2016. However, offsetting this, we are experiencing solid backlog in other areas, including our medical and in our industrial applications.
DLT's operating income for the third quarter was $8.6 million or 8.8% of revenues compared to $8.3 million or 7.8% of revenues for the comparable period in 2014. As you heard earlier from Tony, that there was also in our results for this quarter $0.8 million of the restructuring charges were within this segment. We did benefit in all those key profitability measures due to a favorable product mix and lower compensation and benefit expenses, partially offset by loss of efficiencies from the lower manufacturing volumes.
EBITDA was approximately $13 million or 13.1% of revenue, an improvement from the $12.7 million or 11.9% of revenue in last year's comparable period.
We continue to focus on product mix improvement and achieving the supply chain savings to sustain profitability in the segment.
Corporate General and Administrative expenses that were allocated to the business for the third quarter were $3.7 million or 2.3% of total company revenue, a decrease from $5.1 million or 2.7% of total company revenue in the comparable period.
Now turning to our backlogs. Our overall backlog at the end of the quarter was $553 million, up from $524 million at the end of this year's second quarter. This was primarily driven by significant commercial aerospace orders. The increase reflects a combination of orders for existing programs and recent new awards as we continue to build our pipeline.
As I mentioned in previous calls, timing differences may impact quarterly reporting of backlogs, and at times, it may not truly reflect the strong underlying long term demands for large commercial airframe products. Quarterly backlogs, even on along term programs now tend to be shorter in duration and lower in amounts than was previously the case. Despite that, we continue to work diligently to win additional orders across both our diverse commercial aerospace end markets and defense technology platforms.
Regarding liquidity and capital resources, in the first 9 months of 2015, we generated $12 million of cash from operations, including the $9.8 million that we used for the redemption of the $200 million senior unsecured notes in July. Excluding this $9.8 million redemption payment, we generated approximately $18.2 million in cash from operations for the first 9 months compared to $20.8 million during the comparable period in 2014. We remain diligent in effective working capital management, and we expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect historic seasonal patterns. At the end of the quarter, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA as defined was approximately 4.2:1.
One of the real financial highlights was our new capital structure, which involve completing a new credit facility at the end of the second quarter and finalizing with the redemption of new capital structure by taking out and redeeming in late July the 9.75% senior unsecured notes and replacing that with lower interest, new credit facilities, which we put in place in June. Upon completion of the refinancing, we had $275 million outstanding on the term loan and an unused balance on our revolver. Since that time, we have paid down $25 million in the third quarter, and here in the fourth quarter already, we have paid down an additional $10 million since then, reducing our outstanding debt currently to $250 million. In addition, we have approximately $198 million of liquidity.
We are very pleased with the debt structure as it provides greater financial flexibility to execute strategic initiatives and it create shareholder value by significantly reducing interest expenses.
At this stage, we continue toward our goal of deleveraging to targets of $2.25 million to $2.5 million by the end of 2017. Capital expenditures year-to-date for the 9 months were just under $13 million, and for the year, we expect this amount to be around $15 million. Our capital expenditure spending this year primarily reflects the consolidation and expansion of our upstate New York operations, resulting in a state-of-the-art advanced titanium products center of excellence.
In closing, we continue to focus on managing the changing mix in our business and are working to realize lower manufacturing costs throughout our operations. We also expect to see annualized cost savings of $6 million to $8 million beginning in the fourth quarter through our streamlining initiatives to help drive higher operating and EBITDA margins.
In addition, we remain diligent with regard to expense management and working capital efficiencies, which, along with our significantly lower interest expenses, should generate meaningful free cash flow going forward.
Now I'd like to turn the program back over to Tony. Tony?"

But it really depends on how the capital markets are behaving. And the capital available for, say the emerging markets, so that this issue with Exim Bank, does not help the Boeing Company, for example, and then, therefore, has a direct reflection on us in terms of financing customers overseas. So hopefully, we get through that, we change that from a progressional standpoint and get that past. I think that would benefit that. So that has a bearing in terms of how these things are financed, and I think that's one aspect. The other aspect is how strong-willed the emerging markets in particular China, be going forward because I think, our major thrust in terms of selling [indiscernible] out there is in China. But I will say that both Boeing and Airbus have 5 to 6 years of solid backlog. So I don't see a crash here. And so if there's some slowdown for whatever reason, we will enjoy the current rates that we're at for."

I'll begin by providing an overview of the quarter, including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino to go through",1333,"Thank you, Chris, and thank you, everyone for joining us today for our fiscal third quarter conference call. I'll begin by providing an overview of the quarter, including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino to go through the financial results in detail.
Let me start by acknowledging that we had several onetime charges this quarter, which were preannounced, amounting to some $22.7 million on a pretax basis. Nearly $12 million of this was related to the previously discussed extinguishment of our debt and the implementation of new credit facilities, which will save the company around $15 million annually going forward.
But the other costs bear us some further discussion. We booked a $10 million charge within our AeroStructures unit related to estimated cost overruns for the remaining contract period of the regional jet program. This is a program that has been problematic for quite some time and was aggressively bid originally.
While we remain in discussions with our customers about potential price adjustments, we're not optimistic that such negotiations will make this program profitable. So we're taking this charge even as we continue our discussions and we'll proceed through the contracted period, which is approximately one year. This is obviously a major disappointment.
We also booked a restructuring charge of approximately $800,000 related to a closure of two facilities over the coming months. The first being a small administrative office in St. Louis, and the second plant in Houston that primarily served the company's oil and gas market. Both locations are within the Ducommun and LaBarge Technologies units. We expect these closures and related organizational realignments to result in cost-benefits that should save the company $2 million to $3 million annually when fully implemented.
The Houston plant ceased the operations at the end of October, and was closed because it was not seen as being core to our business operations. The St. Louis facility closure will be completed in the first quarter of 2016.
Turning to our results. We experienced a significant drop in sales this period, both year-over-year and sequentially from the second quarter. Revenue was $162 million, reflecting a 27% year-over-year decrease in sales within our military and space end-use markets.
This is a recurring theme that has impacted nearly every platform we serve. The military decline and corporate's canceled programs, lower demand and schedule slides, which resulted in larger-than-expected drops, particularly across certain defense-related helicopter platforms.
We were unable to offset such shortfalls with the growth of our commercial aerospace markets, which remains robust, but we'll not see significant increases in sales until late 2016. The good news is that our backlog for the company has rebounded to the best level this year, over $550 million, due to strong commercial aerospace bookings in both the structures and electronics businesses.
We have more work to do as we prepare to emerge from this challenging period. We previously announced the headcount reductions and streamlining actions and supply chain initiatives that were to move $4 million to $5 million of annualized costs from our operations, over and above the additional $2 million to $3 million I just mentioned.
So we have a total budget of some $6 million to $8 million in cost reductions for the company with more work to be done in the fourth quarter. We're on schedule for the consolidation of our three upstate New York facilities this year, resulting in the state-of-the-art advanced titanium products manufacturing center. We expect to see efficiencies from this facility improving DAS margins in 2016.
We continue to assess every asset of our organization for cost reductions, consolidation opportunities and working capital improvements, and this means that we're also evaluating our product portfolio to determine what areas of our business are noncore, low-margin, low growth or otherwise not seen in keeping with what we see as a future for Ducommun.
With sales being adversely impacted by the military slowdown, now it's clearly the time to rightsize our company and make it stronger, leaner and more nimble. Obviously, we'll keep our shareholders apprised of any additional actions we deem warranted going forward.
Now I'll provide some market color for you on products and programs.
In the military and space sector, in the current environment, with lower U.S. military involvement overseas, general budget curtailments and shifting spending priorities has impacted both our fixed wing and our helicopter platforms across the board. Some of our longest-serving programs were down significantly this quarter compared to 2014. And the underlying reality is that such conditions are likely to continue to exist in the next year. We believe that current levels are a baseline for us, and we are not optimistic that near-term growth opportunities given the current defense spending moving forward. This is why we're undertaking an across-the-board look at our facilities and product portfolio. Nothing is being spared in our assessment of any ways to improve our performance or other areas for consolidation. In the meantime, we remain cautiously optimistic about the recently passed budget deal in Washington. We hope that this long-term agreement will bring some stability to the defense industry and presumably lead to possible procurements of upgrades and replacements for the many key aircraft platforms we serve. But this is clearly too early to have any clear picture in this regard.
Now we move to our commercial aerospace operations. Revenue this quarter was essentially flat year-over-year, primarily due to shipment timing as well as continued weakness in our commercial helicopter business. But we remain upbeat about our overall commercial aerospace operations. We're on track to post our highest annual revenue in this year. Our total company backlog, as I mentioned earlier, has rebounded to the best point in 2015 due to strong commercial bookings and our backlog here now stands at over $250 million. This reflects solid orders across many of our large platforms, including the Boeing 737, the 777 and the 787 programs as well as the A320 and various other Airbus programs. We continue to win additional content on these and other platforms, and believe the company remains in solid shape for further growth going forward.
We have strong and growing relationships with Boeing, Spirit, Airbus, Gulf Stream, Rolls-Royce, United Technologies and others. And we have over 30 new development programs in place, much of which we expect to benefit from the topline, starting late next year and into 2017.
In the interim, we will pursue additional opportunities to leverage our expanses [ph] , structure and electronics capabilities in this marketplace.
Turning to our non-A&D business, we again saw a mixed performance this quarter with continued weakness in our energy markets, somewhat offset by stability within areas, such as the industrial and medical fields. As I mentioned previously, we'll exit a large portion of the commodity energy business when we close our Houston facility. However, we still see opportunities for growth in this marketplace even given current market conditions.
Our non-A&D backlog stands at around $63 million as we target new business for this sector. We're also looking at additional cost reductions and consolidation opportunities as well as possible portfolio considerations.
Now before turning the call over to Joe, let me just mention that this is his last earnings call with us, as he's retiring at the end of 2015. I want to commend Joe for all he's done for Ducommun in these past 7 years. He truly has been an inspiration and an asset to the company as well as a personal friend. He's been instrumental in the completion of two acquisitions, three debt refinancings, which have been critical to strengthen our overall financial position. He is very well respected by everyone here as well as our investors, and we certainly wish him the best going forward. I will introduce his replacement, our current Chief Accounting Officer, Doug Groves next quarter, but we're all very pleased with the company's careful executed financial succession plan.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?"

Looking at the third quarter 2015 results, earlier today, we reported a net loss of $9.5 million or $0.86 per share for the current quarter. This compares to net income of $2.9 millio",1929,"Thank you, Tony, and good day, everyone, and thanks for the kind words. Looking at the third quarter 2015 results, earlier today, we reported a net loss of $9.5 million or $0.86 per share for the current quarter. This compares to net income of $2.9 million or $0.26 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2014. I'll get into the details in a moment, but as Tony mentioned, this reflects a pretax charge of $22.7 million, which is $1.28 per share on an after-tax basis and includes the following pretax charges: the recording of a $10 million forward loss reserve on a regional jet program; a $0.8 million restructuring charge; and an $11.9 million charge for debt extinguishment expenses incurred relative to our new debt structure, which we finalized during here in the third quarter.
Net sales for the third quarter of 2015 were approximately $162 million, that's roughly 14% lower than the comparable period in 2014. The revenue decline reflected a $26 million decrease in military and space revenues. In this area, we have seen reduced demand for both structural solutions and technology applications. This reflects lower aggregate government defense curtailments and shifting spending priorities.
Within the commercial aerospace arena by contrast, which was up slightly year-over-year, we continue to experience solid revenues as we benefit from the sustainable large commercial airframe build rates and increased content. During the quarter, we experienced significant growth in our commercial aerospace bookings, both in the structural and electronics solutions, largely contributing to our total backlog at quarter-end being nearly identical to year-end 2014.
We expect the current macro environment to be similar over the next few quarters. We had previously indicated that 2015 would be a transition year as we work through the decline in demand with our military and space end-use markets, streamlining operations, realizing supply chain efficiencies and cut costs to strengthen the company.
Excluding the forward loss reserve, our adjusted gross margins were 18.6% as compared to 17.6% in last year's comparable quarter, as we realize the benefits from actively managing this transition and from efforts to improve product mix, eliminate lower-margin products and reduce manufacturing expenses.
As we continue with profit improvement initiatives, we expect to sustain or potentially improve these gross margin levels.
We remain committed to addressing the issues in front of us and return to company profitability levels of which we're capable. This means further headcount reductions, lowering of indirect labor costs, improving our manufacturing performance and effective execution on certain new programs.
As Tony summarized, we have a total target of some $6 million to $8 million in cost reductions for the company with additional work underway. Our cost-cutting activities will continue as we remain committed to improving financial results in the fourth quarter of 2015 and beyond. We expect our New York facility consolidation project to be completed in the next few months. As a result of this move and other restructuring actions in progress, we expect to take an additional $1.7 million to $2 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter.
Ducommun's operating loss for the current quarter was approximately $1 million as compared to operating income of approximately $10 million in the third quarter of 2014. Excluding the $10 million forward loss reserve and a $0.8 million restructuring expenses, which did total $10.8 million, the current quarter operating income would be $9.6 million or 6% of revenues as compared to 5.3% of revenues in last year's third quarter. We are now seeing the benefits of the completion of our refinancing mid-year, and with the new debt structure, interest expenses were $3.4 million or 2% of revenue as compared to $7 million or 3.7% of revenue in last year's third quarter. We estimate interest expenses will be approximately $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Our effective income tax benefit during the quarter was 42.1% compared to 37.4% effective income tax rate for the comparable period last year. The higher rate reflects the pretax loss this year compared to pretax income in 2014. We expect the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 to average approximately 37%, excluding any potential benefit from the federal research and development tax credits. There is traction in Congress for approval of these credits for 2015 and 2016, which would be an additional benefit to us.
EBITDA was $5.5 million or 3.4% of revenue in the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the forward loss reserve and restructuring expenses, EBITDA would have been approximately $16 million or 10% of revenues as compared to $18.4 million or 9.8% of revenues in the third quarter of 2014.
Now looking at the individual business segments starting first with Ducommun AeroStructures or DAS, our Ducommun AeroStructures segment posted revenues of approximately $64 million for the quarter compared to $81.4 million in the third quarter of 2014. The lower revenue was primarily due to reductions in demand for our military helicopter applications, coincident with lower defense spending levels and sunsetting of two long cycle defense programs. Our commercial aerospace structural applications remain at record levels, while up just slightly year-over-year, they reflect certain timing differences regarding shipments.
We continue to meet the delivery requirements of the large commercial airframe manufacturers, primarily Airbus and Boeing, and we are positioned well to support the next level of increased build rates beginning in late 2016 and extending into 2017 and beyond.
The DAS operating segment loss for the quarter was $6 million compared to an operating income of $6.9 million for the third quarter of 2014. This decrease to an operating loss was primarily the result of a $9 million increase over last year's comparable quarter and forward loss reserves related to the regional jet program. In addition, DAS was impacted by approximately $3 million from an unfavorable product mix shift and $1 million in net expenses as we work through our cost-cutting efforts.
EBITDA for the DAS segment was negative $3.6 million for the quarter compared to $10.8 million or 13.3% of revenue for last year's third quarter.
Now turning to the Ducommun LaBarge Technologies, DLT business segment. Our DLT segment posted solid results, with operating income, EBITDA and corresponding margin improvement this quarter as compared to last year's comparable quarter. Revenue for the third quarter was $97.5 million compared to $106.8 million for the third quarter of 2014. The lower net revenue was primarily due to an approximate 14.6% decrease in military and space revenue, mainly due to lower sales of radar rack and defense helicopter electronic applications and an approximate 2% decrease in our overall nonaerospace and defense revenue, primarily from the energy sector, which is partially offset by a 5% increase in our commercial aerospace electronics solutions.
Through recent market development activities, we continue to enjoy increased demand for our commercial aerospace electronics applications with new customers.
In our non-A&D offerings, we have seen lower demand for our energy-related products over the last few quarters and expect that trend to continue well into 2016. However, offsetting this, we are experiencing solid backlog in other areas, including our medical and in our industrial applications.
DLT's operating income for the third quarter was $8.6 million or 8.8% of revenues compared to $8.3 million or 7.8% of revenues for the comparable period in 2014. As you heard earlier from Tony, there were also in our results for this quarter $0.8 million of the restructuring charges within this segment. We did benefit in all those key profitability measures due to a favorable product mix and lower compensation and benefit expenses, partially offset by loss of efficiencies from the lower manufacturing volumes.
EBITDA was approximately $13 million or 13.1% of revenue, an improvement from the $12.7 million or 11.9% of revenue in last year's comparable period.
We continue to focus on product mix improvement and achieving the supply chain savings to sustain profitability in the segment.
Corporate General and Administrative expenses that were allocated to the business for the third quarter were $3.7 million or 2.3% of total company revenue, a decrease from $5.1 million or 2.7% of total company revenue in the comparable period.
Now turning to our backlogs. Our overall backlog at the end of the quarter was $553 million, up from $524 million at the end of this year's second quarter. This was primarily driven by significant commercial aerospace orders. The increase reflects a combination of orders for existing programs and recent new awards as we continue to build our pipeline.
As I mentioned in previous calls, timing differences may impact quarterly reporting of backlogs, and at times, it may not truly reflect the strong underlying long-term demands for large commercial airframe products. Quarterly backlogs, even in long-term programs, now tend to be shorter in duration and lower in amounts than was previously the case. Despite that, we continue to work diligently to win additional orders across both our diverse commercial aerospace end markets and defense technology platforms.
Regarding liquidity and capital resources, in the first nine months of 2015, we generated $12 million of cash from operations, including the $9.8 million that we used for the redemption of the $200 million senior unsecured notes in July. Excluding this $9.8 million redemption payment, we generated approximately $18.2 million in cash from operations for the first nine months compared to $20.8 million during the comparable period in 2014. We remain diligent in effective working capital management, and we expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect historic seasonal patterns. At the end of the quarter, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA as defined was approximately 4.2:1.
One of the real financial highlights was our new capital structure, which involved completing a new credit facility at the end of the second quarter and finalizing with the redemption of new capital structure by taking out and redeeming in late July the 9.75% senior unsecured notes and replacing that with lower interest, new credit facilities, which we put in place in June. Upon completion of the refinancing, we had $275 million outstanding on the term loan and an unused balance on our revolver. Since that time, we have paid down $25 million in the third quarter, and here in the fourth quarter already, we have paid down an additional $10 million since then, reducing our outstanding debt currently to $250 million. In addition, we have approximately $198 million of liquidity.
We are very pleased with the debt structure as it provides greater financial flexibility to execute strategic initiatives and it creates shareholder value by significantly reducing interest expenses.
At this stage, we continue toward our goal of deleveraging to targets of $2.25 million to $2.5 million by the end of 2017. Capital expenditures year-to-date for the nine months were just under $13 million, and for the year, we expect this amount to be around $15 million. Our capital expenditure spending this year primarily reflects the consolidation and expansion of our upstate New York operations, resulting in a state-of-the-art advanced titanium products center of excellence.
In closing, we continue to focus on managing the changing mix in our business and are working to realize lower manufacturing costs throughout our operations. We also expect to see annualized cost savings of $6 million to $8 million beginning in the fourth quarter through our streamlining initiatives to help drive higher operating and EBITDA margins.
In addition, we remain diligent with regard to expense management and working capital efficiencies, which, along with our significantly lower interest expenses, should generate meaningful free cash flow going forward.
Now I'd like to turn the program back over to Tony. Tony?"

Before turning the call over to questions, let me briefly reiterate that we are committed to rightsizing Ducommun quickly and appropriately given the current market dynamics. Even as the company's commercial aerospace business continues to grow, headwinds caused by our defense and our non-A&D end markets, it may mean that quarterly revenue remain similar to the current level for the foreseeable future. So we look to further streamline our operations, realize supply chain efficiencies and reduce working capital, while assessing our product portfolio and manufacturing footprint to strengthen the company.
This has been a challenging period, but 2015 remains a year of transition, and we will do whatever we have to, to make sure that we ensure renewed growth, improved performance and margin expansion and higher cash flow for 2016 and beyond.

And then probably the largest change year-over-year in terms of revenue was just the falloff of the C-17, which was not in this quarter, but the Apache was significant. That was another like $9 million year-over-year change in the revenue base. So those two were pretty large hits to the military side. I don't think they snuck up on us.

The regional jet program dates back quite a few years and was not, unfortunately, part of this process. As I indicated on that program, it was aggressively bid and we're unable to hit the efficiencies that we need in order to make that program profitable. So on the programs, going forward, we have doublecheck system that we are going back and making sure that we are hitting the margins that we quoted in terms of our cost inputs and coming down the learning curves that we anticipated. So we do thorough reviews, and in some cases on a monthly basis and in some cases on a quarterly basis, depending on the program. So I think that internally there has been program reviews. So I think that we really beefed up that system. We looked at this program and a couple of other programs where we had struggled with it early on, several years ago, and we've really changed the system before we introduce new products."

We may have some tooling adjustments. We are evaluating that now. We're going through rate readiness with both customers, both Airbus and Boeing as we look at tooling requirements, so there maybe some adjustments in tooling to make sure that we hit those higher rates and then work our way through that. But in terms of capitalization, we're pretty well capitalized. We will be capitalizing over next year and the following year for new business programs that we brought online. But those are for brand-new applications as opposed to existing business base. But that's all part of the bid process when we bid the program. 
Now in terms of the commercial market and where we see that in terms of the growth rates, again, I think it depends on two things. We talk about that internally a lot. But it really depends on how the capital markets are behaving. And the capital available for, say the emerging markets, so that this issue with Exim Bank, does not help the Boeing Company, for example, and then, therefore, has a direct reflection on us in terms of financing customers overseas. So hopefully, we get through that, we change that from a progressional standpoint and get that past. I think that would benefit that. So that has a bearing in terms of how these things are financed, and I think that's one aspect. The other aspect is how strong-willed the emerging markets, in particular China, be going forward because I think, a major thrust in terms of selling [indiscernible] out there is in China. But I will say that both Boeing and Airbus have 5 to 6 years of solid backlog. So I don't see a crash here. And so if there's some slowdown for whatever reason, we will enjoy the current rates that we're at for sure."

I'll begin by providing an overview of the quarter, including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino to go through the financial results in detail.
Let me start by acknowledging that we had several onetime charges this quarter, which were preannounced, amounting to some $22.7 million on a pretax basis. Nearly $12 million of this was related to the previously discussed extinguishment of our debt and the implementation of new credit facilities, which will save the company around $15 million annually going forward.
But the other costs bear us some further discussion. We booked a $10 million charge within our AeroStructures unit related to estimated cost overruns for the remaining contract period of the regional jet program. This is a program that has been problematic for quite some time and was aggressively bid originally.
While we remain in discussions with our customers about potential price adjustments, we're not optimistic that such negotiations will make this program profitable. So we're taking this charge even as we continue our discussions and we'll proceed through the contracted period, which is approximately one year. This is obviously a major disappointment.
We also booked a restructuring charge of approximately $800,000 related to a closure of 2 facilities over the coming months. The first being a small administrative office in St. Louis, and the second plant in Houston that primarily served the company's oil and gas market. Both locations are within the Ducommun and LaBarge Technologies units. We expect these closures and related organizational realignments to result in cost-benefits that should save the company $2 million to $3 million annually when fully implemented.
The Houston plant ceased the operations at the end of October, and was closed because it was not seen as being core to our business operations. The St. Louis facility closure will be completed in the first quarter of 2016.
Turning to our results. We experienced a significant drop in sales this period, both year-over-year and sequentially from the second quarter. Revenue was $162 million, reflecting a 27% year-over-year decrease in sales within our military and space end-use markets.
This is a recurring theme that has impacted nearly every platform we serve. The military decline and corporate's canceled programs, lower demand and schedule slides, which resulted in larger-than-expected drops, particularly across certain defense-related helicopter platforms.
We were unable to offset such shortfalls with the growth of our commercial aerospace markets, which remains robust, but we'll not see significant increases in sales until late 2016. The good news is that our backlog for the company has rebounded to the best level this year, over $550 million, due to strong commercial aerospace bookings in both the structures and electronics businesses.
We have more work to do as we prepare to emerge from this challenging period. We previously announced the headcount reductions and streamlining actions and supply chain initiatives that were to move $4 million to $5 million of annualized costs from our operations, over and above the additional $2 million to $3 million I just mentioned.
So we have a total budget of some $6 million to $8 million in cost reductions for the company with more work to be done in the fourth quarter. We're on schedule for the consolidation of our 3 upstate New York facilities this year, resulting in the state-of-the-art advanced titanium products manufacturing center. We expect to see efficiencies from this facility improving DAS margins in 2016.
We continue to assess every asset of our organization for cost reductions, consolidation opportunities and working capital improvements, and this means that we're also evaluating our product portfolio to determine what areas of our business are noncore, low-margin, low growth or otherwise not seen in keeping with what we see as a future for Ducommun.
With sales being adversely impacted by the military slowdown, now it's clearly the time to rightsize our company and make it stronger, leaner and more nimble. Obviously, we'll keep our shareholders apprised of any additional actions we deem warranted going forward.
Now I'll provide some market color for you on products and programs.
In the military and space sector, in the current environment, with lower U.S. military involvement overseas, general budget curtailments and shifting spending priorities has impacted both our fixed wing and our helicopter platforms across the board. Some of our longest-serving programs were down significantly this quarter compared to 2014. And the underlying reality is that such conditions are likely to continue to exist in the next year. We believe that current levels are a baseline for us, and we are not optimistic that near-term growth opportunities given the current defense spending moving forward. This is why we're undertaking an across-the-board look at our facilities and product portfolio. Nothing is being spared in our assessment of any ways to improve our performance or other areas for consolidation. In the meantime, we remain cautiously optimistic about the recently passed budget deal in Washington. We hope that this long-term agreement will bring some stability to the defense industry and presumably lead to possible procurements of upgrades and replacements for the many key aircraft platforms we serve. But this is clearly too early to have any clear picture in this regard.
Now we move to our commercial aerospace operations. Revenue this quarter was essentially flat year-over-year, primarily due to shipment timing as well as continued weakness in our commercial helicopter business. But we remain upbeat about our overall commercial aerospace operations. We're on track to post our highest annual revenue in this year. Our total company backlog, as I mentioned earlier, has rebounded to the best point in 2015 due to strong commercial bookings and our backlog here now stands at over $250 million. This reflects solid orders across many of our large platforms, including the Boeing 737, the 777 and the 787 programs as well as the A320 and various other Airbus programs. We continue to win additional content on these and other platforms, and believe the company remains in solid shape for further growth going forward.
We have strong and growing relationships with Boeing, Spirit, Airbus, Gulf Stream, Rolls-Royce, United Technologies and others. And we have over 30 new development programs in place, much of which we expect to benefit from the topline, starting late next year and into 2017.
In the interim, we will pursue additional opportunities to leverage our expanses [ph] , structure and electronics capabilities in this marketplace.
Turning to our non-A&D business, we again saw a mixed performance this quarter with continued weakness in our energy markets, somewhat offset by stability within areas, such as the industrial and medical fields. As I mentioned previously, we'll exit a large portion of the commodity energy business when we close our Houston facility. However, we still see opportunities for growth in this marketplace even given current market conditions.
Our non-A&D backlog stands at around $63 million as we target new business for this sector. We're also looking at additional cost reductions and consolidation opportunities as well as possible portfolio considerations.
Now before turning the call over to Joe, let me just mention that this is his last earnings call with us, as he's retiring at the end of 2015. I want to commend Joe for all he's done for Ducommun in these past 7 years. He truly has been an inspiration and an asset to the company as well as a personal friend. He's been instrumental in the completion of 2 acquisitions, 3 debt refinancings, which have been critical to strengthen our overall financial position. He is very well respected by everyone here as well as our investors, and we certainly wish him the best going forward. I will introduce his replacement, our current Chief Accounting Officer, Doug Groves next quarter, but we're all very pleased with the company's careful executed financial succession plan.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?"
267761,314056497,894529,"Ducommun Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Tony, and good day, everyone, and thanks for the kind words. Looking at the third quarter 2015 results, earlier today, we reported a net loss of $9.5 million or $0.86 per share for the current quarter. This compares to net income of $2.9 millio",1929,"Thank you, Tony, and good day, everyone, and thanks for the kind words. Looking at the third quarter 2015 results, earlier today, we reported a net loss of $9.5 million or $0.86 per share for the current quarter. This compares to net income of $2.9 million or $0.26 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2014. I'll get into the details in a moment, but as Tony mentioned, this reflects a pretax charge of $22.7 million, which is $1.28 per share on an after-tax basis and includes the following pretax charges: the recording of a $10 million forward loss reserve on a regional jet program; a $0.8 million restructuring charge; and an $11.9 million charge for debt extinguishment expenses incurred relative to our new debt structure, which we finalized during here in the third quarter.
Net sales for the third quarter of 2015 were approximately $162 million, that's roughly 14% lower than the comparable period in 2014. The revenue decline reflected a $26 million decrease in military and space revenues. In this area, we have seen reduced demand for both structural solutions and technology applications. This reflects lower aggregate government defense curtailments and shifting spending priorities.
Within the commercial aerospace arena by contrast, which was up slightly year-over-year, we continue to experience solid revenues as we benefit from the sustainable large commercial airframe build rates and increased content. During the quarter, we experienced significant growth in our commercial aerospace bookings, both in the structural and electronics solutions, largely contributing to our total backlog at quarter-end being nearly identical to year-end 2014.
We expect the current macro environment to be similar over the next few quarters. We had previously indicated that 2015 would be a transition year as we work through the decline in demand with our military and space end-use markets, streamlining operations, realizing supply chain efficiencies and cut costs to strengthen the company.
Excluding the forward loss reserve, our adjusted gross margins were 18.6% as compared to 17.6% in last year's comparable quarter, as we realize the benefits from actively managing this transition and from efforts to improve product mix, eliminate lower-margin products and reduce manufacturing expenses.
As we continue with profit improvement initiatives, we expect to sustain or potentially improve these gross margin levels.
We remain committed to addressing the issues in front of us and return to company profitability levels of which we're capable. This means further headcount reductions, lowering of indirect labor costs, improving our manufacturing performance and effective execution on certain new programs.
As Tony summarized, we have a total target of some $6 million to $8 million in cost reductions for the company with additional work underway. Our cost-cutting activities will continue as we remain committed to improving financial results in the fourth quarter of 2015 and beyond. We expect our New York facility consolidation project to be completed in the next few months. As a result of this move and other restructuring actions in progress, we expect to take an additional $1.7 million to $2 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter.
Ducommun's operating loss for the current quarter was approximately $1 million as compared to operating income of approximately $10 million in the third quarter of 2014. Excluding the $10 million forward loss reserve and a $0.8 million restructuring expenses, which did total $10.8 million, the current quarter operating income would be $9.6 million or 6% of revenues as compared to 5.3% of revenues in last year's third quarter. We are now seeing the benefits of the completion of our refinancing mid-year, and with the new debt structure, interest expenses were $3.4 million or 2% of revenue as compared to $7 million or 3.7% of revenue in last year's third quarter. We estimate interest expenses will be approximately $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Our effective income tax benefit during the quarter was 42.1% compared to 37.4% effective income tax rate for the comparable period last year. The higher rate reflects the pretax loss this year compared to pretax income in 2014. We expect the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 to average approximately 37%, excluding any potential benefit from the federal research and development tax credits. There is traction in Congress for approval of these credits for 2015 and 2016, which would be an additional benefit to us.
EBITDA was $5.5 million or 3.4% of revenue in the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the forward loss reserve and restructuring expenses, EBITDA would have been approximately $16 million or 10% of revenues as compared to $18.4 million or 9.8% of revenues in the third quarter of 2014.
Now looking at the individual business segments starting first with Ducommun AeroStructures or DAS, our Ducommun AeroStructures segment posted revenues of approximately $64 million for the quarter compared to $81.4 million in the third quarter of 2014. The lower revenue was primarily due to reductions in demand for our military helicopter applications, coincident with lower defense spending levels and sunsetting of 2 long cycle defense programs. Our commercial aerospace structural applications remain at record levels, while up just slightly year-over-year, they reflect certain timing differences regarding shipments.
We continue to meet the delivery requirements of the large commercial airframe manufacturers, primarily Airbus and Boeing, and we are positioned well to support the next level of increased build rates beginning in late 2016 and extending into 2017 and beyond.
The DAS operating segment loss for the quarter was $6 million compared to an operating income of $6.9 million for the third quarter of 2014. This decrease to an operating loss was primarily the result of a $9 million increase over last year's comparable quarter and forward loss reserves related to the regional jet program. In addition, DAS was impacted by approximately $3 million from an unfavorable product mix shift and $1 million in net expenses as we work through our cost-cutting efforts.
EBITDA for the DAS segment was negative $3.6 million for the quarter compared to $10.8 million or 13.3% of revenue for last year's third quarter.
Now turning to the Ducommun LaBarge Technologies, DLT business segment. Our DLT segment posted solid results, with operating income, EBITDA and corresponding margin improvement this quarter as compared to last year's comparable quarter. Revenue for the third quarter was $97.5 million compared to $106.8 million for the third quarter of 2014. The lower net revenue was primarily due to an approximate 14.6% decrease in military and space revenue, mainly due to lower sales of radar rack and defense helicopter electronic applications and an approximate 2% decrease in our overall nonaerospace and defense revenue, primarily from the energy sector, which is partially offset by a 5% increase in our commercial aerospace electronics solutions.
Through recent market development activities, we continue to enjoy increased demand for our commercial aerospace electronics applications with new customers.
In our non-A&D offerings, we have seen lower demand for our energy-related products over the last few quarters and expect that trend to continue well into 2016. However, offsetting this, we are experiencing solid backlog in other areas, including our medical and in our industrial applications.
DLT's operating income for the third quarter was $8.6 million or 8.8% of revenues compared to $8.3 million or 7.8% of revenues for the comparable period in 2014. As you heard earlier from Tony, there were also in our results for this quarter $0.8 million of the restructuring charges within this segment. We did benefit in all those key profitability measures due to a favorable product mix and lower compensation and benefit expenses, partially offset by loss of efficiencies from the lower manufacturing volumes.
EBITDA was approximately $13 million or 13.1% of revenue, an improvement from the $12.7 million or 11.9% of revenue in last year's comparable period.
We continue to focus on product mix improvement and achieving the supply chain savings to sustain profitability in the segment.
Corporate General and Administrative expenses that were allocated to the business for the third quarter were $3.7 million or 2.3% of total company revenue, a decrease from $5.1 million or 2.7% of total company revenue in the comparable period.
Now turning to our backlogs. Our overall backlog at the end of the quarter was $553 million, up from $524 million at the end of this year's second quarter. This was primarily driven by significant commercial aerospace orders. The increase reflects a combination of orders for existing programs and recent new awards as we continue to build our pipeline.
As I mentioned in previous calls, timing differences may impact quarterly reporting of backlogs, and at times, it may not truly reflect the strong underlying long-term demands for large commercial airframe products. Quarterly backlogs, even in long-term programs, now tend to be shorter in duration and lower in amounts than was previously the case. Despite that, we continue to work diligently to win additional orders across both our diverse commercial aerospace end markets and defense technology platforms.
Regarding liquidity and capital resources, in the first 9 months of 2015, we generated $12 million of cash from operations, including the $9.8 million that we used for the redemption of the $200 million senior unsecured notes in July. Excluding this $9.8 million redemption payment, we generated approximately $18.2 million in cash from operations for the first 9 months compared to $20.8 million during the comparable period in 2014. We remain diligent in effective working capital management, and we expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect historic seasonal patterns. At the end of the quarter, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA as defined was approximately 4.2:1.
One of the real financial highlights was our new capital structure, which involved completing a new credit facility at the end of the second quarter and finalizing with the redemption of new capital structure by taking out and redeeming in late July the 9.75% senior unsecured notes and replacing that with lower interest, new credit facilities, which we put in place in June. Upon completion of the refinancing, we had $275 million outstanding on the term loan and an unused balance on our revolver. Since that time, we have paid down $25 million in the third quarter, and here in the fourth quarter already, we have paid down an additional $10 million since then, reducing our outstanding debt currently to $250 million. In addition, we have approximately $198 million of liquidity.
We are very pleased with the debt structure as it provides greater financial flexibility to execute strategic initiatives and it creates shareholder value by significantly reducing interest expenses.
At this stage, we continue toward our goal of deleveraging to targets of $2.25 million to $2.5 million by the end of 2017. Capital expenditures year-to-date for the 9 months were just under $13 million, and for the year, we expect this amount to be around $15 million. Our capital expenditure spending this year primarily reflects the consolidation and expansion of our upstate New York operations, resulting in a state-of-the-art advanced titanium products center of excellence.
In closing, we continue to focus on managing the changing mix in our business and are working to realize lower manufacturing costs throughout our operations. We also expect to see annualized cost savings of $6 million to $8 million beginning in the fourth quarter through our streamlining initiatives to help drive higher operating and EBITDA margins.
In addition, we remain diligent with regard to expense management and working capital efficiencies, which, along with our significantly lower interest expenses, should generate meaningful free cash flow going forward.
Now I'd like to turn the program back over to Tony. Tony?"

So on the programs, going forward, we have doublecheck system that we are going back and making sure that we are hitting the margins that we quoted in terms of our cost inputs and coming down the learning curves that we anticipated. So we do thorough reviews, and in some cases on a monthly basis and in some cases on a quarterly basis, depending on the program. So I think that internally there has been program reviews.

We may have some tooling adjustments. We are evaluating that now. We're going through rate readiness with both customers, both Airbus and Boeing as we look at tooling requirements, so there may be some adjustments in tooling to make sure that we hit those higher rates and then work our way through that. But in terms of capitalization, we're pretty well capitalized. We will be capitalizing over next year and the following year for new business programs that we brought online. But those are for brand-new applications as opposed to existing business base. But that's all part of the bid process when we bid the program. 
Now in terms of the commercial market and where we see that in terms of the growth rates, again, I think it depends on 2 things. We talk about that internally a lot. But it really depends on how the capital markets are behaving. And the capital available for, say the emerging markets, so that this issue with Exim Bank, does not help the Boeing Company, for example, and then, therefore, has a direct reflection on us in terms of financing customers overseas. So hopefully, we get through that, we change that from a progressional standpoint and get that past. I think that would benefit that. So that has a bearing in terms of how these things are financed, and I think that's one aspect. The other aspect is how strong-willed the emerging markets, in particular China, be going forward because I think, a major thrust in terms of selling [indiscernible] out there is in China. But I will say that both Boeing and Airbus have 5 to 6 years of solid backlog. So I don't see a crash here. And so if there's some slowdown for whatever reason, we will enjoy the current rates that we're at for sure."

I know that you're looking for some numbers. But what we're doing is working through that. We still have some additional costs that we have to work through as we consolidate that facility. But we have it laid out, I think, from an extremely lean performance standpoint, and I think that when we look at this business, we'll be much more efficient in the flow of that business and be able to take on additional new business as well. So we think that we'll get some marginal improvement. Again, when you get marginal improvement at a business unit, the reflection of top takes a little bit at the DAS level. So it may not be as great there, but we're expecting to see some margin improvement within that business segment itself."

This is what we've done as we've tied into a distributor [indiscernible] that will help us penetrate markets. There's 2 elements to it.

But it is something that we're looking at in the non-A&D marketplace where we have the ability to sell our own products. In most cases, Dan, we're -- and the non-A&D where we'll make the print business similar to our aerospace market.

So we're bullish on this. If this happens, we think, it will add a lot of stability for the marketplace. How much of an upswing will happen in the marketplace? I doubt if there's going to be a big upswing, but it certainly will add the funding to the programs that need to be funded, and will put us in a position to have a better predictability on the programs going forward."

One is, we're very heavy into the missile-defense side a bit, and we continue to penetrate that marketplace and we think the budget will help stabilize that and put us in a position to continue to pursue the applications that we are pursuing in the development program. The other one is in the modernization. I think, there will be more money in some of the monetization programs that we're working on and developing. And the release of the Bombardier contract, I think that bodes well. We are bullish on that. And that's a long-term development program, but I think that's really been a nice pickup and I think that will benefit our business going forward. So we're really solid on that.
