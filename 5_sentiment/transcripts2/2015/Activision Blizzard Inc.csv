In fact, at that time, the Internet was creating great amounts of wealth, in fact, what we would consider more wealth creation than we've seen",793,"Thank you, Kristin. 15 years ago, our investors had very little interest in video games or videogame companies. In fact, at that time, the Internet was creating great amounts of wealth, in fact, what we would consider more wealth creation than we've seen in modern commerce. And companies without page views and click throughs were very out-of-favor. We thought it will be a good time to start an Investor Relations program but we had a very difficult time finding anybody that actually wanted to run it. And so we told the recruiter to start looking for out-of-favor industries, industries that were out-of-favor videogames, and they couldn't find any anymore out-of-favor industry then tobacco. So fortunately, for our shareholders, we were able to pry away from Philip Morris Kristin Southey, who thought it would be more fun to expel to virtues of videogames than investing in tobacco. 
When Kristin joined in March 2000, the company had a market value of $337 million. During her tenure, the stock has grown at a compound annual rate of 23% versus the S&P at 4%, and at a rate that's greater than the rate of growth at half the way, which, as you know, is our benchmark for almost everything. 
Kristin has protected our treasury, just collected our receivables with a small trade of bad debt writeoffs of any major company in the videogame industry, and for me, she's always been a fantastic professional, great partner and a pleasure to work with. Kristin has decided to take some time off, something that her work ethic has never allowed her to do during her 15 years that she's been with the company. Both Brian and I are very incredibly grateful for all her contribution and I'll miss her greatly. She has assured me, however, that purely for our own personal enjoyment, she continues -- she will continue to keep all of you analyst in line, especially Michael Pachter. 
She's handing the reigns over to someone terrific and we're confident that Amrita will make Kristin proud as she leads our IR program and protect the legacy Kristin has created as one of the world's great IR efforts. 
So everyone in the room, welcome and meet Amrita, and thank you, Kristin, for all of your great contributions, for your extraordinary service, for your unyielding effort and for your incredible commitment to the principles of creating true stakeholder value. Thank you. 
And now, I get to share of our record results. So of course, we'll be reviewing in detail in a moment our record results, but we had another incredibly successful year. We had record results across a number of different areas. We introduced new franchises without sending game play. We expanded on new higher-margin business models. We continued investing in some of the world's most important entertainment franchise and we continue to attract extraordinarily talented people to our company. 
In terms of results, on a non-GAAP basis, we delivered record earnings per share, which increased more than 50% from the previous year, double-digit revenue growth and higher-margin record digital revenues that represents an all-time high of 46% of total revenues, and we produced more great content in 2014 than ever before. Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare was the #1 release of the year and a franchise's cumulative revenue is now over $11 billion. Destiny was #3 new release of the year and attracted over 16 million of registered users. Skylanders, with over 240 million toys sold life-to-date was, again, the #1 kids console game. World of Warcraft reached over 10 million subscribers and remains the #1 subscription-based MMORPG in the world. Diablo III is the #1 PC role-playing game of the year; and Hearthstone, which is named game of the year, has already attracted more than 25 million registered players. 
Last year, we launched 2 of the most successful new entertainment brands, Destiny and Blizzard's Hearthstone. Combined, they attracted over 40 million registered players worldwide and generated more than $850 million in non-GAAP revenue, a testament to our team's proven abilities to capture the imaginations of millions of people around the world time and time again. 
This year, we expect to expand our leading franchise portfolio to 10, up from 5 franchises at the beginning of 2014. Our amazingly talented teams will continue to produce the world's best content for gamers. 
And today, our board has once again increased our dividend, authorized a $750 million share repurchase program and the repayment of another quarter of $1 billion of our debt. Today, we've return nearly $10 billion to our shareholders in dividends and repurchases since 2008. We have a growing portfolio at the very best entertainment franchises and great confidence in our long-term future. I'll now turn the call over to Dennis."

Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our Q4 and full year 2014 financial results, and then I will review our outlook for 2015. 2014 was a very important year that delivered strong financial results that exceeded our outlook, while",1819,"Thanks, Bobby. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our Q4 and full year 2014 financial results, and then I will review our outlook for 2015. 2014 was a very important year that delivered strong financial results that exceeded our outlook, while setting the stage for growth in the years to come. In 2014, on a non-GAAP basis, we generated double-digit revenue growth, record digital revenues of 32% operating margin, a record EPS, which is up more than 50% year-over-year and operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion. From a capital perspective, we strengthened our balance sheet, paid a record dividend to shareholder, repaid $375 million of our debt and continued to invest in the strongest pipeline of new opportunities with high-margin potential in our history. 
Our financial performance was driven by our strong diversified product portfolio. This year, our top franchise has maintained their leadership positions, and we successfully expanded our portfolio of IP with Destiny and Hearthstone, which drove more than 850 million in combined non-GAAP revenue. 
Turning to our financial results. Please refer to our earnings release for full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. Also, the numbers I will be quoting are compared to the year prior, unless otherwise noted. Please also note that all percentages are based on revenues, except for the tax rate. 
Our Q4 results exceeded our outlook and were driven by Activision Publishing's Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Skylanders Trap Team and continued sales of Destiny. In addition, Blizzard's World of Warcraft and Hearthstone also had a strong sales in the quarter. For Q4, on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.57 billion and an operating margin of 28%. We had interest expense of $50 million and our tax rate was 7%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted share count was $741 million and GAAP EPS was a record $0.49. 
In Q4, the weakening of foreign currencies against the dollar did not have a significant impact on our results due in part to our hedging program, however, the lower euro and British pound rates will impact our outlook for the full year of 2015, which I will discuss in a moment. 
On a non-GAAP basis, for the quarter, we generated revenues of $2.21 billion, an operating margin of 41%. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 19% and our quarterly non-GAAP EPS was a record $0.94. 
Our solid Q4 results capped a better-than-expected year. For the full year on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $4.41 billion, operating income of $1.18 billion, a tax rate of 15% and record EPS of $1.13. 
On a non-GAAP basis for the year, we grew revenues 11% year-over-year to $4.81 billion. Digital revenues grew 40% [ph] year-over-year and accounted for a record 46% [ph] of total revenues. Our strong growth in digital revenue was driven by new and growing high-margin opportunities, including game downloads for consoles, in-game purchases from our first free-to-play game Hearthstone, and new offerings for World of Warcraft, including the pay character boost. 
Our non-GAAP operating income was $1.53 billion reflecting an operating margin of 32%, adjusted EBITDA margin of 33% with adjusted EBITDA being defined as non-GAAP operating income plus depreciation. Our tax rate was 20% and our EPS was a record $1.42. 12 months ago, when we gave our original non-GAAP outlook, it was $4.6 billion in revenue and $1.26 in EPS. So this year we again exceeded our additional guidance with non-GAAP revenues exceeding our outlook by $213 million and non-GAAP EPS exceeding our original outlook by $0.16 or 13%. 
In terms of cash flow, it was another solid year where we generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion and free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. 
Turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, we had approximately $4.9 billion in cash and investments, of which $1.2 billion was held domestically. We had gross debt outstanding of $4.4 billion and net cash of approximately $500 million. And today, based on the strength of our balance sheet and confidence in our long-term performance, our Board of Directors approved 3 important capital allocation matters. Specifically, they authorized the $250 million repayment of part of our term loan, which we expect will be paid in Fabian February; authorized the 2 years, $700 million -- $750 million share repurchase program and approved an increased to our cash dividend per share to a record $0.23, a 15% increase over last year, which will be payable in May. 
Now let's turn to our outlook. This year, we expect Activision Publishing to launch more content than it has in many years. The first launch of the year was Call of Duty Online for China. While we model minimal financial contributions from COD Online in our 2015 expectations, we and our partner, Tencent, are very excited about the long-term prospects of the game. This type of free-to-play opportunity takes time to ramp to full popularity and our focus in 2015 will be on building and growing the audience before meaningful monetization. 
For Destiny, we expect to release an expansion pack in Q2 and to launch more new content in the back half of the year. 
With respect to Call of Duty, this is an important year for the franchise as we expect release multiple mack packs, microtransactions content and an exciting new game in Q4 from one of our top development teams. 
For modeling purposes, we're planning on sales to be consistent with the Advanced Warfare. 
Additionally, in Q4, we expect to release an innovative new Skylanders game. And finally, we are working on several unannounced initiatives that we will say more about in the months ahead. 
In 2014, Blizzard generated record avenues and near-record operating income. The year was driven by Diablo III: Reaper of Souls and World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor, both of which generated significant revenues and income that will not have comparable releases this year. 
In addition, we expect Wild Stops to decline as we have seen historically in the year following the release of a large-scale expansion. 
In terms of new releases, in January, Heroes of the Storm Blizzard second free-to-play game entered closed data. While we expect it will take time to ramp in monetization as it builds its audience, we are very excited about the opportunity we have in front of us for this game. 
In addition, this year, Blizzard will continue to release new content for Hearthstone as well as bringing the game to mobile devices later in the year. 
Lastly, Overwatch, which is just announced in November, is expected to go into closed beta later this year, but we are very excited about this new franchise. It has not been factored into our outlook. 
Finally, Blizzard will continue to invest in our own distribution platform, Battle.net, which will need to support a significantly larger audience and commercial capabilities going forward. 
So before we review the 2015 numbers, I want to highlight a couple of important things. First our planning assumption this year is for our tax rate to revert back to our normal long-term target of around 24%, up from 2014 where the strong international performance from Blizzard and the R&D tax credit drilled the rate lower. And second, as I mentioned earlier, there will be meaningful impact on our results year-over-year due to the weakness in the euro and to a lesser extent, the pound. Approximately 50% of our annual revenues are generated overseas and even higher percentage of our operating income is international. 
As the vast majority of our product development and headcount cost are U.S. based, we have fewer natural cost offsets to dampen the impact of currency translation. To put the decline in perspective, for 2014, the average euro-dollar exchange rate was $1.33, and today, our outlook assumes the euro rate of $1.13 for the balance of calendar year 2015. 
As such, our revenues and earnings will be translated to dollars at a much lower levels than in 2014.  This decline is somewhat offset by our hedging activities which are reflected in our outlook. 
Now let's review our 2015 numbers, which are based on spot rates as reflected in our slide deck. Note that revenue and EPS will increase if the euro or pound strengthens versus the U.S. dollar. 
For 2015, we expect GAAP revenues of $4.1 billion, product cost of 24% and operating expenses of 51% GAAP. For both GAAP and non-GAAP, we expect interest expense of $201 million, and [indiscernible] weighted average share count of $750 million.  Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 21% and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.89. 
On a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.4 billion, dollar cost of 25% and operating expense of 45%. We expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 30% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 33%. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 24% this year, and non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.15. 
To put the numbers in perspective, in 2015, FX accounts for 6 percentage points of the 9% decline of our non-GAAP revenue. Operationally, revenues are down slightly due to a lighter slate investments in infrastructure and scaling of new properties with free-to-play business models. In 2015, as I mentioned, we expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.15. Note that $0.14 of the year-over-year decline is due to FX translation and $0.08 is due primarily to the higher tax rate. At constant currency and tax rate, EPS will be down approximately $0.05 year-over-year. 
Turning to our quarterly outlook. In 2015, we expect a lighter first half of the year as compared to last year as we don't have a comparable launch to the high-margin Diablo III: Reaper of Souls and we only expect modest contributions from Call of Duty Online and Heroes of the Storm, as I mentioned earlier. On a GAAP basis, for the March quarter, we expect net revenues of $1.14 billion, product cost of 28%, operating expenses of 38%.  We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $50 million, a GAAP tax rate of 20%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $745 million and GAAP EPS of $0.37. 
For the March quarter on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $640 million, product cost of 22% and operating expenses of 2%[ph]  . We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.05. 
So in summary, Activision Blizzard delivered record financial results during its transformational year. In 2015, despite currency headwinds, we expect strong industry fundamentals, continued expansion and investment in our franchise portfolio while keeping a keen eye on comps and a laser focus on execution. Today, we are well positioned to capitalize on the large and growing global opportunity in front of us. And we believe the investments we are making in 2015 will drive growth and revenue, operating margin and EPS in 2016 and beyond. Now I will turn the call over to Eric to discuss Activision Publishing."
4222231,281248772,756234,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dennis. Activision Publishing had another record-breaking and industry-leading year. The North America and Europe combined, Activision Publishing was the #1 retail publisher and had 3 of the top 5 best-selling new releases of 2014. With #1 Call",861,"Thanks, Dennis. Activision Publishing had another record-breaking and industry-leading year. 
The North America and Europe combined, Activision Publishing was the #1 retail publisher and had 3 of the top 5 best-selling new releases of 2014. With #1 Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare; #3, Destiny; and #5 Skylanders Trap Team when including toys and accessories. 
Starting with Call of Duty. We want to thank our growing community of millions of Call of Duty players for making Advanced Warfare the #1 console game globally, which has delivered well over $1 billion in sell-through, and far and away the #1 title worldwide on NexGen platforms. 
As we anticipated and discussed on our last earnings call and as we saw across the industry, old gen sales to retail were down year-on-year, but for this year, we expect next gen growth to easily offset that dynamic. Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare was the first game released on our new 3-year development cycle and, as a result, was one of the most highly acclaimed Call of Duty games in recent years. We're also looking forward to a very strong season of digital content for Advanced Warfare starting with our first digital mat pack release, Havoc, which launched last Tuesday and included a new zombies co-op experience. 
I'm happy to report that sales so far are up double-digit percentages year-on-year, both for standalone mat packs and for season pass. 
And looking ahead to this year's holiday release, while we're not yet ready to discuss it fully today, we're excited to announce that we made by the team at word. It was last 2 games Black Ops and Black Ops 2 remained the biggest selling titles in franchise history. This game will be word's first on the 3-year development cycle, they will be loaded with innovation and we're excited to share more details with our community soon. 
In January, we brought the largest videogame franchise in the west to the largest videogame audience in the world with the release of Call of Duty Online in China. This is Activision Publishing's first major entry into one of the fastest-growing business models in our industry, free-to-play. While too early to project the performance, and we expect meaningful contribution will grow over time, initial consumer momentum is positive. The Baidu Index, which measures the volume of searches on China's main search engine and is widely cited as indicated for brand's momentum, puts Call of Duty Online on par with the rollout of League of Legends. 
Now, let's turn to Destiny. Along with our partners at Bungie, we broke industry records as Destiny became the biggest intellectual property launched in videogame history, and was the third biggest new release of the year in North America and Europe combined. Destiny has over 16 million registered users with a massive audience of active players still averaging over 3 hours of game play per day, a figure that has stayed remarkably stable since launch.  Destiny also performed the rarely seen console gaming feat of growing active players from November to December, driven by the release of the new expansion pack, the Dark Below. And it was the #1 played game in North America on a PS4 in December. 
In Q2, we expect to launch the game second expansion pack, House of Wolves, and later this year, we will announce a major content release for the fall, so stay tuned. 
On to our third Temple franchise, Skylanders. As of today, retail sales for Skylanders has exceeded $3 billion. And in 2014, Skylanders outsold all action figure lines and with the #1 kid console game globally for the fourth year in a row, and as a franchise, outperformed its nearest competitor by 30%. 
Skylanders Trap Team are far release outsold its nearest competitor by 17% and continued the incredible streak of breakthrough innovation in the franchise and was also one of the most highly acclaimed Skylanders games today. 
This year, our toy sales grew as the unique mechanic of bring me toys and traps to life has kids and parents buy more toys and accessories than ever before. We expect to benefit from the next gen installed base growth in 2015, and later this year, we will announce our next main release with yet another breakthrough innovation for the category. 
So in closing, over the last 3 years, Activision Publishing has methodically expanded its portfolio, and for the first time in its history, now has 3 tentpole properties, each of which generated over $500 million in non-GAAP revenue this year and drove the highest digital revenues in Activision Publishing's history. We expect Call of Duty Online in China will become an important new revenue contributor and lead the way with new play dynamics and business models. We also have multiple unannounced initiatives in development, which we will reveal later in the year. Finally, across our Temple franchise which Activision Publishing now has set over 70 million players playing over 4 billion hours a year, a massive audience with a depth engagement that we expect to continue to grow and monetize over the coming years. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Mike Morhaime to talk about Blizzard."
4222231,281248772,756234,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Eric. Thanks for the efforts of our dedicated and talented employees around the world. Blizzard Entertainment delivered one of our most successful years ever. In 2014, we released award winning expansions, World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor",819,"Thank you, Eric. Thanks for the efforts of our dedicated and talented employees around the world. Blizzard Entertainment delivered one of our most successful years ever. In 2014, we released award winning expansions, World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor, on Windows and Macs, and Diablo III: Reaper of Souls on Windows, Mac and consoles. We also launched our first free-to-play game, Hearthstone, which has collected game of the year awards and nominations as well. Hearthstone was released first on the Windows and Mac and later on iPad and Android tablets bringing Blizzard into the mobile space for the first time. Additionally, we supported Hearthstone with 2 major content releases, the Curse of Naxxramas Adventure and Goblins vs Gnomes, our first expansion. 
Our success across multiple game genres and platforms in 2014 drove Blizzard's best-ever annual revenue, and more importantly, helped us continue expanding our global community of gamers. 
On the World of Warcraft side, we ended the year with the release of Warlords of Draenor in November. As we previously announced, the expansion was a great success in all regions pushing the global player base above 10 million. The introduction of the character boost as well as design updates to the game made it much easier for lapsed players to return to World of Warcraft and quickly reintegrate themselves into the community. 
Looking ahead, we're already preparing new content and features to support the game in the coming months. 
As with previous expansions, we do anticipate a decline in subscribership in the coming months, particularly out of Asia, where the subscriber base has been more fluid. 
Moving on to Hearthstone. The game continued to excite and attract players around the world. After announcing the Goblins vs Gnomes expansion at BlizzCon in November, we launched it a few weeks later in December. 
This was followed shortly after with the Android tablet version of the game. All this activity help drive Hearthstone highest monthly active players ever in December as well as our highest revenue quarter-to-date for Hearthstone. 
Registered players for the game have now reached over 25 million, capping off a spectacular start for Hearthstone. It's gratifying for us to see how the global Blizzard community has responded to our first foray into a new genre as well as the free-to-play market and gaming on tablet. 
We'll keep working hard to build on last year's momentum with more content in 2015 as well as the upcoming Android phone and iPhone versions of the game. 
We do have another free-to-play game in the pipeline with Heroes of the Storm, our online team brawler. This is a genre that's proven to be very popular in the online space in recent years. We're excited to put our unique spin on this genre in a game that stands out from the rest, with highly accessible play and iconic Blizzard characters from the Warcraft, StarCraft and Diablo universes. 
Heroes of the Storm has recently hit some major development milestones including the start up closed beta in January, along with sales of the founders pack, a digital bundle for $39.99 that gives player an array of heroes, skins and other content as well as instant access to the beta test. 
We're continuing to ramp up our infrastructure and game service capabilities, allowing us to open up the game to more of the 9 million players who have signed up for beta testing. 
Excitement around here continues to build as we're seeing more grassroots tournaments pop up and major east sport entities are already creating professional team sport for the game. 
Looking further ahead, we gave the world a glimpse of what's next for Blizzard at BlizzCon. We kicked off the show by unveiling Overwatch, a team-based first-person shooter featuring an amazing cast of characters of heroes and set in an all-new Blizzard game universe. 
The announcement trailer for Overwatch was a viral sensation on the Internet, while attendees and press alike raved about the gameplay after trying an early build on the BlizzCon show floor. 
In addition to Overwatch, we also showcased the final chapter in the StarCraft 2 trilogy, Legacy of the Void.  This will be a standalone expansion, meaning anyone can jump right in to the StarCraft II experience without needing to own the previous games. We expect beta testing for both Overwatch and Legacy of the Void to start later this year. 
For a while now, we've been discussing the strong pipeline of Blizzard games. Gamers have long known us for World of Warcraft, StarCraft and Diablo. Now with Hearthstone added to the mix and Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch soon to follow, we will have more games and more genres and on more platforms than ever before. As busy and successful as 2014 was, we're looking to build on that momentum this year and deliver even more excitement to players in 2015. 
Thanks, and I'll turn the call over to Thomas."

Before we open the call to questions, I'll take a moment to summarize the 3 key takeaways from today's call. First, from a financial perspective, 2014 was an excellent year for Activision Blizzard: Repeat our plan, deliver double-digit top line growth, grow EPS by 50% a new records and strengthened our balance sheet by generating $1.3 billion of operating cash flow and paying down debt. Second, from a strategic perspective, our investments into new franchises are paying off. We created 2 new Temple franchises with Destiny and Hearthstone that are profitable right out of the gate. Destiny and Hearthstone also had great comp and toplines that we expect to contribute to our results every year in a significant way. For perspective, only 1 year ago, 3 franchises generated the vast majority of our revenues and operating income. During 2014, it's expanded that to 6 franchises, and for 2015, we expect this number to grow to 10. Third, we have been, and we will continue to, reposition our investments priorities against fast-growing business model, platform and geographic opportunities that has proven profitable scale. We're already leading in digital sales, including microtransactions, value-added services and full game digital downloads, with a strong pipeline of free-to-play games coming to market in 2015 with Heroes of the Storm and Call of Duty Online. This also positions us well for the fast-growing geography, which is Asia, place the dominant business model. From a platform perspective, mobile and tablet has also moved up in our priority list, and we're excited to success Hearthstone has had on tablets and look forward to the rollout on Android and iOS phones. 
So in summary, while our outlook for 2015 is significantly impacted by adverse exchange rate movements, we expect profitable growth to resume in 2016 and beyond based on the continued expansion of our franchise portfolio, particularly active free-to-play in China and mobile, along with an anticipated return to growth in the console softer market and continued growth in higher-margin digital revenues. So now we'll take a few questions."

Also Advanced Warfare is a great game, it was really well received by both critics and fans, and it created a lot of positive buzz for the franchise, and we attached at franchise high-levels to the next gen consoles which I think is what matters most when we're looking towards the future. So actually, I think the franchise ended the year in a great place, and we entered 2015 with a lot of momentum. 2014 was the height of the console transition, so I think compared to years when we're selling, when Call of Duty was able to sell to a much larger and more stable install base is not an apples-to-apples comparison. Our 2015 guidance on Call of Duty new releases flat year-over-year, but we still have a fairly conservative developing the game. We have Traerc developing the game, we will have a larger install base and next gen Harbour to sell into, and we believe our Q4 new release can be one of our best games yet, so we think the future's bright."

But we believe we have 3 important advantages in relation to that competition. One is what I think, at this point needs to be seen as our proven ability to out-innovate competitors. Critics and fans have both acclaimed our recent titles to that end, and we believe that the most important reason we've been able to stay on top of the categories that we've had the best games in the category, and we plan to continue that trend in 2015. Number two is that we're not constrained by the limitations of existing intellectual property or characters or anyone else's release slate. We only have to answer one question each and every time we design a game, which is what do we think will be the most fun experience for our fans to have. And three, while there's more competition, I also think it's notable that we are able to grow our on the revenue per user this year through new game play innovation like the introduction of Traps, and we plan to continue to do some other things like that in the future."

As I mentioned in my comments, the Baidu Index puts Call of Duty Online on par with the rollout of League of Legends in terms of consumer interest, which is a great start. It's been just over 3 weeks since we launched and we're still an open beta, so as I said, it's too early for us to share any financial metrics, but we're optimistic. In terms of 2015 guidance, we assume modest contributions from Call of Duty Online but that's simply because, even with the most successful free-to-play games in the market, they've taken time to build revenue to expand their audiences. So we feel fortunate that Tencent has the strongest track record in that market, and I think you can look to games like Crossfire or League of Legends to see how the early ramp up occurs for large successful games in the Chinese market. That's the ramp takes up to buildup but one that is ultimately significant and worth it."

As I mentioned, we have a second expansion pack on the way and a major content release coming in the fall  and a very robust pipeline planned after that.

So fortunately, for our shareholders, we were able to pry away from Philip Morris Kristin Southey, who thought it would be more fun to expel the virtues of video games than investing in tobacco. 
When Kristin joined in March 2000, the company had a market value of $337 million. During her tenure, the stock has grown at a compound annual rate of 23% versus the S&P at 4%, and at a rate that's greater than the rate of growth at  Berkshire Hathaway, which, as you know, is our benchmark for almost everything. 
Kristin has protected our treasury, she has collected our receivables with the smallest rate of bad debt writeoffs of any major company in the video game industry, and for me, she's always been a fantastic professional, great partner and a pleasure to work with. Kristin has decided to take some time off, something that her work ethic never allowed her to do during her 15 years that she's been with the company. Both Brian and I are very incredibly grateful for all her contribution and I'll miss her greatly. She has assured me, however, that purely for our own personal enjoyment, she continues -- she will continue to keep all of you analyst in line, especially Michael Pachter. 
She's handing the reigns over to someone terrific and we're confident that Amrita will make Kristin proud as she leads our IR program and protect the legacy Kristin has created as one of the world's great IR efforts. 
So everyone in the room will welcome, meet -- welcome, Amrita, and thank you, Kristin, for all of your great contributions, for your extraordinary service, for your unyielding effort and for your incredible commitment to the principles of creating true stakeholder value. Thank you. 
And now, I get to share of our record results. So of course, we'll be reviewing in detail in a moment our record results, but we had another incredibly successful year. We had record results across a number of different areas. We introduced new franchises with outstanding game play. We expanded on new higher-margin business models. We continued investing in some of the world's most important entertainment franchise, and we continue to attract extraordinarily talented people to our company. 
In terms of results, on a non-GAAP basis, we delivered record earnings per share, which increased more than 50% from the previous year, double-digit revenue growth and higher-margin record digital revenues that represents an all-time high of 46% of total revenues, and we produced more great content in 2014 than ever before. Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare was the #1 release of the year and the franchise's cumulative revenue is now over $11 billion. Destiny was the #3 new release of the year and attracted over 16 million of registered users. Skylanders, with over 240 million toys sold life to date was, again, the #1 kids console game. World of Warcraft reached over 10 million subscribers and remains the #1 subscription-based MMORPG in the world. Diablo III is the #1 PC role-playing game of the year; and Hearthstone, which is named Game of the Year, has already attracted more than 25 million registered players. 
Last year, we launched 2 of the most successful new entertainment brands, Destiny and Blizzard's Hearthstone. Combined, they attracted over 40 million registered players worldwide and generated more than $850 million in non-GAAP revenue, a testament to our team's proven abilities to capture the imaginations of millions of people around the world time and time again. 
This year, we expect to expand our leading franchise portfolio to 10, up from 5 franchises at the beginning of 2014. Our amazingly talented teams will continue to produce the world's best content for gamers. 
And today, our board has once again increased our dividend, authorized a $750 million share repurchase program and the repayment of another $0.25 billion of our debt. Today, we've return nearly $10 billion to our shareholders in dividends and repurchases since 2008. We have a growing portfolio at the very best entertainment franchises and great confidence in our long-term future. I'll now turn the call over to Dennis."

Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our Q4 and full year 2014 financial results, and then I will review our outlook for 2015. 2014 was a very important year that delivered strong financial results that exceeded our outlook, whi",1819,"Thanks, Bobby. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our Q4 and full year 2014 financial results, and then I will review our outlook for 2015. 
2014 was a very important year that delivered strong financial results that exceeded our outlook, while setting the stage for growth in the years to come. In 2014, on a non-GAAP basis, we generated double-digit revenue growth, record digital revenues, a 32% operating margin, a record EPS, which is up more than 50% year-over-year and operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion. 
From a capital perspective, we strengthened our balance sheet, paid a record dividend to shareholder, repaid $375 million of our debt and continued to invest in the strongest pipeline of new opportunities with high-margin potential in our history. 
Our financial performance was driven by our strong diversified product portfolio. This year, our top franchise has maintained their leadership positions, and we successfully expanded our portfolio of IP with Destiny and Hearthstone, which drove more than $850 million in combined non-GAAP revenue. 
Turning to our financial results. Please refer to our earnings release for full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. Also, the numbers I will be quoting are compared to the year prior, unless otherwise noted. Please also note that all percentages are based on revenues, except for the tax rate. 
Our Q4 results exceeded our outlook and were driven by Activision Publishing's Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Skylanders Trap Team and continued sales of Destiny. In addition, Blizzard's World of Warcraft and Hearthstone also had a strong sales in the quarter. For Q4, on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.57 billion and an operating margin of 28%. We had interest expense of $50 million and our tax rate was 7%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted share count was 741 million and GAAP EPS was a record $0.49. 
In Q4, the weakening of foreign currencies against the dollar did not have a significant impact on our results due in part to our hedging program, however, the lower euro and British pound rates will impact our outlook for the full year of 2015, which I will discuss in a moment. 
On a non-GAAP basis, for the quarter, we generated revenues of $2.21 billion, an operating margin of 41%. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 19% and our quarterly non-GAAP EPS was a record $0.94. 
Our solid Q4 results capped a better-than-expected year. For the full year on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $4.41 billion, operating income of $1.18 billion, a tax rate of 15% and record EPS of $1.13.
 
On a non-GAAP basis for the year, we grew revenues 11% year-over-year to $4.81 billion. Digital revenues grew 40% year-over-year and accounted for a record 46% of total revenues. Our strong growth in digital revenue was driven by new and growing high-margin opportunities, including game downloads for consoles, in-game purchases from our first free-to-play game Hearthstone, and new offerings for World of Warcraft, including the pay character boost. 
Our non-GAAP operating income was $1.53 billion, reflecting an operating margin of 32%, adjusted EBITDA margin of 33% with adjusted EBITDA being defined as non-GAAP operating income plus depreciation. Our tax rate was 20% and our EPS was a record $1.42. 
12 months ago, when we gave our original non-GAAP outlook, it was $4.6 billion in revenue and $1.26 in EPS. So this year, we again exceeded our initial guidance with non-GAAP revenues exceeding our outlook by $213 million and non-GAAP EPS exceeding our original outlook by $0.16 or 13%. 
In terms of cash flow, it was another solid year where we generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion and free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. 
Turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, we had approximately $4.9 billion in cash and investments, of which $1.2 billion was held domestically. We had gross debt outstanding of $4.4 billion and net cash of approximately $500 million. And today, based on the strength of our balance sheet and confidence in our long-term performance, our Board of Directors approved 3 important capital allocation matters. Specifically, they authorized the $250 million repayment of part of our term loan, which we expect will be paid in February; authorized the 2 years, $700 million -- $750 million share repurchase program and approved an increased to our cash dividend per share to a record $0.23, a 15% increase over last year, which will be payable in May. 
Now let's turn to our outlook. This year, we expect Activision Publishing to launch more content than it has in many years. The first launch of the year was Call of Duty Online for China. While we model minimal financial contributions from COD Online in our 2015 expectations, we and our partner, Tencent, are very excited about the long-term prospects of the game. This type of free-to-play opportunity takes time to ramp to full popularity and our focus in 2015 will be on building and growing the audience before meaningful monetization. 
For Destiny, we expect to release an expansion pack in Q2 and to launch more new content in the back half of the year. With respect to Call of Duty, this is an important year for the franchise as we expect release multiple Map Packs, microtransactions content and an exciting new game in Q4 from one of our top development teams. 
For modeling purposes, we were planning on sales to be consistent with the Advanced Warfare. Additionally, in Q4, we expect to release an innovative new Skylanders' game. And finally, we are working on several unannounced initiatives that we will say more about in the months ahead. 
In 2014, Blizzard generated record avenues and near-record operating income. The year was driven by Diablo III: Reaper of Souls and World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor, both of which generated significant revenues and income that will not have comparable releases this year. In addition, we expect wild subs [ph] to decline as we have seen historically in the year following the release of a large-scale expansion. 
In terms of new releases, in January, Heroes of the Storm Blizzard second free-to-play game entered closed beta. While we expect it will take time to ramp in monetization as it builds its audience, we are very excited about the opportunity we have in front of us with this game. In addition, this year, Blizzard will continue to release new content for Hearthstone as well as bringing the game to mobile devices later in the year. 
Lastly, Overwatch, which was just announced in November, is expected to go into closed beta later this year, but we are very excited about this new franchise. It has not been factored into our outlook. 
Finally, Blizzard will continue to invest in our own distribution platform, Battle.net, which will need to support a significantly larger audience and commercial capabilities going forward. 
So before we review the 2015 numbers, I want to highlight a couple of important things. First, our planning assumption this year is for our tax rate to revert back to our normal long-term target of around 24%, up from 2014 where the strong international performance from Blizzard and the R&D tax credit drove the rate lower. And second, as I mentioned earlier, there will be meaningful impact on our results year-over-year due to the weakness in the euro and to a lesser extent, the pound. Approximately 50% of our annual revenues are generated overseas and even higher percentage of our operating income is international. 
As the vast majority of our product development and headcount costs are U.S. based, we have fewer natural cost offsets to dampen the impact of currency translation. To put the decline in perspective, for 2014, the average euro-dollar exchange rate was $1.33, and today, our outlook assumes the euro rate of $1.13 for the balance of calendar year 2015. 
As such, our revenues and earnings will be translated to dollars at a much lower levels than in 2014.  This decline is somewhat offset by our hedging activities which are reflected in our outlook. 
Now let's review our 2015 numbers, which are based on spot rates as reflected in our slide deck. Note that revenue and EPS will increase if the euro or pound strengthens versus the U.S. dollar. 
For 2015, we expect GAAP revenues of $4.1 billion, product costs of 24% and operating expenses of 51% GAAP. For both GAAP and non-GAAP, we expect interest expense of $201 million, and a fully diluted weighted average share count of 750 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 21% and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.89. 
On a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.4 billion, product costs of 25% and operating expense of 45%. We expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 30% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 33%. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 24% this year, and non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.15. 
To put the numbers in perspective, in 2015, FX accounts for 6 percentage points of the 9% decline of our non-GAAP revenue. Operationally, revenues are down slightly due to a lighter slate investments in infrastructure and scaling of new properties with free-to-play business models. 
In 2015, as I mentioned, we expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.15. Note that $0.14 of the year-over-year decline is due to FX translation and $0.08 is due primarily to the higher tax rate. At constant currency and tax rate, EPS will be down approximately $0.05 year-over-year. 
Turning to our quarterly outlook. In 2015, we expect a lighter first half of the year as compared to last year as we don't have a comparable launch to the high-margin Diablo III: Reaper of Souls, and we only expect modest contributions from Call of Duty Online and Heroes of the Storm, as I mentioned earlier. 
On a GAAP basis, for the March quarter, we expect net revenues of $1.14 billion, product costs of 28%, operating expenses of 38%.  We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $50 million, a GAAP tax rate of 20%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 745 million and GAAP EPS of $0.37. 
For the March quarter on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $640 million, product costs of 22% and operating expenses of 62%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.05. 
So in summary, Activision Blizzard delivered record financial results during its transformational year. In 2015, despite currency headwinds, we expect strong industry fundamentals, continued expansion and investment in our franchise portfolio while keeping a keen eye on comps and a laser focus on execution. Today, we are well positioned to capitalize on the large and growing global opportunity in front of us. And we believe the investments we are making in 2015 will drive growth and revenue, operating margin and EPS in 2016 and beyond. Now I will turn the call over to Eric to discuss Activision Publishing."
4222231,281248772,756475,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dennis. Activision Publishing had another record-breaking and industry-leading year. The North America and Europe combined, Activision Publishing was the #1 retail publisher and had 3 of the top 5 best-selling new releases of 2014. With #1 Call",866,"Thanks, Dennis. Activision Publishing had another record-breaking and industry-leading year. 
The North America and Europe combined, Activision Publishing was the #1 retail publisher and had 3 of the top 5 best-selling new releases of 2014. With #1 Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare; #3, Destiny; and #5 Skylanders Trap Team when including toys and accessories. 
Starting with Call of Duty. We want to thank our growing community of millions of Call of Duty players for making Advanced Warfare the #1 console game globally, which has delivered well over $1 billion in sell-through, and far and away the #1 title worldwide on next-gen platforms. 
As we anticipated and discussed on our last earnings call and as we saw across the industry, old gen sales to retail were down year-on-year, but for this year, we expect next-gen growth to easily offset that dynamic. Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare was the first game released on our new 3-year development cycle and, as a result, was one of the most highly acclaimed Call of Duty games in recent years. We're also looking forward to a very strong season of digital content for Advanced Warfare starting with our first digital Map Pack release, Havoc, which launched last Tuesday and included a new zombies co-op experience. 
I'm happy to report that sales so far are up double-digit percentages year-on-year, both for standalone Map Packs and for Season Pass. 
And looking ahead to this year's holiday release, while we're not yet ready to discuss it fully today, we're excited to announce that it will be made by the team at Treyarch. Its last 2 games Black Ops and Black Ops II remained the biggest selling titles in franchise history. This game will be Treyarch's first on the 3-year development cycle, it will be loaded with innovation and we're excited to share more details with our community soon. 
In January, we brought the largest video game franchise in the west to the largest video game audience in the world with the release of Call of Duty Online in China. This is Activision Publishing's first major entry into one of the fastest-growing business models in our industry, free-to-play. While it's too early to project the performance, and we expect meaningful contribution will grow over time, initial consumer momentum is positive. The Baidu Index, which measures the volume of searches on China's main search engine and is widely cited as the indicator of brand's momentum, puts Call of Duty Online on par with the rollout of League of Legends. 
Now, let's turn to Destiny. Along with our partners at Bungie, we broke industry records as Destiny became the biggest new intellectual property launched in video game history, and was the third biggest new release of the year in North America and Europe combined. Destiny now has over 16 million registered users with a massive audience of active players still averaging over 3 hours of game play per day, a figure that has stayed remarkably stable since launch.  
Destiny also performed the rarely seen console gaming feat of growing active players from November to December, driven by the release of the new expansion pack, the Dark Below. And it was the #1 played game in North America on a PS4 in December. 
In Q2, we expect to launch the game second expansion pack, House of Wolves, and later this year, we will announce a major content release for the fall, so stay tuned. 
On to our third tent-pole franchise, Skylanders. As of today, life-to-date retail sales for Skylanders has exceeded $3 billion. And in 2014, Skylanders outsold all action figure lines and with the #1 kid console game globally for the fourth year in a row, and as a franchise, outperformed its nearest competitor by 30%. 
Skylanders Trap Team, our fall release outsold its nearest competitor by 17% and continued the incredible streak of breakthrough innovation in the franchise and was also one of the most highly acclaimed Skylanders' games today. 
This year, our toy sales grew as the unique mechanic of bringing toys and traps to life has kids and parents buy more toys and accessories than ever before. We expect to benefit from the next-gen installed base growth in 2015. And later this year, we will announce our next main release with yet another breakthrough innovation for the category. 
So in closing, over the last 3 years, Activision Publishing has methodically expanded its portfolio, and for the first time in its history, now has 3 tent-pole properties, each of which generated over $500 million in non-GAAP revenue this year and drove the highest digital revenues in Activision Publishing's history. We expect Call of Duty Online in China will become an important new revenue contributor and lead the way with new play dynamics and business models. We also have multiple unannounced initiatives in development, which we will reveal later in the year. Finally, across our tent-pole franchises, Activision Publishing now has set over 70 million players playing over 4 billion hours a year, a massive audience with a depth engagement that we expect to continue to grow and monetize over the coming years. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Mike Morhaime to talk about Blizzard."

Thanks for the efforts of our dedicated and talented employees around the world. Blizzard Entertainment delivered one of our most successful years ever. In 2014, we released award-winning expansions, World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draen",819,"Thank you, Eric. Thanks for the efforts of our dedicated and talented employees around the world. Blizzard Entertainment delivered one of our most successful years ever. 
In 2014, we released award-winning expansions, World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor, on Windows and Mac, and Diablo III: Reaper of Souls on Windows, Mac and consoles. We also launched our first free-to-play game, Hearthstone, which has collected Game of the Year awards and nominations as well. Hearthstone was released first on Windows and Mac and later on iPad and Android tablets, bringing Blizzard into the mobile space for the first time. Additionally, we supported Hearthstone with 2 major content releases, the Curse of Naxxramas Adventure and Goblins vs Gnomes, our first expansion. 
Our success across multiple game genres and platforms in 2014 drove Blizzard's best-ever annual revenue, and more importantly, helped us continue expanding our global community of gamers.
 
On the World of Warcraft side, we ended the year with the release of Warlords of Draenor in November. As we previously announced, the expansion was a great success in all regions, pushing the global player base above 10 million. The introduction of the character boost as well as design updates to the game made it much easier for lapse players to return to World of Warcraft and quickly reintegrate themselves into the community. 
Looking ahead, we're already preparing new content and features to support the game in the coming months. 
As with previous expansions, we do anticipate a decline in subscriber-ship in the coming months, particularly out of Asia, where the subscriber base has been more fluid. 
Moving on to Hearthstone. The game continued to excite and attract players around the world. After announcing the Goblins vs Gnomes expansion at BlizzCon in November, we launched it a few weeks later in December. 
This was followed shortly after with the Android tablet version of the game. All this activity helps drive Hearthstone's highest monthly active players ever in December as well as our highest revenue quarter-to-date for Hearthstone. 
Registered players for the game have now reached over 25 million, capping off a spectacular start for Hearthstone. It's gratifying for us to see how the global Blizzard community has responded to our first foray into a new genre as well as the free-to-play market and gaming on tablets. We'll keep working hard to build on last year's momentum with more content in 2015 as well as the upcoming Android phone and iPhone versions of the game. 
We do have another free-to-play game in the pipeline with Heroes of the Storm, our online team brawler. This is a genre that's proven to be very popular in the online space in recent years. We're excited to put our unique spin on this genre in a game that stands out from the rest, with highly accessible play and iconic Blizzard characters from the Warcraft, StarCraft and Diablo universes. 
Heroes of the Storm has recently hit some major development milestones including the start up closed beta in January, along with sales of the Founder's Pack, a digital bundle for $39.99 that gives player an array of heroes, skins and other content as well as instant access to the beta test.  We're continuing to ramp up our infrastructure and game service capabilities, allowing us to open up the game to more of the 9 million players who have signed up for beta testing. Excitement around Heroes of the Storm continues to build as we're seeing more grassroots tournaments pop up and major eSports entities are already creating professional team for the game. 
Looking further ahead, we gave the world a glimpse of what's next for Blizzard at BlizzCon. We kicked off the show by unveiling Overwatch, a team-based first-person shooter featuring an amazing cast of characters of heroes and set in an all-new Blizzard game universe. The announcement trailer for Overwatch was a viral sensation on the Internet, while attendees and press alike raved about the game play after trying an early build on the BlizzCon show floor. 
In addition to Overwatch, we also showcased the final chapter in the StarCraft II trilogy, Legacy of the Void.  This will be a standalone expansion, meaning anyone can jump right in to the StarCraft II experience without needing to own the previous games. We expect beta testing for both Overwatch and Legacy of the Void to start later this year. 
For a while now, we've been discussing the strong pipeline of Blizzard games. Gamers have long known us for World of Warcraft, StarCraft and Diablo. Now with Hearthstone added to the mix and Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch soon to follow, we will have more games and more genres and on more platforms than ever before. As busy and successful as 2014 was, we're looking to build on that momentum this year and deliver even more excitement to players in 2015. Thanks, and I'll turn the call over to Thomas."

Before we open the call to questions, I'll take a moment to summarize the 3 key takeaways from today's call. 
First, from a financial perspective, 2014 was an excellent year for Activision Blizzard: we beat our plan, deliver double-digit top line growth, grow EPS by 50% to a new record and strengthened our balance sheet by generating $1.3 billion of operating cash flow and paying down debt. 
Second, from a strategic perspective, our investments into new franchises are paying off. We created 2 new tent-pole franchises with Destiny and Hearthstone that are profitable right out of the gate. Destiny and Hearthstone also had great comp and pipelines that we expect to contribute to our results every year in a significant way. 
For perspective, only 1 year ago, 3 franchises generated the vast majority of our revenues and operating income. During 2014, we've expanded that to 6 franchises, and for 2015, we expect this number to grow to 10. Third, we have been, and we will continue to reposition our investments priorities against fast-growing business model, platform and geographic opportunities that has proven profitable scale. We're already leading in digital sales, including microtransactions, value-added services and full-game digital downloads. We have a strong pipeline of free-to-play games coming to market in 2015 with Heroes of the Storm and Call of Duty Online. This also positions us well for the fast-growing geography, which is Asia, where free-to-play is the dominant business model. From a platform perspective, mobile and tablet have also moved up on our priority list, and we're excited about the success Hearthstone has had on tablets and look forward to the rollout on Android and iOS phones. 
So in summary, while our outlook for 2015 is significantly impacted by adverse exchange rate movements, we expect profitable growth to resume in 2016 and beyond based on the continued expansion of our franchise portfolio, particularly into free-to-play in China and mobile, along with an anticipated return to growth in the console software market and continued growth in higher-margin digital revenues. So now we'll take a few questions."

And as we've just announced, we're off to a great start with our DLC season on Advanced Warfare, which is up double digits both on Season Pass and on a la carte DLC sales and engagement is higher than it was a year ago. Also, Advanced Warfare is a great game. It was really well received by both critics and fans, and it created a lot of positive buzz for the franchise. And we attached at franchise high-levels to the next-gen consoles which I think is what matters most when we're looking towards the future. So actually, I think the franchise ended the year in a great place, and we entered 2015 with a lot of momentum. 2014 was the height of the console transition. So I think compared to years when we're selling -- when Call of Duty was able to sell to a much larger and more stable installed base is not an apples-to-apples comparison. Our 2015 guidance on Call of Duty's new release is flat year-over-year, but we still have a fairly conservative planning assumption. We have Treyarch developing the game. We will have a larger installed base and next-gen hardware to sell into, and we believe our Q4 new release can be one of our best games yet. So we think the future is bright."

So I think that our relevance remains very high and our momentum is strong with the audience. It's also very true and inarguable that we continue to see more and more competition entering the category. But we believe we have 3 important advantages in relation to that competition. One is what, I think, at this point needs to be seen as our proven ability to out-innovate competitors. Critics and fans have both acclaimed our recent titles to that end, and we believe that the most important reason we've been able to stay on top of the categories that we've had the best games in the category, and we plan to continue that trend in 2015. Number two is that we're not constrained by the limitations of existing intellectual property or characters or anyone else's release slate. We only have to answer one question each and every time we design a game, which is what do we think will be the most fun experience for our fans to have. And three, while there's more competition, I also think it's notable that we are able to grow our annual revenue per user this year through new game play innovation like the introduction of Traps, and we plan to continue to do similar things like that in the future."

We did see it doubling effectively on Call of Duty in terms of our digital downloads year-over-year. So that's very, very nice. We're now seeing sort of mix percentages. We talked about high teens on the last call. It kind of remained in sort of the teams area in terms of total overall mix, and that will sort of move a little bit throughout the year as you have different sort of retail pushes, et cetera.

As I mentioned in my comments, the Baidu Index puts Call of Duty Online on par with the rollout of League of Legends in terms of consumer interest, which is a great start. It's been just over 3 weeks since we launched and we're still an open beta, so as I said, it's too early for us to share any financial metrics, but we're optimistic. In terms of 2015 guidance, we assume modest contributions from Call of Duty Online but that's simply because, even with the most successful free-to-play games in the market, they've taken time to build revenue to expand their audiences. So we feel fortunate that Tencent has the strongest track record in that market, and I think you can look to games like Crossfire or League of Legends to see how the early ramp up occurs for large successful games in the Chinese market. That's the ramp that takes time to buildup, but one that is ultimately significant and worth it."

Obviously, we don't talk about specific channel levels by franchise, but overall, we're comfortable with the channel levels that we have across our various portfolio and ended the year in a very good position relative to that. I would make one comment relative to overall channel inventory levels that was the move to digital. I'd say retailers are managing their channel inventories very closely, so the overall channel is down versus previous years, and we expect this trend to continue as the transition to digital continues over the coming years. Relative to the puts and takes for Destiny and sort of comparing '14 and '15, obviously, last year, was the major launch with Destiny 1 and we won't have a comparable launch this year, although we do have content, as I mentioned and Eric mentioned, in the back half of the year. On the flip side on the cost side, there were significant amortization of Destiny's development costs that came through in 2014, that will not be in 2015.

We have a massive audience and they're averaging over 3 hours of play per day. So both of those things speak to the fact that Destiny is a great game. As I mentioned, we have a second expansion pack on the way and a major content release coming in the fall  and a very robust pipeline planned after that. Beyond that, whenever you have a large and highly engaged community, there are obviously opportunities for us to deliver a lot of different kinds of content that we think that player base would find valuable and appreciate and that's what we're planning on doing."

In fact, at that time, the Internet was creating great amounts of wealth, in fact, what we would consider more wealth creation than we've seen",796,"Thank you, Kristin. 15 years ago, our investors had very little interest in video games or video game companies. In fact, at that time, the Internet was creating great amounts of wealth, in fact, what we would consider more wealth creation than we've seen in modern commerce. And companies without page views and click-throughs were very out of favor. We thought it'd be a good time to start an Investor Relations program, but we had a very difficult time finding anybody that actually wanted to run it. And so we told the recruiter to start looking for out-of-favor industries, industries that were as out-of-favor as video games, and they couldn't find any anymore out-of-favor industry than tobacco. So fortunately, for our shareholders, we were able to pry away from Philip Morris Kristin Southey, who thought it would be more fun to extol the virtues of video games than investing in tobacco. 
When Kristin joined in March 2000, the company had a market value of $337 million. During her tenure, the stock has grown at a compound annual rate of 23% versus the S&P at 4%, and at a rate that's greater than the rate of growth at Berkshire Hathaway, which, as you know, is our benchmark for almost everything. 
Kristin has protected our treasury, she has collected our receivables with the smallest rate of bad debt writeoffs of any major company in the video game industry, and for me, she's always been a fantastic professional, great partner and a pleasure to work with. Kristin has decided to take some time off, something that her work ethic never allowed her to do during her 15 years that she's been with the company. Both Brian and I are very incredibly grateful for all her contributions and I'll miss her greatly. She has assured me, however, that purely for our own personal enjoyment, she continues -- she will continue to keep all of you analysts in line, especially Michael Pachter. 
She's handing the reigns over to someone terrific and we're confident that Amrita will make Kristin proud as she leads our IR program and protect the legacy Kristin has created as one of the world's great IR efforts. So everyone in the room welcome Amrita, and thank you, Kristin, for all of your great contributions, for your extraordinary service, for your unyielding effort and for your incredible commitment to the principles of creating true stakeholder value. Thank you. 
And now, I get to share of our record results. So of course, we'll be reviewing in detail in a moment our record results, but we had another incredibly successful year. We had record results across a number of different areas. We introduced new franchises with outstanding game play. We expanded on new higher-margin business models. We continued investing in some of the world's most important entertainment franchises, and we continued to attract extraordinarily talented people to our company. 
In terms of results, on a non-GAAP basis, we delivered record earnings per share, which increased more than 50% from the previous year, double-digit revenue growth and higher-margin record digital revenues that represents an all-time high of 46% of total revenues. And we produced more great content in 2014 than ever before. Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare was the #1 release of the year and the franchise's cumulative revenue is now over $11 billion. Destiny was the #3 new release of the year and attracted over 16 million registered users. Skylanders, with over 240 million toys sold life to date was, again, the #1 kids console game. World of Warcraft reached over 10 million subscribers and remains the #1 subscription-based MMORPG in the world. Diablo III is the #1 PC role-playing game of the year; and Hearthstone, which is named Game of the Year, has already attracted more than 25 million registered players. 
Last year, we launched 2 of the most successful new entertainment brands, Destiny and Blizzard's Hearthstone. Combined, they attracted over 40 million registered players worldwide and generated more than $850 million in non-GAAP revenue, a testament to our team's proven abilities to capture the imaginations of millions of people around the world time and time again. This year, we expect to expand our leading franchise portfolio to 10, up from 5 franchises at the beginning of 2014. Our amazingly talented teams will continue to produce the world's best content for gamers. And today, our board has once again increased our dividend, authorized a $750 million share repurchase program and the repayment of another $0.25 billion of our debt. Today, we've return nearly $10 billion to our shareholders in dividends and repurchases since 2008. We have a growing portfolio as the very best entertainment franchises and great confidence in our long-term future. 
I'll now turn the call over to Dennis."

Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our Q4 and full year 2014 financial results, and then I will review our outlook for 2015. 2014 was a very important year that delivered strong financial results that exceeded our outlook, whi",1819,"Thanks, Bobby. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our Q4 and full year 2014 financial results, and then I will review our outlook for 2015. 
2014 was a very important year that delivered strong financial results that exceeded our outlook, while setting the stage for growth in the years to come. In 2014, on a non-GAAP basis, we generated double-digit revenue growth, record digital revenues, a 32% operating margin, a record EPS, which is up more than 50% year-over-year and operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion. From a capital perspective, we strengthened our balance sheet, paid a record dividend to shareholder, repaid $375 million of our debt and continued to invest in the strongest pipeline of new opportunities with high-margin potential in our history.  Our financial performance was driven by our strong diversified product portfolio. This year, our top franchise has maintained their leadership positions, and we successfully expanded our portfolio of IP with Destiny and Hearthstone, which drove more than $850 million in combined non-GAAP revenue. 
Turning to our financial results. Please refer to our earnings release for full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. Also, the numbers I will be quoting are compared to the year prior, unless otherwise noted. Please also note that all percentages are based on revenues, except for the tax rate.  Our Q4 results exceeded our outlook and were driven by Activision Publishing's Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Skylanders Trap Team and continued sales of Destiny. In addition, Blizzard's World of Warcraft and Hearthstone also had a strong sales in the quarter. For Q4, on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.57 billion and an operating margin of 28%. We had interest expense of $50 million and our tax rate was 7%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted share count was 741 million and GAAP EPS was a record $0.49. 
In Q4, the weakening of foreign currencies against the dollar did not have a significant impact on our results due in part to our hedging program, however, the lower euro and British pound rates will impact our outlook for the full year of 2015, which I will discuss in a moment.  On a non-GAAP basis, for the quarter, we generated revenues of $2.21 billion, an operating margin of 41%. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 19% and our quarterly non-GAAP EPS was a record $0.94.  Our solid Q4 results capped a better-than-expected year. For the full year on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $4.41 billion, operating income of $1.18 billion, a tax rate of 15% and record EPS of $1.13. 
On a non-GAAP basis for the year, we grew revenues 11% year-over-year to $4.81 billion. Digital revenues grew 40% year-over-year and accounted for a record 46% of total revenues. Our strong growth in digital revenue was driven by new and growing high-margin opportunities, including game downloads for consoles, in-game purchases from our first free-to-play game Hearthstone, and new offerings for World of Warcraft, including the pay character boost. Our non-GAAP operating income was $1.53 billion, reflecting an operating margin of 32%, adjusted EBITDA margin of 33% with adjusted EBITDA being defined as non-GAAP operating income plus depreciation. Our tax rate was 20% and our EPS was a record $1.42. 12 months ago, when we gave our original non-GAAP outlook, it was $4.6 billion in revenue and $1.26 in EPS. So this year, we again exceeded our initial guidance with non-GAAP revenues exceeding our outlook by $213 million and non-GAAP EPS exceeding our original outlook by $0.16 or 13%. In terms of cash flow, it was another solid year where we generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion and free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. 
Turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, we had approximately $4.9 billion in cash and investments, of which $1.2 billion was held domestically. We had gross debt outstanding of $4.4 billion and net cash of approximately $500 million. And today, based on the strength of our balance sheet and confidence in our long-term performance, our Board of Directors approved 3 important capital allocation matters. Specifically, they authorized a $250 million repayment of part of our term loan, which we expect will be paid in February; authorized a 2 year, $700 million -- $750 million share repurchase program and approved an increased to our cash dividend per share to a record $0.23, a 15% increase over last year, which will be payable in May. 
Now let's turn to our outlook. This year, we expect Activision Publishing to launch more content than it has in many years. The first launch of the year was Call of Duty Online for China. While we modeled minimal financial contributions from COD Online in our 2015 expectations, we and our partner, Tencent, are very excited about the long-term prospects of the game. This type of free-to-play opportunity takes time to ramp to full popularity and our focus in 2015 will be on building and growing the audience before meaningful monetization. 
For Destiny, we expect to release an expansion pack in Q2 and to launch more new content in the back half of the year. With respect to Call of Duty, this is an important year for the franchise as we expect release multiple Map Packs, microtransaction content and an exciting new game in Q4 from one of our top development teams. For modeling purposes, we are planning on sales to be consistent with the Advanced Warfare. Additionally, in Q4, we expect to release an innovative new Skylanders' game. And finally, we are working on several unannounced initiatives that we will say more about in the months ahead. 
In 2014, Blizzard generated record avenues and near-record operating income. The year was driven by Diablo III: Reaper of Souls and World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor, both of which generated significant revenues and income that will not have comparable releases this year. In addition, we expect WoW subs to decline as we have seen historically in the year following the release of a large-scale expansion. 
In terms of new releases, in January, Heroes of the Storm Blizzard second free-to-play game entered closed beta. While we expect it will take time to ramp in monetization as it builds its audience, we are very excited about the opportunity we have in front of us with this game. In addition, this year, Blizzard will continue to release new content for Hearthstone as well as bringing the game to mobile devices later in the year. Lastly, Overwatch, which was just announced in November, is expected to go into closed beta later this year. While we are very excited about this new franchise, it has not been factored into our outlook. Finally, Blizzard will continue to invest in our own distribution platform, Battle.net, which will need to support a significantly larger audience and commercial capabilities going forward. 
So before we review the 2015 numbers, I want to highlight a couple of important things. First, our planning assumption this year is for our tax rate to revert back to our normal long-term target of around 24%, up from 2014 where the strong international performance from Blizzard and the R&D tax credit drove the rate lower. And second, as I mentioned earlier, there will be meaningful impact on our results year-over-year due to the weakness in the euro and to a lesser extent, the pound. Approximately 50% of our annual revenues are generated overseas and an even higher percentage of our operating income is international.  As the vast majority of our product development and headcount costs are U.S. based, we have fewer natural cost offsets to dampen the impact of currency translation. To put the decline in perspective, for 2014, the average euro-dollar exchange rate was $1.33, and today, our outlook assumes the euro rate of $1.13 for the balance of calendar year 2015.  As such, our revenues and earnings will be translated to dollars at a much lower levels than in 2014.  This decline is somewhat offset by our hedging activities which are reflected in our outlook. 
Now let's review our 2015 numbers, which are based on spot rates as reflected in our slide deck. Note that revenue and EPS will increase if the euro or pound strengthens versus the U.S. dollar.  For 2015, we expect GAAP revenues of $4.1 billion, product costs of 24% and operating expenses of 51% GAAP. For both GAAP and non-GAAP, we expect interest expense of $201 million, and a fully diluted weighted average share count of 750 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 21% and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.89.  On a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.4 billion, product costs of 25% and operating expense of 45%. We expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 30% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 33%. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 24% this year, and non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.15. 
To put the numbers in perspective, in 2015, FX accounts for 6 percentage points of the 9% decline of our non-GAAP revenue. Operationally, revenues are down slightly due to a lighter slate, investments in infrastructure and scaling of new properties with free-to-play business models.  In 2015, as I mentioned, we expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.15. Note that $0.14 of the year-over-year decline is due to FX translation and $0.08 is due primarily to the higher tax rate. At constant currency and tax rate, EPS would be down approximately $0.05 year-over-year. 
Turning to our quarterly outlook. In 2015, we expect a lighter first half of the year as compared to last year as we don't have a comparable launch to the high-margin Diablo III: Reaper of Souls, and we only expect modest contributions from Call of Duty Online and Heroes of the Storm, as I mentioned earlier. On a GAAP basis, for the March quarter, we expect net revenues of $1.14 billion, product costs of 28%, operating expenses of 38%.  We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $50 million, a GAAP tax rate of 20%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 745 million and GAAP EPS of $0.37. For the March quarter on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $640 million, product costs of 22% and operating expenses of 62%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.05. 
So in summary, Activision Blizzard delivered record financial results during its transformational year. In 2015, despite currency headwinds, we expect strong industry fundamentals, continued expansion and investment in our franchise portfolio while keeping a keen eye on costs and a laser focus on execution. Today, we are well positioned to capitalize on the large and growing global opportunity in front of us. And we believe the investments we are making in 2015 will drive growth in revenue, operating margin and EPS in 2016 and beyond. 
Now I will turn the call over to Eric to discuss Activision Publishing."
4222231,281248772,756557,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dennis. Activision Publishing had another record-breaking and industry-leading year. The North America and Europe combined, Activision Publishing was the #1 retail publisher and had 3 of the top 5 best-selling new releases of 2014. With #1 Call of",866,"Thanks, Dennis. Activision Publishing had another record-breaking and industry-leading year. The North America and Europe combined, Activision Publishing was the #1 retail publisher and had 3 of the top 5 best-selling new releases of 2014. With #1 Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare; #3, Destiny; and #5 Skylanders Trap Team when including toys and accessories. 
Starting with Call of Duty. We want to thank our growing community of millions of Call of Duty players for making Advanced Warfare the #1 console game globally, which has delivered well over $1 billion in sell-through, and far and away the #1 title worldwide on next-gen platforms. As we anticipated and discussed on our last earnings call and as we saw across the industry, old gen sales to retail were down year-on-year, but for this year, we expect next-gen growth to easily offset that dynamic. Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare was the first game released on our new 3-year development cycle and, as a result, was one of the most highly acclaimed Call of Duty games in recent years. We're also looking forward to a very strong season of digital content for Advanced Warfare starting with our first digital Map Pack release, Havoc, which launched last Tuesday and included a new zombies co-op experience. I'm happy to report that sales so far are up double-digit percentages year-on-year, both for standalone Map Packs and for Season Pass. 
And looking ahead to this year's holiday release, while we're not yet ready to discuss it fully today, we're excited to announce that it will be made by the team at Treyarch, whose last 2 games, Black Ops and Black Ops II, remain the biggest selling titles in franchise history. This fall's game will be Treyarch's first on the 3-year development cycle, it will be loaded with innovation and we're excited to share more details with our community soon. 
In January, we brought the largest video game franchise in the west to the largest video game audience in the world with the release of Call of Duty Online in China. This is Activision Publishing's first major entry into one of the fastest-growing business models in our industry, free-to-play. While it's too early to project the performance, and we expect meaningful contribution will grow over time, initial consumer momentum is positive. The Baidu Index, which measures the volume of searches on China's main search engine and is widely cited as the indicator of brand's momentum, puts Call of Duty Online on par with the rollout of League of Legends. 
Now, let's turn to Destiny. Along with our partners at Bungie, we broke industry records as Destiny became the biggest new intellectual property launch in video game history, and was the third biggest new release of the year in North America and Europe combined. Destiny now has over 16 million registered users with a massive audience of active players still averaging over 3 hours of game play per day, a figure that has stayed remarkably stable since launch.  Destiny also performed the rarely seen console gaming feat of growing active players from November to December, driven by the release of the new expansion pack, the Dark Below. And it was the #1 played game in North America on a PS4 in December.  In Q2, we expect to launch the game's second expansion pack, House of Wolves, and later this year, we will announce a major content release for the fall, so stay tuned. 
On to our third tent-pole franchise, Skylanders. As of today, life-to-date retail sales for Skylanders has exceeded $3 billion. And in 2014, Skylanders outsold all action figure lines and was the #1 kid console game globally for the fourth year in a row, and as a franchise, outperformed its nearest competitor by 30%.  Skylanders Trap Team, our fall release, outsold its nearest competitor by 17% and continued the incredible streak of breakthrough innovation in the franchise and was also one of the most highly acclaimed Skylanders' games today.  This year, our toy sales grew as the unique mechanic of bringing toys and traps to life has kids and parents buying more toys and accessories than ever before. We expect to benefit from the next-gen installed base growth in 2015. And later this year, we will announce our next main release with yet another breakthrough innovation for the category. 
So in closing, over the last 3 years, Activision Publishing has methodically expanded its portfolio, and for the first time in its history, now has 3 tent-pole properties, each of which generated over $500 million in non-GAAP revenue this year and drove the highest digital revenues in Activision Publishing's history. We expect Call of Duty Online in China will become an important new revenue contributor and lead the way with new play dynamics and business models. We also have multiple unannounced initiatives in development, which we will reveal later in the year. Finally, across our tent-pole franchises, Activision Publishing now has over 70 million players playing over 4 billion hours a year, a massive audience with a depth engagement that we expect to continue to grow and monetize over the coming years. 
And I'll now turn the call over to Mike Morhaime to talk about Blizzard."

Thanks to the efforts of our dedicated and talented employees around the world. Blizzard Entertainment delivered one of our most successful years ever. In 2014, we released award-winning expansions, World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draeno",818,"Thank you, Eric. Thanks to the efforts of our dedicated and talented employees around the world. Blizzard Entertainment delivered one of our most successful years ever. 
In 2014, we released award-winning expansions, World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor, on Windows and Mac, and Diablo III: Reaper of Souls on Windows, Mac and consoles. We also launched our first free-to-play game, Hearthstone, which has collected Game of the Year awards and nominations as well. Hearthstone was released first on Windows and Mac and later on iPad and Android tablets, bringing Blizzard into the mobile space for the first time. Additionally, we supported Hearthstone with 2 major content releases, the Curse of Naxxramas Adventure and Goblins vs. Gnomes, our first expansion. Our success across multiple game genres and platforms in 2014 drove Blizzard's best-ever annual revenue, and more importantly, helped us continue expanding our global community of gamers.
 
On the World of Warcraft side, we ended the year with the release of Warlords of Draenor in November. As we previously announced, the expansion was a great success in all regions, pushing the global player base above 10 million. The introduction of the character boost as well as design updates to the game made it much easier for lapsed players to return to World of Warcraft and quickly reintegrate themselves into the community. Looking ahead, we're already preparing new content and features to support the game in the coming months. As with previous expansions, we do anticipate a decline in subscribership in the coming months, particularly out of Asia, where the subscriber base has been more fluid. 
Moving on to Hearthstone. The game continued to excite and attract players around the world. After announcing the Goblins vs Gnomes expansion at BlizzCon in November, we launched it a few weeks later in December. This was followed shortly after with the Android tablet version of the game. All this activity helped drive Hearthstone's highest monthly active players ever in December as well as our highest revenue quarter-to-date for Hearthstone. 
Registered players for the game have now reached over 25 million, capping off a spectacular start for Hearthstone. It's gratifying for us to see how the global Blizzard community has responded to our first foray into a new genre as well as the free-to-play market and gaming on tablets. We'll keep working hard to build on last year's momentum with more content in 2015 as well as the upcoming Android phone and iPhone versions of the game. 
We do have another free-to-play game in the pipeline with Heroes of the Storm, our online team brawler. This is a genre that's proven to be very popular in the online space in recent years. We're excited to put our unique spin on this genre in a game that stands out from the rest, with highly accessible plays and iconic Blizzard characters from the Warcraft, StarCraft and Diablo universes. 
Heroes of the Storm has recently hit some major development milestones including the start of closed beta in January, along with sales of the Founder's Pack, a digital bundle for $39.99 that gives player an array of heroes, skins and other content as well as instant access to the beta test.  We're continuing to ramp up our infrastructure and game service capabilities, allowing us to open up the game to more of the 9 million players who have signed up for beta testing. Excitement around Heroes of the Storm continues to build as we're seeing more grassroots tournaments pop up and major eSports entities are already creating professional teams for the game. 
Looking further ahead, we gave the world a glimpse of what's next for Blizzard at BlizzCon. We kicked off the show by unveiling Overwatch, a team-based first-person shooter featuring an amazing cast of characters of heroes and set in an all-new Blizzard game universe. The announcement trailer for Overwatch was a viral sensation on the Internet, while attendees and press alike raved about the game play after trying an early build on the BlizzCon show floor. In addition to Overwatch, we also showcased the final chapter in the StarCraft II trilogy, Legacy of the Void.  This will be a standalone expansion, meaning anyone can jump right into the StarCraft II experience without needing to own the previous games. We expect beta testing for both Overwatch and Legacy of the Void to start later this year. 
For a while now, we've been discussing the strong pipeline of Blizzard games. Gamers have long known us for World of Warcraft, StarCraft and Diablo. Now with Hearthstone added to the mix and Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch soon to follow, we will have more games in more genres and on more platforms than ever before. As busy and successful as 2014 was, we're looking to build on that momentum this year and deliver even more excitement to players in 2015. 
Thanks, and I'll turn the call over to Thomas."

Before we open the call to questions, I'll take a moment to summarize the 3 key takeaways from today's call. 
First, from a financial perspective, 2014 was an excellent year for Activision Blizzard: we beat our plan, delivered double-digit top line growth, grew EPS by 50% to a new record and strengthened our balance sheet by generating $1.3 billion of operating cash flow and paying down debt. Second, from a strategic perspective, our investments into new franchises are paying off. We created 2 new tent-pole franchises with Destiny and Hearthstone that are profitable right out of the gate. Destiny and Hearthstone also have great comp and pipelines that we expect to contribute to our results every year in a significant way. 
For perspective, only 1 year ago, 3 franchises generated the vast majority of our revenues and operating income. During 2014, we've expanded that to 6 franchises, and for 2015, we expect this number to grow to 10. Third, we have been, and will continue to reposition our investments priorities against fast-growing business model, platform and geographic opportunities that have proven, profitable scale. We're already leading in digital sales, including microtransactions, value-added services and full-game digital downloads. We have a strong pipeline of free-to-play games coming to market in 2015 with Heroes of the Storm and Call of Duty Online. This also positions us well for the fast-growing geography, which is Asia, where free-to-play is the dominant business model. From a platform perspective, mobile and tablet have also moved up on our priority list, and we're excited about the success Hearthstone has had on tablets and look forward to the rollout on Android and iOS phones. 
So in summary, while our outlook for 2015 is significantly impacted by adverse exchange rate movements, we expect profitable growth to resume in 2016 and beyond based on the continued expansion of our franchise portfolio, particularly into free-to-play in China and mobile, along with an anticipated return to growth in the console software market and continued growth in higher-margin digital revenues. 
So now we'll take a few questions."

And as we've just announced, we're off to a great start with our DLC season on Advanced Warfare, which is up double digits both on Season Pass and on a la carte DLC sales and engagement is higher than it was a year ago. Also, Advanced Warfare is a great game. It was really well received by both critics and fans, and it created a lot of positive buzz for the franchise. And we attach at franchise high-levels to the next-gen consoles which I think is what matters most when we're looking towards the future. So I actually think the franchise ended the year in a great place, and we entered 2015 with a lot of momentum. 2014 was the height of the console transition. So I think to compare it to years when we were selling -- when Call of Duty was able to sell to a much larger and more stable installed base is not an apples-to-apples comparison. Our 2015 guidance on Call of Duty's new release is flat year-over-year, but we still have a fairly conservative planning assumption. We have Treyarch developing the game. We'll have a larger installed base of next-gen hardware to sell into, and we believe our Q4 new release can be one of our best games yet. So we think the future is bright."

We entered closed beta last month in January. We're very pleased with the response from our beta testers. The feedback that we've been receiving has been very positive. We are going to continue increasing the invites and concurrency as we test out the infrastructure for our game and drive towards open beta. We don't have any dates to announce on that. I think that's going to really be determined by how the testing goes, but we're eager to get the game into the hands of as many people as possible and drive towards our official commercial launch."

Kristin, good luck and keep in touch. My question, though, I think, is for Eric. I guess looking back at the performance of Skylanders, the commentary was generally positive, although we certainly see more competition in the space.

So I think that our relevance remains very high and our momentum is strong with the audience. It's also very true and inarguable that we continue to see more and more competition entering the category. But we believe we have 3 important advantages in relation to that competition. One is what, I think, at this point needs to be seen as our proven ability to out-innovate competitors. Critics and fans have both acclaimed our recent titles to that end, and we believe that the most important reason we've been able to stay on top of the category is that we've had the best games in the category, and we plan to continue that trend in 2015. Number two is that we're not constrained by the limitations of existing intellectual property or characters or anyone else's release slate. We only have to answer one question each and every time we design a game, which is what do we think will be the most fun experience for our fans to have? And three, while there's more competition, I also think it's notable that we are able to grow our annual revenue per user this year through new game play innovation like the introduction of Traps, and we plan to continue to do similar things like that in the future."

We're now seeing sort of mix percentages. We talked about high teens on the last call. It kind of remained in sort of the teams area in terms of total overall mix, and that'll sort of move a little bit throughout the year as you have different sort of retail pushes, et cetera.

We think the game is going to be great and our partners at Tencent do, too. As I mentioned in my comments, the Baidu Index puts Call of Duty Online on par with the rollout of League of Legends in terms of consumer interest, which is a great start. It's been just over 3 weeks since we launched and we're still an open beta, so as I said, it's too early for us to share any financial metrics, but we're optimistic. In terms of 2015 guidance, we assume modest contributions from Call of Duty Online but that's simply because, even with the most successful free-to-play games in the market, they've taken time to build revenue to expand their audiences. So we feel fortunate that Tencent has the strongest track record in that market, and I think you can look to games like Crossfire or League of Legends to see how the early ramp up occurs for large successful games in the Chinese market. That's a ramp that takes time to build up, but one that is ultimately significant and worth it."

Obviously, we don't talk about specific channel levels by franchise, but overall, we're comfortable with the channel levels that we have across our various portfolio and ended the year in a very good position relative to that. I would make one comment relative to overall channel inventory levels that was the move to digital. I'd say retailers are managing their channel inventories very closely, so the overall channel is down versus previous years, and we expect this trend to continue as the transition to digital continues over the coming years. Relative to the puts and takes for Destiny and sort of comparing '14 and '15, obviously, last year was a major launch with Destiny 1 and we won't have a comparable launch this year, although we do have content, as I mentioned and Eric mentioned, in the back half of the year. On the flip side, though, on the cost side, there was significant amortization of Destiny's development costs that came through in 2014, that will not be in 2015. So even though the revenue will be down based on the new content pipeline and a smaller release, effectively, we do expect actual profits to be up for the franchise."

We have a massive audience and they're averaging over 3 hours of play per day. So both of those things speak to the fact that Destiny is a great game. As I mentioned, we have a second expansion pack on the way and a major content release coming in the fall and a very robust pipeline planned after that. Beyond that, whenever you have a large and highly engaged community, there are obviously opportunities for us to deliver a lot of different kinds of content that we think that player base would find valuable and appreciate and that's what we're planning on doing."

And to be recognized as a great place to work by a respected institution like Fortune is gratifying and rewarding. But being acknowledged is a great institution by our own people means more to be than just about anything. And I'd like to thank our wildly talented, inspired, driven and hard-working teams for everything they do to capture the imagination of tens of millions of people day after day.
Our talented teams around the world continue to create experiences that inspire our players, drive deeper levels of engagement in our games by our massive and growing global communities of fans. In the last 12 months we had over 150 million active users around the world playing our games for more than 12 billion hours, and spectators watching over 1 billion hours of linear content based on our games.
In the hour we'll spend on this conference call, we expect over 1 million people to interact with Activision Blizzard franchises alone. And in the past year, our communities grew by more than 25%.
This deepening level of engagement with a widening base of players across our franchises is what drove another successful quarter. We delivered better-than-expected Q1 results, increased our 2015 non-GAAP revenue outlook to $4.425 billion and our earnings per share outlook to $1.20 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, we delivered record higher margin digital revenues of over $0.5 billion, a first quarter record on an absolute basis and an all-time high on a percentage basis.
As we celebrate our 35th anniversary, we continue to create extraordinary entertainment for our fans. We couldn't be more excited to continue to do so for another 35 years. Our greatest achievement continues to be our ability to attract and retain the most talented employees around the world. Because of that, I've never been more excited or confident about our future.

Good afternoon, everyone. Today I will review our better-than-expected Q1 financial results, our outlook for Q2 and our increased outlook for 2015. Q1 was a great quarter that displayed strong trends in our year-round monetizing franchise",1347,"Thanks, Bobby. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I will review our better-than-expected Q1 financial results, our outlook for Q2 and our increased outlook for 2015. 
Q1 was a great quarter that displayed strong trends in our year-round monetizing franchises. We overperformed our non-GAAP February guidance by over $60 million on revenue, $100 million on operating income and $0.11 on EPS.
Even though we had a relatively lighter slate in Q1 this year, non-GAAP revenue and EPS were flat to Q1 last year on a constant FX basis due to strong digital trends. Non-GAAP digital revenues comprised a record percentage of overall revenues, up 800 basis points year-over-year. 
Turning to our financial results. Please refer to our earnings release for a full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations. Also, the numbers I will be quoting are compared to the prior year unless otherwise noted.
For the quarter on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.3 billion, up 15% year-over-year and operating margin of 43%, up from 37% last year and a record quarterly GAAP EPS of $0.53, up 33% year-over-year and up $0.16 versus our February guidance.
For the quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $703 million, an operating margin of 29% and EPS of $0.16. Of the $0.11 in non-GAAP EPS overperformance versus guidance, about $0.05 was related to timing for costs that shifted out of the quarter and about $0.06 was related to strong franchise momentum, including digital sales and engagement trends with our large community of fans.
Activision Publishing had a strong Season Pass downloadable content and expansion attach rates on both Call of Duty and Destiny. Console full game downloads represent a high teens share of total units and continued to increase year-over-year. Blizzard Entertainment had a steady and strong performance on Hearthstone with ongoing engagement on the Q4 expansion, Goblins vs Gnomes.
As mentioned during our February earnings call and consistent with our experience following prior expansions, we saw a decline in World of Warcraft subscribers. Subscribers ended the quarter at 7.1 million. World of Warcraft's revenue performance at constant FX has been more stable, driven by continued strong uptake on value-added services and price increases in select regions which partially offsets the subscriber declines particularly in the East.
Moreover, Blizzard has successfully expanded their portfolio over the recent past and continues to do so. Growth from franchises like Hearthstone and Diablo has boosted Blizzard's top line and had pushed Blizzard's non-World of Warcraft revenue streams of 30% of total revenue in 2013 to 40% of total revenue in 2014, even while the World of Warcraft revenues also increased in that period. And new franchises like Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm are expected to further expand non-World of Warcraft revenues in more than 50% share of the Blizzard business in 2015. The strong recurring franchise diversification is in process inside the Blizzard portfolio which sets us up for a bright 2016 and beyond. 
Turning to specific P&L items. Please note that all percentages are based on revenues except for the tax rate.
For Q1, GAAP product cost were 20%, operating expenses were 37% and operating margin was 43%. GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense was $50 million and our GAAP tax rate was 20%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted weighted share count was 741 million, including participating securities. 
On a non-GAAP basis for the quarter, product costs were 21%, operating expenses were 50% and operating margin was 29%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 32%. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%.
In terms of cash flow. In Q1, we generated strong cash flow with non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $223 million, operating cash flow of $209 million and free cash flow of $188 million after CapEx. We also repaid $250 million of our term loan in February and next week on May 13, we plan to pay a $0.23 per share cash dividend or approximately $167 million in aggregate to shareholders of record as of March 30.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of March 31, we had approximately $4.5 billion in cash and investments, of which over $1 billion was held domestically. We had total debt of $4.12 billion and net cash of $360 million. 
Turning to FX. Please note that as discussed on our February call, currency fluctuations continue to be a headwind that we will monitor. 
In Q1, the year-over-year impact of the strengthening dollar was $68 million on revenue and $0.03 on EPS. As mentioned, both revenue and EPS would have been flat year-over-year at constant FX. In summary, Q1 was a very strong start of the year for Activision Blizzard. 
So now let's turn to our slate and our outlook for Q2 and for the balance of 2015.
Our expected Q2 slate from Activision Publishing includes additional downloadable content releases from Call of Duty and Destiny and continued live operations during the open beta for Call of Duty Online in China. Blizzard Entertainment's Q2 slate is a robust offering across the portfolio, including Hearthstone's new adventure, Blackrock Mountain, Hearthstone's important iOS and Android smartphone releases, Diablo III's launch in China, StarCraft Legacy of the Void's  closed beta and Heroes of the Storm's launch in June. In Q2, we also expect to begin the ramp in sales and marketing spending for our major releases in the back half the year. 
Now to the numbers. For Q2 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $930 million, product costs of 20% and operating expenses of 52%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $50 million, a GAAP tax rate of 25%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $745 million and EPS of $0.21. 
For Q2 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $650 million, product cost of 19% and operating expenses of 63%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 26% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.07.
Our expected Q3 and Q4 slate from Activision Publishing is one of the strongest we've ever had, including the biggest addition to the Destiny universe yet, Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which we're very excited about, a new innovative release for Skylanders and the return of one of our most beloved IPs with Guitar Hero Live, as well as further ramp up of our audience playing Call of Duty Online in China.
Blizzard Entertainment will bring additional content and live service updates to World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm, as well as bring Overwatch into closed beta. 
Now to our 2015 full year numbers. For 2015 on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.25 billion an increase of $110 million versus our guidance in February, product costs of 23% and operating expenses of 50%. For both GAAP and non-GAAP, we expect interest expense of $202 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 22%. We expect 750 million fully diluted shares both for GAAP and non-GAAP. And GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.98, up $0.09 from our February guidance.
For 2015, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.425 billion, $25 million higher than our February guidance, product cost of 24%, operating expenses of 45% and an operating margin of 31%, 100 basis points better than our February guidance. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 24%. 
For the year, we are raising our full year outlook by $0.05 to $1.20. As I mentioned earlier, strong business momentum in Q1 amounted to $0.06 of EPS favorability, which is partially offset by $0.01 of FX headwind given the further strengthening of the dollar since we last gave guidance in February. See our accompanying earnings materials for FX assumptions.
So in summary, the transition to digital continues inside of our business helping to further drive our year-round engagement and monetization model where our community can play and invest in their experiences for the entire year. Along with these digital trends, our strategic investments in new franchises, platforms and geographies are paying off and set the stage for growth ahead. 
Now I will turn the call over to Eric to discuss Activision Publishing."
4222231,289734224,805806,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 06, 2015",2015-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dennis. Activision Publishing is off to a great start. And in Q1, we significantly outperformed last year's results with revenues up 28% year-on-year.

And in Q1, we significantly outperformed last year's results with revenues up 28% year-on-year. We have 2 of the top 5 video game franchises globally year-to-date. We continue to have 3 of the top 5 next-gen games life-to-date with Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare remaining the #1 title on nex-gen as it has in since it launch 6 months ago. Including toys, Skylanders is also the #1 console franchise and title globally in Q1. It outsold the #1 action figure line globally and, of course, was the #1 kids console franchise and title globally.
For the past few years, we have methodically and effectively expanded our portfolio, which now includes 3 industry-leading franchises. Each one of which keeps players engaged all year round. This engagement creates a virtuous cycle, great content leading to large engaged communities, leading our ability to monetize those communities by providing more great content. This is why we have the biggest Q1 online player community in our history, up double-digit percentages year-over-year.
And it is also why, based on our current trajectory, Activision Publishing will likely deliver our biggest year yet of digital revenues. 
So let me share a few more specifics by franchise, starting with Call of Duty.
In the first quarter, revenue was up by a double-digit percentage year-over-year due to the strong sell-through of Advanced Warfare and growing revenues per user across our recent Call of Duty titles. Sales of Season Pass and Map Packs were up significantly and we introduced a new consumable digital mechanic in Advanced Warfare which drove engagement and allowed our players to invest more deeply in their online experience.
We recently revealed Call of Duty: Black Ops III from our award-winning studio Treyarch. Nearly 100 million players have played Black Ops and Black Ops II, making Black Ops the most played series in Call of Duty history. In fact, Call of Duty: Black Ops II, originally released in 2012 continues to exhibit record-setting engagement this long after release with millions of actively engaged players who are now eager for the next installment of the series.
Black Ops III is Treyarch's first 3-year development cycle and they've been making the most of it with unparalleled depth of content across 3 modes of play. The Campaign can be played as full single player game or as a co-op game with up to 4 players. The multiplayer experience is the deepest we've ever offered in Call of Duty. And the mind blowing third mode, Call of Duty Zombies experience, features its own XP progression system for the first time.
Another benefit of the 3-year cycle is that we've been able to get the press hands on with the game earlier than ever before and their response has been phenomenal. In fact, positive media sentiment is double what it was last year. And mind you, last year was our previous high watermark. We're confident that anyone who get their hands on the game will agree, which is why we're going to have hands-on multiplayer at E3, as well as this year, our first beta in years. Fans [indiscernible] to the game now on Xbox One or PlayStation 4 or PC will have access to the beta. 
On to Call of Duty Online, which commenced open beta in January in China, the largest gaming market in the world. We're seeing good early trends especially with high engagement from core first person action players. As we said in our last call, this is a game and a business model that will take time to ramp. We're now working with our partner, Tencent, to expand our audience base. We continue to be enthusiastic both about the opportunity in China and about the long-term prospects for our game.
Turning now to Destiny which continues to have incredible online engagement from millions of active players. In fact, these players are still playing on average about 3 hours a day as they have been since launch with strong digital sales and expansion attach rates. In all, Destiny has now received 299 awards, including 31 wins for Game of the Year, most recently adding Action Game of the Year from Dice and Game of the Year at [indiscernible] And everyday, our great partner at Bungie, continues to make the game and online experience better.
Later this month, we plan to launch Destiny's second major expansion pack, House of Wolves, yet another great piece of content to keep our fans engaged. And in the fall, we'll have a major release which will be the biggest content addition yet to the Destiny universe and you'll hear more about that soon.
Onto Skylanders, the industry's top console franchise and title of the year so far. Skylanders have this own unique engagement and monetization loop, real world toy purchases that enable new and different play experiences in the game, in which rollout in ways for our fans throughout the year.
As with our other franchises, Skylanders average revenue per user has grown year-over-year. And while the toy select category that we created is increasingly competitive, we believe it remains highly attractive and one that we will continue to lead with industry best innovation and gameplay. We'll have more details to share soon about the next installment in the Skylanders franchise, which will once again bring fresh innovation to the category and expand the audience even further.
Finally, Guitar Hero. In April, we announced a fall 2015 return for the beloved franchise, which has been played by over 40 million gamers. Consumers affinity for the brand remains incredibly strong and we spent years developing meaningful creative innovation. The new Guitar Hero game is one game with 2 ways to play. Guitar Hero Live, withstands rock real crowds with real reactions and Guitar Hero TV is the world's first playable music video network which offers hundreds of songs and additional content that constantly engage our players. It will be available across consoles, smartphone and tablet devices. The fan of the year response to our [indiscernible] has been overwhelmingly positive and we couldn't be more excited to share additional details later this summer.
Overall, we had a great start to 2015 across our portfolio of titles and I look forward to sharing more news with you at E3. So thanks, and I'll now turn the call over to Mike to talk about Blizzard."

Compared to last year's launch of Hearthstone, Diablo III, Reaper of Souls and presales for Warlords of Draenor, this year's Q1 was relatively quiet for Blizzard Entertainment. Despite this, we continue to have strong performance in terms of engagement. Without any major launches, Battle.net still ended the quarter with the largest Q1 player community in our history, up double-digits percentage-wise year-over-year. This reflect ongoing strength across our portfolio of games. 
On the World of Warcraft front, we launched the first Warlords of Draenor update in Q1, adding new content, Twitter integration and more. This update increased stability in the last few weeks of the quarter. Warlords of Draenor brought more players back than any previous expansion. And showed that even long time lapsed players will return when the right content is offered. On that note, we recently revealed the next major update for the game which will add a ton of new content that will appeal to players across a range of play styles. That's currently on our public test realm and we're looking forward to getting it into players hands as quickly as possible.
We also announced the WoW Token System. Players who purchase a WoW token, priced at $20, can exchange that token with another player for gold. The player who received the token can then redeem it for 1 month game time or a set amount of play time in China. This provides 2 benefits. It enables players to pay for their subscriptions with gold and it provides players with a secured method for purchasing gold in game. We just launched World of Warcraft Tokens in April so it's too early to see the long-term impact. But many players welcome this service and have been using it actively.
This was also a big quarter for Heroes of the Storm, our highly anticipated online team brawler. More than 11 million people have signed up for the closed beta test, which went live in January. We're seeing a lot of anticipation in the gaming community and we're continuing to collect great feedback from our beta testers as we drive towards the launch on June 2.
To showcase the action and depth that the game offers, we recently sponsored a collegiate eSports tournament, which we dubbed Heroes of the Dorm. Thousands of players form teams at over 460 schools across the U.S. and Canada. And similar to March Madness we created a 60 14 [ph] bracket after a few qualifying rounds. Those teams then battle their way to the finals, which were televised live by ESPN. This was the network's first-ever live telecast of a collegiate eSports event. The competition was intense throughout the tournament and we saw the formation of many potential Heroes of the Storm college rivalries. 
I'd like to congratulate the [indiscernible] Golden Bears on their championship victory. We also saw widespread positive commentary across a range of online communities about the event. This is a testament to the fact that Heroes of the Storm is not only fun to play, it's fun to watch. We think it has great potential as a spectator sport.
Q1 was also an important quarter for Hearthstone, despite no new content releases, engagement and revenues were steady quarter-over-quarter and in fact have remained relatively stable since launch. The performance for the quarter was driven by a sustained pickup of Goblins vs Gnomes. Players have really enjoyed the mechanics of the new cards and we've seen some incredibly creative deck strategies.
During the last 2 weeks of March, we held presales for our second adventure, Blackrock Mountain. We were please to see that enthusiasm for the new content was even stronger than it was with Curse of Naxxramas last August, with 40% more sales in the same time frame. That enthusiasm continued with the launch of Blackrock Mountain in April, which was followed by the iPhone and Android phone versions of Hearthstone a few weeks later. The mobile phone versions pushed Hearthstone to the #1 spot for game downloads in over 25 countries across North America, Europe and Asia and quickly drove the game to a new milestone of more than 30 million players. Hearthstone continues to be very popular with players worldwide and we're already hard-at-work on our next release for the game.
We also recently started beta testing the Chinese version of Diablo III together with NetEase in March. There's been a lot of anticipation for the game in China with about 3 million players signing up for the closed beta test. A few weeks ago, we launched the open beta test, opening up the game to everyone else in China. Chinese players are able to access the base experience for free and can buy much of the content from Reaper of Souls via an add-on, which is already available for purchase across 2 offerings, at $32 and $64. In fact, we just announced with NetEase that Diablo III has already achieved over 1 million unit sales in China, which is a fantastic reception from the community. We look forward to building on that momentum as we drive towards the commercial launch.
Lastly, at the end of the quarter, we kicked off the closed beta test for Legacy of the Void, the final chapter of StarCraft II. We know the StarCraft community is eager to play through the conclusion of the story and we've already seen great positive feedback about the game's new multiplayer features. Arkan Mode, which allows 2 players to team up and share control of an army has gotten a very enthusiastic response. We're excited about this feature in particular because it greatly increases accessibility for the game. As I mentioned, previously, Legacy of the Void will be a standalone expansion that doesn't require either of the first 2 releases, so it will be easier to have players to get into the game and experience all of the latest content.
In the eSports side, Season 1 of the StarCraft II World Championship Series came to an exciting conclusion with our finals event in France at the beginning of April. Season 2 is now underway and the finals set to take place at the Metro Convention Center in Toronto at the end of June. It's a thrill to see the top StarCraft II players in the world compete for a spot in the Global Finals. So I hope you'll tune in online if you can't make it in person.
To recap, we had a great start to the year with more games and more genres and on more platforms than ever before. It doesn't look like things will be slowing down anytime soon. We announced that BlizzCon 2015 will take place at the Anaheim Convention Center on November 6 and 7. And tickets for the event sold out quickly once again.
We're going to have a lot to talk about at the show as well as in the months ahead. So now I will turn the call over to Tommy."

Before we open up to Q&A, I will take a moment to summarize the key takeaways from today's call. 
First, 2015 is off to a great start. We over delivered the plan for Q1 and raised our full year guidance which now projects year-over-year EPS growth from operations. And even more important for the long-term prospects of our business, we saw a 25% increase in the size of the player community that engages with our games.
That leaves us with the second key takeaway from today's call. We're successfully transitioning our business with digital year-round engagement model where our community can play and invest in their experiences, not just at launch but throughout the year. This is important because it allows us to improve the player experience by delivering fresh content on a frequent basis while at the same time creating value for our shareholders through deeper and higher-margin monetization of the audiences we serve.
Lastly, our strategic investments in new franchises, platforms and geographies continued to pay off. And along with growing engagement and better monetization, sets the stage for growth ahead. We are well underway to expanding our franchise portfolio from 5 to over 10 with 4 new intellectual properties already in market. The 2 IPs we launched last year, Destiny and Hearthstone combined, now have over 50 million registered players and nearly $1 billion in non-GAAP revenues life-to-date. We have 2 new free-to-play franchises in beta, Call of Duty Online and Heroes of the Storm. We also reached recently announced that this fall, the beloved Guitar Hero franchise will return with product innovation that we couldn't be more excited about. And Overwatch is on the horizon with a beta this fall.
We have an increasing focus on mobile and tablet with Hearthstone's release on iOS and Android smartphones. And Guitar Hero Live's planned released to also include mobile and tablet at launch.
Finally, we are positioned for growth in new geographies. And in particular, in the large and fast-growing China market. We now have 6 franchises in market in China: World of Warcraft, StarCraft, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, Diablo and Call of Duty Online, up from 2 at the end of last year or at the beginning of last year rather.
So let's take a few questions."

Well, the first, and I think, the advantage of the 3-year cycle is just pure quality. That third year allows us more time to innovate and iterate and more time to polish and this is Treyarch's first Call of Duty game with that time period to develop. So the first answer is just this could be a great game. Secondly, you've heard a lot of talk today about driving engagement being key to our business strategy. And, as I mentioned, Black Ops is the most played series in Call of Duty's history. But beyond just that, I agree that both Treyarch's in the Black Ops series, the 3-year cycle also allows us to put a deeper offering on the disc. The MP, the multiplayer game is going to be the deepest and we think the stickiest we have ever made. The Zombies is going to be deeper than ever and it's going to have our first XP progression system, which I think will also drive engagement. And, of course, the campaign has big innovations in it as well. As I mentioned, you can play it as a single player game or as a co-op game with up to 4 friends. So that drives not only increased engagement but replayability because there's more variability in the experience. In terms of the differences with past Black Ops games and Advanced Warfare, the answer is honestly we're building on successes of all of those games but we're also bringing a lot of fresh ideas. I understand when you say see similarities with Advanced Warfare I think, the movement system in Black Ops III picks up where Advanced Warfare left off but improves it and makes it more athletic and intuitive and smoother than ever before and that's been a big theme we've heard from the press who got hands-on with the game at reveal, which we've never been able to do before, which is another good advantage of the 3-year cycle. So I think anyone who gets their hands on the game is going to agree, which is why we're doing hands-on at E3 for the first time in MP in a long while, as well as our first beta in years. So we're really bullish on the content, I think it's going to be a great experience."

The feedback that we have been getting from the closed beta test has been very positive. There's a lot of great buzz around the game. We've had, like I said, over 11 million people signing up for the beta test, so there's a lot of anticipation there. As you know, it's a very popular genre.

The first thing is we think have a great game innovation and that the franchise needs that. And we said when we put it on ice 5 years ago that we would not bring it back unless we really had a breakthrough creative way to bring it back and we think that we have that. In terms of the way the market itself has changed, first of all online social play has transformed gaming over the past 5 years and GHTV is going to be constantly updated with new content to keep the game fresh and to keep people engaged and it also allows people to compete online with their friends in a highly social way. I think this has the potential to have the kind of sticky long tail engagement that defines the rest of our portfolio and our major franchises. Second, the games [indiscernible] marks the 5 years and during that time, we have a console transition, we now have powerful new consoles in the marketplace that give us the opportunity to deliver that rockstar fantasy in a more vivid and visceral way with ever before, just what the Live mode is really going to do. Third is mobile has had explosive growth over the last 5 years with casual players. And one of the breakthrough innovations is that you will be able to have the entire experience on mobile and this is a great experience both on the go, on the glass or with the full experience with the guitar on your big screen TV. So we think that's a big innovation for us and a big opportunity for us as well. And finally, as I mentioned at the reveal, we've improved and innovated on the guitar itself, managing to make it both easier and more accessible to a casual player, while also managing to make it more challenging than ever for an advanced player, so we think we're going to widen the appeal of the game in that score as well. As we mentioned, that guitar is going to be forward compatible with any additional games that will come out, that's going to be a better consumer experience we think this time around. It's going to focus us on innovating on the software and keeping the game more engaging and as opposed to the hardware like the last time around."

And I would say both the expansiveness of the universe as well as the innovation that Bungie has established with bringing together the best of both first-person action games with MMORPG has led Destiny to become already I think, one of the most engaging games ever. As I said, the active Destiny players are still playing for about 3 hours a day, which is just remarkable amounts of engagement from a large and passionate player base. So this points to exactly the kind of model that I spoke about for all of our games, great content, leading to large audiences, leading to our ability to monetize those committees by providing more great content. So the answer is we have a very robust content plan for Destiny starting with our second major expansion pack, House of Wolves, which has already been announced. And then you'll also see content engaging -- content being dropped throughout the summer. And in the fall, we'll have a major release, which will be the biggest addition to the Destiny universe yet across all modes of play, unfortunately I don't have more details than that today. But we're confident it's going to be incredibly [indiscernible] not just to our current fans but also to people who have not yet joined the Destiny universe, it's going to be that big of an expansion."

But right now, you have so many players around the world who dedicate so much of their time and their energy and their passion playing our games that we never really want to take that for granted and this is a way to celebrate them. So you have seen a lot of value created so far with star players and we have players who are earning over $1 million a year between endorsements and winnings. Then you've seen opportunities for shop casters at professional events who are also earning meaningful revenues. And then for our players themselves who are narrating their own game play and are starting to develop millions of fans. And then we have gamers who are competing in price events like Blizzard's Heroes of the Dorm that we just posted last weekend. We gave away college scholarships to Berkeley, the winning team. And we also with Call of Duty Championship where we paid out $1 million in price money. So if you look at the numbers of spectators that are now watching gameplay, you're probably looking at, just for our content alone last year, somewhere around 1 billion hours of spectating, of linear play. And so from a lot of perspectives, it's something that when we look out into the future, we are incredibly excited about both as way to really recognize our player's investment and commitment but also from a commercial perspective."

Usually, I end my remarks by thanking our incredibly talented, extraordinarily committed employees around the world. But today, I'm leading with it because they are in fact the reason we remain one of the world's most successful game companies. And also during this quarter, for the first time, we were recognized by Fortune as one of the 100 Best Companies to Work For. Inclusion on this list is largely determined by employee survey results, and to be recognized as a great place to work by a respected institution like Fortune is gratifying and rewarding. But being acknowledged as a great institution by our own people means more to me than just about anything. And I'd like to thank our wildly talented, inspired, driven and hard-working teams for everything they do to capture the imagination of tens of millions of people day after day. 
Our talented teams around the world continue to create experiences that inspire our players, drive deeper levels of engagement in our games by our massive and growing global communities of fans. In the last 12 months we had over 150 million active users around the world playing our games for more than 12 billion hours and spectators watching over 1 billion hours of linear content based on our games. In the hour we'll spend on this conference call, we expect over 1 million people to interact with Activision Blizzard franchises alone. And in the past year, our communities grew by more than 25%.
This deepening level of engagement with a widening base of players across our franchises is what drove another successful quarter. We delivered better-than-expected Q1 results, increased our 2015 non-GAAP revenue outlook to $4.425 billion and our earnings per share outlook to $1.20 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, we delivered record higher margin digital revenues of over $0.5 billion, a first quarter record on an absolute basis and an all-time high on a percentage basis.
As we celebrate our 35th anniversary, we continue to create extraordinary entertainment for our fans. We couldn't be more excited to continue to do so for another 35 years. Our greatest achievement continues to be our ability to attract and retain the most talented employees around the world and because of that, I have never been more excited or confident about our future.

4222231,289734224,806114,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 06, 2015",2015-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bobby. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our better-than-expected Q1 financial results, our outlook for Q2 and our increased outlook for 2015.Q1 was a great quarter that displayed strong trends on our year-round monetizing franchise",1345,"Thanks, Bobby. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our better-than-expected Q1 financial results, our outlook for Q2 and our increased outlook for 2015.
Q1 was a great quarter that displayed strong trends on our year-round monetizing franchises. We overperformed our non-GAAP February guidance by over $60 million on revenue, $100 million on operating income and $0.11 on EPS. Even though we had a relatively lighter slate in Q1 this year, non-GAAP revenue and EPS were flat to Q1 last year on a constant FX basis given strong digital trends. Non-GAAP digital revenues comprised a record percentage of overall revenues, up 800 basis points year-over-year.
Turning to our financial results. Please refer to our earnings release for full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations. Also, the numbers I'll be quoting are compared to the prior year unless otherwise noted. For the quarter on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.3 billion, up 15% year-over-year; an operating margin of 43%, up from 37% last year; and a record quarterly GAAP EPS of $0.53, up 33% year-over-year and up $0.16 versus our February guidance.
For the quarter on a non-GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $703 million, an operating margin of 29% and EPS of $0.16. Of the $0.11 in non-GAAP EPS over performance versus guidance, about $0.05 was related to timing for costs that shifted out of the quarter and about $0.06 was related to strong franchise momentum, including digital sales and engagement trends with our large community of fans.
Activision Publishing had a strong Season Pass downloadable content and expansion attach rates on both Call of Duty and Destiny. Console full game downloads represent a high-teens share of total units and continued to increase year-over-year. Blizzard Entertainment had a steady and strong performance on Hearthstone with ongoing engagement on the Q4 expansion, Goblins vs Gnomes.
As mentioned during our February earnings call and consistent with our experience following prior expansions, we saw a decline in World of Warcraft subscribers. Subscribers ended the quarter at 7.1 million. World of Warcraft's revenue performance at constant FX has been more stable, driven by continued strong uptake on value-added services and price increases in select regions, which partially offset the subscriber declines particularly in the east.
Moreover, Blizzard has successfully expanded their portfolio over the recent past and continues to do so. Growth from franchises like Hearthstone and Diablo had boosted Blizzard's top line and had pushed Blizzard's non-World of Warcraft revenue streams of 30% of total revenue in 2013 to 40% of total revenue in 2014, even while the World of Warcraft revenues also increased in that period. And new franchises like Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm are expected to further expand non-World of Warcraft revenues in more than 50% share of the Blizzard business in 2015. So strong recurring franchise diversification is in process inside the Blizzard portfolio, which sets us up for a bright 2016 and beyond.
Turning to specific P&L items. Please note that all percentages are based on revenues except for the tax rate. For Q1, GAAP product costs were 20%, operating expenses were 37% and operating margin was 43%. GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense was $50 million and our GAAP tax rate was 20%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted weighted share count was 741 million, including participating securities. On a non-GAAP basis for the quarter, product costs were 21%, operating expenses were 50% and operating margin was 29%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 32%. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%.
In terms of cash flow, in Q1, we generated strong cash flow with non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $223 million, operating cash flow of $209 million and free cash flow of $188 million after CapEx. We also repaid $250 million of our term loan in February and next week on May 13, we plan to pay a $0.23 per share cash dividend or approximately $167 million in aggregate to shareholders of record as of March 30.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of March 31, we had approximately $4.5 billion in cash and investments, of which over $1 billion was held domestically. We had total debt of $4.12 billion and net cash of $360 million.
Turning to FX. Please note that as discussed on our February call, currency fluctuations continue to be a headwind that we will monitor. In Q1, the year-over-year impact of the strengthening dollar was $68 million on revenue and $0.03 on EPS. As mentioned, both revenue and EPS would have been flat year-over-year at constant FX. In summary, Q1 was a very strong start of the year for Activision Blizzard. So now let's turn to our slate and our outlook for Q2 and for the balance of 2015.
Our expected Q2 slate from Activision Publishing includes additional downloadable content releases from Call of Duty and Destiny and continued live operations during the open beta for Call of Duty Online in China. Blizzard Entertainment's Q2 slate is a robust offering across the portfolio, including Hearthstone's new adventure, Blackrock Mountain, Hearthstone's important iOS and Android smartphone releases; Diablo III's launch in China; StarCraft: Legacy of the Void's closed beta; and Heroes of the Storm's launch in June. In Q2, we also expect to begin the ramp in sales and marketing spending for our major releases in the back half the year.
Now to the numbers. For Q2 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $930 million, product costs of 20% and operating expenses of 52%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $50 million, a GAAP tax rate of 25%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 745 million and EPS of $0.21. For Q2 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $650 million, product cost of 19% and operating expenses of 63%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 26% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.07.
Our expected Q3 and Q4 slate from Activision Publishing is one of the strongest we've ever had, including the biggest addition to the Destiny universe yet, Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which we are very excited about; a new innovative release for Skylanders; and the return of one of our most beloved IPs with Guitar Hero Live as well as further ramp up of our audience playing Call of Duty Online in China. Blizzard Entertainment will bring additional content and live service updates to World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm as well as bring Overwatch into closed beta.
Now to our 2015 full year numbers. For 2015 on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.25 billion, an increase of $110 million versus our guidance in February; product cost of 23%; and operating expenses of 50%. For both GAAP and non-GAAP, we expect interest expense of $202 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 22%. We expect 750 million fully diluted shares both for GAAP and non-GAAP, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.98, up $0.09 from our February guidance. For 2015, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.425 billion, $25 million higher than our February guidance; product cost of 24%; operating  expenses of 45%; and an operating margin of 31%, 100 basis points better than our February guidance. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 24%.
For the year, we are raising our full year outlook by $0.05 to $1.20. As I mentioned earlier, strong business momentum in Q1 amounted to $0.06 of EPS favorability, which is partially offset by $0.01 of FX headwind given the further strengthening of the dollar since we last gave guidance in February. See our accompanying earnings materials for FX assumptions.
So in summary, the transition to digital continues inside of our business, helping to further drive our year-round engagement and monetization model where our community can play and invest in their experiences throughout the entire year. Along with these digital trends, our strategic investments in new franchises, platforms and geographies are paying off and set the stage for growth ahead.
Now I will turn the call over to Eric to discuss Activision Publishing."

Activision Publishing is off to a great start and in Q1, we significantly outperformed last year's results, with revenues up 28% year-on-year. We have 2 of the top 5 video game franchises globally year-to-date. We continue to have 3 of the",1074,"Thanks, Dennis. Activision Publishing is off to a great start and in Q1, we significantly outperformed last year's results, with revenues up 28% year-on-year. We have 2 of the top 5 video game franchises globally year-to-date. We continue to have 3 of the top 5 next-gen games life-to-date with Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare remaining the #1 title on next gen as it has since its launch 6 months ago. Including toys, Skylanders is also the #1 console franchise and title globally in Q1, outsold the #1 action figure line globally and of course, was the #1 kids console franchise and title globally.
Over the past few years, we have methodically and effectively expanded our portfolio, which now includes 3 industry leading franchises, each one of which keeps players engaged all year round. This engagement creates a virtuous cycle: great content leading to large engaged communities, leading to our ability to monetize those communities by providing more great content. This is why we have the biggest Q1 online player community in our history, up double-digit percentages year-over-year. And it is also why based on our current trajectory, Activision Publishing will likely deliver our biggest year yet of digital revenues.
So let me share a few more specifics by franchise, starting with Call of Duty. In the first quarter, revenue was up by double-digit percentage year-over-year due to the strong sell-through of Advanced Warfare and growing online revenues per user across our recent Call of Duty titles. Sales of Season Pass and Map Packs were up significantly, and we introduced a new consumable digital mechanic in Advanced Warfare, which drove engagement and allowed our players to invest more deeply in their online experience.
We recently revealed Call of Duty: Black Ops III from our award-winning studio Treyarch. Nearly 100 million players have played Black Ops and Black Ops II, making Black Ops the most played series in Call of Duty history. In fact, Call of Duty: Black Ops II, originally released in 2012, continues to exhibit record-setting engagement this long after release with millions of actively engaged players who are now eager for the next installment of the series.
Black Ops III is Treyarch's first 3-year development cycle and they've been making the most of it with unparalleled depth of content across 3 modes of play. The campaign can be played as full single player game or as a co-op game with up to 4 players. The multiplayer experience is the deepest we've ever offered in Call of Duty, and the mind blowing third mode, Call of Duty Zombies experience that features its own XP progression system for the first time.
Another benefit of the 3-year cycle is that we've been able to get the press hands on with the game earlier than ever before and their response has been phenomenal. In fact, positive media sentiment is double what it was last year, and mind you, last year was our previous high-water mark. We're confident that anyone who gets their hands on the game will agree, which is why we're going to have hands-on multiplayer at E3 as well as this year, our first beta in years. Fans who preordered the game now on Xbox One or PlayStation 4 or PC will have access to the beta.
On to Call of Duty Online, which commenced open beta in January in China, the largest gaming market in the world. We're seeing good early trends especially with high engagement from core first-person action players. As we said on our last call, this is a game and a business model that will take time to ramp, and we're now working with our partner, Tencent, to expand our audience base. We continue to be enthusiastic both about the opportunity in China and about the long-term prospects for our game.
Turning now to Destiny, which continues to have incredible online engagement from millions of active players. In fact, these players are still playing on average about 3 hours a day as they have been since launch with strong digital sales and expansion attach rates. In all, Destiny has now received 299 awards, including 31 wins for Game of the Year, most recently adding Action Game of the Year from D.I.C.E. and Game of the Year at the BAFTAs. And every day, our great partner at Bungie continues to make the game and online experience better.
Later this month, we plan to launch Destiny's second major expansion pack, House of Wolves, yet another great piece of content to keep our fans engaged. In the fall, we'll have a major release which will be the biggest content addition yet to the Destiny universe and you'll hear more about that soon.
On to Skylanders, the industry's top console franchise and title of the year so far. Skylanders has its own unique engagement and monetization loop, real world toy purchases that enable new and different play experiences in the game and which roll out in ways for our fans throughout the year. As with our other franchises, Skylanders average revenue per user has grown year-over-year. And while the toys led category that we created is increasingly competitive, we believe it remains highly attractive and one that we will continue to lead with industry best innovation and game play. We'll have more details to share soon about the next installment in the Skylanders franchise, which will once again bring fresh innovation to the category and expand the audience even further.
Finally, Guitar Hero. In April, we announced a fall 2015 return for the beloved franchise which has been played by over 40 million gamers. Consumers' affinity for the brand remains incredibly strong, and we spent years developing meaningful creative innovation. The new Guitar Hero game is one game with 2 ways to play: Guitar Hero Live lets fans rock real crowds with real reactions; and Guitar Hero TV is the world's first playable music video network, which offers hundreds of songs and additional content to constantly engage our players. The game will be available across consoles, smartphone and tablet devices. The fan and media response to our reveal has been overwhelmingly positive, and we couldn't be more excited to share additional details later this summer.
Overall, we had a great start to 2015 across our portfolio of titles and we look forward to sharing more news with you at E3. So thanks, and I'll now turn the call over to Mike to talk about Blizzard."

Compared to last year's launch of Hearthstone, Diablo III: Reaper of Souls and presales for Warlords of Draenor, this year's Q1 was relatively quiet for Blizzard Entertainment. Despite this, we continue to have strong performance in terms of engagement. Without any major launches, Battle.net still ended the quarter with the largest Q1 player community in our history, up double-digits percentage-wise year-over-year. This reflects ongoing strength across our portfolio of games. 
On the World of Warcraft front, we launched the first Warlords of Draenor update in Q1, adding new content, Twitter integration and more. This update increased stability in the last few weeks of the quarter. Warlords of Draenor brought more players back than any previous expansions and showed that even long time lapsed players will return when the right content is offered. On that note, we recently revealed the next major update for the game, which will add a ton of new content that will appeal to players across a range of play styles. That's currently on our public test realm, and we're looking forward to getting it into players hands as quickly as possible.
We also announced the WoW Token System. Players who purchase a WoW token priced at $20 can exchange that token with another player for gold. The player who received the token can then redeem it for 1 month game time or a set amount of play time in China. This provides 2 benefits. It enables players to pay for their subscriptions with their gold, and it provides players with a secure method for purchasing gold in-game. We just launched World of Warcraft Tokens in April so it's too early to see the long-term impact, but many players welcome this service and have been using it actively.
This was also a big quarter for Heroes of the Storm, our highly anticipated online team brawler. More than 11 million people have signed up for the closed beta test, which went live in January. We're seeing a lot of anticipation in the gaming community, and we're continuing to collect great feedback from our beta testers as we drive towards the launch on June 2.
To showcase the action and depth that the game offers, we recently sponsored a collegiate eSports tournament, which we dubbed Heroes of the Dorm. Thousands of players formed teams at over 460 schools across the U.S. and Canada. And similar to March Madness, we created a 64 team bracket after a few qualifying rounds. Those teams then battle their way to the finals, which were televised live by ESPN. This was the network's first-ever live telecast of a collegiate eSports event. The competition was intense throughout the tournament, and we saw the formation of many potential Heroes of the Storm college rivalries. I'd like to congratulate the Cal Berkeley Golden Bears on their championship victory. We also saw widespread positive commentary across a range of online communities about the event. This is a testament to the fact that Heroes of the Storm is not only fun to play, it's fun to watch. We think it has great potential as a spectator sport.
Q1 was also an important quarter for Hearthstone. Despite no new content releases, engagement and revenues were steady quarter-over-quarter and in fact, have remained relatively stable since launch. The performance for the quarter was driven by a sustained pickup of Goblins vs Gnomes. Players have really enjoyed the mechanics of the new cards, and we've seen some incredibly creative deck strategies.
During the last 2 weeks of March, we held presales for our second adventure, Blackrock Mountain. We were pleased to see that enthusiasm for the new content was even stronger than it was with Curse of Naxxramas last August, with 40% more sales in the same time frame. That enthusiasm continued with the launch of Blackrock Mountain in April, which was followed by the iPhone and Android phone versions of Hearthstone a few weeks later. The mobile phone versions pushed Hearthstone to the #1 spot for game downloads in over 25 countries across North America, Europe and Asia and quickly drove the game to a new milestone of more than 30 million players. Hearthstone continues to be very popular with players worldwide, and we're already hard at work on our next release for the game.
We also recently started beta testing the Chinese version of Diablo III together with NetEase in March. There has been a lot of anticipation for the game in China with about 3 million players signing up for the closed beta test. Two weeks ago, we launched the open beta test, opening up the game to everyone else in China. Chinese players are able to access the base experience for free and can buy much of the content from Reaper of Souls via an add-on, which is already available for purchase across 2 offerings priced at $32 and $64. In fact, we just announced with NetEase that Diablo III has already achieved over 1 million unit sales in China, which is a fantastic reception from the community. We look forward to building on that momentum as we drive towards the commercial launch.
Lastly, at the end of the quarter, we kicked off the closed beta test for Legacy of the Void, the final chapter of StarCraft II. We know the StarCraft community is eager to play through the conclusion of the story, and we've already seen great positive feedback about the game's new multiplayer features. Archon Mode, which allows 2 players to team up and share control of an army, has gotten a very enthusiastic response. We're excited about this feature in particular because it greatly increases accessibility for the game. As I mentioned previously, Legacy of the Void will be a standalone expansion that doesn't require either of the first 2 releases. So it will be easier to have -- for players to get into the game and experience all of the latest content.
On the eSports side, Season 1 of the StarCraft II World Championship Series came to an exciting conclusion with our finals event in France at the beginning of April. Season 2 is now underway and the finals are set to take place at the Metro Convention Centre in Toronto at the end of June. It's a thrill to see the top StarCraft II players in the world compete for a spot in the Global Finals, so I hope you'll tune in online if you can't make it in person.
To recap, we had a great start to the year. With more games in more genres and on more platforms than ever before, it doesn't look like things will be slowing down anytime soon. We announced that BlizzCon 2015 will take place at the Anaheim Convention Center on November 6 and 7, and tickets for the event sold out quickly once again. We're going to have a lot to talk about at the show as well as in the months ahead.
So now I will turn the call over to Thomas."

Before we open the call to Q&A, I'll take a moment to summarize the key takeaways from today's call.
First, 2015 is off to a great start. We over delivered the plan for Q1 and raised our full year guidance which now projects year-over-year EPS growth from operations. And even more important for the long-term prospects of our business, we saw a 25% increase in the size of the player community that engages with our games.
That leads me to the second key takeaway from today's call. We are successfully transitioning our business to a digital year-round engagement model where our community can play and invest in their experiences not just at launch but throughout the year. This is important because it allows us to improve the player experience by delivering fresh content on a frequent basis, while at the same time creating value for our shareholders through deeper and higher-margin monetization of the audiences we serve.
Lastly, our strategic investments in new franchises, platforms and geographies continued to pay off and along with growing engagement and better monetization, sets the stage for growth ahead. We are well underway to expanding our franchise portfolio from 5 to over 10 with 4 new intellectual properties already in market. The 2 IPs we launched last year, Destiny and Hearthstone combined, now have over 50 million registered players and nearly $1 billion in non-GAAP revenues life-to-date. We have 2 new free-to-play franchises in beta, Call of Duty Online and Heroes of the Storm. We also recently announced that this fall, the beloved Guitar Hero franchise will return with product innovation that we couldn't be more excited about, and Overwatch is on the horizon with a beta this fall. We have an increasing focus on mobile and tablet with Hearthstone's release on iOS and Android smartphones and Guitar Hero Live's planned released to also include mobile and tablet at launch.
Finally, we are positioned for growth in new geographies and in particular, in the large and fast-growing China market. We now have 6 franchises in market in China: World of Warcraft, StarCraft, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, Diablo and Call of Duty Online, up from 2 at the end of last year -- sorry, at the beginning of last year rather.
So now let's take a few questions."

We've seen an increase in new players. As I said, it's pushed us past the 30 million player mark. We're very excited about that. Overall, engagement and revenue levels have increased meaningfully with the release of the phone version, and they continue to be strong. So we're not breaking down usage across platforms, but I think it is important to note that Hearthstone is a little bit unique and that is a shared ecosystem. So many of our players do choose to play across multiple platforms, and they have access to the same cards regardless which platform they're playing on."

Well, the first and I think most obvious advantage of the 3-year cycle is just pure creative quality. That third year allows us more time to innovate and iterate and more time to polish, and this is Treyarch's first Call of Duty game with that time period to develop. So the first answer is it's just going to be a great game. Secondly, you've heard a lot of talk today about driving engagement being key to our business strategy and as I mentioned, Black Ops is the most played series in Call of Duty's history. But beyond just that pedigree of both Treyarch in the Black Ops series, the 3-year cycle has also allowed us to put a deeper offering on the desk. The MP, the multiplayer game, is going to be the deepest and we think the stickiest we've ever made. The Zombies is going to be deeper than ever, and it's going to have our first XP progression system, which we think will also drive engagement. And of course, the campaign has big innovations in it as well. As I mentioned, you can play it as a single player game or as a co-op game with up to 4 friends. So that drives not only increased engagement but replayability because there's more variability in the experience. In terms of the differences with past Black Ops games and Advanced Warfare, the answer is honestly we're building on successes of all of those games, but we're also bringing a lot of fresh ideas. I understand when you say you see similarities with Advanced Warfare. I think the movement system in Black Ops III picks up where Advanced Warfare's left off, but improves it and makes it more athletic and intuitive and smoother than ever before. And that's been a big theme we've heard from the press who got hands-on with the game at reveal, which we've never been able to do before, which is another good advantage of the 3-year cycle. So I think anyone who gets their hands on the game is going to agree, which is why we're doing hands-on at E3 for the first time, in MP in a long while as well as our first beta in years. So we're really bullish on the content and think it's going to be a great experience."

And I do think that relative to some of the other options in the genre, it is easier to get into Heroes. And I think judging by the response that we've gotten from our recent Heroes of the Dorm tournament, I think it's easier to watch as well. The feedback that we've been getting from the closed beta test has been very positive. There's a lot of great buzz around the game. We've had, like I said, over 11 million people signing up for the beta test, so there's a lot of anticipation there. As you know, it's a very popular genre. I think the fact that this is a digital game with long-term content opportunities, we're very optimistic about Heroes of the Storm and how it can grow to become another key game in our portfolio. And I think in terms of how the monetization curve will look, we expect to get started strong on June 2, and we are hoping that, that will grow over time."

Well, yes, a lot has changed in the market in that time and we think for the better in terms of our prospects with Guitar Hero. The first thing is that we think we have a great game innovation and that the franchise needs that. And we said when we put it on ice 5 years ago that we wouldn't bring it back unless we really had a breakthrough creative way to bring it back, and we think that we have that. In terms of the way the market itself has changed, first of all, online social play has transformed gaming over the past 5 years and GHTV is going to be constantly updated with new content to keep the game fresh and to keep people engaged and it also allows people to compete online with their friends in a highly social way. We think this has the potential to have the kind of sticky long tail engagement that defines the rest of our portfolio in our major franchises. Second, the game's been on the market for 5 years and during that time, we've had a console transition. We now have powerful new consoles in the marketplace that give us the opportunity to deliver that rockstar fantasy in a more vivid and visceral way with ever before. It's just what the Live mode is really going to do. Third is mobile has had explosive growth over the last 5 years with casual players. And one of the breakthrough innovations is that you'll be able to have the entire experience on mobile and this is a great experience both on the go, on the glass or with the full experience with the guitar in your big screen TV. So we think that's a big innovation for us and a big opportunity for us as well. And finally, as I mentioned at the reveal, we've improved and innovated on the guitar itself, managing to make it both easier and more accessible to a casual player while also managing to make it more challenging than ever for an advanced player. So we think we're going to widen the appeal of the game in that score as well. And also, we mentioned we're -- that guitar is going to be forward compatible with any additional games that come out. That's going to be a better consumer experience we think this time around. It's going to focus us on innovating on the software and keeping the game more engaging as opposed to the hardware like last time around."

But obviously, a constant stream of robust content is integral to our plans on Destiny. And I would say both the expansiveness of the universe as well as the innovation that Bungie's established with bringing together the best of both first-person action games with MMORPG has led Destiny to become already, I think, one of the most engaging games ever. As I said, the active Destiny players are still playing for about 3 hours a day, which is just remarkable amounts of engagement from a large and passionate player base. So this points to exactly the kind of model that I spoke about for all of our games: great content, leading to large audiences, leading to our ability to monetize those communities by providing more great content. So the answer is we have a very robust content plan for Destiny starting with our second major expansion pack, House of Wolves, which has already been announced. And then you'll also see content engaging -- content being dropped throughout the summer. And then in the fall, we will have a major release, which will be the biggest addition to the Destiny universe yet across all modes of play. Unfortunately, I don't have more details than that today, but we're confident it's going to be incredibly appealing, not just to our current fans but also to people who haven't yet joined the Destiny universe. It's going to be that big of an expansion."

You've seen a lot of value created so far with star players, and we have players who are earning over $1 million a year between endorsements and winnings. Then you've seen opportunities for shoutcasters at professional events who are also earning meaningful revenues, and then for our players themselves who are now rating their own game play and are now starting to develop millions of fans. And then we have gamers who are competing in price events like Blizzard's Heroes of the Dorm that we just posted last weekend. We gave away college scholarships to Berkeley, the winning team. And we recently also had the Call of Duty Championships where we paid out $1 million in price money. So if you look at the numbers of spectators that are now watching game play, you're probably looking at, just for our content alone last year, somewhere around 1 billion hours of spectating of linear play. And so from a lot of perspectives, it's something that when we look out into the future, we are incredibly excited about both as way to really recognize our players' investment and commitment, but also from a commercial perspective."

Usually, I end my remarks by thanking our incredibly talented, extraordinarily committed employees around the world. But today, I'm leading with it because they are in fact the reason we remain one of the world's most successful game companies. And also during this quarter, for the first time, we were recognized by Fortune as one of the 100 Best Companies to Work For. Inclusion on this list is largely determined by employee survey results, and to be recognized as a great place to work by a respected institution like Fortune is gratifying and rewarding. But being acknowledged as a great institution by our own people means more to me than just about anything. And I'd like to thank our wildly talented, inspired, driven and hard-working teams for everything they do to capture the imagination of tens of millions of people day after day. 
Our talented teams around the world continue to create experiences that inspire our players, drive deeper levels of engagement in our games by our massive and growing global communities of fans. In the last 12 months, we had over 150 million active users around the world playing our games for more than 12 billion hours and spectators watching over 1 billion hours of linear content based on our games. In the hour we'll spend on this conference call, we expect over 1 million people to interact with Activision Blizzard franchises alone. And in the past year, our communities grew by more than 25%.
This deepening level of engagement with a widening base of players across our franchises is what drove another successful quarter. We delivered better-than-expected Q1 results, increased our 2015 non-GAAP revenue outlook to $4.425 billion and our earnings per share outlook to $1.20 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, we delivered record higher-margin digital revenues of over $0.5 billion, a first quarter record on an absolute basis and an all-time high on a percentage basis.
As we celebrate our 35th anniversary, we continue to create extraordinary entertainment for our fans. We couldn't be more excited to continue to do so for another 35 years. Our greatest achievement continues to be our ability to attract and retain the most talented employees around the world and because of that, I have never been more excited or confident about our future.
And now I'll turn the call over to Dennis."
4222231,289734224,806166,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 06, 2015",2015-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bobby. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our better-than-expected Q1 financial results, our outlook for Q2 and our increased outlook for 2015.Q1 was a great quarter that displayed strong trends on our year-round monetizing franchise",1344,"Thanks, Bobby. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our better-than-expected Q1 financial results, our outlook for Q2 and our increased outlook for 2015.
Q1 was a great quarter that displayed strong trends on our year-round monetizing franchises. We overperformed our non-GAAP February guidance by over $60 million on revenue, $100 million on operating income and $0.11 on EPS. Even though we had a relatively lighter slate in Q1 this year, non-GAAP revenue and EPS were flat to Q1 last year on a constant FX basis, given strong digital trends. Non-GAAP digital revenues comprised a record percentage of overall revenues, up 800 basis points year-over-year.
Turning to our financial results. Please refer to our earnings release for full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations. Also, the numbers I'll be quoting are compared to the prior year unless otherwise noted. For the quarter on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.3 billion, up 15% year-over-year; an operating margin of 43%, up from 37% last year; and a record quarterly GAAP EPS of $0.53, up 33% year-over-year and up $0.16 versus our February guidance.
For the quarter on a non-GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $703 million, an operating margin of 29% and EPS of $0.16. Of the $0.11 in non-GAAP EPS over performance versus guidance, about $0.05 was related to timing for costs that shifted out of the quarter and about $0.06 was related to strong franchise momentum, including digital sales and engagement trends with our large community of fans.
Activision Publishing had a strong Season Pass, downloadable content and expansion attach rates on both Call of Duty and Destiny. Console full-game downloads represent a high-teens share of total units and continued to increase year-over-year. Blizzard Entertainment had a steady and strong performance on Hearthstone with ongoing engagement on the Q4 expansion, Goblins vs Gnomes.
As mentioned during our February earnings call and consistent with our experience following prior expansions, we saw a decline in World of Warcraft subscribers. Subscribers ended the quarter at 7.1 million. World of Warcraft's revenue performance at constant FX has been more stable, driven by continued strong uptake on value-added services and price increases in select regions, which partially offset the subscriber declines, particularly in the east.
Moreover, Blizzard has successfully expanded their portfolio over the recent past and continues to do so. Growth from franchises like Hearthstone and Diablo had boosted Blizzard's top line and had pushed Blizzard's non-World of Warcraft revenue streams from 30% of total revenue in 2013 to 40% of total revenue in 2014, even while the World of Warcraft revenues also increased in that period. And new franchises like Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm are expected to further expand non-World of Warcraft revenues to more than 50% share of the Blizzard business in 2015. So strong recurring franchise diversification is in process inside the Blizzard portfolio, which sets us up for a bright 2016 and beyond.
Turning to specific P&L items. Please note that all percentages are based on revenues, except for the tax rate. For Q1, GAAP product costs were 20%, operating expenses were 37% and operating margin was 43%. GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense was $50 million and our GAAP tax rate was 20%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted weighted share count was 741 million, including participating securities. On a non-GAAP basis for the quarter, product costs were 21%, operating expenses were 50% and operating margin was 29%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 32%. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%.
In terms of cash flow, in Q1, we generated strong cash flow with non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $223 million, operating cash flow of $209 million and free cash flow of $188 million after CapEx. We also repaid $250 million of our term loan in February and next week, on May 13, we plan to pay a $0.23 per share cash dividend or approximately $167 million in aggregate to shareholders of record as of March 30.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of March 31, we had approximately $4.5 billion in cash and investments, of which over $1 billion was held domestically. We had total debt of $4.12 billion and net cash of $360 million.
Turning to FX. Please note that as discussed on our February call, currency fluctuations continue to be a headwind that we will monitor. In Q1, the year-over-year impact of the strengthening dollar was $68 million on revenue and $0.03 on EPS. As mentioned, both revenue and EPS would have been flat year-over-year at constant FX. In summary, Q1 was a very strong start of the year for Activision Blizzard. So now let's turn to our slate and our outlook for Q2 and for the balance of 2015.
Our expected Q2 slate from Activision Publishing includes additional downloadable content releases from Call of Duty and Destiny and continued live operations during the open beta for Call of Duty Online in China. Blizzard Entertainment's Q2 slate is a robust offering across the portfolio, including Hearthstone's new adventure, Blackrock Mountain; Hearthstone's important iOS and Android smartphone releases; Diablo III's launch in China; StarCraft: Legacy of the Void's closed beta; and Heroes of the Storm's launch in June. In Q2, we also expect to begin the ramp in sales and marketing spending for our major releases in the back half the year.
Now to the numbers. For Q2 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $930 million, product costs of 20% and operating expenses of 52%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $50 million, a GAAP tax rate of 25%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 745 million and EPS of $0.21. For Q2 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $650 million, product cost of 19% and operating expenses of 63%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 26% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.07.
Our expected Q3 and Q4 slate from Activision Publishing is one of the strongest we've ever had, including the biggest addition to the Destiny universe yet, Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which we are very excited about; a new innovative release for Skylanders; and the return of one of our most beloved IPs with Guitar Hero Live; as well as further ramp up of our audience playing Call of Duty Online in China. Blizzard Entertainment will bring additional content and live service updates to World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm, as well as bring Overwatch into closed beta.
Now to our 2015 full year numbers. For 2015 on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.25 billion, an increase of $110 million versus our guidance in February; product cost of 23%; and operating expenses of 50%. For both GAAP and non-GAAP, we expect interest expense of $202 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 22%. We expect 750 million fully diluted shares both for GAAP and non-GAAP, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.98, up $0.09 from our February guidance. For 2015, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.425 billion, $25 million higher than our February guidance; product cost of 24%; operating  expenses of 45%; and an operating margin of 31%, 100 basis points better than our February guidance. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 24%.
For the year, we are raising our full year outlook by $0.05 to $1.20. As I mentioned earlier, strong business momentum in Q1 amounted to $0.06 of EPS favorability, which is partially offset by $0.01 of FX headwind given the further strengthening of the dollar since we last gave guidance in February. See our accompanying earnings materials for FX assumptions.
So in summary, the transition to digital continues inside of our business, helping to further drive our year-round engagement and monetization model, where our community can play and invest in their experiences throughout the entire year. Along with these digital trends, our strategic investments in new franchises, platforms and geographies are paying off and set the stage for growth ahead.
Now I will turn the call over to Eric to discuss Activision Publishing."

Activision Publishing is off to a great start and in Q1, we significantly outperformed last year's results with revenues up 28% year-on-year. We have 2 of the top 5 video game franchises globally year-to-date. We continue to have 3 of the top 5 next-gen games life-to-date, with Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare remaining the #1 title on next gen as it has since its launch 6 months ago. Including toys, Skylanders is also the #1 console franchise and title globally in Q1, outsold the #1 action figure line globally and of course, was the #1 kids console franchise and title globally.
Over the past few years, we have methodically and effectively expanded our portfolio, which now includes 3 industry-leading franchises, each one of which keeps players engaged all year round. This engagement creates a virtuous cycle: great content leading to large engaged communities, leading to our ability to monetize those communities by providing more great content. This is why we have the biggest Q1 online player community in our history, up double-digit percentages year-over-year. And it is also why, based on our current trajectory, Activision Publishing will likely deliver our biggest year yet of digital revenues.
So let me share a few more specifics by franchise, starting with Call of Duty. In the first quarter, revenue was up by double-digit percentage year-over-year due to the strong sell-through of Advanced Warfare and growing online revenues per user across our recent Call of Duty titles. Sales of Season Pass and Map Packs were up significantly, and we introduced a new consumable digital mechanic in Advanced Warfare, which drove engagement and allowed our players to invest more deeply in their online experience.
We recently revealed Call of Duty: Black Ops III from our award-winning studio Treyarch. Nearly 100 million players have played Black Ops and Black Ops II, making Black Ops the most played series in Call of Duty history. In fact, Call of Duty: Black Ops II, originally released in 2012, continues to exhibit record-setting engagement this long after release, with millions of actively engaged players who are now eager for the next installment of the series.
Black Ops III is Treyarch's first 3-year development cycle, and they've been making the most of it with unparalleled depth of content across 3 modes of play. The campaign can be played as full single-player game or as a co-op game with up to 4 players. The multiplayer experience is the deepest we've ever offered in Call of Duty, and the mind blowing third mode, Call of Duty Zombies experience that features its own XP progression system for the first time.
Another benefit of the 3-year cycle is that we've been able to get the press hands-on with the game earlier than ever before, and their response has been phenomenal. In fact, positive media sentiment is double what it was last year, and mind you, last year was our previous high-water mark. We're confident that anyone who gets their hands on the game will agree, which is why we're going to have hands-on multiplayer at E3 as well as this year, our first beta in years. Fans who preorder the game now on Xbox One or PlayStation 4 or PC will have access to the beta.
On to Call of Duty Online, which commenced open beta in January in China, the largest gaming market in the world. We're seeing good early trends, especially with high engagement from core first-person action players. As we said on our last call, this is a game and a business model that will take time to ramp, and we're now working with our partner, Tencent, to expand our audience base. We continue to be enthusiastic both about the opportunity in China and about the long-term prospects for our game.
Turning now to Destiny, which continues to have incredible online engagement from millions of active players. In fact, these players are still playing on average about 3 hours a day, as they have been since launch, with strong digital sales and expansion attach rates. In all, Destiny has now received 299 awards, including 31 wins for Game of the Year, most recently adding Action Game of the Year from D.I.C.E. and Game of the Year at the BAFTAs. And every day, our great partner at Bungie continues to make the game and online experience better.
Later this month, we plan to launch Destiny's second major expansion pack, House of Wolves, yet another great piece of content to keep our fans engaged. In the fall, we'll have a major release, which will be the biggest content addition yet to the Destiny universe, and you'll hear more about that soon.
On to Skylanders, the industry's top console franchise and title of the year so far. Skylanders has its own unique engagement and monetization loop, real-world toy purchases that enable new and different play experiences in the game and which roll out in waves for our fans throughout the year. As with our other franchises, Skylanders average revenue per user has grown year-over-year. And while the toys-to-life category that we created is increasingly competitive, we believe it remains highly attractive and one that we will continue to lead with industry-best innovation and game play. We'll have more details to share soon about the next installment in the Skylanders franchise, which will once again bring fresh innovation to the category and expand the audience even further.
Finally, Guitar Hero. In April, we announced a fall 2015 return for the beloved franchise, which has been played by over 40 million gamers. Consumers' affinity for the brand remains incredibly strong, and we spent years developing meaningful creative innovation. The new Guitar Hero game is one game with 2 ways to play: Guitar Hero Live lets fans rock real crowds with real reactions; and Guitar Hero TV is the world's first playable music video network, which offers hundreds of songs and additional content to constantly engage our players. The game will be available across consoles, smartphone and tablet devices. The fan and media response to our reveal has been overwhelmingly positive, and we couldn't be more excited to share additional details later this summer.
Overall, we had a great start to 2015 across our portfolio of titles, and we look forward to sharing more news with you at E3. So thanks, and I'll now turn the call over to Mike to talk about Blizzard."

Compared to last year's launch of Hearthstone, Diablo III: Reaper of Souls and presales for Warlords of Draenor, this year's Q1 was relatively quiet for Blizzard Entertainment. Despite this, we continue to have strong performance in terms of engagement. Without any major launches, Battle.net still ended the quarter with the largest Q1 player community in our history, up double-digits percentage-wise year-over-year. This reflects ongoing strength across our portfolio of games. 
On the World of Warcraft front, we launched the first Warlords of Draenor update in Q1, adding new content, Twitter integration and more. This update increased stability in the last few weeks of the quarter. Warlords of Draenor brought more players back than any previous expansion and showed that even long-time-lapsed players will return when the right content is offered. On that note, we recently revealed the next major update for the game, which will add a ton of new content that will appeal to players across a range of play styles. That's currently on our public test realm, and we're looking forward to getting it into players hands as quickly as possible.
We also announced the WoW Token System. Players who purchase a WoW token priced at $20 can exchange that token with another player for gold. The player who received the token can then redeem it for 1-month's game time or a set amount of play time in China. This provides 2 benefits. It enables players to pay for their subscriptions with their gold, and it provides players with a secure method for purchasing gold in-game. We just launched World of Warcraft Tokens in April so it's too early to see the long-term impact, but many players welcome this service and have been using it actively.
This was also a big quarter for Heroes of the Storm, our highly anticipated online team brawler. More than 11 million people have signed up for the closed beta test, which went live in January. We're seeing a lot of anticipation in the gaming community, and we're continuing to collect great feedback from our beta testers as we drive towards the launch on June 2.
To showcase the action and depth that the game offers, we recently sponsored a collegiate eSports tournament, which we dubbed Heroes of the Dorm. Thousands of players formed teams at over 460 schools across the U.S. and Canada. And similar to March Madness, we created a 64-team bracket after a few qualifying rounds. Those teams then battled their way to the finals, which were televised live by ESPN. This was the network's first-ever live telecast of a collegiate eSports event. The competition was intense throughout the tournament, and we saw the formation of many potential Heroes of the Storm college rivalries. I'd like to congratulate the Cal Berkeley Golden Bears on their championship victory. We also saw widespread positive commentary across a range of online communities about the event. This is a testament to the fact that Heroes of the Storm is not only fun to play, it's fun to watch. We think it has great potential as a spectator sport.
Q1 was also an important quarter for Hearthstone. Despite no new content releases, engagement and revenues were steady quarter-over-quarter and, in fact, have remained relatively stable since launch. The performance for the quarter was driven by a sustained pickup of Goblins vs Gnomes. Players have really enjoyed the mechanics of the new cards, and we've seen some incredibly creative deck strategies.
During the last 2 weeks of March, we held presales for our second adventure, Blackrock Mountain. We were pleased to see that enthusiasm for the new content was even stronger than it was with Curse of Naxxramas last August, with 40% more sales in the same time frame. That enthusiasm continued with the launch of Blackrock Mountain in April, which was followed by the iPhone and Android phone versions of Hearthstone a few weeks later. The mobile phone versions pushed Hearthstone to the #1 spot for game downloads in over 25 countries across North America, Europe and Asia, and quickly drove the game to a new milestone of more than 30 million players. Hearthstone continues to be very popular with players worldwide, and we're already hard at work on our next release for the game.
We also recently started beta testing the Chinese version of Diablo III together with NetEase in March. There has been a lot of anticipation for the game in China, with about 3 million players signing up for the closed beta test. Two weeks ago, we launched the open beta test, opening up the game to everyone else in China. Chinese players are able to access the base experience for free and can buy much of the content from Reaper of Souls via an add-on, which is already available for purchase across 2 offerings priced at $32 and $64. In fact, we just announced with NetEase that Diablo III has already achieved over 1 million unit sales in China, which is a fantastic reception from the community. We look forward to building on that momentum as we drive towards the commercial launch.
Lastly, at the end of the quarter, we kicked off the closed beta test for Legacy of the Void, the final chapter of StarCraft II. We know the StarCraft community is eager to play through the conclusion of the story, and we've already seen great positive feedback about the game's new multiplayer features. Archon Mode, which allows 2 players to team up and share control of an army, has gotten a very enthusiastic response. We're excited about this feature in particular, because it greatly increases accessibility for the game. As I mentioned previously, Legacy of the Void will be a standalone expansion that doesn't require either of the first 2 releases. So it will be easier to have -- for players to get into the game and experience all of the latest content.
On the eSports side, Season 1 of the StarCraft II World Championship Series came to an exciting conclusion with our finals event in France at the beginning of April. Season 2 is now underway, and the finals are set to take place at the Metro Convention Centre in Toronto at the end of June. It's a thrill to see the top StarCraft II players in the world compete for a spot in the Global Finals, so I hope you'll tune in online if you can't make it in person.
To recap, we had a great start to the year. With more games in more genres and on more platforms than ever before, it doesn't look like things will be slowing down anytime soon. We announced that BlizzCon 2015 will take place at the Anaheim Convention Center on November 6 and 7, and tickets for the event sold out quickly once again. We're going to have a lot to talk about at the show as well as in the months ahead.
So now I will turn the call over to Thomas."

Before we open the call to Q&A, I'll take a moment to summarize the key takeaways from today's call.
First, 2015 is off to a great start. We over-delivered the plan for Q1 and raised our full year guidance, which now projects year-over-year EPS growth from operations. And even more important for the long-term prospects of our business, we saw a 25% increase in the size of the player community that engages with our games.
That leads me to the second key takeaway from today's call. We are successfully transitioning our business to a digital year-round engagement model, where our community can play and invest in their experiences, not just at launch but throughout the year. This is important because it allows us to improve the player experience by delivering fresh content on a frequent basis, while at the same time creating value for our shareholders through deeper and higher-margin monetization of the audiences we serve.
Lastly, our strategic investments in new franchises, platforms and geographies continued to pay off, and along with growing engagement and better monetization, sets the stage for growth ahead. We are well on the way to expanding our franchise portfolio from 5 to over 10, with 4 new intellectual properties already in market. The 2 IPs we launched last year, Destiny and Hearthstone combined, now have over 50 million registered players and nearly $1 billion in non-GAAP revenues life-to-date. We have 2 new free-to-play franchises in beta, Call of Duty Online and Heroes of the Storm. We also recently announced that this fall, the beloved Guitar Hero franchise will return with product innovation that we couldn't be more excited about, and Overwatch is on the horizon with a beta this fall. We have an increasing focus on mobile and tablet with Hearthstone's release on iOS and Android smartphones and Guitar Hero Live's planned released to also include mobile and tablet at launch.
Finally, we are positioned for growth in new geographies and in particular, in the large and fast-growing China market. We now have 6 franchises in market in China: World of Warcraft, StarCraft, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, Diablo and Call of Duty Online, up from 2 at the end of last year -- sorry, at the beginning of last year rather.
So now let's take a few questions."

Well, the first and I think most obvious advantage of the 3-year cycle is just pure creative quality. That third year allows us more time to innovate and iterate and more time to polish, and this is Treyarch's first Call of Duty game with that time period to develop. So the first answer is it's just going to be a great game. Secondly, you've heard a lot of talk today about driving engagement being key to our business strategy and as I mentioned, Black Ops is the most-played series in Call of Duty's history. But beyond just that pedigree of both Treyarch and the Black Ops series, the 3-year cycle has also allowed us to put a deeper offering on the disk. The MP, the multiplayer game, is going to be the deepest and we think the stickiest we've ever made. The Zombies is going to be deeper than ever, and it's going to have our first XP progression system, which we think will also drive engagement. And of course, the campaign has big innovations in it as well. As I mentioned, you can play it as a single-player game or as a co-op game with up to 4 friends. So that drives not only increased engagement but replayability because there's more variability in the experience. In terms of the differences with past Black Ops games and Advanced Warfare, the answer is honestly we're building on successes of all of those games, but we're also bringing a lot of fresh ideas. I understand what you mean when you say you see similarities with Advanced Warfare. I think the movement system in Black Ops III picks up where Advanced Warfare's left off, but improves it and makes it more athletic and intuitive and smoother than ever before. And that's been a big theme we've heard from the press who got hands-on with the game at reveal, which we've never been able to do before, which is another good advantage of the 3-year cycle. So I think anyone who gets their hands on the game is going to agree, which is why we're doing hands-on at E3 for the first time, in MP in a long while as well as our first beta in years. So we're really bullish on the content and think it's going to be a great experience."

And I do think that relative to some of the other options in the genre, it is easier to get into Heroes. And I think judging by the response that we've gotten from our recent Heroes of the Dorm tournament, I think it's easier to watch as well. The feedback that we've been getting from the closed beta test has been very positive. There's a lot of great buzz around the game. We've had, like I said, over 11 million people signing up for the beta test, so there's a lot of anticipation there. As you know, it's a very popular genre. I think the fact that this is a digital game with long-term content opportunities, we're very optimistic about Heroes of the Storm and how it can grow to become another key game in our portfolio. And I think in terms of how the monetization curve will look, we expect to get started strong on June 2, and we are hoping that, that will grow over time."

Well, yes, a lot has changed in the market in that time and we think for the better in terms of our prospects with Guitar Hero. The first thing is that we think we have a great game innovation and that the franchise needs that. And we said when we put it on ice 5 years ago that we wouldn't bring it back unless we really had a breakthrough creative way to bring it back, and we think that we have that. In terms of the way the market itself has changed, first of all, online social play has transformed gaming over the past 5 years, and GHTV is going to be constantly updated with new content to keep the game fresh and to keep people engaged, and it also allows people to compete online with their friends in a highly social way. We think this has the potential to have the kind of sticky long-tail engagement that defines the rest of our portfolio and our major franchises. Second, the game's been on the market for 5 years and during that time, we've had a console transition. We now have powerful new consoles in the marketplace that give us the opportunity to deliver that rockstar fantasy in a more vivid and visceral way with (sic) [than] ever before. It's just what the Live mode is really going to do. Third is mobile has had explosive growth over the last 5 years with casual players. And one of the breakthrough innovations is that you'll be able to have the entire experience on mobile, and this is a great experience both on the go, on the glass or with the full experience with the guitar in your big screen TV. So we think that's a big innovation for us and a big opportunity for us as well. And finally, as I mentioned at the reveal, we've improved and innovated on the guitar itself, managing to make it both easier and more accessible to a casual player, while also managing to make it more challenging than ever for an advanced player. So we think we're going to widen the appeal of the game in that score as well. And also, we mentioned we're -- that guitar is going to be forward compatible with any additional games that come out. That's going to be a better consumer experience, we think, this time around. It's going to focus us on innovating on the software and keeping the game more engaging as opposed to the hardware like last time around."

But obviously, a constant stream of robust content is integral to our plans on Destiny. And I would say both the expansiveness of the universe as well as the innovation that Bungie's established with bringing together the best of both first-person action games with MMORPG has led Destiny to become already, I think, one of the most engaging games ever. As I said, the active Destiny players are still playing for about 3 hours a day, which is just remarkable amounts of engagement from a large and passionate player base. So this points to exactly the kind of model that I spoke about for all of our games: great content, leading to large audiences, leading to our ability to monetize those communities by providing more great content. So the answer is we have a very robust content plan for Destiny, starting with our second major expansion pack, House of Wolves, which has already been announced. And then you'll also see content engaging -- content being dropped throughout the summer. And then in the fall, we will have a major release, which will be the biggest addition to the Destiny universe yet across all modes of play. Unfortunately, I don't have more details than that today, but we're confident it's going to be incredibly appealing, not just to our current fans but also to people who haven't yet joined the Destiny universe. It's going to be that big of an expansion."

You've seen a lot of value created so far with star players, and we have players who are earning over $1 million a year between endorsements and winnings. Then you've seen opportunities for shoutcasters at professional events who are also earning meaningful revenues, and then for our players themselves who are narrating their own game play and are now starting to develop millions of fans. And then we have gamers who are competing in prize events like Blizzard's Heroes of the Dorm that we just hosted last weekend. We gave away college scholarships to Berkeley, the winning team. And we recently also had the Call of Duty Championships, where we paid out $1 million in prize money. So if you look at the numbers of spectators that are now watching game play, you're probably looking at, just for our content alone last year, somewhere around 1 billion hours of spectating of linear play. And so from a lot of perspectives, it's something that when we look out into the future, we are incredibly excited about, both as way to really recognize our players' investment and commitment, but also from a commercial perspective."

Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our better-than-expected Q1 financial results, our outlook for Q2 and our increased outlook for 2015.Q1 was a great quarter that displayed strong trends on our year-round monetizing franchise",1345,"Thanks, Bobby. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our better-than-expected Q1 financial results, our outlook for Q2 and our increased outlook for 2015.
Q1 was a great quarter that displayed strong trends on our year-round monetizing franchises. We overperformed our non-GAAP February guidance by over $60 million on revenue, $100 million on operating income and $0.11 on EPS. Even though we had a relatively lighter slate in Q1 this year, non-GAAP revenue and EPS were flat to Q1 last year on a constant FX basis given strong digital trends. Non-GAAP digital revenues comprised a record percentage of overall revenues, up 800 basis points year-over-year.
Turning to our financial results. Please refer to our earnings release for full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations. Also, the numbers I'll be quoting are compared to the prior year unless otherwise noted. For the quarter on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.3 billion, up 15% year-over-year; an operating margin of 43%, up from 37% last year; and a record quarterly GAAP EPS of $0.53, up 33% year-over-year and up $0.16 versus our February guidance.
For the quarter on a non-GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $703 million, an operating margin of 29% and EPS of $0.16. Of the $0.11 in non-GAAP EPS over performance versus guidance, about $0.05 was related to timing for costs that shifted out of the quarter and about $0.06 was related to strong franchise momentum, including digital sales and engagement trends with our large community of fans.
Activision Publishing had a strong Season Pass, downloadable content and expansion attach rates on both Call of Duty and Destiny. Console full game downloads represent a high-teens share of total units and continued to increase year-over-year. Blizzard Entertainment had a steady and strong performance on Hearthstone with ongoing engagement on the Q4 expansion, Goblins vs Gnomes.
As mentioned during our February earnings call and consistent with our experience following prior expansions, we saw a decline in World of Warcraft subscribers. Subscribers ended the quarter at 7.1 million. World of Warcraft's revenue performance at constant FX has been more stable, driven by continued strong uptake on value-added services and price increases in select regions, which partially offset the subscriber declines particularly in the east.
Moreover, Blizzard has successfully expanded their portfolio over the recent past and continues to do so. Growth from franchises like Hearthstone and Diablo had boosted Blizzard's top line and had pushed Blizzard's non-World of Warcraft revenue streams from 30% of total revenue in 2013 to 40% of total revenue in 2014, even while the World of Warcraft revenues also increased in that period. And new franchises like Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm are expected to further expand non-World of Warcraft revenues to more than 50% share of the Blizzard business in 2015. So strong recurring franchise diversification is in process inside the Blizzard portfolio, which sets us up for a bright 2016 and beyond.
Turning to specific P&L items. Please note that all percentages are based on revenues except for the tax rate. For Q1, GAAP product costs were 20%, operating expenses were 37% and operating margin was 43%. GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense was $50 million and our GAAP tax rate was 20%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted weighted share count was 741 million, including participating securities. On a non-GAAP basis for the quarter, product costs were 21%, operating expenses were 50% and operating margin was 29%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 32%. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%.
In terms of cash flow, in Q1, we generated strong cash flow with non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $223 million, operating cash flow of $209 million and free cash flow of $188 million after CapEx. We also repaid $250 million of our term loan in February and next week, on May 13, we plan to pay a $0.23 per share cash dividend or approximately $167 million in aggregate to shareholders of record as of March 30.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of March 31, we had approximately $4.5 billion in cash and investments, of which over $1 billion was held domestically. We had total debt of $4.12 billion and net cash of $360 million.
Turning to FX. Please note that as discussed on our February call, currency fluctuations continue to be a headwind that we will monitor. In Q1, the year-over-year impact of the strengthening dollar was $68 million on revenue and $0.03 on EPS. As mentioned, both revenue and EPS would have been flat year-over-year at constant FX. In summary, Q1 was a very strong start of the year for Activision Blizzard. So now let's turn to our slate and our outlook for Q2 and for the balance of 2015.
Our expected Q2 slate from Activision Publishing includes additional downloadable content releases from Call of Duty and Destiny and continued live operations during the open beta for Call of Duty Online in China. Blizzard Entertainment's Q2 slate is a robust offering across the portfolio, including Hearthstone's new adventure, Blackrock Mountain; Hearthstone's important iOS and Android smartphone releases; Diablo III's launch in China; StarCraft: Legacy of the Void's closed beta; and Heroes of the Storm's launch in June. In Q2, we also expect to begin the ramp in sales and marketing spending for our major releases in the back half the year.
Now to the numbers. For Q2 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $930 million, product costs of 20% and operating expenses of 52%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $50 million, a GAAP tax rate of 25%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 745 million and EPS of $0.21. For Q2 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $650 million, product cost of 19% and operating expenses of 63%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 26% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.07.
Our expected Q3 and Q4 slate from Activision Publishing is one of the strongest we've ever had, including the biggest addition to the Destiny universe yet, Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which we are very excited about; a new innovative release for Skylanders; and the return of one of our most beloved IPs with Guitar Hero Live as well as further ramp up of our audience playing Call of Duty Online in China. Blizzard Entertainment will bring additional content and live service updates to World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm as well as bring Overwatch into closed beta.
Now to our 2015 full year numbers. For 2015 on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.25 billion, an increase of $110 million versus our guidance in February; product cost of 23%; and operating expenses of 50%. For both GAAP and non-GAAP, we expect interest expense of $202 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 22%. We expect 750 million fully diluted shares both for GAAP and non-GAAP, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.98, up $0.09 from our February guidance. For 2015, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.425 billion, $25 million higher than our February guidance; product cost of 24%; operating expenses of 45%; and an operating margin of 31%, 100 basis points better than our February guidance. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 24%.
For the year, we are raising our full year outlook by $0.05 to $1.20. As I mentioned earlier, strong business momentum in Q1 amounted to $0.06 of EPS favorability, which is partially offset by $0.01 of FX headwind given the further strengthening of the dollar since we last gave guidance in February. See our accompanying earnings materials for FX assumptions.
So in summary, the transition to digital continues inside of our business, helping to further drive our year-round engagement and monetization model where our community can play and invest in their experiences throughout the entire year. Along with these digital trends, our strategic investments in new franchises, platforms and geographies are paying off and set the stage for growth ahead.
Now I will turn the call over to Eric to discuss Activision Publishing."
4222231,289734224,807934,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 06, 2015",2015-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dennis. Activision Publishing is off to a great start and in Q1, we significantly outperformed last year's results with revenues up 28% year-on-year. We have 2 of the top 5 video game franchises globally year-to-date. We continue to have 3 of the",1074,"Thanks, Dennis. Activision Publishing is off to a great start and in Q1, we significantly outperformed last year's results with revenues up 28% year-on-year. We have 2 of the top 5 video game franchises globally year-to-date. We continue to have 3 of the top 5 next-gen games life-to-date with Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare remaining the #1 title on next gen as it has since its launch 6 months ago. Including toys, Skylanders is also the #1 console franchise and title globally in Q1, outsold the #1 action figure line globally and of course, was the #1 kids console franchise and title globally.
Over the past few years, we have methodically and effectively expanded our portfolio, which now includes 3 industry leading franchises, each one of which keeps players engaged all year round. This engagement creates a virtuous cycle: great content leading to large engaged communities, leading to our ability to monetize those communities by providing more great content. This is why we have the biggest Q1 online player community in our history, up double-digit percentages year-over-year. And it is also why based on our current trajectory, Activision Publishing will likely deliver our biggest year yet of digital revenues.
So let me share a few more specifics by franchise, starting with Call of Duty. In the first quarter, revenue was up by double-digit percentage year-over-year due to the strong sell-through of Advanced Warfare and growing online revenues per user across our recent Call of Duty titles. Sales of Season Pass and Map Packs were up significantly, and we introduced a new consumable digital mechanic in Advanced Warfare, which drove engagement and allowed our players to invest more deeply in their online experience.
We recently revealed Call of Duty: Black Ops III from our award-winning studio Treyarch. Nearly 100 million players have played Black Ops and Black Ops II, making Black Ops the most played series in Call of Duty history. In fact, Call of Duty: Black Ops II, originally released in 2012, continues to exhibit record-setting engagement this long after release with millions of actively engaged players who are now eager for the next installment of the series.
Black Ops III is Treyarch's first 3-year development cycle, and they've been making the most of it with unparalleled depth of content across 3 modes of play. The campaign can be played as full single player game or as a co-op game with up to 4 players. The multiplayer experience is the deepest we've ever offered in Call of Duty, and the mind blowing third mode, Call of Duty Zombies experience that features its own XP progression system for the first time.
Another benefit of the 3-year cycle is that we've been able to get the press hands-on with the game earlier than ever before, and their response has been phenomenal. In fact, positive media sentiment is double what it was last year, and mind you, last year was our previous high-water mark. We're confident that anyone who gets their hands on the game will agree, which is why we're going to have hands-on multiplayer at E3 as well as this year, our first beta in years. Fans who preorder the game now on Xbox One or PlayStation 4 or PC will have access to the beta.
On to Call of Duty Online, which commenced open beta in January in China, the largest gaming market in the world. We're seeing good early trends especially with high engagement from core first-person action players. As we said on our last call, this is a game and a business model that will take time to ramp, and we're now working with our partner, Tencent, to expand our audience base. We continue to be enthusiastic both about the opportunity in China and about the long-term prospects for our game.
Turning now to Destiny, which continues to have incredible online engagement from millions of active players. In fact, these players are still playing on average about 3 hours a day as they have been since launch with strong digital sales and expansion attach rates. In all, Destiny has now received 299 awards, including 31 wins for Game of the Year, most recently adding Action Game of the Year from D.I.C.E. and Game of the Year at the BAFTAs. And every day, our great partner at Bungie continues to make the game and online experience better.
Later this month, we plan to launch Destiny's second major expansion pack, House of Wolves, yet another great piece of content to keep our fans engaged. In the fall, we'll have a major release which will be the biggest content addition yet to the Destiny universe and you'll hear more about that soon.
On to Skylanders, the industry's top console franchise and title of the year so far. Skylanders has its own unique engagement and monetization loop, real world toy purchases that enable new and different play experiences in the game and which roll out in waves for our fans throughout the year. As with our other franchises, Skylanders average revenue per user has grown year-over-year. And while the toys to life category that we created is increasingly competitive, we believe it remains highly attractive and one that we will continue to lead with industry best innovation and game play. We'll have more details to share soon about the next installment in the Skylanders franchise, which will once again bring fresh innovation to the category and expand the audience even further.
Finally, Guitar Hero. In April, we announced a fall 2015 return for the beloved franchise, which has been played by over 40 million gamers. Consumers' affinity for the brand remains incredibly strong, and we spent years developing meaningful creative innovation. The new Guitar Hero game is one game with 2 ways to play: Guitar Hero Live lets fans rock real crowds with real reactions; and Guitar Hero TV is the world's first playable music video network, which offers hundreds of songs and additional content to constantly engage our players. The game will be available across consoles, smartphone and tablet devices. The fan and media response to our reveal has been overwhelmingly positive, and we couldn't be more excited to share additional details later this summer.
Overall, we had a great start to 2015 across our portfolio of titles, and we look forward to sharing more news with you at E3. So thanks, and I'll now turn the call over to Mike to talk about Blizzard."

Compared to last year's launch of Hearthstone, Diablo III: Reaper of Souls and presales for Warlords of Draenor, this year's Q1 was relatively quiet for Blizzard Entertainment.

Compared to last year's launch of Hearthstone, Diablo III: Reaper of Souls and presales for Warlords of Draenor, this year's Q1 was relatively quiet for Blizzard Entertainment. Despite this, we continue to have strong performance in terms of engagement. Without any major launches, Battle.net still ended the quarter with the largest Q1 player community in our history, up double-digits percentage-wise year-over-year. This reflects ongoing strength across our portfolio of games. 
On the World of Warcraft front, we launched the first Warlords of Draenor update in Q1, adding new content, Twitter integration and more. This update increased stability in the last few weeks of the quarter. Warlords of Draenor brought more players back than any previous expansion and showed that even long time lapsed players will return when the right content is offered. On that note, we recently revealed the next major update for the game, which will add a ton of new content that will appeal to players across a range of play styles. That's currently on our public test realm, and we're looking forward to getting it into players hands as quickly as possible.
We also announced the WoW Token System. Players who purchase a WoW token priced at $20 can exchange that token with another player for gold. The player who received the token can then redeem it for 1 month's game time or a set amount of play time in China. This provides 2 benefits. It enables players to pay for their subscriptions with their gold, and it provides players with a secure method for purchasing gold in-game. We just launched World of Warcraft Tokens in April so it's too early to see the long-term impact, but many players welcome this service and have been using it actively.
This was also a big quarter for Heroes of the Storm, our highly anticipated online team brawler. More than 11 million people have signed up for the closed beta test, which went live in January. We're seeing a lot of anticipation in the gaming community, and we're continuing to collect great feedback from our beta testers as we drive towards the launch on June 2.
To showcase the action and depth that the game offers, we recently sponsored a collegiate eSports tournament, which we dubbed Heroes of the Dorm. Thousands of players formed teams at over 460 schools across the U.S. and Canada. And similar to March Madness, we created a 64 team bracket after a few qualifying rounds. Those teams then battled their way to the finals, which were televised live by ESPN. This was the network's first-ever live telecast of a collegiate eSports event. The competition was intense throughout the tournament, and we saw the formation of many potential Heroes of the Storm college rivalries. I'd like to congratulate the Cal Berkeley Golden Bears on their championship victory. We also saw widespread positive commentary across a range of online communities about the event. This is a testament to the fact that Heroes of the Storm is not only fun to play, it's fun to watch. We think it has great potential as a spectator sport.
Q1 was also an important quarter for Hearthstone. Despite no new content releases, engagement and revenues were steady quarter-over-quarter and in fact, have remained relatively stable since launch. The performance for the quarter was driven by a sustained pickup of Goblins vs Gnomes. Players have really enjoyed the mechanics of the new cards, and we've seen some incredibly creative deck strategies.
During the last 2 weeks of March, we held presales for our second adventure, Blackrock Mountain. We were pleased to see that enthusiasm for the new content was even stronger than it was with Curse of Naxxramas last August, with 40% more sales in the same time frame. That enthusiasm continued with the launch of Blackrock Mountain in April, which was followed by the iPhone and Android phone versions of Hearthstone a few weeks later. The mobile phone versions pushed Hearthstone to the #1 spot for game downloads in over 25 countries across North America, Europe and Asia and quickly drove the game to a new milestone of more than 30 million players. Hearthstone continues to be very popular with players worldwide, and we're already hard at work on our next release for the game.
We also recently started beta testing the Chinese version of Diablo III together with NetEase in March. There has been a lot of anticipation for the game in China with about 3 million players signing up for the closed beta test. Two weeks ago, we launched the open beta test, opening up the game to everyone else in China. Chinese players are able to access the base experience for free and can buy much of the content from Reaper of Souls via an add-on, which is already available for purchase across 2 offerings priced at $32 and $64. In fact, we just announced with NetEase that Diablo III has already achieved over 1 million unit sales in China, which is a fantastic reception from the community. We look forward to building on that momentum as we drive towards the commercial launch.
Lastly, at the end of the quarter, we kicked off the closed beta test for Legacy of the Void, the final chapter of StarCraft II. We know the StarCraft community is eager to play through the conclusion of the story, and we've already seen great positive feedback about the game's new multiplayer features. Archon Mode, which allows 2 players to team up and share control of an army, has gotten a very enthusiastic response. We're excited about this feature in particular because it greatly increases accessibility for the game. As I mentioned previously, Legacy of the Void will be a standalone expansion that doesn't require either of the first 2 releases. So it will be easier to have -- for players to get into the game and experience all of the latest content.
On the eSports side, Season 1 of the StarCraft II World Championship Series came to an exciting conclusion with our finals event in France at the beginning of April. Season 2 is now underway, and the finals are set to take place at the Metro Convention Centre in Toronto at the end of June. It's a thrill to see the top StarCraft II players in the world compete for a spot in the Global Finals, so I hope you'll tune in online if you can't make it in person.
To recap, we had a great start to the year. With more games in more genres and on more platforms than ever before, it doesn't look like things will be slowing down anytime soon. We announced that BlizzCon 2015 will take place at the Anaheim Convention Center on November 6 and 7, and tickets for the event sold out quickly once again. We're going to have a lot to talk about at the show as well as in the months ahead.
So now I will turn the call over to Thomas."

Before we open the call to Q&A, I'll take a moment to summarize the key takeaways from today's call.
First, 2015 is off to a great start. We over-delivered the plan for Q1 and raised our full year guidance, which now projects year-over-year EPS growth from operations. And even more important for the long-term prospects of our business, we saw a 25% increase in the size of the player community that engages with our games.
That leads me to the second key takeaway from today's call. We are successfully transitioning our business to a digital year-round engagement model where our community can play and invest in their experiences not just at launch but throughout the year. This is important because it allows us to improve the player experience by delivering fresh content on a frequent basis, while at the same time creating value for our shareholders through deeper and higher margin monetization of the audiences we serve.
Lastly, our strategic investments in new franchises, platforms and geographies continued to pay off and along with growing engagement and better monetization, sets the stage for growth ahead. We are well on the way to expanding our franchise portfolio from 5 to over 10 with 4 new intellectual properties already in market. The 2 IPs we launched last year, Destiny and Hearthstone combined, now have over 50 million registered players and nearly $1 billion in non-GAAP revenues life-to-date. We have 2 new free-to-play franchises in beta, Call of Duty Online and Heroes of the Storm. We also recently announced that this fall, the beloved Guitar Hero franchise will return with product innovation that we couldn't be more excited about, and Overwatch is on the horizon with a beta this fall. We have an increasing focus on mobile and tablet with Hearthstone's release on iOS and Android smartphones and Guitar Hero Live's planned released to also include mobile and tablet at launch.
Finally, we are positioned for growth in new geographies and in particular, in the large and fast-growing China market. We now have 6 franchises in market in China: World of Warcraft, StarCraft, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, Diablo and Call of Duty Online, up from 2 at the end of last year -- sorry, at the beginning of last year rather.
So now let's take a few questions."

Well, the first and I think most obvious advantage of the 3-year cycle is just pure creative quality. That third year allows us more time to innovate and iterate and more time to polish, and this is Treyarch's first Call of Duty game with that time period to develop. So the first answer is it's just going to be a great game. Secondly, you've heard a lot of talk today about driving engagement being key to our business strategy and as I mentioned, Black Ops is the most played series in Call of Duty's history. But beyond just that pedigree of both Treyarch and the Black Ops series, the 3-year cycle has also allowed us to put a deeper offering on the disk. The MP, the multiplayer game, is going to be the deepest and we think the stickiest we've ever made. The Zombies is going to be deeper than ever, and it's going to have our first XP progression system, which we think will also drive engagement. And of course, the campaign has big innovations in it as well. As I mentioned, you can play it as a single player game or as a co-op game with up to 4 friends. So that drives not only increased engagement but replayability because there's more variability in the experience. In terms of the differences with past Black Ops games and Advanced Warfare, the answer is honestly we're building on successes of all of those games, but we're also bringing a lot of fresh ideas. I understand what you mean when you say you see similarities with Advanced Warfare. I think the movement system in Black Ops III picks up where Advanced Warfare's left off, but improves it and makes it more athletic and intuitive and smoother than ever before. And that's been a big theme we've heard from the press who got hands on with the game at reveal, which we've never been able to do before, which is another good advantage of the 3-year cycle. So I think anyone who gets their hands on the game is going to agree, which is why we're doing hands-on at E3 for the first time, in MP in a long while as well as our first beta in years. So we're really bullish on the content and think it's going to be a great experience."

We've had, like I said, over 11 million people signing up for the beta test, so there's a lot of anticipation there. As you know, it's a very popular genre.

Well, yes, a lot has changed in the market in that time and we think for the better in terms of our prospects with Guitar Hero. The first thing is that we think we have a great game innovation and that the franchise needs that. And we said when we put it on ice 5 years ago that we wouldn't bring it back unless we really had a breakthrough creative way to bring it back, and we think that we have that. In terms of the way the market itself has changed, first of all, online social play has transformed gaming over the past 5 years, and GHTV is going to be constantly updated with new content to keep the game fresh and to keep people engaged, and it also allows people to compete online with their friends in a highly social way. We think this has the potential to have the kind of sticky long-tail engagement that defines the rest of our portfolio and our major franchises. Second, the game's been on the market for 5 years and during that time, we've had a console transition. We now have powerful new consoles in the marketplace that give us the opportunity to deliver that rockstar fantasy in a more vivid and visceral way with (sic) [than] ever before. It's just what the Live mode is really going to do. Third is mobile has had explosive growth over the last 5 years with casual players. And one of the breakthrough innovations is that you'll be able to have the entire experience on mobile, and this is a great experience both on the go, on the glass or with the full experience with the guitar in your big screen TV. So we think that's a big innovation for us and a big opportunity for us as well. And finally, as I mentioned at the reveal, we've improved and innovated on the guitar itself, managing to make it both easier and more accessible to a casual player, while also managing to make it more challenging than ever for an advanced player. So we think we're going to widen the appeal of the game in that score as well. And also, we mentioned we're -- that guitar is going to be forward compatible with any additional games that come out. That's going to be a better consumer experience we think this time around. It's going to focus us on innovating on the software and keeping the game more engaging as opposed to the hardware like last time around."

But obviously, a constant stream of robust content is integral to our plans on Destiny. And I would say both the expansiveness of the universe as well as the innovation that Bungie's established with bringing together the best of both first-person action games with MMORPG has led Destiny to become already, I think, one of the most engaging games ever. As I said, the active Destiny players are still playing for about 3 hours a day, which is just remarkable amounts of engagement from a large and passionate player base. So this points to exactly the kind of model that I spoke about for all of our games: great content, leading to large audiences, leading to our ability to monetize those communities by providing more great content. So the answer is we have a very robust content plan for Destiny starting with our second major expansion pack, House of Wolves, which has already been announced. And then you'll also see content engaging -- content being dropped throughout the summer. And then in the fall, we will have a major release, which will be the biggest addition to the Destiny universe yet across all modes of play. Unfortunately, I don't have more details than that today, but we're confident it's going to be incredibly appealing, not just to our current fans but also to people who haven't yet joined the Destiny universe. It's going to be that big of an expansion."

But right now, you have so many players around the world who dedicate so much of their time and their energy and their passion playing our games that we never really want to take that for granted, and this is the way to celebrate them. You've seen a lot of value created so far with star players, and we have players who are earning over $1 million a year between endorsements and winnings. Then you've seen opportunities for shoutcasters at professional events who are also earning meaningful revenues, and then for our players themselves who are narrating their own game play and are now starting to develop millions of fans. And then we have gamers who are competing in prize events like Blizzard's Heroes of the Dorm that we just hosted last weekend. We gave away college scholarships to Berkeley, the winning team. And we recently also had the Call of Duty Championships where we paid out $1 million in prize money. So if you look at the numbers of spectators that are now watching game play, you're probably looking at, just for our content alone last year, somewhere around 1 billion hours of spectating of linear play. And so from a lot of perspectives, it's something that when we look out into the future, we are incredibly excited about both as way to really recognize our players' investment and commitment, but also from a commercial perspective."

Our strategic focus on expanding our franchise portfolio with captivating and original new intellectual property, innovating on new platforms and expanding into new geographies is reflected our results. We outperformed our Q2 targets and last year's results on revenues, digital growth in earnings per share. These strong results and the excitement for upcoming launches have driven us to raise our full year outlook yet again.
As we have successfully transitioning from a launch to a year-round engagement model, our audience stays and the total amount of time people spend with our franchises continue to grow. 
In the second quarter, our monthly active users grew by 35% year-over-year. And in the world with so many entertainment choices, from television to movies to social media and beyond, we are grateful that people are choosing to spend more and more of their time with us. 
In the second quarter, the amount of time our community spent playing Activision Blizzard games grew by 25% year-over-year. In fact, this past quarter, our player communities lock nearly 3.5 billion hours of game play with our key franchises Heroes of the Storm, Hearthstone's, World of Warcraft, Diablo, StarCraft, Skylanders, Destiny and Call of Duty. And these numbers do not even include the rapidly increasing amount of time expected to spend watching content based on our games on channels like Twitch and YouTube.
Our strategic investments in new franchises platforms and geographies continue to pay off. And along with growing engagement and better monetization, set the stage for more growth ahead. 
We are well underway to expanding our franchise portfolio from 5 to over 10, with 4 new intellectual properties already launched and performing well. In addition, the beloved Guitar Hero franchise will return this fall with product innovation that we couldn't be more excited about. And Overwatch is on the horizon with the beta this fall.
With an increasing focus on mobile and tablet, Hearthstone's release on iOS and Android smartphones in April has been a key driver of outperformance in Q2 and should benefit us for the foreseeable future. Guitar Hero Live phone release will also include mobile and tablet at launch, and we are redoubling our efforts to provide a great mobile experience for our Skylanders franchise in addition to making the full game available on tablets.
Finally, we're positioned for growth in new geographies and in particular, in large and fast-growing China. We now have 6 franchises in market in China, up from 2 at the start of last year and we are already seeing still results with our teams and partners in China delivering record revenues in MA use in Q2.
Before I hand over to Dennis, I want to thank our talented teams who have continued to execute very well. Our employees are extraordinarily committed and they create the most engaging entertainment experience for our players and it shows in our results, which Dennis is now going to take you through in detail."

Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP measures, so please refer to our earnings release for full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations.
For the quarter on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.04 billion, up 8% year-over-year and operating margin of 32% and GAAP EPS of $0.29, up $0.08 versus our May guidance.
For the quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $759 million and operating margin of 23%, up more than 550 basis points year-over-year and EPS of $0.13.
We outperformed last year's revenue and EPS by $101 million and $0.07, respectively. At constant FX for Q2, we outperformed last year's revenue by $188 million or 29%, operating income by $116 million or 103% and EPS by $0.13.
In addition, we outperformed our May guidance by $109 million on revenue and $0.06 on EPS.
Revenue and EPS outperformance was primarily due to strong growth in recurring revenue from digital content across our broad franchise portfolio. Importantly, total digital revenues grew 27% year-over-year to a Q2 record of $611 million.
The main franchises drivers of the quarter's performance were: Hearthstone with the launch of their newest adventure, Blackrock Mountain, as well as the release of Hearthstone onto new Android and iOS smartphone; Destiny with the launch of their second expansion, House of Wolves; Call of Duty with sales of Season Pass, DLC and micro-transactions like supply for Advanced Warfare; Blizzard's Diablo III, which launched and outperformed in China, helping drive record revenues in China for the company this quarter; and finally, Blizzard launch Heroes of the Storm globally on June 2nd.
Not the this quarter was an important inflection point for Blizzard. In spite of the World of Warcraft subscriber declines, which were more concentrated in the East and partly affected by the success of Diablo III in China, Blizzard grew it's Q2 revenues 29% year-over-year at constant FX. This performance was driven by the strong performance of Diablo, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm, which in Q2, made up the majority of Blizzard revenues.
The franchise diversification inside Blizzard is happening rapidly and even more importantly, the aggregate Blizzard community is healthy and growing and in Q2, reached the highest levels in Blizzard's history on the back of strong engagement across the expanded portfolio. And the community will have even more to enjoy with an incredible lineup of new content for these franchises that is yet to come. You will hear more details for Mike on Blizzard's engagement and pipeline later in the call.
In terms of the EBITDA and cash flow. In Q2, we generated strong non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $193 million, up $47 million year-over-year, operating cash flow of $135 million and up 27% year-over-year and free cash flow of $107 million, up 32% year-over-year. 
In Q2, we also paid our previously announced $0.23 per share cash dividend, a 15% increase year-over-year and had no share repurchases in the quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of June 30, we had approximately $4.5 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $800 million was held domestically. We had total debt of $4.12 billion and net cash of approximately $400 billion -- $400 million.
Turning to FX. Please note, as discussed on our February and May calls, the strong dollar has had and will continue to be a headwind this year as our international revenues are translated to lower rate than last year. In Q2, the year-over-year impact of the strengthening of the dollar was $87 million on revenue and $0.06 on EPS. Year-to-date, the year-over-year FX impact was $154 million on revenue and $0.11 on EPS.
Now let's turn to our slate and our outlook for Q3 and for the balance of 2015. We are planning one of the best content pipelines in our history for the back half of the year and games are all progressing very well. You will hear more about our Q3 and Q4 slate from Eric and Mike. New releases include Destiny's Mag Expansion the Taken King, Skylanders superchargers, Guitar Hero Live, Call of Duty: Black Ops III and Hearthstone's expansion, the Grand Tournament. What's important addition is we are now confirming the much-anticipated final chapter for the StarCraft: Legacy of the Void is expected to be released in 2015 and will now be included in our guidance for the full year.
Looking forward to Q3, on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $875 million, product costs of 26% and operating expenses of 59%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $51 million, a GAAP tax rate of 23%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 748 million and EPS of $0.08.
For Q3, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $930 million, product cost of 25% and operating expenses of 55%. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.14.
Note that our guidance is at FX spot rates as laid out in the accompanying slides on our IR website. Now to our 2015 full year numbers.
For 2015 on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.425 billion, product cost of 24%, operating expenses of 48% and GAAP interest income expense of $202 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 22%. We expect 750 million fully diluted shares both for GAAP to non-GAAP and GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.06, up $0.08 from our May guidance.
For 2015, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.6 billion, $175 million higher than our May guidance; product cost of 23%, operating expenses of 45% and an operating margin of 32%, 100 points -- 100 basis points better than our May guidance. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $201 million and our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 24%.
For the second time this year, we are raising our EPS outlook. Our new outlook has increased by $0.10 to $1.30 based on strong franchise momentum coming out of Q2 and now, including the StarCraft: Legacy of the Void in our full year numbers. At constant FX, we now project year-over-year growth on the top line and bottom line, including record EPS for the year.
In summary, strong engagement and recurring digital monetization trends are driving our financial results so far this year and give us great momentum heading into the back half of the year. Along with these digital trends, our strategic investments in new franchises, platforms and geographies are paying off.
This backdrop sets the stage for growth as we take advantage of the best content pipelines in our history. 
Now I will turn the call over to Eric to discuss Activision Publishing."
4222231,304926567,848452,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2015",2015-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dennis. Activision Publishing significantly outperformed last year's results and delivered many fully higher digital revenues and operating income for the quarter and the first half of the year. Our Q2 and year-to-date revenues were each of 35% at",1486,"Thanks, Dennis. Activision Publishing significantly outperformed last year's results and delivered many fully higher digital revenues and operating income for the quarter and the first half of the year. Our Q2 and year-to-date revenues were each of 35% at a constant FX rate. We also continue to have 2 of the top 5 console franchises year-to-date in Skylanders and Call of Duty and 3 of the top 5 next-gen games life-to-date, including the #1 slot.
This revenue performance is due to our proven ability to create great games that turn into beloved long-term franchises. In the recent years, we have methodically and effectively expanded our portfolio to now include 3 innovative and industry-leading franchises, each of which gamers enjoy playing year-round. As a result of our monthly active users are of by more than 25% in Q2 year-over-year and each of these franchises contributed significantly to our over performance year-to-date.
Let me share some specifics by franchise, starting with Call of Duty. In Q2, revenue was up by double-digit percentage year-over-year due to to strong sell-through on Advanced Warfare, strong momentum in digital monetization as well a strong sell-through on catalog titles. I want to highlight Activision -- I want to highlight Advanced Warfare's strong season of digital content particular.
Season Pass, DLC, micro-transactions and average revenue per user have all grown year-over-year. As we said in our last call, we introduced a new digital consumable mechanic called supply drops to which players responded very positively. We meant in our already high engagement levels while monetization of that engagement significantly grew.
We believe this approach will allow our average revenue per user to continue to grow in future years, driving higher margins as more revenues delivered digitally. 
Which brings me to the Call of Duty: Black Ops III, the November release from our award-winning studio, Treyarch. In June, we provided public with hands-on multiplayer E3 for the first time in Call of Duty's history and the response is overwhelmingly positive. In fact, since E3, the number of Black Ops II monthly active users has risen to over 11 million players, which is unprecedented in the game that's known 3 years old in particularly one that is only available on all generation systems.
We're also attracting new consumers into Black ops Universe with catalog sales of both of Black Ops I and Black Ops II, up significantly in North America for the first half of the year. Then at Comic-Con in July, we unveiled the Black Ops III Zombies mode and again, the fan reception was great.
Their excitement was driven not only by the Zombies mode itself, but also by funds realization of just how deep this game is going to be. Laptops they will have 3 incredible play mode, campaign, multiplayer and Zombies inside 1 game. It's mode has its own sticky progression system and we will offer full season of follow-on content to keep players engaged. 
We couldn't be more excited for Call of Duty fans to to experience in Black Ops III multiplayer and that's why for anyone who preorder is we're holding our first public beta in years starting in August.
We can't wait for faster play the game provide feedback will help us make it even better at launch in November. We're also planning our most robust and expensive season of Easter sports for Call of Duty ever and we'll have more details that in the future.
On the Call of Duty Online, which an open beta in China. As I've said before, this game that will take time to ramp in early signs on core player engagement are increasing. In the last week of July, we launched a significant content in feature update in Tencent the kick off marketing campaign to support new player acquisition. While it's too early to know, initial engagement update are positive and we'll have more to share in future quarters.
Turnout to Destiny. In May, we'll partners at Bungie released highly acclaimed second expansion pack, House of Wolves. The percentage of Destiny players who have bought both expansion packs is the highest we have ever seen for any Activision Publishing game. Moreover, engagement of the games millions of active users actually increased after we released House of Wolves, which is impressive for a game 10 months after its launch. Destiny now has over 20 million registered players with an average of about 100 hours of game play each, showing great momentum as we head into our fall release.
On September 15 comes the largest up it estimate of the Destiny universe yet, a mega expansion called The Taken King. We reveled The Taken King at E3, highlighting the all-new campaign, subclasses and brand new destination and gamer reception was incredible. For those who already own Destiny and both expansion packs, they can buy The Taken King for a suggested retail price of $40. 
For those who are new to the Destiny universe, we'll offer the legendary edition, which includes the original Destiny game, both expansion packs thus far and all of the content in The Taken King for a suggested retail price of just $60. This obviously provides new players with a great value but also the right thing to do for our dignity as it will help us keep us many players as possible playing together in the same universe of content.
On to Skylanders. The industry's performing console franchise title and title for the year so far. Despite increasingly competitive toys-to-life category we've maintained our leadership position, growing user engagement and average revenue per user and outsold all other action figure lines year-to-date. Before we get to this year's release for Skylanders, let's take a step-up with other subcategory overall production. As you know, this is a genre we created and have have lead ever since transforming the way kids interact with the toys in the process. Despite the ever-increasing list of competitors on the strong characters from other mediums, we feel we are best-positioned to continue to lead this category for 1 reason, we have delivered and will continue to deliver the best games with the biggest innovations.
Games are at the heart of what we do and games are also the heart of these done well since compelling game plays the way to drive sales. This year's fall release, Skylanders supercharger which we plan to launch on September 20 in North American and September 25th in Europe will bring both action figures and vehicles to life for the first time, allowing our fans to drive, fly and across land, air and sea. This innovation increases the size of the pie, which will now include both action figures for consumers spend about $2.5 billion each year and vehicle toys where consumers spend about $3.3 billion each year in North America and Europe alone. Our proven ability to create great games in this space is what that we were unprecedented partnership with Nintendo to bring Donkey Kong and into Skylanders Superchargers. 
As we have last year, the full game will be available in tablet, one of the world's fastest-growing gaining platforms also development on new initiative for the Skylanders franchise and look forward to telling you more about it next week.
Finally, Guitar Hero, as I said, on our last call, Guitar Hero was brand affinity and name recognition are amongst the highest in our industry, which gives us a strong platform from which to relaunch the brand. But neither we nor fans will be content if we simply repackaged of an version of the old game. Guitar Hero Live is entirely new as a result of many years of meaningful creative innovation. It is 1 game but 2 ways to play. GH Live, which lets fans rock real crowds with real reactions making you feel more like a rockstar than ever before and GH TV, which is the world's first playable music video network with hundreds of songs and could do was a stream of new content to keep our players engaged.
At E3, we give the media a chance to play GHTV for the first time in response could not have been better. Our partners are equally excited and retailers are allocating shelf space to us and multiple what they are allocating to our competitors, and will have more music and promotional partnerships to announce as we get closer to launch, which we plan for October 20.

Blizzard that another strong quarter in Q2 with multiple releases and more activity on more platforms than in any previous quarter. This new content lead to incredible engagement across our player base, monthly active users, the number of players who log into the game each month in the quarter across the entire portfolio is a good indicator of the health of the Blizzard community.
In Q2, the average MAU across Blizzard games was up more than 50% year-over-year, achieving its highest level ever. Moreover, Battle.net ended the quarter at an all-time high for active accounts.
Again, up double digits percentage-wise year-over-year. These important metrics reflect the strength of our portfolio, with many more people around the world playing more Blizzard games than ever before.
On the World of Warcraft front, in late June, we launched one of our biggest, nonexpansion content update ever, Patch 6.2, Fury Hellfire. it added a new zone for players to explore, a new raid and much more. This helped stabilize the subscriber base in the last part of the quarter.
We're currently at work on a much-anticipated update for game that will bring flying to trainer, added new player versus player match making feature and more. In addition, we're going to have exciting news of gains on the suite will be announcing the next expansion for World of Warcraft.
We been listening closely to our players about their experience with Warlords of Draenor and we think they'll be excited when they hear our plans. You can see the announcement for the Battle.net desktop app or the World of Warcraft website.
Hearthstone had a very good quarter with multiple releases in quick succession. We launched the Blackrock Mountain adventure at the beginning of the quarter followed by the release of Hearthstone on mobile phones. We also added a popular new game mode called, what, which gives players a different way to play each week. For example, as legendary monster from the game complete with customized deck. As a result of the new platform and all the new content, engagement for Hearthstone, which was already very strong, nearly doubled year-over-year in terms of active players and time spent. The game continues to perform well in all major regions and remains a top viewed title on Twitch. We recently announced our new card expansion, the Grand Tournament. Like our first expansion Goblins vs Gnomes, the Grand Tournament will add a new game manganic and exempt on of new cards that will have an impact on how Hearthstone is played, which ultimately supports longer-term engagement. The Grand Tournament is due out this month and we're already seeing a lot of excitement about it from the community. 
In addition, like other Blizzard games, Hearthstone has developed into a premiere fixture in the competitive gaming scene. That includes our formal tournaments as well s community-driven event. A big example of the latter our fireside gatherings were members of the community was local Hearthstone get-togethers. This year alone, the community has already have more than 1,300 fireside gatherings globally. Many of these offer participants a chance to secure a spot in the Hearthstone World Championship competition culminating at BlizzCon. 
We look forward to seeing which of these players rise up and make a name for themselves and how they fair against the established pro-players who have advanced to our official government.
Heroes of the Storm also had an exciting quarter with the team making solid progress in driving engagement. Following the June 2nd game launch, the critical reception has been enthusiastic with many outlets giving Heroes of the Storm hybrids for its innovations, accessibility and depth. We've also seen consistently positive commentary from players and that's only increased as more try the game. One of the strengths of Heroes of the Storm is the fact that the draws on content from all of our franchises, giving our players familiar touch points in the game regardless of their familiarity with the genre. 
At the end of June, we started a series of updates that brought popular characters from Diablo such as the Butcher and King Leoric, and a new Diablo battleground, the Battlefield of Eternity to the game.
Players really enjoyed these event, which we're calling the internal conflict and it is still going on so there is more to come. We plan to continue a rapid cadence of Heroes of the Storm update for the foreseeable future this will constantly players new character in strategy options, which will support the game's long-term appeal. Heroes of the Storm eSports is another avenue for engagement and growth of our audience. We kicked off the collegiate scene in April with Heroes the door some of our March Madness torn about, which culminated in a life final event on ESPN2 and resulted in a lot of excitement across the Blizzard community. 
On the professional side, the game has been added to our road to BlizzCon program, and major tournaments are already underway globally. With total price full of $1.2 million in cash and prizes and opportunity to be crowned world champion at BlizzCon. The stakes are high and the competition has already been amazing.
Q2 was also a very good quarter for Diablo III. We launched the game with a free model in China, while offering 2 premium version at $32 and $64. Despite the availability of the free option, the premium version achieved record sell-through in China out the gate and it's continuing to perform well there. The take-up of Diablo 3 in China played a large part in driving research record MAU globally as well as in China specifically for the quarter. In fact, Blizzard's total revenue in China this quarter reached a record high, driven in large part by the success of Diablo 3 there as well as Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm.
I'm pleased to report that Diablo 3 as a whole has now sold through over 30 million copies globally. Players around the world are looking forward to upcoming content patch, which will add the rulings of the Barbarian City of [ph] for them to explore. It also add the powerful item called Ice Cube, which provides endless options for transmitting and upgrading their items.
Blizzard gamers have always expected an outstanding level of entertainment from our games and constant updates such as this reflects our commitment to that standard. 
Moving on StarCraft II. Legacy of the Void beta test continues to go well and we're excited to get into player's hand this year. We're certainly started offering prepurchase as an aspect of that, we're providing data access alone with advanced access to us of campaign missions titled Whispers of Bleak to to anyone who prepurchase the game. We have been a lot of anticipation for this final chapter of the Toolachee and even higher demand at this point in presales compared to Heart of the Swarm. 
The Whispers of Oblivion content plus the multiplayer changes have been received very positively. This is gratifying because we're working hard to deliver a worthy finale to an epic story that's now been over 17 years in the making. One the reasons we feel we can continue to expand our StarCraft II audience that players no longer need to have the previous entries in the series in order to play a part of the former Legacy of the Void. This provides a great opportunity for players who might have missed one of the chapters in the trilogy to come back and jump right into the latest content.
We're also excited to bring StarCraft II multiplayer into a whole new era with new play modes and other changes that increase accessibility. One of the new modes, Archon Mode, allows 2 players to team up and share control of an Army, making the game even more fun to play with a friend. We've seen a very enthusiastic response to this mode as well as the as well as follow the financial patient about our other new call up automatic reminders, which we will be providing more detail about at Games Con.
Looking back at the amount of funded we delivered this quarter, and the player response, we're really pleased with the performance and engagement overall. For the second half of the year, we're driving towards the milestones I mentioned in addition to the global beta test for our Overwatch.
We're particularly excited to carry the momentum from the first half of the year forward to BlizzCon in November, where we will have more to share with our community. One of the biggest attractions there will be the culmination of this year's road to BlizzCon the sports to that with the global champions for World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm being crowned. This will be the most Blizzard eSports competition comping content under 1 roof and we're really excited to see, which of the world stuff players make it to the main event and walk away with the grand prizes.
The global Blizzard community is now as big and as vibrant as it has ever been and we're thrilled to be able to serve players across a wider range of genres and platforms than ever before. Looking across our entire portfolio, and all the upcoming content in our pipeline, it's a great time to be a Blizzard gamer. 
Thank you. And I'll turn the call back over to Amrita."

We're now several games past that and we managed to retain our sizeably that every step of the way. We've already shown, I think, that established characters from other mediums are not the shortcut to leading this category. We believe we will go did lead this category because we make the best games in the category, we've consistently delivered the best innovations in the category and our characters are built for interactive entertainment and our creators have no constraints to routing what those characters can and can't do in a video game, and we believe that's a key competitive advantage as well. On the category itself, we think that the toys-to-life genre will continue to grow and more broadly that the idea of fiscal toys that have digital lives is definitely here to stay. Also, thus far, we've only brought 1 form of toys-to-life with action figures, as I mentioned, with superchargers being vehicles to life as well and the vehicle toys aren't even bigger category and action figures are is, whereas in expanding the pie and the audience further.

The upcoming expansion announcement, I think is a great example, which we're planning to announce later this week at GamesCon.

But equally important is Guitar Hero TV, which gives us a real long-term engagement strategy on this franchise for the first time. We've learned a lot of lessons hear from games like Call of Duty and Destiny, which are that fans appreciate a constant stream of new content, the ability to compete with their friends online and for the game to constantly reward them for their engagement. So we've designed GHTV with all that in mind. So it's really about more than just how many units we sell, it's all about us driving that long-term engagement and you know how powerful that can be for our business when we achieved that.

So this probably represents the most game play you can get for $60 in the industry this holiday.

And we expect our distributor forward for the first time more than 50% of the company sales will come through digital channels this year, which is an important milestone. And obviously, with a great digital growth of 27% in Q2, where well on our way to achieving that. There's a couple of buckets in terms of that, that are really important the first is obviously full-game downloads. We're in the Blizzard side of the business. We already see most of the majority of that volume being digital. Now we're starting to see on the console side more of our AAA share moving digitally. We've seen high teens in the past and that can sometimes spike and weeks depending upon how deep a title is in its catalog life span. So that's growing very, very nicely and we expect that to continue to grow this holiday. But another important area for us in that you really see reflected in our results so far this year is digital add-on content sales. So think of that as content and services that we sell to our players once they're already playing one of our games in these are things like advanced supply transfer Map Packs and Call of Duty or Card Packs or Tokens in Hearthstone or paid character boost in World of Warcraft's in World of Warcraft. Our teams are getting more and more creative about finding ways to use of these tools to drive further engagement. And this is actually the largest and fastest-growing segment of our digital business, which had sales in this area growing at over 56% year-over-year or 73% at constant currency is a very, very strong momentum there. And we think these add-on content sales are super important because they provided only opportunities for our expansion and nice margins but can expand in the engagement with our player base overall, strong trends and momentum for this head into the back half of the year."

Our strategic focus on expanding our franchise portfolio with captivating and original new intellectual property, innovating on new platforms and expanding into new geographies is reflected in our results. We outperformed our Q2 targets and last year's results on revenues, digital growth and earnings per share. These strong results and the excitement for upcoming launches have driven us to raise our full year outlook yet again.
As we are successfully transitioning from a launch to a year-round engagement model, our audience stays and the total amount of time people spend with our franchises continue to grow. In the second quarter, our monthly active users grew by 35% year-over-year. And in a world with so many entertainment choices, from television to movies to social media and beyond, we are grateful that people are choosing to spend more and more of their time with us.
In the second quarter, the amount of time our communities spent playing Activision Blizzard games grew by 25% year-over-year. In fact, this past quarter, our player communities locked nearly 3.5 billion hours of gameplay with our key franchises Heroes of the Storm, Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Diablo, StarCraft, Skylanders, Destiny and Call of Duty. And these numbers do not even include the rapidly increasing amount of time spectators spend watching content based on our games on channels like Twitch and YouTube.
Our strategic investments in new franchises, platforms and geographies continue to pay off. And along with growing engagement and better monetization, sets the stage for more growth ahead. 
We are well underway to expanding our franchise portfolio from 5 to over 10, with 4 new intellectual properties already launched and performing well. In addition, the beloved Guitar Hero franchise will return this fall with product innovation that we couldn't be more excited about. And Overwatch is on the horizon, with the beta this fall.
With an increasing focus on mobile and tablet, Hearthstone's release on iOS and Android smartphones in April multiplayer base has been a key driver for outperformance in Q2 and should benefit us for the foreseeable future. Guitar Hero Live's phone release will also include mobile and tablet at launch. And we are redoubling our efforts to provide a great mobile experience for our Skylanders franchise in addition to making the full game available on tablets.
Finally, we're positioned for growth in new geographies and, in particular, in large and fast-growing China. We now have 6 franchises in market in China, up from 2 at the start of last year, and we're already seeing strong results, with our teams and partners in China delivering record revenues and MAUs in Q2.
Before I hand it over to Dennis, I want to thank our talented teams who continues to execute very well. Our employees are extraordinarily committed and they create the most engaging entertainment experiences for our players. And it shows in our results, which Dennis is now going to take you through in detail."
4222231,304926567,848768,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2015",2015-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Thomas. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our better than expected Q2 financial results, our outlook for Q3 and our increased outlook for 2015.

Today, I will review our better than expected Q2 financial results, our outlook for Q3 and our increased outlook for 2015. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP measures, so please refer to our earnings release for full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations.
For the quarter, on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.04 billion, up 8% year-over-year; an operating margin of 32%; and GAAP EPS of $0.29, up $0.08 versus our May guidance.
For the quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $759 million; an operating margin of 23%, up more than 550 basis points year-over-year; and EPS of $0.13.
We outperformed last year's revenue and EPS by $101 million and $0.07, respectively. At constant FX for Q2, we outperformed last year's revenue by $188 million or 29%, operating income by $116 million or 103% and EPS by $0.13. In addition, we outperformed our May guidance by $109 million on revenue and $0.06 on EPS.
Revenue and EPS outperformance was primarily due to strong growth in recurring revenue from digital content across our broad franchise portfolio. Importantly, total digital revenues grew 27% year-over-year to a Q2 record of $611 million.
The main franchise drivers of the quarter's performance were: Hearthstone, with the launch of their newest adventure, Blackrock Mountain, as well as the release of Hearthstone onto new Android and iOS smartphones; Destiny, with the launch of their second expansion, House of Wolves; Call of Duty, with sales of Season Pass, DLC and microtransactions like Supply Drops for Advanced Warfare; Blizzard's Diablo III, which launched and outperformed in China, helping drive record revenues in the -- in China for the company this quarter; and finally, Blizzard launched Heroes of the Storm globally on June 2.
Note that this quarter was an important inflection point for Blizzard. In spite of World of Warcraft subscriber declines, which were more concentrated in the East and partly affected by the success of Diablo III in China, Blizzard grew its Q2 revenues 29% year-over-year at constant FX. This performance was driven by the strong performances of Diablo, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm, which, in Q2, made up the majority of Blizzard revenues.
The franchise diversification inside Blizzard is happening rapidly. And even more importantly, the aggregate Blizzard community is healthy and growing and, in Q2, reached the highest levels in Blizzard history on the back of strong engagement across the expanded portfolio. And the community will have even more to enjoy with an incredible lineup of new content for these franchises that is yet to come. You will hear more details from Mike on Blizzard's engagement and pipeline later in the call.
In terms of EBITDA and cash flow, in Q2, we generated strong non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $193 million, up $47 million year-over-year; operating cash flow of $135 million and up 27% year-over-year; and free cash flow of $107 million, up 32% year-over-year.
In Q2, we also paid our previously announced $0.20 -- $0.23 per share cash dividend, a 15% increase year-over-year and had no share repurchases in the quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of June 30, we had approximately $4.5 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $800 million was held domestically. We had total debt of $4.12 billion and net cash of approximately $400 billion -- $400 million.
Turning to FX. Please note, as discussed on our February and May calls, the strong dollar has had and will continue to be a headwind this year as our international revenues are translated at lower rates than last year. In Q2, the year-over-year impact of the strengthening of the dollar was $87 million on revenue and $0.06 on EPS. Year-to-date, the year-over-year FX impact was $154 million on revenue and $0.11 on EPS.
Now let's turn to our slate and our outlook for Q3 and for the balance of 2015. We are planning one of the best content pipelines in our history for the back half of the year, and the games are all progressing very well. You will hear more about our Q3 and Q4 slate from Eric and Mike. New releases include Destiny's mega-expansion, The Taken King; Skylanders SuperChargers; Guitar Hero Live; Call of Duty: Black Ops III; and Hearthstone's expansion, The Grand Tournament. One important addition is we are now confirming that the much-anticipated final chapter for StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void is expected to be released in 2015 and will now be included in our guidance for the full year.
Looking forward to Q3, on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $875 million, product costs of 26% and operating expenses of 59%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $51 million, a GAAP tax rate of 23%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 748 million and EPS of $0.08.
For Q3, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $930 million, product costs of 25% and operating expenses of 55%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.14.
Note that our guidance is at FX spot rates as laid out in the accompanying slides on our IR website. 
Now to our 2015 full year numbers. For 2015, on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.425 billion, product costs of 24%, operating expenses of 48% and GAAP interest income expense of $202 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 22%. We expect 750 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP. And GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.06, up $0.08 from our May guidance.
For 2015, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.6 billion, $175 million higher than our May guidance; product costs of 23%; operating expenses of 45%; and an operating margin of 32%, 100 points -- 100 basis points better than our May guidance. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $201 million and our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 24%.
For the second time this year, we are raising our EPS outlook. Our new outlook has increased by $0.10 to $1.30 based on strong franchise momentum coming out of Q2 and now including the StarCraft: Legacy of the Void in our full year numbers. At constant FX, we now project year-over-year growth on the top line and bottom line, including record EPS for the year.
In summary, strong engagement and recurring digital monetization trends are driving our financial results so far this year and give us great momentum heading into the back half of the year. Along with these digital trends, our strategic investments in new franchises, platforms and geographies are paying off. This backdrop sets the stage for growth as we take advantage of the best content pipeline in our history.
Now I will turn the call over to Eric to discuss Activision Publishing."
4222231,304926567,848768,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2015",2015-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dennis. Activision Publishing significantly outperformed last year's result and delivered meaningfully higher digital revenues and operating income for the quarter and the first half of the year. Our Q2 and year-to-date revenues were each up 35% a",1511,"Thanks, Dennis. Activision Publishing significantly outperformed last year's result and delivered meaningfully higher digital revenues and operating income for the quarter and the first half of the year. Our Q2 and year-to-date revenues were each up 35% at a constant FX rate. We also continue to have 2 of the top 5 console franchises year-to-date in Skylanders and Call of Duty, and 3 of the top 5 next-gen games life-to-date, including the number one slot.
This revenue performance is due to our proven ability to create great games that turn into beloved long-term franchises. In recent years, we have methodically and effectively expanded our portfolio to now include 3 innovative and industry-leading franchises, each of which gamers enjoy playing year-round. As a result, our monthly active users are up by more than 25% in Q2 year-over-year and each of these franchises contributed significantly to our overperformance year-to-date.
Let me share some specifics by franchise, starting with Call of Duty. In Q2, revenue was up by a double-digit percentage year-over-year due to strong sell-through on Advanced Warfare, strong momentum in digital monetization as well as strong sell-through on catalog titles. 
I want to highlight Activision -- I want to highlight Advanced Warfare's strong season of digital content in particular. Season Pass, DLC, microtransactions and average revenue per user have all grown year-over-year. As we said in our last call, we introduced a new digital consumable mechanic called Supply Drops to which players have responded very positively. We maintained our already high engagement levels, while monetization of that engagement significantly grew. We believe this approach will allow our average revenue per user to continue to grow in future years, driving higher margins as more revenue is delivered digitally.
Which brings me to Call of Duty: Black Ops III, the November release from our award-winning studio, Treyarch. In June, we provided the public with hands-on multiplayer E3 for the first time in Call of Duty's history, and the response was overwhelmingly positive. In fact, since E3, the number of Black Ops II monthly active users has risen to over 11 million players, which is unprecedented in a game that's now 3 years old, and particularly one that is only available on old generation systems.
We're also attracting new consumers into the Black Ops universe, with catalog sales of both Black Ops I and Black Ops II up significantly in North America for the first half of the year.
Then, at Comic-Con in July, we unveiled the Black Ops III Zombies mode. And again, the fan reception was great. Their excitement was driven not only by the Zombies mode itself, but also by fans' realization of just how deep this game is going to be. Black Ops III will have 3 incredible play modes: Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies inside one game. Each mode has its own sticky progression system and we will offer a full season of follow-on content to keep players engaged. 
We couldn't get more excited for Call of Duty fans to experience Black Ops III Multiplayer and that's why, for anyone who preorders, we're holding our first public beta in years starting in August. We can't wait for fans to play the game and provide feedback to help us make it even better at launch in November. We're also planning our most robust and expansive season of eSports for Call of Duty ever and we'll have more details on that in the future.
Onto Call of Duty Online, which is in open beta in China. As I've said before, this game will take -- that it will take time to ramp, and early signs on core player engagement are encouraging. 
In the last week of July, we launched a significant content and feature update, and Tencent kicked off a marketing campaign to support new player acquisition. While it's too early to know, initial engagement trends after the update are positive, and we'll have more to share in future quarters.
Turning now to Destiny. In May, we, along with our partners at Bungie, released the highly-acclaimed second expansion pack, House of Wolves. The percentage of Destiny players who have bought both expansion packs is the highest we have ever seen for any Activision Publishing game. Moreover, engagement of the game's millions of active users actually increased after we released House of Wolves, which is impressive for a game 10 months after its launch. Destiny now has over 20 million registered players, with an average of about 100 hours of gameplay each, showing great momentum as we head into our fall release.
On September 15 comes the largest update to Destiny -- to the Destiny universe yet, a mega-expansion called The Taken King. We revealed The Taken King at E3, highlighting the all-new campaign, subclasses and brand new destination, and gamer reception was incredible. 
For those who already own Destiny and both expansion packs, they could buy The Taken King for a suggested retail price of $40. For those who are new to the Destiny universe, we'll offer the Legendary Edition, which includes the original Destiny game, both expansion packs thus far, and all of the content in The Taken King for a suggested retail price of just $60. This, obviously, provides new players with a great value. But it's also the right thing to do for our community as it will help us keep as many players as possible playing together in the same universe of content.
Onto Skylanders, the industry's top performing console franchise title and title for the year so far. Despite the increasingly competitive toys-to-life category, we have maintained our leadership position, grown user engagement and average revenue per user and outsold all other action figure lines year-to-date. 
Before we get to this year's release for Skylanders, let's take a step back and look at the toys-to-life category overall. As you know, this is a genre we created and had lead ever since, transforming the way kids interact with toys in the process. Despite an ever-increasing list of competitors on the strong characters from other mediums, we feel we are best positioned to continue to lead this category for one reason: We have delivered and will continue to deliver the best games with the biggest innovations. Games are at the heart of what we do, and games are also at the heart of this genre since compelling gameplay is the way to drive toy sales. 
This year's fall release, Skylanders SuperChargers, which we plan to launch on September 20 in North America and September 25 in Europe, will bring both action figures and vehicles to life for the first time, allowing our fans to drive, fly and captain their way across land, air and sea. This innovation increases the size of the pie, which will now include both action figures, where consumers spend about $2.5 billion each year; and vehicle toys, where consumers spend about $3.3 billion each year in North America and Europe alone. Our proven ability to create great games in this space is what led to our unprecedented partnership with Nintendo to bring Donkey Kong and Bowser into Skylanders SuperChargers.
As we had last year, the full game will be available on tablet, one of the world's fastest-growing gaming platforms. We're also in development on a new mobile initiative for the Skylanders franchise and look forward to telling you more about it next week.
Finally, Guitar Hero. As I said on our last call, Guitar Hero's brand affinity and name recognition are amongst the highest in our industry, which gives us a strong platform from which to relaunch the brand. But neither we nor our fans would be content if we had simply repackaged an upscale [ph] version of an old game. Guitar Hero Live is entirely new and the result of many years of meaningful creative innovation. 
It is one game with 2 ways to play: GH Live, which lets fans rock real crowds with real reactions, making you feel more like a rock star than ever before; and GHTV, which is the world's first playable music video network, with hundreds of songs and a continuous stream of new content to keep our players engaged.
At E3, we gave the media a chance to play GHTV for the first time, and the response could not have been better. Our partners are equally excited and retailers are allocating shelf space to us at multiples to what they are allocating to our competitors. And we'll have more music and promotional partnerships to announce as we get closer to launch, which we plan for October 20.
So to close, Activision Publishing has had a great first half of the year built on innovative games that engage our passionate fans. The stage is set for a great second half as well with major innovation across the portfolio, including Call of Duty: Black Ops III, Destiny: The Taken King, Skylanders SuperChargers and Guitar Hero Live. We look forward to sharing more details with you at Gamescom later this week. 
Now I'll turn over the call to Mike to talk about Blizzard."

Blizzard had another strong quarter in Q2, with multiple releases and more activity on more platforms than in any previous quarter. This new content lead to incredible engagement across our player base. Monthly active users, the number of players who log in to a game each month in the quarter from across the entire portfolio, is a good indicator of the health of a Blizzard community.
In Q2, the average MAU across Blizzard games was up more than 50% year-over-year, achieving its highest level ever. Moreover, Battle.net ended the quarter at an all-time high for active accounts, again up double-digits percentage-wise year-over-year. These important metrics reflect the strength of our portfolio, with many more people around the world playing more Blizzard games than ever before.
On the World of Warcraft front, in late June, we launched one of our biggest, non-expansion content updates ever, Patch 6.2, Fury of Hellfire. It added a new zone for players to explore, a new raid and much more. This helped stabilize the subscriber base in the last part of the quarter.
We're currently at work on a much-anticipated update for the game that will bring flying to Draenor, add a new player versus player matchmaking feature and more. 
In addition, we're going to have exciting news at Gamescom this week. We'll be announcing the next expansion for World of Warcraft. We have been listening closely to our players about their experience with Warlords of Draenor, and we think they'll be really excited when they hear our plans. You can tune in to the announcement through the Battle.net desktop app or the World of Warcraft website.
Hearthstone had a very good quarter, with multiple releases in quick succession. We launched the Blackrock Mountain adventure at the beginning of the quarter, followed by the release of Hearthstone on mobile phones. We also added a popular new game mode called Tavern Brawl, which gives players a different way to play each week. For example, playing as a legendary monster from the game, complete with a customized deck. As a result of the new platform and all the new content, engagement for Hearthstone, which was already very strong, nearly doubled year-over-year in terms of active players and time spent. The game continues to perform well in all major regions and remains a top viewed title on Twitch. 
We recently announced our new card expansion, The Grand Tournament. Like our first expansion, Goblins vs Gnomes, The Grand Tournament will add new game mechanics and a ton of new cards that will have an impact on how Hearthstone is played, which ultimately supports longer-term engagement. The Grand Tournament is due out this month and we're already seeing a lot of excitement about it from the community.
In addition, like other Blizzard games, Hearthstone has developed into a premier fixture in the competitive gaming scene, that includes our formal tournaments as well as community-driven events. A big example of the latter are Fireside Gatherings where members of the community host local Hearthstone get-togethers. This year alone, the community has already held more than 1,300 Fireside Gatherings globally. Many of these offer participants a chance to secure a spot in the Hearthstone World Championship competition culminating at BlizzCon. We look forward to seeing which of these players rise up and make a name for themselves and how they fare against the established pro players who have advanced to our official tournament.
Heroes of the Storm also had an exciting quarter, with the team making solid progress in driving engagement. Following the June 2 game launch, the critical reception has been enthusiastic, with many outlets giving Heroes of the Storm high marks for its innovations, accessibility and depth. We have also seen consistently positive commentary from players, and that's only increased as more try the game. 
One of the strengths of Heroes of the Storm is the fact that it draws on content from all of our franchises, giving our players familiar touch points in the game regardless of their familiarity with the genre. At the end of June, we started a series of updates that brought popular characters from Diablo such as The Butcher and King Leoric, and a new Diablo-themed battleground, the Battlefield of Eternity, to the game. Players really enjoyed this event, which we're calling The Eternal Conflict, and it's still going on so there is more to come. We plan to continue a rapid cadence of Heroes of the Storm updates for the foreseeable future. This will constantly give players new character and strategy options, which will support the game's long-term appeal. 
Heroes of the Storm eSports is another avenue for engagement and growth of our audience. We kicked off the collegiate scene in April with Heroes of the Dorm, a March Madness style tournament, which culminated in a live finals event on ESPN2 and resulted in a lot of excitement across the Blizzard community.
On the professional side, the game has been added to our Road to BlizzCon program and major tournaments are already underway globally. With a total prize pool of $1.2 million in cash and prizes and an opportunity to be crowned world champion at BlizzCon, the stakes are high and the competition has already been amazing.
Q2 was also a very good quarter for Diablo III. We launched the game with a free model in China, while offering 2 premium versions at $32 and $64. Despite the availability of the free option, the premium versions achieved record sell-through in China out of the gate, and it's continuing to perform well there. The take up of Diablo III in China played a large part in driving Blizzard's record MAU globally, as well as in China specifically, for the quarter. In fact, Blizzard's total revenue in China this quarter reached a record high, driven in large part by the success of Diablo III there as well as Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm.
I'm pleased to report that Diablo III as a whole has now sold through over 30 million copies globally. Players around the world are looking forward to upcoming -- the upcoming content patch, which will add the Ruins of the Barbarian City of Sescheron for them to explore. It also adds a powerful item called Kanai's Cube, which provides endless options for transmitting and upgrading their items. Blizzard gamers have always expected an outstanding level of entertainment from our games and constant updates such as this reflects our commitment to that standard.
Moving on StarCraft II. The Legacy of the Void beta test continues to go well and we're excited to get the game into players' hands later this year. We recently started offering prepurchases and, as part of that, we're providing beta access along with advanced access to a set of campaign missions titled “Whispers of Oblivion” to anyone who prepurchases the game. We have seen a lot of anticipation for this final chapter of the trilogy and even higher demand at this point in presales compared to Heart of the Swarm.
The ""Whispers of Oblivion"" content, plus the multiplayer changes, have been received very positively. This is gratifying because we're working hard to deliver a worthy finale to an epic story that's now been over 17 years in the making. 
One of the reasons we feel we can continue to expand our StarCraft II audience is that players no longer need to have the previous entries in the series in order to play Heart of the Swarm or Legacy of the Void. This provides a great opportunity for players who might have missed one of the chapters in the trilogy to come back and jump right in to the latest content.
We're also excited to bring StarCraft II multiplayer into a whole new era, with new play modes and other changes that increase accessibility. One of the new modes, Archon mode, allows 2 players to team up and share control of an army, making the game even more fun to play with a friend. We have seen a very enthusiastic response to this mode as well as a lot of anticipation about our other new co-op mode, Allied Commanders, which we will be providing more detail about at Gamescom.
Looking back at the amount of content we delivered this quarter and the player response, we're really pleased with the performance and engagement overall. For the second half of the year, we're driving towards the milestones I mentioned in addition to the global beta test for Overwatch. 
We're particularly excited to carry the momentum from the first half of the year forward to BlizzCon in November, where we will have more to share with our community. One of the biggest attractions there will be the culmination of this year's Road to BlizzCon eSports tournament, with the global champions for World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm being crowned. This will be the most Blizzard eSports competitions ever contained under one roof. And we're really excited to seeing which of the world's top players make it to the main event and walk away with the grand prizes.
The global Blizzard community is now as big and as vibrant as it's ever been, and we're thrilled to be able to serve players across a wider range of genres and platforms than ever before. Looking across our entire portfolio and all the upcoming content in our pipeline, it's a great time to be a Blizzard gamer.
Thank you. And I'll turn the call back to Amrita."

But to be fair, we have been asked some form of this question, how can you hold on to your lead versus competitors that have much better established characters from other mediums since the -- before the launch of the first Disney game. 
We're now several games past that and we've managed to retain our sizeable lead at every step of the way. We've already shown, I think, that established characters from other mediums are not the shortcut to leading this category. We believe we will continue to lead the category because we make the best games in the category, we've consistently delivered the best innovations in the category, and our characters are built for interactive entertainment and our creators have no constraints surrounding what those characters can and can't do in a video game, and we believe that's a key competitive advantage as well. 
On the category itself, we think that the toys-to-life genre will continue to grow and, more broadly, that the idea of physical toys that have digital lives is definitely here to stay. 
Also thus far, we've only brought one form of toys-to-life with action figures. As I mentioned with SuperChargers, we're bringing vehicles to life as well and vehicle toys are an even bigger category than action figures are, so we're actually expanding the pie and the audience further. 
So we think the category is going to continue to grow. And we're confident that we, uniquely, have the right strategy and capabilities to continue to lead it."

The upcoming expansion announcement, I think, is a great example, which we're planning to announce later this week at Gamescom. 
Looking back at Warlords of Draenor, we were able to bring back more players than any previous expansion, taking the game back over 10 million subscribers, so we definitely believe that there is potential to reengage lapsed layers with good new content.

But more important to us than that is the wide range of other metrics that we use to look at and -- from trailer views, to positive sentiment, to social media engagements, to unaided title awareness, to purchase intent, these metrics are all also up year-on-year as well. 
Also, as I said, we now have over 11 million monthly active users playing Black Ops II, which is unprecedented 3 years past the release date as one of our titles. And it shows, I think, a lot of momentum, a lot of hunger for -- as we head into the launch of Black Ops III. So we're optimistic."

We know we have a great game that has meaningful innovations, and everyone who has put their hands on it, including both critics and fans, loves it. Guitar Hero Live makes you feel more like a rock star than ever before, which is a big marketable innovation. But equally important is Guitar Hero TV, which gives us a real long-term engagement strategy on this franchise for the first time.  We have learned a lot of lessons here from games like Call of Duty and Destiny, which are that fans appreciate a constant stream of new content, the ability to compete with their friends online and for the game to constantly reward them for their engagement. So we've designed GHTV with all that in mind. So it's really about more than just how many units we sell, it's all about us driving that long-term engagement and you know how powerful that can be for our business when we achieve that. 
And also, we're expanding the addressable audience by making the game available on mobile. And we've made a significant investment in both the product development to make sure we have a great game and we're making a significant investment in the marketing to make sure that we have a great launch. So those should be 2 good indicators for you. We believe that this can be a significant contributor to our business in the coming years."

We think that in this genre, eSports is a big driver. And we've already started with our major eSports initiatives underway with our Road to BlizzCon, and so we would expect that eSports will continue to be a driver for us in terms of engagement and growth of the game.

But that's just The Taken King. And I want to emphasize that equally significant to our plans for Q4 are -- is the Legendary Edition, which includes the original game, both the expansion packs thus far and The Taken King, and it's just $60. So this probably represents the most gameplay you can get for $60 anywhere in the industry this holiday.

Yes, obviously, digital was a great -- we had great momentum on digital in the first half of the year. And we expect -- obviously, we look forward for the first time that more than 50% of the company sales will come through digital channels this year, which is an important milestone. And obviously, with a great digital growth of 27% in Q2, we're well on our way to achieving that. 
There's a couple of buckets in terms of that, that are really important. The first is, obviously, full game downloads. We're on the Blizzard side of the business. We already see most of the majority of that volume being digital. Now we're starting to see on the console side more of our AAA share moving digitally. We've seen high teens in the past, and that can sometimes spike in weeks depending upon how deep a title is in its catalog lifespan. So that's growing very, very nicely and we expect that to continue to grow this holiday. 
But another important area for us, in that you really see reflected in our results so far this year is digital add-on content sales. So think of that as content and services that we sell to our players once they're already playing one of our games. And these are things like advanced Supply Drops or map packs in Call of Duty, or card packs in -- or Arena Tokens in Hearthstone, or paid character boosts in World of Warcraft's -- in World of Warcraft. And our teams are getting more and more creative about finding ways to use these tools to drive further engagement. 
And this is actually the largest and fastest-growing segment of our digital business, which had sales in this area growing at over 56% year-over-year or 73% at constant currency, so a very, very strong momentum there. And we think that these add-on content sales are super important because they provide not only opportunities for ARPU expansion and nice margins, but can expand and deepen gameplay and engagement with our player base. So overall, strong trends and momentum for this in -- heading into the back half of the year."

Our strategic focus on expanding our franchise portfolio with captivating and original new intellectual property, innovating on new platforms and expanding into new geographies is reflected in our results. We outperformed our Q2 targets and last year's results on revenues, digital growth and earnings per share. These strong results and the excitement for upcoming launches have driven us to raise our full year outlook yet again.
As we are successfully transitioning from a launch to a year-round engagement model, our audience base and the total amount of time people spend with our franchises continue to grow. In the second quarter, our monthly active users grew by 35% year-over-year. And in a world with so many entertainment choices, from television to movies to social media and beyond, we are grateful that people are choosing to spend more and more of their time with us.
In the second quarter, the amount of time our communities spent playing Activision Blizzard games grew by 25% year-over-year. In fact, this past quarter, our player communities logged nearly 3.5 billion hours of gameplay with our key franchises Heroes of the Storm, Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Diablo, StarCraft, Skylanders, Destiny and Call of Duty. And these numbers do not even include the rapidly increasing amount of time spectators spend watching content based on our games on channels like Twitch and YouTube. 
Our strategic investments in new franchises, platforms and geographies continue to pay off. And along with growing engagement and better monetization, sets the stage for more growth ahead. We are well underway to expanding our franchise portfolio from 5 to over 10, with 4 new intellectual properties already launched and performing well. In addition, the beloved Guitar Hero franchise will return this fall with product innovation that we couldn't be more excited about. And Overwatch is on the horizon, with the beta this fall.
With an increasing focus on mobile and tablet, Hearthstone's release on iOS and Android smartphones in April multiplayer base has been a key driver for outperformance in Q2 and should benefit us for the foreseeable future. Guitar Hero Live's phone release will also include mobile and tablet at launch. And we are redoubling our efforts to provide a great mobile experience for our Skylanders franchise in addition to making the full game available on tablets.  Finally, we're positioned for growth in new geographies and, in particular, in large and fast-growing China. We now have 6 franchises in market in China, up from 2 at the start of last year, and we're already seeing strong results, with our teams and partners in China delivering record revenues and MAUs in Q2.
Before I hand it over to Dennis, I want to thank our talented teams who continue to execute very well. Our employees are extraordinarily committed and they create the most engaging entertainment experiences for our players. And it shows in our results, which Dennis is now going to take you through in detail."
4222231,304926567,848833,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2015",2015-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Thomas. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our better than expected Q2 financial results, our outlook for Q3 and our increased outlook for 2015.

Today, I will review our better than expected Q2 financial results, our outlook for Q3 and our increased outlook for 2015. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP measures, so please refer to our earnings release for full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations.
For the quarter, on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.04 billion, up 8% year-over-year; an operating margin of 32%; and GAAP EPS of $0.29, up $0.08 versus our May guidance. For the quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $759 million; an operating margin of 23%, up more than 550 basis points year-over-year; and EPS of $0.13. We outperformed last year's revenue and EPS by $101 million and $0.07, respectively. At constant FX for Q2, we outperformed last year's revenue by $188 million or 29%, operating income by $116 million or 103% and EPS by $0.13. In addition, we outperformed our May guidance by $109 million on revenue and $0.06 on EPS. Revenue and EPS outperformance was primarily due to strong growth in recurring revenue from digital content across our broad franchise portfolio. Importantly, total digital revenues grew 27% year-over-year to a Q2 record of $611 million.
The main franchise drivers of the quarter's performance were: Hearthstone, with the launch of their newest adventure, Blackrock Mountain, as well as the release of Hearthstone onto new Android and iOS smartphones; Destiny, with the launch of their second expansion, House of Wolves; Call of Duty, with sales of Season Pass, DLC and microtransactions like Supply Drops for Advanced Warfare; Blizzard's Diablo III, which launched and outperformed in China, helping drive record revenues in the -- in China for the company this quarter; and finally, Blizzard launched Heroes of the Storm globally on June 2.
Note that this quarter was an important inflection point for Blizzard. In spite of World of Warcraft subscriber declines, which were more concentrated in the East and partly affected by the success of Diablo III in China, Blizzard grew its Q2 revenues 29% year-over-year at constant FX. This performance was driven by the strong performances of Diablo, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm, which, in Q2, made up the majority of Blizzard revenues. The franchise diversification inside Blizzard is happening rapidly. And even more importantly, the aggregate Blizzard community is healthy and growing and, in Q2, reached the highest levels in Blizzard history on the back of strong engagement across the expanded portfolio. And the community will have even more to enjoy with an incredible lineup of new content for these franchises that is yet to come. You will hear more details from Mike on Blizzard's engagement and pipeline later in the call.
In terms of EBITDA and cash flow, in Q2, we generated strong non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $193 million, up $47 million year-over-year; operating cash flow of $135 million and up 27% year-over-year; and free cash flow of $107 million, up 32% year-over-year. In Q2, we also paid our previously announced $0.20 -- $0.23 per share cash dividend, a 15% increase year-over-year and had no share repurchases in the quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of June 30, we had approximately $4.5 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $800 million was held domestically. We had total debt of $4.12 billion and net cash of approximately $400 billion -- $400 million.
Turning to FX. Please note, as discussed on our February and May calls, the strong dollar has had and will continue to be a headwind this year as our international revenues are translated at lower rates than last year. In Q2, the year-over-year impact of the strengthening of the dollar was $87 million on revenue and $0.06 on EPS. Year-to-date, the year-over-year FX impact was $154 million on revenue and $0.11 on EPS.
Now let's turn to our slate and our outlook for Q3 and for the balance of 2015. We are planning one of the best content pipelines in our history for the back half of the year, and the games are all progressing very well. You will hear more about our Q3 and Q4 slate from Eric and Mike. New releases include Destiny's mega-expansion, The Taken King; Skylanders SuperChargers; Guitar Hero Live; Call of Duty: Black Ops III; and Hearthstone's expansion, The Grand Tournament. One important addition is we are now confirming that the much-anticipated final chapter for StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void is expected to be released in 2015 and will now be included in our guidance for the full year.
Looking forward to Q3, on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $875 million, product costs of 26% and operating expenses of 59%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $51 million, a GAAP tax rate of 23%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 748 million and EPS of $0.08. For Q3, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $930 million, product costs of 25% and operating expenses of 55%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.14. Note that our guidance is at FX spot rates as laid out in the accompanying slides on our IR website. 
Now to our 2015 full year numbers. For 2015, on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.425 billion, product costs of 24%, operating expenses of 48% and GAAP interest income expense of $202 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 22%. We expect 750 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP. And GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.06, up $0.08 from our May guidance. 
For 2015, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.6 billion, $175 million higher than our May guidance; product costs of 23%; operating expenses of 45%; and an operating margin of 32%, 100 points -- 100 basis points better than our May guidance. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $201 million and our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 24%. For the second time this year, we are raising our EPS outlook. Our new outlook has increased by $0.10 to $1.30 based on strong franchise momentum coming out of Q2 and now including the StarCraft: Legacy of the Void in our full year numbers. At constant FX, we now project year-over-year growth on the top line and bottom line, including record EPS for the year.
In summary, strong engagement and recurring digital monetization trends are driving our financial results so far this year and give us great momentum heading into the back half of the year. Along with these digital trends, our strategic investments in new franchises, platforms and geographies are paying off. This backdrop sets the stage for growth as we take advantage of the best content pipeline in our history.
Now I will turn the call over to Eric to discuss Activision Publishing."
4222231,304926567,848833,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2015",2015-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dennis. Activision Publishing significantly outperformed last year's result and delivered meaningfully higher digital revenues and operating income for the quarter and the first half of the year. Our Q2 and year-to-date revenues were each up 35% a",1505,"Thanks, Dennis. Activision Publishing significantly outperformed last year's result and delivered meaningfully higher digital revenues and operating income for the quarter and the first half of the year. Our Q2 and year-to-date revenues were each up 35% at a constant FX rate. We also continue to have 2 of the top 5 console franchises year-to-date in Skylanders and Call of Duty, and 3 of the top 5 next-gen games life-to-date, including the #1 slot.
This revenue performance is due to our proven ability to create great games that turn into beloved long-term franchises. In recent years, we have methodically and effectively expanded our portfolio to now include 3 innovative and industry-leading franchises, each of which gamers enjoy playing year-round. As a result, our monthly active users are up by more than 25% in Q2 year-over-year and each of these franchises contributed significantly to our over performance year-to-date.
Let me share some specifics by franchise, starting with Call of Duty. In Q2, revenue was up by a double-digit percentage year-over-year due to strong sell-through on Advanced Warfare, strong momentum in digital monetization as well as strong sell-through on catalog titles.  I want to highlight Advanced Warfare's strong season of digital content in particular. Season Pass, DLC, microtransactions and average revenue per user have all grown year-over-year. As we said on our last call, we introduced a new digital consumable mechanic called Supply Drops to which players have responded very positively. We maintained our already high engagement levels, while monetization of that engagement significantly grew. We believe this approach will allow our average revenue per user to continue to grow in future years, driving higher margins as more revenue is delivered digitally.
Which brings me to Call of Duty: Black Ops III, the November release from our award-winning studio, Treyarch. In June, we provided the public with hands-on multiplayer E3 for the first time in Call of Duty's history, and the response was overwhelmingly positive. In fact, since E3, the number of Black Ops II monthly active users has risen to over 11 million players, which is unprecedented in a game that's merely 3 years old, and particularly one that is only available on old generation systems. We're also attracting new consumers into the Black Ops universe, with catalog sales of both Black Ops I and Black Ops II up significantly in North America for the first half of the year.
Then, at Comic-Con in July, we unveiled the Black Ops III Zombies mode. And again, the fan reception was great. Their excitement was driven not only by the Zombies mode itself, but also by fans' realization of just how deep this game is going to be. Black Ops III will have 3 incredible play modes: Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies inside one game. Each mode has its own sticky progression system and we will offer a full season of follow-on content to keep players engaged.  We couldn't get more excited for Call of Duty fans to experience Black Ops III Multiplayer and that's why, for anyone who preorders, we're holding our first public beta in years starting in August. We can't wait for fans to play the game and provide feedback to help us make it even better at launch in November. We're also planning our most robust and expansive season of eSports for Call of Duty ever and we'll have more details on that in the future. 
Onto Call of Duty Online, which is in open beta in China. As I've said before, this game will take -- that it will take time to ramp, and early signs on core player engagement are encouraging.  In the last week of July, we launched a significant content and feature update, and Tencent kicked off a marketing campaign to support new player acquisition. While it's too early to know, initial engagement trends after the update are positive, and we'll have more to share in future quarters.
Turning now to Destiny. In May, we, along with our partners at Bungie, released the highly-acclaimed second expansion pack, House of Wolves. The percentage of Destiny players who have bought both expansion packs is the highest we have ever seen for any Activision Publishing game. Moreover, engagement of the game's millions of active users actually increased after we released House of Wolves, which is impressive for a game 10 months after its launch. Destiny now has over 20 million registered players, with an average of about 100 hours of gameplay each, showing great momentum as we head into our fall release.
On September 15 comes the largest update to Destiny -- to the Destiny universe yet, a mega-expansion called The Taken King. We revealed The Taken King at E3, highlighting the all-new campaign, subclasses and brand new destination, and gamer reception was incredible.  For those who already own Destiny and both expansion packs, they could buy The Taken King for a suggested retail price of $40. For those who are new to the Destiny universe, we'll offer the Legendary Edition, which includes the original Destiny game, both expansion packs thus far, and all of the content in The Taken King for a suggested retail price of just $60. This, obviously, provides new players with a great value. But it's also the right thing to do for our community as it will help us keep as many players as possible playing together in the same universe of content.
Onto Skylanders, the industry's top performing console franchise title and title for the year so far. Despite the increasingly competitive toys-to-life category, we have maintained our leadership position, grown user engagement and average revenue per user and outsold all other action figure lines year-to-date.  Before we get to this year's release for Skylanders, let's take a step back and look at the toys-to-life category overall. As you know, this is a genre we created and have led ever since, transforming the way kids interact with toys in the process. Despite an ever-increasing list of competitors on the strong characters from other mediums, we feel we are best positioned to continue to lead this category for one reason: We have delivered and will continue to deliver the best games with the biggest innovations. Games are at the heart of what we do, and games are also at the heart of this genre since compelling gameplay is the way to drive toy sales. 
This year's fall release, Skylanders SuperChargers, which we plan to launch on September 20 in North America and September 25 in Europe, will bring both action figures and vehicles to life for the first time, allowing our fans to drive, fly and captain their way across land, air and sea. This innovation increases the size of the pie, which will now include both action figures, where consumers spend about $2.5 billion each year; and vehicle toys, where consumers spend about $3.3 billion each year in North America and Europe alone. Our proven ability to create great games in this space is what led to our unprecedented partnership with Nintendo to bring Donkey Kong and Bowser into Skylanders SuperChargers. As we had last year, the full game will be available on tablet, one of the world's fastest-growing gaming platforms. We're also in development on a new mobile initiative for the Skylanders franchise and look forward to telling you more about it next week.
Finally, Guitar Hero. As I said on our last call, Guitar Hero's brand affinity and name recognition are amongst the highest in our industry, which gives us a strong platform from which to relaunch the brand. But neither we nor our fans would be content if we had simply repackaged an up res version of an old game. Guitar Hero Live is entirely new and the result of many years of meaningful creative innovation.  It is one game with 2 ways to play: GH Live, which lets fans rock real crowds with real reactions, making you feel more like a rock star than ever before; and GHTV, which is the world's first playable music video network, with hundreds of songs and a continuous stream of new content to keep our players engaged. At E3, we gave the media a chance to play GHTV for the first time, and the response could not have been better. Our partners are equally excited and retailers are allocating shelf space to us at multiples to what they are allocating to our competitors. And we'll have more music and promotional partnerships to announce as we get closer to launch, which we plan for October 20.
So to close, Activision Publishing has had a great first half of the year built on innovative games that engage our passionate fans. The stage is set for a great second half as well with major innovation across the portfolio, including Call of Duty: Black Ops III, Destiny: The Taken King, Skylanders SuperChargers and Guitar Hero Live. We look forward to sharing more details with you at Gamescom later this week. 
Now I'll turn over the call to Mike to talk about Blizzard."

Blizzard had another strong quarter in Q2, with multiple releases and more activity on more platforms than in any previous quarter.

Blizzard had another strong quarter in Q2, with multiple releases and more activity on more platforms than in any previous quarter. This new content lead to incredible engagement across our player base. Monthly active users, the number of players who log in to a game each month in the quarter from across the entire portfolio, is a good indicator of the health of a Blizzard community. In Q2, the average MAU across Blizzard games was up more than 50% year-over-year, achieving its highest level ever. Moreover, Battle.net ended the quarter at an all-time high for active accounts, again up double-digits percentage-wise year-over-year. These important metrics reflect the strength of our portfolio, with many more people around the world playing more Blizzard games than ever before.
On the World of Warcraft front, in late June, we launched one of our biggest, non-expansion content updates ever, Patch 6.2, Fury of Hellfire. It added a new zone for players to explore, a new raid and much more. This helped stabilize the subscriber base in the last part of the quarter. We're currently at work on a much-anticipated update for the game that will bring flying to Draenor, add a new player versus player matchmaking feature and more.  In addition, we're going to have exciting news at Gamescom this week. We'll be announcing the next expansion for World of Warcraft. We have been listening closely to our players about their experience with Warlords of Draenor, and we think they'll be really excited when they hear our plans. You can tune in to the announcement through the Battle.net desktop app or the World of Warcraft website.
Hearthstone had a very good quarter, with multiple releases in quick succession. We launched the Blackrock Mountain adventure at the beginning of the quarter, followed by the release of Hearthstone on mobile phones. We also added a popular new game mode called Tavern Brawl, which gives players a different way to play each week. For example, playing as a legendary monster from the game, complete with a customized deck. As a result of the new platform and all the new content, engagement for Hearthstone, which was already very strong, nearly doubled year-over-year in terms of active players and time spent. The game continues to perform well in all major regions and remains a top viewed title on Twitch. 
We recently announced our new card expansion, The Grand Tournament. Like our first expansion, Goblins vs Gnomes, The Grand Tournament will add new game mechanics and a ton of new cards that will have an impact on how Hearthstone is played, which ultimately supports longer-term engagement. The Grand Tournament is due out this month and we're already seeing a lot of excitement about it from the community.
In addition, like other Blizzard games, Hearthstone has developed into a premier fixture in the competitive gaming scene; that includes our formal tournaments as well as community-driven events. A big example of the latter are Fireside Gatherings where members of the community host local Hearthstone get-togethers. This year alone, the community has already held more than 1,300 Fireside Gatherings globally. Many of these offer participants a chance to secure a spot in the Hearthstone World Championship competition culminating at BlizzCon. We look forward to seeing which of these players rise up and make a name for themselves and how they fare against the established pro players who have advanced to our official tournament.
Heroes of the Storm also had an exciting quarter, with the team making solid progress in driving engagement. Following the June 2 game launch, the critical reception has been enthusiastic, with many outlets giving Heroes of the Storm high marks for its innovations, accessibility and depth. We have also seen consistently positive commentary from players, and that's only increased as more try the game. 
One of the strengths of Heroes of the Storm is the fact that it draws on content from all of our franchises, giving our players familiar touch points in the game regardless of their familiarity with the genre. At the end of June, we started a series of updates that brought popular characters from Diablo such as The Butcher and King Leoric, and a new Diablo-themed battleground, the Battlefield of Eternity, to the game. Players have really enjoyed this event, which we're calling The Eternal Conflict, and it's still going on so there's more to come. 
We plan to continue a rapid cadence of Heroes of the Storm updates for the foreseeable future. This will constantly give players new character and strategy options, which will support the game's long-term appeal. Heroes of the Storm eSports is another avenue for engagement and growth of our audience. We kicked off the collegiate scene in April with Heroes of the Dorm, a March Madness style tournament, which culminated in a live finals event on ESPN2 and resulted in a lot of excitement across the Blizzard community. On the professional side, the game has been added to our Road to BlizzCon program and major tournaments are already underway globally. With a total prize pool of $1.2 million in cash and prizes and an opportunity to be crowned world champion at BlizzCon, the stakes are high and the competition has already been amazing.
Q2 was also a very good quarter for Diablo III. We launched the game with a free model in China, while offering 2 premium versions at $32 and $64. Despite the availability of the free option, the premium versions achieved record sell-through in China out of the gate, and it's continuing to perform well there. The take up of Diablo III in China played a large part in driving Blizzard's record MAU globally, as well as in China specifically, for the quarter. In fact, Blizzard's total revenue in China this quarter reached a record high, driven in large part by the success of Diablo III there as well as Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm.
I'm pleased to report that Diablo III as a whole has now sold through over 30 million copies globally. Players around the world are looking forward to upcoming -- the upcoming content patch, which will add the Ruins of the Barbarian City of Sescheron for them to explore. It also adds a powerful item called Kanai's Cube, which provides endless options for transmuting and upgrading their items. Blizzard gamers have always expected an outstanding level of entertainment from our games and constant updates such as this reflects our commitment to that standard.
Moving on StarCraft II. The Legacy of the Void beta test continues to go well and we're excited to get the game into players' hands later this year. We recently started offering prepurchases and, as part of that, we're providing beta access along with advanced access to a set of campaign missions titled “Whispers of Oblivion” to anyone who prepurchases the game. We have seen a lot of anticipation for this final chapter of the trilogy and even higher demand at this point in presales compared to Heart of the Swarm. The ""Whispers of Oblivion"" content, plus the multiplayer changes, have been received very positively. This is gratifying because we're working hard to deliver a worthy finale to an epic story that's now been over 17 years in the making. 
One of the reasons we feel we can continue to expand our StarCraft II audience is that players no longer need to have the previous entries in the series in order to play Heart of the Swarm or Legacy of the Void. This provides a great opportunity for players who might have missed one of the chapters in the trilogy to come back and jump right in to the latest content. We're also excited to bring StarCraft II multiplayer into a whole new era, with new play modes and other changes that increase accessibility. One of the new modes, Archon mode, allows 2 players to team up and share control of an army, making the game even more fun to play with a friend. We have seen a very enthusiastic response to this mode as well as a lot of anticipation about our other new co-op mode, Allied Commanders, which we will be providing more detail about at Gamescom.
Looking back at the amount of content we delivered this quarter and the player response, we're really pleased with the performance and engagement overall. For the second half of the year, we're driving towards the milestones I mentioned in addition to the global beta test for Overwatch. We're particularly excited to carry the momentum from the first half of the year forward to BlizzCon in November, where we will have more to share with our community. One of the biggest attractions there will be the culmination of this year's Road to BlizzCon eSports tournament, with the global champions for World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm being crowned. This will be the most Blizzard eSports competitions ever contained under one roof. And we're really excited to see which of the world's top players make it to the main event and walk away with the grand prizes.
The global Blizzard community is now as big and as vibrant as it's ever been, and we're thrilled to be able to serve players across a wider range of genres and platforms than ever before.

It's inarguable that the category has become much more crowded since we invented it a few years ago. But to be fair, we've been being asked some form of this question, how can you hold on to your lead versus competitors that have much better established characters from other mediums since the -- before the launch of the first Disney game. We're now several games past that and we've managed to retain our sizeable lead at every step of the way. We've already shown, I think, that established characters from other mediums are not the shortcut to leading this category. We believe we will continue to lead the category because we make the best games in the category, we've consistently delivered the best innovations in the category, and our characters are built for interactive entertainment and our creators have no constraints surrounding what those characters can and can't do in a video game, and we believe that's a key competitive advantage as well. On the category itself, we think that the toys-to-life genre will continue to grow and, more broadly, that the idea of physical toys that have digital lives is definitely here to stay.  Also thus far, we've only brought one form of toys-to-life with action figures. As I mentioned with SuperChargers, we're bringing vehicles to life as well and vehicle toys are an even bigger category than action figures are, so we're actually expanding the pie and the audience further. So we think the category is going to continue to grow. And we're confident that we, uniquely, have the right strategy and capabilities to continue to lead it."

We have now more developers working on World of Warcraft than ever before, and that's so we can continue to release high quality content for our community and, hopefully, increase the pace at which we're releasing that. The upcoming expansion announcement, I think is a great example, which we're planning to announce later this week at Gamescom.  Looking back at Warlords of Draenor, we were able to bring back more players than any previous expansion, taking the game back over 10 million subscribers, so we definitely believe that there's potential to reengage lapsed layers with good new content.  We also think that the Warcraft movie is a key inflection point. It's coming out next June.

So with that as a backdrop, I'll tell you that year-to-date, we're, in fact, significantly up on preorders with Black Ops III. And we expect Call of Duty to lead the industry in preorders again. But more important to us than that is the wide range of other metrics that we use to look at. And from trailer views, to positive sentiment, to social media engagements, to unaided title awareness, to purchase intent, these metrics are all also up year-on-year as well.  Also, as I said, we now have over 11 million monthly active users playing Black Ops II, which is unprecedented 3 years past the release date as one of our titles. And it shows, I think, a lot of momentum, a lot of hunger for -- as we head into the launch of Black Ops III. So we're optimistic."

Guitar Hero Live makes you feel more like a rock star than ever before, which is a big marketable innovation. But equally important is Guitar Hero TV, which gives us a real long-term engagement strategy on this franchise for the first time.  We've learned a lot of lessons here from games like Call of Duty and Destiny, which are that fans appreciate a constant stream of new content, the ability to compete with their friends online and for the game to constantly reward them for their engagement. So we've designed GHTV with all that in mind. So it's really about more than just how many units we sell, it's all about us driving that long-term engagement and you know how powerful that can be for our business when we achieve that.  And also, we're expanding the addressable audience by making the game available on mobile.

I think I would say that looking at the game's reception and performance globally, we're very happy with the reaction and reception around the world. We did just launch the game in June, so you're right, it is still very early. I think if you look at other games in the genre, they all had more gradual growth of their player base, so that is what we would expect to see with Heroes of the Storm. We think that in this genre, eSports is a big driver. And we've already started with our major eSports initiatives underway with our Road to BlizzCon, and so we would expect that eSports will continue to be a driver for us in terms of engagement and growth of the game.

It's hard to compare to other games' expansion packs because Destiny is such an unusual game. But the short answer is, compared to our own past expansion packs, it's significantly bigger than the other expansion packs we've had, but still smaller than an entirely new game. We're calling it a mega-expansion for a reason. But that's just The Taken King. And I want to emphasize that equally significant to our plans for Q4 are -- is the Legendary Edition, which includes the original game, both the expansion packs thus far and The Taken King, and it's just $60. So this probably represents the most gameplay you can get for $60 anywhere in the industry this holiday. And we're doing that very deliberately because -- both because we want to bring in new fans and it's a great value for them, but it's also the right thing to do for the community because it's a shared world game and we want to keep the largest number of players possible playing together with the same content.

Yes, obviously, digital was a great -- we had great momentum on digital in the first half of the year. And we expect -- obviously, we look forward for the first time that more than 50% of the company sales will come through digital channels this year, which is an important milestone. And obviously, with a great digital growth of 27% in Q2, we're well on our way to achieving that.  There's a couple of buckets in terms of that, that are really important. The first is, obviously, full game downloads, where on the Blizzard side of the business, we already see most of the majority of that volume being digital. Now we're starting to see on the console side more of our AAA share moving digitally. We've seen high teens in the past, and that can sometimes spike in weeks depending upon how deep a title is in its catalog lifespan. So that's growing very, very nicely and we expect that to continue to grow this holiday.  But another important area for us, in that you really see reflected in our results so far this year is digital add-on content sales. So think of that as content and services that we sell to our players once they're already playing one of our games. And these are things like advanced Supply Drops or map packs in Call of Duty, or card packs in -- or Arena Tokens in Hearthstone, or paid character boosts in World of Warcraft's -- in World of Warcraft. And our teams are getting more and more creative about finding ways to use these tools to drive further engagement.  And this is actually the largest and fastest-growing segment of our digital business, which had sales in this area growing at over 56% year-over-year or 73% at constant currency, so very, very strong momentum there. And we think that these add-on content sales are super important because they provide not only opportunities for ARPU expansion and nice margins, but can expand and deepen gameplay and engagement with our player base. So overall, strong trends and momentum for this in -- heading into the back half of the year."

We refer to these measures as non-GAAP measures.

In addition, we will also be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results and a one-page summary.

Irish law also plays a certain limitations on what are deemed to be profit forecasts, so we are more limited in what we can say about future prospects.

Over the last 25 years, we've demonstrated a consistent ability to identify opportunities to serve and support our audiences and deliver superior value to our shareholders. We're disciplined, deliberate and methodical whether in the development of new franchises, entering new segments and geographies and perhaps most importantly, identifying transactions with great opportunity for shareholder value creation. 
With respect to the latter, we've had very positive results and track records over the last 25 years because we cared deeply about how we allocate our capital and prioritize our opportunities. The way we considered King is consistent with our proven history of evaluating acquisition opportunities. King operates in a rapidly growing segment. They have a truly well-placed management team, exceptional gain development talent and great commercial instincts. 
The transaction is accretive, brings new audiences and the King corporate DNA is oriented towards great game-making with commercial potential. We merged with Blizzard Entertainment, we found the right partner with extraordinary leadership. And when others dismissed the sustainability of Blizzard's incredible capacity for innovation, we were certain patience would be rewarded, and it has. We see a lot of the same characteristics fixed today in King. 
We think now is the right time to enter mobile gaming in a meaningful way. Widespread mobile access around the world has opened up significant demand for engaging fun content that players can enjoy anytime, anywhere. By acquiring King, which is a proven ability to turn it to games into iconic franchises, we will be a participant in the fastest-growing segment in gaming, a category that today is estimated to be $36 billion. It's still extremely fragmented, and we believe has great promise for the future. 
We also believe King's management team, including Ricardo, Sebastian and Stephane, are some of the most talented executives in the game industry. We've long admired their talents and after spending a lot of time over the last 3 years getting to know the King team, we realized how truly special their company is. They have over 1,600 incredibly talented people, committed to a community of more than 450 million monthly active users. 
Acquiring King will solidify Activision Blizzard's position as the world leader in interactive entertainment, positioning the combined company for growth across platforms, audiences, genres and business models. Combining Activision Blizzard's portfolio of some of the very best interactive entertainment franchises on the console and PC with King's leading mobile titles will create a world-class portfolio of games with strong, enduring appeal to a wide range of demographics and audiences, along with leadership positions across key platforms. 
The #1 console franchises is Call of Duty, the #1 PC franchise is World of Warcraft and now, 2 of the top 5 highest grossing mobile games. We'll have 1 of the largest entertainment networks in the world with over 0.5 billion monthly active users, immediately opening up meaningful opportunities to grow across promote content to provide enhanced offerings to our collective players, while expanding into untapped geographies. The combined company will have diversified capabilities across business models like subscription, upfront purchase, free-to-play and microtransaction. 
Through our world-class properties and enhanced capabilities across segments and business models, we'll be able to diversify our revenue streams, enhancing our position as the most profitable interactive entertainment company in the world. The result is a transaction that will be accretive to estimated 2016 non-GAAP EPS estimates by approximately 30%. I couldn't be more excited to welcome the King into the Activision Blizzard family and now Tom will share with you the specifics of the transaction."

Under the proposed transaction, Activision Blizzard will acquire all of the outstanding shares of King for $18 in cash per share for a total equity value of $5.9 billion and an enterprise value of $5 billion [ph], representing a multiple of approximately 6.4x King's estimated 2015 adjusted EBITDA. 
This transaction will be financed through a mix of offshore cash and fully committed debt financing. This will enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet and conservative leverage. Following today's announcement, our path to completion is subject to approval by the Irish High Court, the U.S., E.U. and other anti-trust regulators as well as other customary holding conditions. In addition, the transaction is subject to a vote by King's shareholders. APEX and King's management shareholders have committed to voting their shares in favor of the transaction. 
All in all, we expect the transaction to close by spring 2016. Once the transaction closes, King will operate as an independent operating unit of Activision Blizzard, similar to how Blizzard Entertainment operates. We have an excellent track record of integrating with minimal disruption and in a way that maintains the organization's culture, creative independence and ability to really thrive. As Bobby said earlier, King's management team has been integral to their success. Ricardo, Sebastian and Stephan will continue to lead the business and they've all signed long-term contractual commitments. 
We think this acquisition is an exciting opportunity for everyone connected to Activision Blizzard and to King. This is a very compelling transaction from a financial perspective. Together, we'll have more diversified and recurring revenues, a strong balance sheet and strong liquidity. King's shareholders will also be getting a 20% plus premium to the recent share price and the liquidity, and we'll be able to speed up our ability to capitalize on meaningful long-term growth opportunities. We'll reach more players across more audiences and expand our presence in fast-growing regions, such as Asia. 
One of the most exciting things about this deal is what it means for our communities of players. By putting these 2 companies together, we'll have greater capabilities and expertise to enrich the player experience, an expanded network to which players in virtually every country across the world and more resources to amaze and delight our players. We want to be where our players are, whether it's normal consoles or PCs, or out of their smartphones and tablets and this deal enhances our ability to do just that. 
I also want to talk to you about employee culture. It's something that's incredibly important to Activision Blizzard and something we really think sets us apart. We have a track record of attracting and retaining top talent. This is incredibly important in the entertainment and technology industries, and one of the reasons we're able to do this is because we have deep respect for the creative process. We are the destination for the best talent in the business. Activision Blizzard's commitment to innovation, talent development and the creative process is 100% mirror in King's culture. 
Activision Blizzard debt holders, this transaction accelerates the promising path we're already on to build our diverse portfolio, grow our predictable recurring revenue streams and generate strong cash flows, while maintaining strong liquidity. This financial profile puts us on a path for near-term deleveraging and further supports our already investment-grade financial profile. In fact, last night, Moody's upgraded our -- of the company's debt ratings to investment grade upon announcement of the deal. 
King and Activision Blizzard are a great fit for all stakeholders and we're excited about what we'll be able to accomplish together. As Bobby mentioned earlier, our long-term strategy has been focused on innovating on new high-growth platforms, expanding our franchise portfolio with captivating and original new intellectual property, and building our capabilities to create compelling offerings to our diverse player base across genres, platforms, business models and geographies. You will hear more during the second half of this call about our strong results, which are further evidence that our strategy is working. 
In this transaction, meaningfully accelerates that growth strategy by providing Activision Blizzard with a leadership position in mobile gaming, the largest and fastest growing segment of interactive entertainment. It is expected to grow by more than 50% from $36 billion in 2015 to $55 billion by 2019. Mobile franchises are now reaching results similar to established console franchises. King in particular has shown repeat success with multiple titles and deleting franchises demonstrates a track record of continued success. 
The combined company will have a world-class portfolio with some of the world's most iconic franchises in the entertainment industry across key platforms. Activision Blizzard knows how to create, develop and sustain our portfolio of titles and turn them into iconic franchises with long-lasting appeal and deep engagement. The names you see on the slide are some of the most successful interactive entertainment franchises in the world. What attracted us to King is that in similar ways to us, they have a proven ability to extend the success of their quartiles, developing them into proven franchises. 
Together, we'll be able to apply our highly complementary strengths, assets and operational expertise to drive deep, year-round engagement and additional revenue streams and build upon our proven development models to bring new content to more audiences across genres. Our combined will have 0.5 billion monthly active uses, making it one of the largest entertainment networks in the world. Our audience includes a broad diversity of demographics in almost every country around the globe. The ability to cross promote our industry-leading franchises across this highly engaged network is incredibly exciting. As part of our growth strategy, not only do we have some of the leading owned intellectual property in the interactive entertainment, but we've been building capabilities across platforms, genres, business models and geographies. 
It is clear that our acquisition of King provides important highly complementary capabilities in key areas. In mobile, free-to-play and the ability to reach casual gamers and emerging geographies. Our capabilities and infrastructure has never been better and we've never been in such a great position to deliver content to any audience on any platform. That is an exciting prospect for not only our fans, but for our employees and our shareholders as well. 
Now let me introduce Ricardo who will walk you through King's business."

I would like to share a little about King, especially for those who are [indiscernible] company. King is a leader in mobile gaming and has been developing games since 2003. We have created a strong organization with 12 studios in Europe",768,"Thank you, Thomas. I would like to share a little about King, especially for those who are [indiscernible] company. King is a leader in mobile gaming and has been developing games since 2003. We have created a strong organization with 12 studios in Europe, Asia and the U.S. and are driven by dedicated world-class talent. King has a portfolio of best-in-class franchises that includes the top grossing games within their sub genres. Our 4 franchises: Candy Crush, Farm Heroes, Flat Rescue and Bottle Witch are category-leading brand. We operate them as a life service and continually give our players new highly engaging content by adding new levels, timebase live up and expansions with innovative modes of play. 
We also launched new games within our existing franchises. Candy Crush Soda Saga is our highly successful sister title to the original hit, Candy Crush Saga. We have seen that these efforts has transformed our games into true game franchises. In third quarter 2015, more than 3 years after the original launch of Candy Crush Saga, an average of 92 million people played Candy Crush games every day. The popularity of our games and success of our monetization and franchise strategy have translated into a leading position in the mobile gaming business. 
We have had 2 of the top 5 grossing games on the Apple App Store and Google Play store in the U.S. for 3 consecutive quarters. And at least 3 of the top 15 grossing games for 7 consecutive quarters. We have built 1 of the largest networks of mobile game players with 474 million monthly active users in Q3 who played 1.4 billion games per day. Our network is a key asset for launching new through games cross promotion. 
We are excited about what we bring to the combined company. We have a strong pipeline, which includes new franchise games and other new games to diversify our portfolio into new genres, which we have just begun with our first noncasual game launch. And though our company already has a strong presence globally, we see meaningful opportunities in key Asian markets. Our strength as a company is reflected in our robust financial profile with significant scale and profitability. 
In the 12 months ended September 30, we generated $2.2 billion of gross bookings and $875 million also adjusted EBITDA for a 42% adjusted EBITDA margin. We have a highly cash generative business with $920 million of cash on our balance sheet. We think we can have the combined company win in mobile. We have 1 of the largest networks, not just for our gaming company, but across the mobile sector with 474 million monthly active users and 133 million daily active users in Q3. 
We have a portfolio of best-in-class game franchises on mobile, which are top grossing in their respective subgenres and their year plan to operate our franchises with 3 new games planned for launch by the end of 2016. In addition to our focus on our franchise business, our strategy is to leverage our reach and capabilities to enter new genres. We recently launched our first resource management game and expect to release our first mid core title in 2016. 
Through this transaction, I think that both King and Activision Blizzard will be able to better serve our players by leveraging our complementary strength, assets and operational expertise. We also will have the ability to cross promote games, providing our players more opportunities to engage with our content. Activision Blizzard has a long history of building, maintaining and growing what I think are iconic and successful franchises, and I believe we can benefit from their experience. 
Our third quarter performance reflects the continued strength of our business. Our preliminary third quarter 2015 results include gross bookings of $502 million, which exceeded the high-end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $180 million for a 38% adjusted EBITDA margin. Our player metrics for the quarter, 474 million monthly active users, 330 million monthly unique users and 133 million daily active users underscore our massive player network.
Based on the timing of game releases and recent trends, King expects gross bookings in the fourth quarter to be between $475 million and $500 million. We look forward to sharing more with you about our third quarter performance during our earnings call tomorrow. In closing, I think the deal makes sense because it makes a stronger in the industry. It brings together 2 world-class teams and it gives our shareholders an attractive liquidity leverage. And we look forward to working together with Activision Blizzard and are very excited."

As Bobby, Thomas and Ricardo mentioned, we're incredibly excited to be combining the capabilities and portfolios of our company together. This transaction enhances Activision Blizzard's current position as the most profitable, stand-alone",673,"Thanks, Ricardo. As Bobby, Thomas and Ricardo mentioned, we're incredibly excited to be combining the capabilities and portfolios of our company together. This transaction enhances Activision Blizzard's current position as the most profitable, stand-alone interactive entertainment company. We expect accretion to 2016 estimated non-GAAP revenues and earnings per share of approximately 30% based on consensus estimates. The transaction is also significantly accretive to 2016 estimated free cash flow per share. We'll be combining Activision Blizzard's trailing 12 months non-GAAP revenues of $4.7 billion with King's trailing 12 months adjusted revenues of $2.1 billion, and combining Activision Blizzard's adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion with King's $0.9 billion over the same period. Importantly, the accretion figures detailed in this presentation do not include potential synergies that could come from cross promotion and shared capabilities for the combined company. 
Activision Blizzard's business today generates the bulk of its revenues from its high-performing console and PC businesses, which as we will discuss on our Q3 earnings report, continue to perform very well and are increasingly shifting to high-margin digital channels with increasingly long tails of player engagement and monetization. King generates virtually all of its revenue from high-margin digital platforms with the vast majority of it on mobile. The industrial logic of combining these businesses, bringing leadership in gaming across PCs, consoles and mobile platforms is highlighted by the balanced post deal revenue mix of roughly 1/3 coming from each of these platforms. In addition, the combined company will be an online services business with roughly 2/3 of the combined revenue being delivered digitally. 
One of the things we've learned from our Blizzard merger is that a broader IP portfolio across more platforms creates diversified and highly profitable financial profile, which in turn, provides us with more capital to reinvest in innovation and deliver the great content that our fans expect. And with the acquisition of King, we will now have some of the world's leading interactive entertainment franchises, not only on PC and console, but mobile as well. Now let's turn to the balance sheet and look at the sources and uses of capital as well as the combined capitalization of the company. 
As mentioned earlier, the acquisition of King is an accretive use of Activision Blizzard's offshore cash. The transaction will be funded with $3.4 billion in offshore cash from our balance sheet along with $2.3 billion coming from fully committed term loan financing led by Bank of America, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs and around $200 million of rollover unvested equity awards. The combined companies capitalization will also maintain a conservative balance sheet with strong liquidity. Having a strong balance sheet with deep capital resources is very important to us and the transaction further diversifies and reinforces our financial profile. 
And as Thomas mentioned, just last night, Moody's upgraded all of our debt rating to investment-grade upon announcement of the deal, which is obviously, great recognition for the progress we have made for the past 2 years since we've raised debt for the first time. So in summary, Activision Blizzard's acquisition of King solidifies us as a world leader in interactive entertainment and positions us well for future growth opportunities. The transaction accelerates our current growth strategy as it provides us with a leadership position in mobile gaming, the largest and fastest growing gaming segment and it adds to our portfolio of iconic interactive entertainment franchises. 
It is also highly accretive to earnings and free cash flow per share while still providing King's shareholders with the premium and liquidity. And most importantly for the long-term growth prospects of our business, our acquisition of King brings with it a committed management team with a proven track record and talented employees with aligned objectives to drive innovation to better serve our player communities. So we couldn't be more excited than we are now to have Ricardo, Sebastian, Stephan and the entire King team as part of the Activision Blizzard family. 
I will now turn the call back the Thomas to kick off our Q3 results discussion."

I will now turn to Activision Blizzard's earnings results for the third quarter of 2015. Our strong results reflect our strategic focus on expanding our franchise portfolio with innovative new intellectual property, broadening our reach by expanding on to new platforms and geographies and driving deeper engagement through regular content updates that delights our audiences. We outperformed our Q3 targets on revenues, digital growth and earnings per share, and we are raising our full year outlook yet again. We project year-over-year revenue and EPS growth as constant FX. We'll continue to invest in our franchises through the holiday to build our installed base, given the increasing opportunity of backend revenues. This investment sets us up for continued organic growth in 2016 and beyond. 
And of course, the addition of King to our portfolio presents additional opportunities for growth ahead. As we successfully transition from a large to a year-round engagement model, our audience base and the total amount of time people spend with our franchisors continue to grow. In the third quarter, our monthly active users grew by 27% year-over-year and the amount of time our communities spend playing Activision Blizzard's games grew by 23% year-over-year. Our audiences yet again allot nearly 3.5 billion hours of game play in the quarter, not including rapidly growing our spent spectating. You will hear more about our strategic initiatives at Investor Day later this week at BlizzCon. You will also get to see some of the industry's most exciting E sports championships. We look forward to seeing you there. And now I will turn the call over to Eric to discuss Activision publishing's results."

Activision Publishing delivered another record quarter with record non-GAAP operating income, which at constant FX, was up by over 50% over last year's Q3 performance. We also drove monthly active users up by 17% year-over-year, continue to have 3 of the top 5 next-generation games live to date and have the largest digital revenues in our history both in Q3 and year-to-date. Our results are due to our proven ability to turn great games into long-term franchises with large passionate communities. We have strategically and methodically expanded our portfolio to include 3 such industry-leading franchises, each of which gamers enjoy playing year-round. 
We've also just relaunched what we hope could become our fourth major franchise with Guitar Hero Live. We're only 2 weeks in, but early reception from fans and critics has been very positive. While sell-through comparisons to prior games from 5 years ago aren't exactly apples to apples, our current sell-through is significantly up versus each of the prior 2 Guitar Hero titles. As you know, unlike path games, we also designed Guitar Hero Live to be a living platform to keep players engaged and so far, people are responding well with average engagement per player reaching nearly 2 hours per day. The game has also been featured in a wide array of the most influential must-have holiday toy lists. All that said, it's still very early and we anticipate that this title will ramp towards the holiday, which is why we have over half of our marketing investment this year, yet to come. 
Moving on to Destiny. We launched the Taken King in September with our partners at Bungie to extremely positive reception from fans and critics. Day 1 downloads broke Sony PS4 records. Day 1 engagements are the highest number of active players in Destiny's history. Player engagement is now well North of 3 hours per day and the Destiny community now has 25 million registered players. For new players, the Taken King Legendary Edition gives new players the original Destiny game both expansion packs and the Taken King all for the same price as a regular console game. We've also successfully introduced great new content into the game, which allows our player to express themselves and personalize their experience, which is available via in-game purchases and it's caused a number of thriller dancers in game to increase dramatically. 
Onto skylanders, which launched at the end of September with Skylanders superchargers, our first game featuring both vehicle and character toys. I said in our last call that we expect the competition to continue to increase in the toys live category, which we invented, and it has. I also said we will continue to lead because we deliver the best games and the biggest innovations, and we are. With Skylanders remaining the biggest franchise in the toys-to-life category year-to-date. Superchargers and the addition of vehicles in the skylanders has been positively received by fans. It's also one of our most engaging Skylanders games ever with more towards per player than last year. But even though superchargers sell-through is down year-on-year due to increased competition, we are investing in the holiday to maintain our leadership position and we're optimistic that we'll see category expansion in the holiday. The full game will once again be available on the tablet and the first time on iPhone and AppleTV as well. As I mentioned, in our last call we are in the development Skylanders battle cost which brings cards to life when a free-to-play card battle game. The game is looking great and we expect it to launch in 2016. 
Last but not least, Call Of Duty. The year so far has been phenomenal for the franchise with revenues up double-digit percentages both this quarter and quarter to date. The over performance has been, driven by one, higher advanced warfare selling; two, deeper engagement from our community, driving up performance on Season Pass, DLC, and the new consumable microtransactions feature supply drops; and three, strong catalog sales of Black Ops which have ramped with consumer anticipation for Black Ops 3. In fact, monthly active users for Black Ops 2 grew quarter-over-quarter again to a new record of nearly 12 million monthly active users, and uncommitted level for a game that is now 3 years old and only available on Old Gen. 
This brings me to our most anticipated launch of the year, Call Of Duty Black Ops 3. We couldn't be more excited about the launch this Friday. We have strong momentum indicated by a number of factors but just to name a few, the growing engagement around the past Black Ops titles, the significant year-on-year list on pre-orders, the consumer around our marketing asset, which is more positive for Black Ops 3 than any Call of Duty title on record. The great partnership with Sony across consumer trade and custom PS4 bundles and our ranking at Nielsen's #1 most anticipated title of the year. Even more importantly, we've got the game. It is simply awesome with innovations across single player, multiplayer, and of course, Zombies. Black Ops 3 has more content and more surprises packed inside than any game we've made to date. So in closing, we've had a great first 3 quarters built on innovative games that engage our passionate fans and the stage is set for a strong Q4. I look forward to seeing you and sharing more at Investor Day this Friday. And now I'll turn over the call over to my good friend, Mike, to discuss Blizzard."

We have an exciting upcoming content plate and we're continuing to foster powerful connections with our community online, through our pro and amateur e-sports program and at live events like. Hearthstone in particular had another great quarter, driven by the launch of the The Grand Tournament expansion. Along with continued strength on mobile and continued strong performance in all markets, the new expansion helps put engagement for Hearthstone even in higher in Q3 than in Q2. 
Year-over-year, engagement with a 77% leading to Hearthstone's highest ever quarterly revenue. In addition, we recently launched a fully localized version of Hearthstone in Japan. The game already had an established audience in Japan, so we were pleased to provide them as well as new players with a version that makes access even easier. Activity around Hearthstone East Fortress also continued to grow and drive excitement. Over the past few months, we concluded several tournaments beating into the world championship at BlizzCon. For World of Warcraft this quarter, we released a key update, which helps maintain stability in the subscriber base and we're currently at work on the next update. 
We also had very exciting news at games comp with the announcement of World of Warcraft legion, our next expansion. Players responded very positively not only to the new features coming with the expansion, but to the care we're putting into the content. In addition to holding the World of Warcraft, the World Cup Arena championship will have more to share on Legion at BlizzCon to speak. On the StarCraft 2 front, excitement for legacy of the void, which will be sold in the standalone product launching on November 10 remains strong. In fact, prepurchases for Legacy of the Void have continued to outpace those for the previous release, Heart of the Swarm. 
At the professional level, the StarCraft 2 world championship series competition has been intense and extremely fun to follow. I encourage everyone to tune in at BlizzCon or online for the final round. It's amazing to see some of the most skilled pro gamers in the world in action. As for Diablo III, we were pleased that we continue to bring in new players in Q3. And in China, it passed the 2 million sales milestone. We released a huge well-received content update in the quarter. Altogether, we've added a ton of posts that launched content in Diablo 3 and this reflects our strong commitment to the game and to the community. 
Here's of the storm also brings in the -- brought in more players in Q3 driven in part by our Diablo themed content series.

We held the regional championships for our world of with squads series, including our championship in Las Vegas and the European championship in Prague over the past few months. These events featured teams with international followings across multiple games, which is exciting frontiers of the storm community and for e-sports as a whole. We're looking forward to seeing the winners of the regional championships face off at BlizzCon for the world championship title. 
There is also a lot of ongoing excitement around Overwatch, which just started its beta test last week.

We're keeping access limited in order to focus feedback, but we plan to periodically run stress test begins around the world that will allow many more players to join him. We'll be sharing the latest Overwatch news at BlizzCon, so I hope you will tune in.
As you can tell, we're very excited about BlizzCon and all the eSports action taking place there this week. BlizzCon represents the depth and breadth of our portfolio. At the height of the esport competition in our games, it's a massive undertaking and it wouldn't exist without the super passionate, highly engaged audiences of Blizzard gamers around the world.

For the quarter on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $990 million, up 31% year-over-year and operating margin of 20% and GAAP EPS of $0.17, up $0.09 versus our August guidance. 
For the quarter on a non-GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.04 billion and operating margin of 24% up 190 basis points year-over-year and EPS of $0.21. We outperformed our August guidance by $110 million on revenue and $0.07 on EPS. At constant FX, our year-to-date revenues are up 5% ahead of last year and EPS is 35% ahead of last year, despite the tougher comp with last year's Diablo III expansion and Destiny's full game launch. Importantly, total digital revenues grew 38% year-over-year or 50% at constant FX to an all-time quarterly record of $697 million, a significant driver of that growth was sales from digital add-on content, which grew 60% year-over-year or 75% at constant FX. 
Our digital full game downloads also grew 39% year-over-year or 48% at constant FX largely, driven by the Destiny expansion launch. There are a few key franchise drivers worth highlighters. Hearthstone had its highest revenue quarter yet with the launch of its expansion in the grand tournament in August. Destiny's operating income grew by a double-digit percentage year-to-date on the back of the launch of the taken King in September. Skylanders SuperChargers launched a great fan and critical reception that went into a more competitive landscape. Activision's Call of Duty and Blizzard's Diablo III and Heroes of the Storm continue to perform well and attract new players. And World of Warcraft subscribers stabilized at 5.5 million subs in the quarter and note that this is the last quarter that we plan to provide the subscriber number as there are other metrics that are better indicators of the overall Blizzard business performance. 
In terms of EBITDA. In Q3, we generated non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $275 million and $1.63 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Operating cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $1.36 billion [ph] up 39% year-over-year and free cash flow was $1.25 billion, up 43% year-over-year. Turning to the balance sheet as of September 30, we had approximately $4.5 billion in cash and investments of which approximately $870 million was held domestically. We had total debt of $4.12 billion and net cash of approximately $400 million. We had no share repurchases in the quarter. 
Turning to FX. Please note that as discussed in our prior's earnings calls, the strong dollar has will and continue to be a headwind this year as our international revenues are translated at lower rates for last year. In Q3, the year-over-year impact of the strength in the dollar was $85 million on revenue and $0.05 on EPS. Year-to-date, the year-over-year FX impact was $239 million on revenue and $0.16 on EPS. Now let's turn to our outlook for Q4 and full year 2015. 
First for Q4 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.22 billion, product cost of 30% and operating expenses of 57%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $51 million, a GAAP tax rate of 39%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 753 million, and EPS of $0.09. For Q4 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $2.15 billion, product cost of 25% and operating expenses of 35%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.82. Note that our guidance is an FX spot rates as laid out in the company's slides on our IR website. 
Now to our full year 2015 numbers. For 2015 on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.53 billion, product cost of 24%, operating expenses of 49% and GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $201 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 22%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted shares of $715 million and GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.07. For 2015 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.65 billion, $50 million higher than our own August guidance, products comps of 24%, operating expenses of 44% and an operating margin of 32%. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 24% . Once again, we are raising our full year EPS guidance now to $1.31. We are not fully passing through the entire $0.07 [ph] Q3 over performance largely due to 3 factors, but first, revenue pullforward on Destiny and Skylanderse from Q4 into Q3, which has an impact of approximately $0.02. Cost savings and timing of expenses, which pushed into Q4 from Q3, which also was worth $0.02 and additional investments we'll be making in Q4 to build the installed base of players across our portfolio, which accounts for the other $0.02. 
With the strong back end monetization we're seeing across our portfolio, we think these investments set us up well heading into next year. Importantly, we expect to end the year with more than half of our revenues coming from digital channels, up double-digit percentage points in aggregate from last year. So in summary, strong engagement and recurring digital monetization trends continue to drive our financial results along with these positive digital tailwinds, our strategic investments and new franchises, platforms and geographies are paying off as shown by our year-to-date results. And going forward with King's franchises in our portfolio, we feel that our strategic growth opportunities across platforms, genres, business models, audience demographics and geographies are more promising than ever. We couldn't be more excited to welcome King and their talented employees into the fold, and look forward to taking advantage of the great mutual opportunities we have in front of us. 
Lastly, we look forward to seeing many of you in person this Friday at Investor Day at the start of BlizzCon, to tell you more about exciting times ahead. And for those of you who can't attend in person, you can watch the live stream from our IR website. Thanks again, and now we'll open up the call for questions."

And then separately, I think there's been some discussion around Destiny favoring microtransactions going forward. Based on the experience you had with the Taken King, can you talk about the strategy with DLC going forward and can it, along with microtransactions, coexist with this franchise?"

We had a full year of expansions that have been very well-received and sold quite well, and more recently, you've seen us introduce smaller to allow people to customize their experience and express themselves and those have been very well-received and its sold well also. So I think they've already shown POC and microtransactions can exist for more great content. As far as any shifts in strategy, I don't have any announcements today, but I think we have a lot of options at our disposal. And the reason for that of course, is that we have such great engagement with this game. As I said, we're seeing average player times of 3 hours per day, which is really an outstanding figure. And beyond that, we're also bringing in new players. I think the Legendary Edition going into the holiday gives holidays the best ever to jump into the Destiny universe, and as you get the original Destiny in both the expansion packs and taken King at the price of a regular console game. So this has already brought a lot of new players in and we hope to see even more as we head into the holiday."

We have a lot of exciting news to share with you. First, our proposed acquisition of King, then Activision Blizzard third quarter earnings results, followed by Q&A.
I'd like to remind everyone that during this call, we will be making statements that are not historical facts. These are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include comments about our plans and expectations regarding Activision Blizzard's pending acquisition of King Digital Entertainment as well as our comments about our outlook and other future plans and expectations that we'll provide during the earnings report portion of this call.
A number of important factors could cause actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements, including the factors indicated on the slide that is showing and those discussed in the Risk Factors section of Activision Blizzard's and King Digital Entertainment's SEC filings.
In particular, all of our statements with respect to the expected impact of the acquisition are subject to the risk that the acquisition may not be completed or may not be completed on the expected timeline.
The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available to Activision Blizzard and King Digital Entertainment as of the date of this presentation. And while we believe them to be true, they may ultimately prove to be incorrect. The companies undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today, November 3, 2015, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
I would like to note that Activision Blizzard prepares its financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP and King Digital Entertainment prepares its financial information in accordance with IFRS, as issued by the IASB. Certain numbers we will be presenting today will be made on a non-GAAP basis for Activision Blizzard and on a non-IFRS basis for King Digital Entertainment. We refer to these measures as non-GAAP measures. Please refer to our Rule 2.5 announcement, which is available at activisionblizzard.acquisitionoffer.com and Activision Blizzard's earnings release, which is posted on activisionblizzard.com, for the applicable reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and further explanation.
There are also 2 PowerPoint overviews, one with respect to the deal and one with respect to Activision Blizzard's Q3 results, which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted to the websites following the call.
In addition, we will also be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results and a one-page summary. Please note, because this is an Irish public company deal, there are certain limits on what we can say, specifically our statements must be limited to matters disclosed in the rule 2.5 announcement, which was released last night and we won't be able to go beyond what is presented in that document.
Irish law also plays a certain limitations on what are deemed to be profit forecasts, so we are more limited in what we can say about future prospects.
Now speaking on the call today will be Bobby Kotick, our CEO; Thomas Tippl, our COO; Dennis Durkin, our CFO; and Riccardo Zacconi, CEO and Co-Founder of King Digital Entertainment. Later, we will be joined by Eric Hirshberg and Mike Morhaime to review Activision Blizzard's quarterly over performance.

Over the last 25 years, we've demonstrated a consistent ability to identify opportunities to serve and support our audiences and deliver superior value to our shareholders. We're disciplined, deliberate and methodical whether in the developments of new franchises, entering new segments and geographies and perhaps most importantly identifying transactions with great opportunity for shareholder value creation.
With respect to the latter, we've had very positive results and track records over the last 25 years, because we care deeply about how we allocate our capital and prioritize our opportunities. The way we considered King is consistent with our proven history of evaluating acquisition opportunities. King operates in a rapidly growing segment. They have a truly world-class management team, exceptional gain development talent and great commercial instincts.
The transaction is accretive, brings new audiences and the King corporate DNA is oriented towards great game-making with commercial potential. We merged with Blizzard Entertainment. We found the right partner with extraordinary leadership. And when others dismissed the sustainability of Blizzard's incredible capacity for innovation, we were certain patience would be rewarded, and it has. We see a lot of the same characteristics today in King.
We think now is the right time to enter mobile gaming in a meaningful way. Widespread mobile access around the world has opened up significant demand for engaging fun content that players can enjoy anytime, anywhere. By acquiring King, which has a proven ability to turn it's games into iconic franchises, we will be a participant in the fastest-growing segments in gaming, a category that today is estimated to be $36 billion. It's still extremely fragmented, and we believe has great promise for the future.
We also believe King's management team, including Riccardo, Sebastian and Stephane are some of the most talented executives in the game industry. We've long admired their talents. And after spending a lot of time over the last 3 years getting to know the King team, we realized how truly special their company is. They have over 1,600 incredibly talented people, committed to a community of more than 450 million monthly active users.
Acquiring King will solidify Activision Blizzard's position as the world leader in interactive entertainment, positioning the combined company for growth across platforms, audiences, genres and business models. Combining Activision Blizzard's portfolio of some of the very best interactive entertainment franchises on the console and PC with King's leading mobile titles, will create a world-class portfolio of games with strong, enduring appeal to a wide range of demographics and audiences, along with leadership positions across key platforms.
The #1 console franchise with Call of Duty, the #1 PC franchise with World of Warcraft and now, 2 of the top 5 highest grossing mobile games. We'll have one of the largest entertainment networks in the world with over 0.5 billion monthly active users, immediately opening up meaningful opportunities to grow and cross-promote content to provide enhanced offerings to our collective players, while expanding into untapped geographies. The combined company will have diversified capabilities across business models like subscription, upfront purchase, free-to-play and microtransaction.
Through our world-class properties and enhanced capabilities across segments and business models, we'll be able to diversify our revenue streams, enhancing our position as the most profitable interactive entertainment company in the world. The result is a transaction that will be accretive to estimated 2016 non-GAAP EPS estimates by approximately 30%. I couldn't be more excited to welcome King into the Activision Blizzard family, and now Thomas will share with you the specifics of the transaction."
4222231,315899151,890194,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2015",2015-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bobby.

Under the proposed transaction, Activision Blizzard will acquire all of the outstanding shares of King for $18 in cash per share for a total equity value of $5.9 billion or an enterprise value of $5 billion, representing a multiple of approximately 6.4x King's estimated 2015 adjusted EBITDA.
This transaction will be financed through a mix of offshore cash and fully committed debt financing. This will enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet and conservative leverage.
Following today's announcement, our path to completion is subject to approval by the Irish High Court, the U.S., E.U. and other antitrust regulators as well as other customary closing conditions. In addition, the transaction is subject to a vote by King's shareholders. APEX and King management shareholders have committed to voting their shares in favor of the transaction. All in all, we expect the transaction to close by spring 2016.
Once the transaction closes, King will operate as an independent operating unit of Activision Blizzard, similar to how Blizzard Entertainment operates. We have an excellent track record of integrating with minimal disruption and in a way that maintains the organization's culture, creative independence and ability to really thrive. As Bobby said earlier, King's management team has been integral to their success. Riccardo, Sebastian and Stephane will continue to lead the business and they've all signed long-term contractual commitments.
We think this acquisition is an exciting opportunity for everyone connected to Activision Blizzard and to King. This is a very compelling transaction from a financial perspective. Together, we'll have more diversified and recurring revenues, a strong balance sheet and strong liquidity. King's shareholders will also be getting a 20%-plus premium to the recent share price and liquidity. And we'll be able to speed up our ability to capitalize on meaningful long-term growth opportunities. We'll reach more players across more audiences and expand our presence in fast-growing regions such as Asia.
One of the most exciting things about this deal is what it means for our communities of players. By putting these 2 companies together, we'll have greater capabilities and expertise to enrich the player experience, an expanded network to reach players in virtually every country across the world and more resources to amaze and delight our players. We want to be wherever our players are. Whether they are at home on consoles or PCs, or out on their smartphones and tablets and this deal enhances our ability to do just that.
I also want to talk to you about employee culture. It's something that's incredibly important at Activision Blizzard and something we really think sets us apart. We have a track record of attracting and retaining top talent. This is incredibly important in the entertainment and technology industries, and one of the reasons we are able to do this is because we have deep respect for the creative process. We are the destination for the best talent in the business. Activision Blizzard's commitment to innovation, talent development and the creative process is 100% mirror in King's culture.
For Activision Blizzard debt holders, this transaction accelerates the promising path we are already on to build our diverse portfolio, grow our predictable recurring revenue streams and generate strong cash flows, while maintaining strong liquidity. This financial profile puts us on the path for near-term deleveraging and further supports our already investment-grade financial profile. In fact, last night, Moody's upgraded all of the company's debt ratings to investment grade upon announcement of the deal.
King and Activision Blizzard are a great fit for all stakeholders and we are excited about what we'll be able to accomplish together. As Bobby mentioned earlier, our long-term strategy has been focused on innovating on new high-growth platforms, expanding our franchise portfolio with captivating and original new intellectual property and building our capabilities to create compelling offerings to our diverse player base across genres, platforms, business models and geographies. You will hear more during the second half of this call about our strong results, which are further evidence that our strategy is working.
And this transaction meaningfully accelerates that growth strategy by providing Activision Blizzard with a leadership position in mobile gaming, the largest and fastest-growing segment of interactive entertainment. It is expected to grow by more than 50% from $36 billion in 2015 to $55 billion by 2019. Mobile franchises are now reaching results similar to established console franchises. King, in particular, has shown repeat success with multiple titles and the leading franchises demonstrate a track record of continued success.
The combined company will have a world-class portfolio with some of the world's most iconic franchises in the entertainment industry across key platforms. Activision Blizzard knows how to create, develop and sustain our portfolio of titles and turn them into iconic franchises with long-lasting appeal and deep engagement. The names you see on the slide are some of the most successful interactive entertainment franchises in the world. What attracted us to King is that in similar ways to us, they have a proven ability to extend the success of their quartiles, developing them into proven franchises.
Together, we'll be able to apply our highly complementary strengths, assets and operational expertise to drive deep, year-round engagement and digital revenue streams and build upon our proven development models to bring new content to more audiences across genres.
Our combined audience will have more than 0.5 billion monthly active uses, making it one of the largest entertainment networks in the world. Our audience includes a broad diversity of demographics in almost every country around the globe. The ability to cross promote our industry-leading franchises across this highly engaged network is incredibly exciting. As part of our growth strategy, not only do we have some of the leading owned intellectual property in the interactive entertainment, but we've been building capabilities across platforms, genres, business models and geographies.
It is clear that our acquisition of King provides important highly complementary capabilities in key areas in mobile, free-to-play and the ability to reach casual gamers and emerging geographies. Our capabilities and infrastructure have never been better and we've never been in such a great position to deliver content to any audience on any platform. That is an exciting prospect for not only our fans, but for our employees and for our shareholders as well.
Now let me introduce Riccardo, who will walk you through King's business."

We have created a strong organization with 12 studios in Europe",767,"Thank you, Thomas. I would like to share a little about King, especially for those who are [indiscernible] company. King is a leader in mobile gaming and has been developing games since 2003. We have created a strong organization with 12 studios in Europe, Asia and the U.S. that are driven by dedicated world-class talent. King has a portfolio of best-in-class franchises that includes the top grossing games within their subgenres. Our 4 franchises: Candy Crush, Farm Heroes, Pet Rescue and Bubble Witch are category-leading brands. We operate them as a life service and continually give our players new highly engaging content by adding new levels, timebase live up and expansions with innovative modes of play.
We also launched new games within our existing franchises. Candy Crush Soda Saga is our highly successful sister title to the original hit, Candy Crush Saga. We have seen that these efforts have transformed our games into true game franchises. In third quarter 2015, more than 3 years after the original launch of Candy Crush Saga, an average of 92 million people played Candy Crush games every day. The popularity of our games and success of our monetization and franchise strategy have translated to a leading position in the mobile gaming business.
We have had 2 of the top 5 grossing games on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in the U.S. for 3 consecutive quarters, and at least 3 of the top 15 grossing games for 7 consecutive quarters. We have built one of the largest networks of mobile game players with 474 million monthly active users in Q3, who played 1.4 billion games per day. Our network is a key asset for launching new games through cross promotion.
We are excited about what we bring to the combined company. We have a strong pipeline, which includes new franchise games and other new games to diversify our portfolio into new genres, which we have just begun with our first noncasual game launch. And though our company already has a strong presence globally, we see meaningful opportunities in key Asian markets. Our strength as a company is reflected in our robust financial profile with significant scale and profitability.
In the 12 months ended September 30, we generated $2.2 billion of gross bookings and $875 million of adjusted EBITDA for a 42% adjusted EBITDA margin. We have a highly cash generative business with $920 million of cash on our balance sheet. We think we can have the combined company win in mobile. We have one of the largest networks, not just for a gaming company, but across the mobile sector with 474 million monthly active users and 133 million daily active users in Q3.
We have a portfolio of best-in-class game franchises on mobile, which are top grossing in their respective subgenres and their multiyear plan to operate our franchises with 3 new games planned for launch by the end of 2016. In addition to our focus on our franchise business, our strategy is to leverage our reach and capabilities to enter new genres. We recently launched our first resource management game and expect to release our first mid-core title in 2016.
Through this transaction, I think that both King and Activision Blizzard will be able to better serve our players by leveraging our complementary strength, assets and operational expertise. We also will have the ability to cross promote games, providing our players more opportunities to engage with our content. Activision Blizzard has a long history of building, maintaining and growing what I think are iconic and successful franchises, and I believe we can benefit from their experience.
Our third quarter performance reflects the continued strength of our business. Our preliminary third quarter 2015 results include gross bookings of $502 million, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $180 million for a 38% adjusted EBITDA margin. Our player metrics for the quarter, 474 million monthly active users, 330 million monthly unique users and 133 million daily active users underscore our massive player network.
Based on the timing of game releases and recent trends, King expects gross bookings in the fourth quarter to be between $475 million and $500 million. We look forward to sharing more with you about our third quarter performance during our earnings call tomorrow.
In closing, I think this deal makes sense because it makes us stronger in the industry, it brings together 2 world-class teams and it gives our shareholders an attractive liquidity event. And we look forward to working together with Activision Blizzard and I'm very excited."

As Bobby, Thomas and Riccardo mentioned, we're incredibly excited to be combining the capabilities and portfolios of our company together.

As Bobby, Thomas and Riccardo mentioned, we're incredibly excited to be combining the capabilities and portfolios of our company together. This transaction enhances Activision Blizzard's current position as the most profitable, stand-alone interactive entertainment company. We expect accretion to 2016 estimated non-GAAP revenues and earnings per share of approximately 30% based on IBES consensus estimates. The transaction is also significantly accretive to 2016 estimated free cash flow per share.
We'll be combining Activision Blizzard's trailing 12-month non-GAAP revenues of $4.7 billion with King's trailing 12-month adjusted revenues of $2.1 billion, and combining Activision Blizzard's adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion with King's $0.9 billion over the same period. Importantly, the accretion figures detailed in this presentation do not include potential synergies that could come from cross promotion and shared capabilities for the combined company.
Activision Blizzard's business today generates the bulk of its revenues from its high-performing console and PC businesses, which as we will discuss during our Q3 earnings report, continue to perform very well and are increasingly shifting to high-margin digital channels with increasingly long tails of player engagement and monetization.
King generates virtually all of its revenue from high-margin digital platforms with the vast majority of it on mobile. The industrial logic of combining these businesses, bringing leadership in gaming across PCs, consoles and mobile platforms is highlighted by the balanced post deal revenue mix of roughly 1/3 coming from each of these platforms. In addition, the combined company will be an online services business with roughly 2/3 of the combined revenue being delivered digitally.
One of the things we've learned from our Blizzard merger is that a broader IP portfolio across more platforms creates a diversified and highly profitable financial profile, which in turn provides us with more capital to reinvest in innovation and to deliver the great content that our fans expect.
And with the acquisition of King, we will now have some of the world's leading interactive entertainment franchises, not only on PC and console, but mobile as well.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and look at the sources and uses of capital as well as the combined capitalization of the company.
As mentioned earlier, the acquisition of King is an accretive use of Activision Blizzard's offshore cash. The transaction will be funded with $3.4 billion in offshore cash from our balance sheet along with $2.3 billion coming from fully committed term loan financing led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs and around $200 million of rollover unvested equity awards. The combined companies' capitalization will also maintain a conservative balance sheet with strong liquidity. Having a strong balance sheet with deep capital resources is very important to us and the transaction further diversifies and reinforces our financial profile.
And as Thomas mentioned, just last night, Moody's upgraded all of our debt rating to investment grade upon announcement of the deal, which is obviously great recognition for the progress we have made in the past 2 years since we've raised debt for the first time.
So in summary, Activision Blizzard's acquisition of King solidifies us as a world leader in interactive entertainment and positions us well for future growth opportunities. The transaction accelerates our current growth strategy, as it provides us with a leadership position in mobile gaming, the largest and fastest-growing gaming segment and it adds to our portfolio of iconic interactive entertainment franchises.
It is also highly accretive to earnings and free cash flow per share, while still providing King's shareholders with the premium and liquidity. And most importantly for the long-term growth prospects of our business, our acquisition of King brings with it a committed management team with a proven track record and talented employees with aligned objectives to drive innovation to better serve our player communities. So we couldn't be more excited than we are now to have Riccardo, Sebastian, Stephane and the entire King team as part of the Activision Blizzard family.
I will now turn the call back the Thomas to kick off our Q3 results discussion."

I will now turn to Activision Blizzard's earnings results for the third quarter of 2015. Our strong results reflect our strategic focus on expanding our franchise portfolio with innovative new intellectual property, broadening our reach by expanding on to new platforms and geographies and driving deeper engagement through regular content updates that delights our audiences.
We outperformed our Q3 targets on revenues, digital growth and earnings per share, and we are raising our full year outlook yet again. We project year-over-year revenue and EPS growth as constant FX. We'll continue to invest in our franchises through the holiday to build our installed base, given the increasing opportunity of backend revenues. This investment sets us up for continued organic growth in 2016 and beyond.
And of course, the addition of King to our portfolio presents additional opportunities for growth ahead. As we successfully transition from a large to a year-round engagement model, our audience base and the total amount of time people spend with our franchises continue to grow.
In the third quarter, our monthly active users grew by 27% year-over-year and the amount of time our communities spend playing Activision Blizzard's games grew by 23% year-over-year. Our audiences yet again locked nearly 3.5 billion hours of game play in the quarter, not including rapidly growing our spend spectating. You will hear more about our strategic initiatives at Investor Day later this week at BlizzCon, where you will also get to see some of the industry's most exciting eSports championships. We look forward to seeing you there.

Activision Publishing delivered another record quarter with record non-GAAP operating income, which at constant FX, was up by over 50% versus last year's Q3 performance. We also drove monthly active users up by 17% year-over-year, continue to have 3 of the top 5 next-generation games live to date and have the largest digital revenues in our history both in Q3 and year-to-date. Our results are due to our proven ability to turn great games into long-term franchises with large passionate communities. We strategically and methodically expanded our portfolio to include 3 such industry-leading franchises, each of which gamers enjoy playing year-round.
We've also just relaunched what we hope could become our fourth major franchise with Guitar Hero Live. We're only 2 weeks in, but early reception from fans and critics has been very positive. While sell-through comparisons to prior games from 5 years ago aren't exactly apples to apples, our current sell-through is significantly up versus each of the prior 2 Guitar Hero titles.
As you know, unlike past games, we also designed Guitar Hero Live to be a living platform to keep players engaged. And so far, people are responding well with average engagement per player reaching nearly 2 hours per day. The game has also been featured in a wide array of the most influential must-have holiday toy lists. All that said, it's still very early and we anticipate that this title will ramp towards the holiday, which is why we have over half of our marketing investment this year is still yet to come.
Moving on to Destiny. We launched the Taken King in September with our partners at Bungie to an extremely positive reception from fans and critics. Day 1 downloads broke Sony PS4 records. Day 1 engagements are the highest number of active players in Destiny's history. Daily player engagement is now well north of 3 hours per day and the Destiny community has now 20 million registered players -- 25 million registered players.
For new players, the Taken King, Legendary Edition gives new players the original Destiny game both expansion packs and the Taken King all for the same price as a regular console game. We've also successfully introduced great new content into the game, which allows our players to express themselves and personalize their experience, which is available via in-game purchases and it's caused a number of thriller dances in game to increase dramatically.
Onto Skylanders, which launched at the end of September with Skylanders SuperChargers, our first game featuring both vehicle and character toys. I said in our last call that we expect the competition to continue to increase in the toys-to-life category, which we invented, and it has. I also said we will continue to lead because we deliver the best games and the biggest innovations, and we are, with Skylanders remaining the biggest franchise in the toys-to-life category year-to-date.
SuperChargers and the addition of vehicles in the Skylanders have been positively received by both critics and fans. It's also one of our most engaging Skylanders games ever, more toys per player than last year. But even though SuperChargers sell-through is down year-on-year due to increased competition, we are investing in the holiday to maintain our leadership position and we're optimistic that we'll see category expansion in the holiday. The full game will once again be available on tablet and the first time on iPhone and Apple TV as well. As I mentioned on our last call, we are in development on a major new mobile initiative called Skylanders Battlecast, which brings cards to life in free-to-play card battle game. The game is looking great and we expect it to launch in 2016.
Last but not least, Call Of Duty. The year so far has been phenomenal for the franchise with revenues up double-digit percentages both this quarter and quarter-to-date. The over performance has been driven by: one, higher advanced warfare selling; two, deeper engagement from our community, driving up performance on Season Pass, DLC, and the new consumable microtransaction feature Supply Drops; and three, strong catalog sales of Black Ops, which have ramped with consumer anticipation for Black Ops III. In fact, monthly active users for Black Ops II grew quarter-over-quarter again to a new record of nearly 12 million monthly active users, and unprecedented level of engagement for a game that is now 3 years old and only available on old-gen.
This brings to our most anticipated launch of the year, Call Of Duty Black Ops III. We couldn't be more excited about the launch this Friday. We have strong momentum indicated by a number of factors but just to name a few, the growing engagement around the past Black Ops titles, the significant year-on-year lift in pre-orders, consumer sentiment around our marketing assets, which is more positive for Black Ops III than any Call of Duty title on record.
The great partnership with Sony across consumer trade and custom PS4 bundles and our ranking as Nielsen's #1 most anticipated title of the year. Even more importantly, we've got the game. It is simply awesome with innovations across single player, multiplayer, and of course, Zombies. Black Ops III has more content and more surprises packed inside than any game we've made to date. So in closing, we've had a great first 3 quarters built on innovative games that engage our passionate fans and the stage is set for a strong Q4. I look forward to seeing you and sharing more at Investor Day this Friday.
And now I'll turn the call over to my good friend, Mike, to discuss Blizzard."

We had significant activity across our franchises and our MAUs for the quarter were up 50% year-over-year. Blizzard continues to be well positioned for growth. We're operating more franchises on more platforms and in more regions than ever before. We have an exciting upcoming content to play and we're continuing to foster powerful connections with our community online, through our pro and amateur eSports programs and at live events like BlizzCon.
Hearthstone, in particular, had another great quarter, driven by the launch of The Grand Tournament expansion. Along with continued strength on mobile and continued strong performance in all markets, the new expansion helps push engagement for Hearthstone even in higher in Q3 than in Q2.
Year-over-year, engagement was up 77% leading to Hearthstone's highest ever quarterly revenue. In addition, we recently launched a fully localized version of Hearthstone in Japan. The game already had an established audience in Japan. So we were pleased to provide them as well as new players with a version that makes access even easier. Activity around Hearthstone eSports is also continuing to grow and drive excitement. Over the past few months, we concluded several tournaments leading into the world championship at BlizzCon.
For World of Warcraft this quarter, we released a key update, which helps maintain stability in the subscriber base and we're currently at work on the next update.
We also had very exciting news at Gamescom with the announcement of World of Warcraft: Legion, our next expansion. Players responded very positively, not only to the new features coming with the expansion but to the care we're putting into the content. In addition to hosting World of Warcraft, Arena Championship, we'll have more to share on Legion at BlizzCon this week.
On the StarCraft II front, excitement for Legacy of the Void, which will be sold as a standalone product launching on November 10, remains strong. In fact, prepurchases for Legacy of the Void have continued to outpace those for the previous release, Heart of the Swarm.
At the professional level, the StarCraft II World Championship Series competition has been intense and extremely fun to follow. I encourage everyone to tune in at BlizzCon or online for the final round. It's amazing to see some of the most skilled pro gamers in the world in action.
As for Diablo III, we were pleased that it continues to bring in new players in Q3. And in China, it passed the 2 million sales milestone. We released a huge well-received content update in the quarter. All together, we've added a ton of postlaunch content to Diablo III and this reflects our strong commitment to the game and to the community.
Heroes of the Storm also brings in -- brought in more players in Q3, driven in part by our Diablo-themed content series. While we are still in early days for the game, it's been great to see the ongoing enthusiasm and support from players as the community continues to come together. We held the regional championships for our Road to BlizzCon series, including the Americas Championship in Las Vegas and the European Championship in Prague over the past few months. These events feature teams with international followings across multiple games, which is exciting for the Heroes of the Storm community and for eSports as a whole. We're looking forward to seeing the winners of the regional championships face off at BlizzCon for the World Championship Title.
There is also a lot of ongoing excitement around Overwatch, which just started its beta test last week. We've already had more than 7 million players sign up to participate and that's not including China. We're keeping access limited in order to focus feedback, but we plan to periodically run stress test weekends around the world that will allow many more players to join in. We'll be sharing the latest Overwatch news at BlizzCon, so I hope you will tune in.
As you can tell, we're very excited about BlizzCon and all the eSports action taking place there this week. BlizzCon represents the depth and breadth of our portfolio and the height of eSports competition in our games. It's a massive undertaking and it wouldn't exist without the super passionate, highly engaged audience of Blizzard gamers around the world.
Tickets again sold out very quickly and we're using more of the Anaheim Convention Center than ever before to host the 25,000-plus live attendees. The BlizzCon virtual ticket is again available this year and viewers will have multiple channels for catching as much of the show as possible. We'll be broadcasting the opening ceremony and all the eSports events for free globally, and we're expecting the total audience to again number in the millions. You can tune in via blizzcon.com.
Duncan Jones will be there to talk about the Warcraft movie and he'll debut the commercial trailer during our opening ceremony. We're also happy to have Wil Wheaton hosting our community contest and Linkin Park will help close out the show on Saturday night. I look forward to seeing those of you, who will be attending and I encourage everyone else to follow the action online.
Thanks, and I'll turn the call back over to Dennis."
4222231,315899151,890194,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2015",2015-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike.

Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP measures, so please refer to our earnings release for full non-G",1040,"Thanks, Mike. I will now review our better-than-expected Q3 financial results and our raised outlook for Q4 and the full year 2015. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP measures, so please refer to our earnings release for full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations. For the quarter on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $990 million, up 31% year-over-year and operating margin of 20% and GAAP EPS of $0.17, up $0.09 versus our August guidance.
For the quarter on a non-GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.04 billion and operating margin of 24%, up 190 basis points year-over-year and EPS of $0.21. We outperformed our August guidance by $110 million on revenue and $0.07 on EPS. At constant FX, our year-to-date revenues are up 5% ahead of last year and EPS is 35% ahead of last year, despite the tougher comp with last year's Diablo III expansion and Destiny's full game launch.
Importantly, total digital revenues grew 38% year-over-year or 50% at constant FX to an all-time quarterly record of $697 million, a significant driver of that growth was sales from digital add-on content, which grew 60% year-over-year or 75% at constant FX.
Our digital full game downloads also grew 39% year-over-year or 48% at constant FX, largely driven by the Destiny expansion launch.
There are a few key franchise drivers worth highlighting. Hearthstone had its highest revenue quarter yet with the launch of its expansion, The Grand Tournament in August. Destiny's operating income grew by a double-digit percentage year-to-date on the back of the launch of The Taken King in September. Skylanders SuperChargers launched a great fan and critical reception that went into a more competitive landscape. Activision's Call of Duty and Blizzard's Diablo III and Heroes of the Storm continue to perform well and attract new players. And World of Warcraft subscribers stabilized at 5.5 million subs in the quarter. And note that this is the last quarter that we planned to provide the subscriber number as there are other metrics that are better indicators of the overall Blizzard business performance.
In terms of EBITDA. In Q3, we generated non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $275 million and $1.63 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Operating cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $1.36 billion, up 39% year-over-year and free cash flow was $1.25 billion, up 43% year-over-year.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of September 30, we had approximately $4.5 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $870 million was held domestically. We had total debt of $4.12 billion and net cash of approximately $400 million. We had no share repurchases in the quarter.
Turning to FX. Please note that as discussed on our prior earnings calls, the strong dollar has and will continue to be a headwind this year, as our international revenues are translated at lower rates than last year. In Q3, the year-over-year impact of the strengthening of the dollar was $85 million on revenue and $0.05 on EPS. Year-to-date, the year-over-year FX impact was $239 million on revenue and $0.16 on EPS.
Now let's turn to our outlook for Q4 and full year 2015. First for Q4 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.22 billion, product costs of 30% and operating expenses of 57%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $51 million, a GAAP tax rate of 39%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 753 million and EPS of $0.09. For Q4 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $2.15 billion, product costs of 25% and operating expenses of 35%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.82. Note that our guidance is at FX spot rates as laid out in the accompanying slides on our IR website.
Now to our full year 2015 numbers. For 2015, on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.53 billion, product costs of 24%, operating expenses of 49% and GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $201 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 22%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted shares of $750 million and GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.07. For 2015, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.65 billion, $50 million higher than our own August guidance, product costs of 24%, operating expenses of 44% and an operating margin of 32%. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 24%.
Once again, we are raising our full year EPS guidance now to $1.31. We are not fully passing through the entire $0.07 Q3 over performance largely due to 3 factors: the first, revenue pull forward on Destiny and Skylanders from Q4 into Q3, which had an impact of approximately $0.02; cost phasing and timing of expenses, which pushed into Q4 from Q3, which also was worth $0.02; and additional investments we'll be making in Q4 to build the installed base of players across our portfolio, which accounts for the other $0.02.
With the strong backend monetization we are seeing across our portfolio, we think these investments set us up well heading into next year. Importantly, we expect to end the year with more than half of our revenues coming from digital channels, up double-digit percentage points in aggregate from last year.
So in summary, strong engagement and recurring digital monetization trends continue to drive our financial results. Along with these positive digital tailwinds, our strategic investments and new franchises, platforms and geographies are paying off as shown by our year-to-date results. And going forward with King's franchises in our portfolio, we feel that our strategic growth opportunities across platforms, genres, business models, audience demographics and geographies are more promising than ever. We couldn't be more excited to welcome King and their talented employees into the fold and look forward to taking advantage of the great mutual opportunities we have in front of us.
Lastly, we look forward to seeing many of you in person, this Friday at Investor Day at the start of BlizzCon, to tell you more about the exciting times ahead. And for those of you, who can't attend in person, you can watch the live stream from our IR website. Thanks, again. And now we'll open up the call for questions."

And when you look at 196 countries being served by King's footprint and the network of over 400 million players, our intellectual property that goes back to 1980, we really thought that there was a great opportunity. And you now see mobile as a $36 billion market that's growing faster than almost any category. I think the most important thing though was that we thought that creatively, we could see sustained franchises that will have perpetual value, where we could continuously put our best creative foot forward."

As far as any shifts in strategy, I don't have any announcements today, but I think we have a lot of options at our disposal. And the reason for that, of course, is that we have such great engagement with this game. As I said, we're seeing average player times of 3 hours per day, which is really an astounding figure. And beyond that, we're also bringing in new players. I think our Legendary Edition going into the holiday gives players the best time ever to jump into the Destiny universe, because you get the original Destiny game, both the expansion packs and The Taken King for the price of a regular console game.

We have a lot of exciting news to share with you. First, our proposed acquisition of King, then Activision Blizzard third quarter earnings results, followed by Q&A.
I'd like to remind everyone that during this call, we will be making statements that are not historical facts. These are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include comments about our plans and expectations regarding Activision Blizzard's pending acquisition of King Digital Entertainment as well as our comments about our outlook and other future plans and expectations that we'll provide during the earnings report portion of this call.
A number of important factors could cause actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements, including the factors indicated on the slide that is showing and those discussed in the Risk Factors section of Activision Blizzard's and King Digital Entertainment's SEC filings.
In particular, all of our statements with respect to the expected impact of the acquisition are subject to the risk that the acquisition may not be completed or may not be completed on the expected timeline.
The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available to Activision Blizzard and King Digital Entertainment as of the date of this presentation. And while we believe them to be true, they may ultimately prove to be incorrect. The companies undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today, November 3, 2015, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
I would like to note that Activision Blizzard prepares its financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP and King Digital Entertainment prepares its financial information in accordance with IFRS, as issued by the IASB. Certain numbers we will be presenting today will be made on a non-GAAP basis for Activision Blizzard and on a non-IFRS basis for King Digital Entertainment. We refer to these measures as non-GAAP measures. Please refer to our Rule 2.5 announcement, which is available at activisionblizzard.acquisitionoffer.com and Activision Blizzard's earnings release, which is posted on activisionblizzard.com, for the applicable reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and further explanation.
There are also 2 PowerPoint overviews, one with respect to the deal and one with respect to Activision Blizzard's Q3 results, which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted to the websites following the call.
In addition, we will also be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results and a one-page summary. Please note, because this is an Irish public company deal, there are certain limits on what we can say, specifically our statements must be limited to matters disclosed in the Rule 2.5 announcement, which was released last night and we won't be able to go beyond what is presented in that document.
Irish law also plays a certain limitations on what are deemed to be profit forecasts, so we are more limited in what we can say about future prospects.
Now speaking on the call today will be Bobby Kotick, our CEO; Thomas Tippl, our COO; Dennis Durkin, our CFO; and Riccardo Zacconi, CEO and Co-Founder of King Digital Entertainment. Later, we will be joined by Eric Hirshberg and Mike Morhaime to review Activision Blizzard's quarterly over performance.
And now I would like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick."
4222231,315899151,890468,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2015",2015-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Amrita.

Over the last 25 years, we've demonstrated a consistent ability to identify opportunities to serve and support our audiences and deliver superior value to our shareholders. We're disciplined, deliberate and methodical whether in the developments of new franchises, entering new segments and geographies and perhaps most importantly identifying transactions with great opportunity for shareholder value creation.
With respect to the latter, we've had very positive results and track records over the last 25 years, because we care deeply about how we allocate our capital and prioritize our opportunities. The way we considered King is consistent with our proven history of evaluating acquisition opportunities. King operates in a rapidly growing segment. They have a truly world-class management team, exceptional game development talent and great commercial instincts.
The transaction is accretive, brings new audiences and the King corporate DNA is oriented towards great game-making with commercial potential. When we merged with Blizzard Entertainment, we found the right partner with extraordinary leadership. And when others dismissed the sustainability of Blizzard's incredible capacity for innovation, we were certain patience would be rewarded, and it has. We see a lot of the same characteristics today in King.
We think now is the right time to enter mobile gaming in a meaningful way. Widespread mobile access around the world has opened up significant demand for engaging fun content that players can enjoy anytime, anywhere. By acquiring King, which has a proven ability to turn its games into iconic franchises, we will be a participant in the fastest-growing segment in gaming, a category that today is estimated to be $36 billion. It's still extremely fragmented, and we believe has great promise for the future.
We also believe King's management team, including Riccardo, Sebastian and Stephane are some of the most talented executives in the game industry. We've long admired their talents. And after spending a lot of time over the last 3 years getting to know the King team, we realized how truly special their company is. They have over 1,600 incredibly talented people, committed to a community of more than 450 million monthly active users.
Acquiring King will solidify Activision Blizzard's position as the world leader in interactive entertainment, positioning the combined company for growth across platforms, audiences, genres and business models. Combining Activision Blizzard's portfolio of some of the very best interactive entertainment franchises on the console and PC with King's leading mobile titles, will create a world-class portfolio of games with strong, enduring appeal to a wide range of demographics and audiences, along with leadership positions across key platforms.
The #1 console franchise with Call of Duty, the #1 PC franchise with World of Warcraft and now, 2 of the top 5 highest grossing mobile games. We'll have one of the largest entertainment networks in the world with over 0.5 billion monthly active users, immediately opening up meaningful opportunities to grow and cross-promote content to provide enhanced offerings to our collective players, while expanding into untapped geographies. The combined company will have diversified capabilities across business models like subscription, upfront purchase, free-to-play and microtransaction.
Through our world-class properties and enhanced capabilities across segments and business models, we'll be able to diversify our revenue streams, enhancing our position as the most profitable interactive entertainment company in the world. The result is a transaction that will be accretive to estimated 2016 non-GAAP EPS estimates by approximately 30%. I couldn't be more excited to welcome King into the Activision Blizzard family, and now Thomas will share with you the specifics of the transaction."

Under the proposed transaction, Activision Blizzard will acquire all of the outstanding shares of King for $18 in cash per share for a total equity value of $5.9 billion or an enterprise value of $5 billion, representing a multiple of approximately 6.4x King's estimated 2015 adjusted EBITDA.
This transaction will be financed through a mix of offshore cash and fully committed debt financing. This will enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet and conservative leverage.
Following today's announcement, our path to completion is subject to approval by the Irish High Court, the U.S., E.U. and other antitrust regulators as well as other customary closing conditions. In addition, the transaction is subject to a vote by King's shareholders. APEX and King management shareholders have committed to voting their shares in favor of the transaction. All in all, we expect the transaction to close by spring 2016.
Once the transaction closes, King will operate as an independent operating unit of Activision Blizzard, similar to how Blizzard Entertainment operates. We have an excellent track record of integrating with minimal disruption and in a way that maintains the organization's culture, creative independence and ability to really thrive. As Bobby said earlier, King's management team has been integral to their success. Riccardo, Sebastian and Stephane will continue to lead the business and they've all signed long-term contractual commitments.
We think this acquisition is an exciting opportunity for everyone connected to Activision Blizzard and to King. This is a very compelling transaction from a financial perspective. Together, we'll have more diversified and recurring revenues, a strong balance sheet and strong liquidity. King's shareholders will also be getting a 20%-plus premium to the recent share price and liquidity. And we'll be able to speed up our ability to capitalize on meaningful long-term growth opportunities. We'll reach more players across more audiences and expand our presence in fast-growing regions such as Asia.
One of the most exciting things about this deal is what it means for our communities of players. By putting these 2 companies together, we'll have greater capabilities and expertise to enrich the player experience, an expanded network to reach players in virtually every country across the world and more resources to amaze and delight our players. We want to be wherever our players are. Whether they are at home on consoles or PCs, or out on their smartphones and tablets and this deal enhances our ability to do just that.
I also want to talk to you about employee culture. It's something that's incredibly important at Activision Blizzard and something we really think sets us apart. We have a track record of attracting and retaining top talent. This is incredibly important in the entertainment and technology industries, and one of the reasons we are able to do this is because we have deep respect for the creative process. We are the destination for the best talent in the business. Activision Blizzard's commitment to innovation, talent development and the creative process is 100% mirrored in King's culture.
For Activision Blizzard's debt holders, this transaction accelerates the promising path we are already on to build out our diverse portfolio, grow our predictable recurring revenue streams and generate strong cash flows, while maintaining strong liquidity. This financial profile puts us on the path for near-term deleveraging and further supports our already investment-grade financial profile. In fact, last night, Moody's upgraded all of the company's debt ratings to investment grade upon announcement of the deal.
King and Activision Blizzard are a great fit for all stakeholders and we are excited about what we'll be able to accomplish together. As Bobby mentioned earlier, our long-term strategy has been focused on innovating our new high-growth platforms, expanding our franchise portfolio with captivating and original new intellectual property and building our capabilities to create compelling offerings to our diverse player base across genres, platforms, business models and geographies. You will hear more during the second half of this call about our strong results, which are further evidence that our strategy is working.
And this transaction meaningfully accelerates that growth strategy by providing Activision Blizzard with a leadership position in mobile gaming, the largest and fastest-growing segment of interactive entertainment. It is expected to grow by more than 50% from $36 billion in 2015 to $55 billion by 2019. Mobile franchises are now reaching results similar to established console franchises. King, in particular, has shown repeat success with multiple titles and the leading franchises demonstrate a track record of continued success.
The combined company will have a world-class portfolio with some of the world's most iconic franchises in the entertainment industry across key platforms. Activision Blizzard knows how to create, develop and sustain our portfolio of titles and turn them into iconic franchises with long-lasting appeal and deep engagement. The names you see on the slide are some of the most successful interactive entertainment franchises in the world. What attracted us to King is that in similar ways to us, they have a proven ability to extend the success of their core titles, developing them into proven franchises.
Together, we'll be able to apply our highly complementary strengths, assets and operational expertise to drive deep, year-round engagement and digital revenue streams and build upon our proven development models to bring new content to more audiences across genres.
Our combined audience will have more than 0.5 billion monthly active users, making it one of the largest entertainment networks in the world. Our audience includes a broad diversity of demographics in almost every country around the globe. The ability to cross promote our industry-leading franchises across this highly engaged network is incredibly exciting. As part of our growth strategy, not only do we have some of the leading owned intellectual property in interactive entertainment, but we've been building capabilities across platforms, genres, business models and geographies.
It is clear that our acquisition of King provides important, highly complementary capabilities in key areas: in mobile, free-to-play and the ability to reach casual gamers and emerging geographies. Our capabilities and infrastructure have never been better and we've never been in such a great position to deliver content to any audience on any platform. That is an exciting prospect for not only our fans, but for our employees and for our shareholders as well.
Now let me introduce Riccardo, who will walk you through King's business."

I would like to share a little about King, especially for those who are [indiscernible] company. King is a leader in mobile gaming and has been developing games since 2003. We have created a strong organization with 12 studios in Europe",767,"Thank you, Thomas. I would like to share a little about King, especially for those who are [indiscernible] company. King is a leader in mobile gaming and has been developing games since 2003. We have created a strong organization with 12 studios in Europe, Asia and the U.S. that are driven by dedicated world-class talent. King has a portfolio of best-in-class franchises that includes the top grossing games within their subgenres. Our 4 franchises: Candy Crush, Farm Heroes, Pet Rescue and Bubble Witch are category-leading brands. We operate them as a life service and continually give our players new highly engaging content by adding new levels, time-based live op and expansions with innovative modes of play.
We also launched new games within our existing franchises. Candy Crush Soda Saga is our highly successful sister title to the original hit, Candy Crush Saga. We have seen that these efforts have transformed our games into true game franchises. In third quarter 2015, more than 3 years after the original launch of Candy Crush Saga, an average of 92 million people played Candy Crush games every day. The popularity of our games and success of our monetization and franchise strategy have translated to a leading position in the mobile gaming business.
We have had 2 of the top 5 grossing games on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in the U.S. for 3 consecutive quarters, and at least 3 of the top 15 grossing games for 7 consecutive quarters. We have built one of the largest networks of mobile game players with 474 million monthly active users in Q3, who played 1.4 billion games per day. Our network is a key asset for launching new games through cross promotion.
We are excited about what we bring to the combined company. We have a strong pipeline, which includes new franchise games and other new games to diversify our portfolio into new genres, which we have just begun with our first noncasual game launch. And though our company already has a strong presence globally, we see meaningful opportunities in key Asian markets. Our strength as a company is reflected in our robust financial profile with significant scale and profitability.
In the 12 months ended September 30, we generated $2.2 billion of gross bookings and $875 million of adjusted EBITDA for a 42% adjusted EBITDA margin. We have a highly cash generative business with $920 million of cash on our balance sheet. We think we can have the combined company win in mobile. We have one of the largest networks, not just for a gaming company, but across the mobile sector with 474 million monthly active users and 133 million daily active users in Q3.
We have a portfolio of best-in-class game franchises on mobile, which are top grossing in their respective subgenres and a multiyear plan to operate our franchises with 3 new games planned for launch by the end of 2016. In addition to our focus on our franchise business, our strategy is to leverage our reach and capabilities to enter new genres. We recently launched our first resource management game and expect to release our first mid-core title in 2016.
Through this transaction, I think that both King and Activision Blizzard will be able to better serve our players by leveraging our complementary strengths, assets and operational expertise. We also will have the ability to cross promote games, providing our players more opportunities to engage with our content. Activision Blizzard has a long history of building, maintaining and growing what I think are iconic and successful franchises, and I believe we can benefit from their experience.
Our third quarter performance reflects the continued strength of our business. Our preliminary third quarter 2015 results include gross bookings of $502 million, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $180 million for a 38% adjusted EBITDA margin. Our player metrics for the quarter, 474 million monthly active users, 330 million monthly unique users and 133 million daily active users underscore our massive player network.
Based on the timing of game releases and recent trends, King expects gross bookings in the fourth quarter to be between $475 million and $500 million. We look forward to sharing more with you about our third quarter performance during our earnings call tomorrow.
In closing, I think this deal makes sense because it makes us stronger in the industry, it brings together 2 world-class teams and it gives our shareholders an attractive liquidity event. And we look forward to working together with Activision Blizzard and I'm very excited."

We expect accretion to 2016 estimated non-GAAP revenues and earnings per share of approximately 30% based on IBES consensus estimates. The transaction is also significantly accretive to 2016 estimated free cash flow per share.
We'll be combining Activision Blizzard's trailing 12-month non-GAAP revenues of $4.7 billion with King's trailing 12-month adjusted revenues of $2.1 billion, and combining Activision Blizzard's adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion with King's $0.9 billion over the same period. Importantly, the accretion figures detailed in this presentation do not include potential synergies that could come from cross promotion and shared capabilities for the combined company.
Activision Blizzard's business today generates the bulk of its revenues from its high-performing console and PC businesses, which as we will discuss during our Q3 earnings report, continue to perform very well and are increasingly shifting to high-margin digital channels with increasingly long tails of player engagement and monetization.
King generates virtually all of its revenue from high-margin digital platforms with the vast majority of it on mobile. The industrial logic of combining these businesses, bringing leadership in gaming across PCs, consoles and mobile platforms is highlighted by the balanced post deal revenue mix of roughly 1/3 coming from each of these platforms. In addition, the combined company will be an online services business with roughly 2/3 of the combined revenue being delivered digitally.
One of the things we've learned from our Blizzard merger is that a broader IP portfolio across more platforms creates a diversified and highly profitable financial profile, which in turn provides us with more capital to reinvest in innovation and to deliver the great content that our fans expect.
And with the acquisition of King, we will now have some of the world's leading interactive entertainment franchises, not only on PC and console, but mobile as well.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and look at the sources and uses of capital as well as the combined capitalization of the company.
As mentioned earlier, the acquisition of King is an accretive use of Activision Blizzard's offshore cash. The transaction will be funded with $3.4 billion in offshore cash from our balance sheet along with $2.3 billion coming from fully committed term loan financing led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs and around $200 million of rollover unvested equity awards. The combined companies' capitalization will also maintain a conservative balance sheet with strong liquidity. Having a strong balance sheet with deep capital resources is very important to us and this transaction further diversifies and reinforces our financial profile.
And as Thomas mentioned, just last night, Moody's upgraded all of our debt rating to investment grade upon announcement of the deal, which is obviously great recognition for the progress we have made in the past 2 years since we've raised debt for the first time.
So in summary, Activision Blizzard's acquisition of King solidifies us as a world leader in interactive entertainment and positions us well for future growth opportunities. The transaction accelerates our current growth strategy, as it provides us with a leadership position in mobile gaming, the largest and fastest-growing gaming segment and it adds to our portfolio of iconic interactive entertainment franchises.
It is also highly accretive to earnings and free cash flow per share, while still providing King's shareholders with the premium and liquidity. And most importantly for the long-term growth prospects of our business, our acquisition of King brings with it a committed management team with a proven track record and talented employees with aligned objectives to drive innovation to better serve our player communities. So we couldn't be more excited than we are now to have Riccardo, Sebastian, Stephane and the entire King team as part of the Activision Blizzard family.
I will now turn the call back the Thomas to kick off our Q3 results discussion."

I will now turn to Activision Blizzard's earnings results for the third quarter of 2015. Our strong results reflect our strategic focus on expanding our franchise portfolio with innovative new intellectual property, broadening our reach by expanding on to new platforms and geographies and driving deeper engagement through regular content updates that delight our audiences.
We outperformed our Q3 targets on revenues, digital growth and earnings per share, and we are raising our full year outlook yet again. We project year-over-year revenue and EPS growth as constant FX. We'll continue to invest in our franchises through the holiday to build our installed base, given the increasing opportunity of backend revenues. This investment sets us up for continued organic growth in 2016 and beyond.
And of course, the addition of King to our portfolio presents additional opportunities for growth ahead. As we successfully transition from a large to a year-round engagement model, our audience base and the total amount of time people spend with our franchises continue to grow.
In the third quarter, our monthly active users grew by 27% year-over-year and the amount of time our communities spent playing Activision Blizzard's games grew by 23% year-over-year. Our audiences yet again logged nearly 3.5 billion hours of game play in the quarter, not including rapidly growing hours spent spectating. You will hear more about our strategic initiatives at Investor Day later this week at BlizzCon, where you will also get to see some of the industry's most exciting eSports championships. We look forward to seeing you there.
And now I will turn the call over to Eric to discuss Activision Publishing's results."

Activision Publishing delivered another record quarter with record non-GAAP operating income, which at constant FX, was up by over 50% versus last year's Q3 performance.

Activision Publishing delivered another record quarter with record non-GAAP operating income, which at constant FX, was up by over 50% versus last year's Q3 performance. We also drove monthly active users up by 17% year-over-year, continued to have 3 of the top 5 next-generation games live to date and have the largest digital revenues in our history both in Q3 and year-to-date. Our results are due to our proven ability to turn great games into long-term franchises with large passionate communities. We've strategically and methodically expanded our portfolio to include 3 such industry-leading franchises, each of which gamers enjoy playing year-round.
We've also just relaunched what we hope could become our fourth major franchise with Guitar Hero Live. We're only 2 weeks in, but early reception from fans and critics has been very positive. While sell-through comparisons to prior games from 5 years ago aren't exactly apples to apples, our current sell-through is significantly up versus each of the prior 2 Guitar Hero titles.
As you know, unlike past games, we also designed Guitar Hero Live to be a living platform to keep players engaged. And so far, people are responding well, with average engagement per player reaching nearly 2 hours per day. The game has also been featured in a wide array of the most influential must-have holiday toy lists. All that said, it's still very early and we anticipate that this title will ramp towards the holiday, which is why we have over half of our marketing investment this year, still yet to come.
Moving on to Destiny. We launched the Taken King in September with our partners at Bungie to an extremely positive reception from fans and critics. Day 1 downloads broke Sony PS4 records. Day 1 engagements saw the highest number of active players in Destiny's history. Daily player engagement is now well north of 3 hours per day and the Destiny community has now 20 million registered players -- 25 million registered players.
For new players, the Taken King, Legendary Edition gives new players the original Destiny game, both expansion packs and the Taken King all for the same price as a regular console game. We've also successfully introduced great new content into the game, which allows our players to express themselves and personalize their experience, which is available via in-game purchases and it's caused the number of Thriller dances in game to increase dramatically.
Onto Skylanders, which launched at the end of September with Skylanders SuperChargers, our first game featuring both vehicle and character toys. I said on our last call that we expected competition to continue to increase in the toys-to-life category, which we invented, and it has. I also said we will continue to lead because we deliver the best games and the biggest innovations, and we are, with Skylanders remaining the biggest franchise in the toys-to-life category year-to-date.
SuperChargers and the addition of vehicles into Skylanders have been positively received by both critics and fans. It's also one of our most engaging Skylanders games ever, with more toys per player than last year. So even though SuperChargers sell-through is down year-on-year due to increased competition, we are investing in the holiday to maintain our leadership position and we're optimistic that we'll see category expansion in the holiday. The full game will once again be available on tablet and for the first time on iPhone and Apple TV as well. As I mentioned on our last call, we are in development on a major new mobile initiative called Skylanders Battlecast, which brings cards to life in free-to-play card battle game. The game is looking great and we expect it to launch in 2016.
Last but not least, Call Of Duty. The year so far has been phenomenal for the franchise with revenues up double-digit percentages both this quarter and year-to-date. The over performance has been driven by: one, higher advanced warfare selling; two, deeper engagement from our community, driving up performance on Season Pass, DLC, and the new consumable microtransaction feature Supply Drops; and three, strong catalog sales of Black Ops, which have ramped with consumer anticipation for Black Ops III. In fact, monthly active users for Black Ops II grew quarter-over-quarter again to a new record of nearly 12 million monthly active users, and unprecedented level of engagement for a game that is now 3 years old and only available on old-gen.
This brings to our most anticipated launch of the year, Call Of Duty Black Ops III. We couldn't be more excited about the launch this Friday. We have strong momentum indicated by a number of factors but just to name a few, the growing engagement around the past Black Ops titles, the significant year-on-year lift in pre-orders, consumer sentiment around our marketing assets, which is more positive for Black Ops III than any Call of Duty title on record.
The great partnership with Sony across consumer trade and custom PS4 bundles and our ranking as Nielsen's #1 most anticipated title of the year. Even more importantly, we've got the game. It is simply awesome with innovations across single player, multiplayer, and of course, Zombies, Black Ops III has more content and more surprises packed inside than any game we've made to date. So in closing, we've had a great first 3 quarters built on innovative games that engage our passionate fans and the stage is set for a strong Q4. I look forward to seeing you and sharing more at Investor Day this Friday.
And now I'll turn the call over to my good friend, Mike, to discuss Blizzard."

We had significant activity across our franchises and our MAUs for the quarter were up 50% year-over-year. Blizzard continues to be well positioned for growth. We're operating more franchises on more platforms and in more regions than ever before. We have an exciting upcoming content slate and we're continuing to foster powerful connections with our community online, through our pro and amateur eSports programs and at live events like BlizzCon.
Hearthstone, in particular, had another great quarter, driven by the launch of The Grand Tournament expansion. Along with continued strength on mobile and continued strong performance in all markets, the new expansion helps push engagement for Hearthstone even higher in Q3 than in Q2.
Year-over-year, engagement was up 77% leading to Hearthstone's highest ever quarterly revenue. In addition, we recently launched a fully localized version of Hearthstone in Japan. The game already had an established audience in Japan. So we were pleased to provide them, as well as new players, with a version that makes access even easier. Activity around Hearthstone eSports is also continuing to grow and drive excitement. Over the past few months, we concluded several tournaments feeding into the world championship at BlizzCon.
For World of Warcraft this quarter, we released a key update, which helps maintain stability in the subscriber base and we're currently at work on the next update.
We also had very exciting news at Gamescom with the announcement of World of Warcraft: Legion, our next expansion. Players responded very positively, not only to the new features coming with the expansion, but to the care we're putting into the content. In addition to hosting the World of Warcraft, Arena Championship, we'll have more to share on Legion at BlizzCon this week.
On the StarCraft II front, excitement for Legacy of the Void, which will be sold as a standalone product launching on November 10, remains strong. In fact, prepurchases for Legacy of the Void have continued to outpace those for the previous release, Heart of the Swarm.
At the professional level, the StarCraft II World Championship Series competition has been intense and extremely fun to follow. I encourage everyone to tune in at BlizzCon or online for the final round. It's amazing to see some of the most skilled pro gamers in the world in action.
As for Diablo III, we were pleased that it continued to bring in new players in Q3. And in China, it passed the 2 million sales milestone. We released a huge well-received content update in the quarter. All together, we've added a ton of postlaunch content to Diablo III and this reflects our strong commitment to the game and to the community.
Heroes of the Storm also brings in -- brought in more players in Q3, driven in part by our Diablo-themed content series. While we are still in the early days for the game, it's been great to see the ongoing enthusiasm and support from players as the community continues to come together. We held the regional championships for our Road to BlizzCon series, including the Americas Championship in Las Vegas and the European Championship in Prague over the past few months. These events feature teams with international followings across multiple games, which is exciting for the Heroes of the Storm community and for eSports as a whole. We're looking forward to seeing the winners of the regional championships face off at BlizzCon for the World Championship Title.
There is also a lot of ongoing excitement around Overwatch, which just started its beta test last week. We've already had more than 7 million players sign up to participate and that's not including China. We're keeping access limited in order to focus feedback, but we plan to periodically run stress test weekends around the world that will allow many more players to join in. We'll be sharing the latest Overwatch news at BlizzCon, so I hope you will tune in.
As you can tell, we're very excited about BlizzCon and all the eSports action taking place there this week. BlizzCon represents the depth and breadth of our portfolio and the height of eSports competition in our games. It's a massive undertaking and it wouldn't exist without the super passionate, highly engaged audience of Blizzard gamers around the world.
Tickets again sold out very quickly and we're using more of the Anaheim Convention Center than ever before to host the 25,000-plus live attendees. The BlizzCon virtual ticket is again available this year and viewers will have multiple channels for catching as much of the show as possible. We'll be broadcasting the opening ceremony and all the eSports events for free globally, and we're expecting the total audience to again number in the millions. You can tune in via blizzcon.com.
Duncan Jones will be there to talk about the Warcraft movie and he'll debut the commercial trailer during our opening ceremony. We're also happy to have Wil Wheaton hosting our community contest and Linkin Park will help close out the show on Saturday night. I look forward to seeing those of you, who will be attending and I encourage everyone else to follow the action online.
Thanks, and I'll turn the call back over to Dennis."
4222231,315899151,890468,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2015",2015-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike.

I will now review our better-than-expected Q3 financial results and our raised outlook for Q4 and the full year 2015. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP measures, so please refer to our earnings release for full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations. For the quarter on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $990 million, up 31% year-over-year and operating margin of 20% and GAAP EPS of $0.17, up $0.09 versus our August guidance.
For the quarter on a non-GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.04 billion and operating margin of 24%, up 190 basis points year-over-year and EPS of $0.21. We outperformed our August guidance by $110 million on revenue and $0.07 on EPS. At constant FX, our year-to-date revenues are up 5% ahead of last year and EPS is 35% ahead of last year, despite the tougher comp with last year's Diablo III expansion and Destiny's full game launch.
Importantly, total digital revenues grew 38% year-over-year or 50% at constant FX to an all-time quarterly record of $697 million, a significant driver of that growth was sales from digital add-on content, which grew 60% year-over-year or 75% at constant FX.
Our digital full game downloads also grew 39% year-over-year or 48% at constant FX, largely driven by the Destiny expansion launch.
There are a few key franchise drivers worth highlighting. Hearthstone had its highest revenue quarter yet with the launch of its expansion, The Grand Tournament in August. Destiny's operating income grew by a double-digit percentage year-to-date on the back of the launch of The Taken King in September. Skylanders SuperChargers launched to great fan and critical reception though into a more competitive landscape. Activision's Call of Duty and Blizzard's Diablo III and Heroes of the Storm continued to perform well and attract new players. And World of Warcraft subscribers stabilized at 5.5 million subs in the quarter. And note that this is the last quarter that we plan to provide the subscriber number as there are other metrics that are better indicators of the overall Blizzard business performance.
In terms of EBITDA. In Q3, we generated non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $275 million and $1.63 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Operating cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $1.36 billion, up 39% year-over-year and free cash flow was $1.25 billion, up 43% year-over-year.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of September 30, we had approximately $4.5 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $870 million was held domestically. We had total debt of $4.12 billion and net cash of approximately $400 million. We had no share repurchases in the quarter.
Turning to FX. Please note that as discussed on our prior earnings calls, the strong dollar has and will continue to be a headwind this year, as our international revenues are translated at lower rates than last year. In Q3, the year-over-year impact of the strengthening of the dollar was $85 million on revenue and $0.05 on EPS. Year-to-date, the year-over-year FX impact was $239 million on revenue and $0.16 on EPS.
Now let's turn to our outlook for Q4 and full year 2015. First for Q4 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.22 billion, product costs of 30% and operating expenses of 57%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $51 million, a GAAP tax rate of 39%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 753 million and EPS of $0.09. For Q4 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $2.15 billion, product costs of 25% and operating expenses of 35%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.82. Note that our guidance is at FX spot rates as laid out in the accompanying slides on our IR website.
Now to our full year 2015 numbers. For 2015, on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.53 billion, product costs of 24%, operating expenses of 49% and GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $201 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 22%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted shares of $750 million and GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.07. For 2015, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.65 billion, $50 million higher than our own August guidance, product costs of 24%, operating expenses of 44% and an operating margin of 32%. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 24%.
Once again, we are raising our full year EPS guidance now to $1.31. We are not fully passing through the entire $0.07 Q3 over performance largely due to 3 factors: the first, revenue pull forward on Destiny and Skylanders from Q4 into Q3, which had an impact of approximately $0.02; cost phasing and timing of expenses, which pushed into Q4 from Q3, which also was worth $0.02; and additional investments we'll be making in Q4 to build the installed base of players across our portfolio, which accounts for the other $0.02.
With the strong backend monetization we are seeing across our portfolio, we think these investments set us up well heading into next year. Importantly, we expect to end the year with more than half of our revenues coming from digital channels, up double-digit percentage points in aggregate from last year.
So in summary, strong engagement and recurring digital monetization trends continue to drive our financial results. Along with these positive digital tailwinds, our strategic investments in new franchises, platforms and geographies are paying off as shown by our year-to-date results. And going forward with King's franchises in our portfolio, we feel that our strategic growth opportunities across platforms, genres, business models, audience demographics and geographies are more promising than ever. We couldn't be more excited to welcome King and their talented employees into the fold and look forward to taking advantage of the great mutual opportunities we have in front of us.
Lastly, we look forward to seeing many of you in person, this Friday at Investor Day at the start of BlizzCon, to tell you more about the exciting times ahead. And for those of you, who can't attend in person, you can watch the live stream from our IR website. Thanks, again. And now we'll open up the call for questions."

One of the big benefits, I think they'll get is plugging into the great framework that we've created for long-term strategic planning and that includes capital allocation. Remember, King generates a lot of operating profit. In fact, more operating profit than virtually any other game company that has ever existed. And so they'll be able to continue to generate that operating profit and invest that cash flow into opportunities."

I'd like to remind everyone that during this call, we will be making statements that are not historical facts.

These forward-looking statements include comments about our plans and expectations regarding Activision Blizzard's pending acquisition of King Digital Entertainment as well as our comments about our outlook and other future plans and expectations that we'll provide during the earnings report portion of this call.
A number of important factors could cause actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements, including the factors indicated on the slide that is showing and those discussed in the Risk Factors section of Activision Blizzard's and King Digital Entertainment's SEC filings.
In particular, all of our statements with respect to the expected impact of the acquisition are subject to the risk that the acquisition may not be completed or may not be completed on the expected timeline.
The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available to Activision Blizzard and King Digital Entertainment as of the date of this presentation. And while we believe them to be true, they may ultimately prove to be incorrect. The companies undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today, November 3, 2015, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
I would like to note that Activision Blizzard prepares its financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP and King Digital Entertainment prepares its financial information in accordance with IFRS, as issued by the IASB. Certain numbers we will be presenting today will be made on a non-GAAP basis for Activision Blizzard and on a non-IFRS basis for King Digital Entertainment. We refer to these measures as non-GAAP measures. Please refer to our Rule 2.5 announcement, which is available at activisionblizzard.acquisitionoffer.com and Activision Blizzard's earnings release, which is posted on activisionblizzard.com, for the applicable reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and further explanation.
There are also 2 PowerPoint overviews, one with respect to the deal and one with respect to Activision Blizzard's Q3 results, which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted to the websites following the call.
In addition, we will also be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results and a one-page summary. Please note, because this is an Irish public company deal, there are certain limits on what we can say, specifically our statements must be limited to matters disclosed in the Rule 2.5 announcement, which was released last night and we won't be able to go beyond what is presented in that document.
Irish law also plays a certain limitations on what are deemed to be profit forecasts, so we are more limited in what we can say about future prospects.
Now speaking on the call today will be Bobby Kotick, our CEO; Thomas Tippl, our COO; Dennis Durkin, our CFO; and Riccardo Zacconi, CEO and Co-Founder of King Digital Entertainment. Later, we will be joined by Eric Hirshberg and Mike Morhaime to review Activision Blizzard's quarterly over performance.

Over the last 25 years, we've demonstrated a consistent ability to identify opportunities to serve and support our audiences and deliver superior value to our shareholders. We're disciplined, deliberate and methodical whether in the developments of new franchises, entering new segments and geographies and perhaps most importantly identifying transactions with great opportunity for shareholder value creation.
With respect to the latter, we've had very positive results and track records over the last 25 years, because we care deeply about how we allocate our capital and prioritize our opportunities. The way we considered King is consistent with our proven history of evaluating acquisition opportunities. King operates in a rapidly growing segment. They have a truly world-class management team, exceptional game development talent and great commercial instincts.
The transaction is accretive, brings new audiences and the King corporate DNA is oriented towards great game-making with commercial potential. When we merged with Blizzard Entertainment, we found the right partner with extraordinary leadership. And when others dismissed the sustainability of Blizzard's incredible capacity for innovation, we were certain patience would be rewarded, and it has. We see a lot of the same characteristics today in King.
We think now is the right time to enter mobile gaming in a meaningful way. Widespread mobile access around the world has opened up significant demand for engaging fun content that players can enjoy anytime, anywhere. By acquiring King, which has a proven ability to turn its games into iconic franchises, we will be a participant in the fastest-growing segment in gaming, a category that today is estimated to be $36 billion. It's still extremely fragmented, and we believe has great promise for the future.
We also believe King's management team, including Riccardo, Sebastian and Stephane are some of the most talented executives in the game industry. We've long admired their talents. And after spending a lot of time over the last 3 years getting to know the King team, we realized how truly special their company is. They have over 1,600 incredibly talented people, committed to a community of more than 450 million monthly active users.
Acquiring King will solidify Activision Blizzard's position as the world leader in interactive entertainment, positioning the combined company for growth across platforms, audiences, genres and business models. Combining Activision Blizzard's portfolio of some of the very best interactive entertainment franchises on the console and PC with King's leading mobile titles, will create a world-class portfolio of games with strong, enduring appeal to a wide range of demographics and audiences, along with leadership positions across key platforms.
The #1 console franchise with Call of Duty, the #1 PC franchise with World of Warcraft and now, 2 of the top 5 highest grossing mobile games. We'll have one of the largest entertainment networks in the world with over 0.5 billion monthly active users, immediately opening up meaningful opportunities to grow and cross-promote content to provide enhanced offerings to our collective players, while expanding into untapped geographies. The combined company will have diversified capabilities across business models like subscription, upfront purchase, free-to-play and microtransaction.
Through our world-class properties and enhanced capabilities across segments and business models, we'll be able to diversify our revenue streams, enhancing our position as the most profitable interactive entertainment company in the world. The result is a transaction that will be accretive to estimated 2016 non-GAAP EPS estimates by approximately 30%. I couldn't be more excited to welcome King into the Activision Blizzard family, and now Thomas will share with you the specifics of the transaction."

Under the proposed transaction, Activision Blizzard will acquire all of the outstanding shares of King for $18 in cash per share for a total equity value of $5.9 billion or an enterprise value of $5 billion, representing a multiple of approximately 6.4x King's estimated 2015 adjusted EBITDA.
This transaction will be financed through a mix of offshore cash and fully committed debt financing. This will enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet and conservative leverage.
Following today's announcement, our path to completion is subject to approval by the Irish High Court, the U.S., E.U. and other antitrust regulators as well as other customary closing conditions. In addition, the transaction is subject to a vote by King's shareholders. APEX and King management shareholders have committed to voting their shares in favor of the transaction. All in all, we expect the transaction to close by spring 2016.
Once the transaction closes, King will operate as an independent operating unit of Activision Blizzard, similar to how Blizzard Entertainment operates. We have an excellent track record of integrating with minimal disruption and in a way that maintains the organization's culture, creative independence and ability to really thrive. As Bobby said earlier, King's management team has been integral to their success. Riccardo, Sebastian and Stephane will continue to lead the business and they've all signed long-term contractual commitments.
We think this acquisition is an exciting opportunity for everyone connected to Activision Blizzard and to King. This is a very compelling transaction from a financial perspective. Together, we'll have more diversified and recurring revenues, a strong balance sheet and strong liquidity. King's shareholders will also be getting a 20%-plus premium to the recent share price and liquidity. And we'll be able to speed up our ability to capitalize on meaningful long-term growth opportunities. We'll reach more players across more audiences and expand our presence in fast-growing regions such as Asia.
One of the most exciting things about this deal is what it means for our communities of players. By putting these 2 companies together, we'll have greater capabilities and expertise to enrich the player experience, an expanded network to reach players in virtually every country across the world and more resources to amaze and delight our players. We want to be wherever our players are. Whether they are at home on consoles or PCs, or out on their smartphones and tablets and this deal enhances our ability to do just that.
I also want to talk to you about employee culture. It's something that's incredibly important at Activision Blizzard and something we really think sets us apart. We have a track record of attracting and retaining top talent. This is incredibly important in the entertainment and technology industries, and one of the reasons we are able to do this is because we have deep respect for the creative process. We are the destination for the best talent in the business. Activision Blizzard's commitment to innovation, talent development and the creative process is 100% mirrored in King's culture.
For Activision Blizzard's debt holders, this transaction accelerates the promising path we are already on to build out our diverse portfolio, grow our predictable recurring revenue streams and generate strong cash flows, while maintaining strong liquidity. This financial profile puts us on the path for near-term deleveraging and further supports our already investment-grade financial profile. In fact, last night, Moody's upgraded all of the company's debt ratings to investment grade upon announcement of the deal.
King and Activision Blizzard are a great fit for all stakeholders and we are excited about what we'll be able to accomplish together. As Bobby mentioned earlier, our long-term strategy has been focused on innovating our new high-growth platforms, expanding our franchise portfolio with captivating and original new intellectual property and building our capabilities to create compelling offerings to our diverse player base across genres, platforms, business models and geographies. You will hear more during the second half of this call about our strong results, which are further evidence that our strategy is working.
And this transaction meaningfully accelerates that growth strategy by providing Activision Blizzard with a leadership position in mobile gaming, the largest and fastest-growing segment of interactive entertainment. It is expected to grow by more than 50% from $36 billion in 2015 to $55 billion by 2019. Mobile franchises are now reaching results similar to established console franchises. King, in particular, has shown repeat success with multiple titles and the leading franchises demonstrate a track record of continued success.
The combined company will have a world-class portfolio with some of the world's most iconic franchises in the entertainment industry across key platforms. Activision Blizzard knows how to create, develop and sustain our portfolio of titles and turn them into iconic franchises with long-lasting appeal and deep engagement. The names you see on the slide are some of the most successful interactive entertainment franchises in the world. What attracted us to King is that in similar ways to us, they have a proven ability to extend the success of their core titles, developing them into proven franchises.
Together, we'll be able to apply our highly complementary strengths, assets and operational expertise to drive deep, year-round engagement and digital revenue streams and build upon our proven development models to bring new content to more audiences across genres.
Our combined audience will have more than 0.5 billion monthly active users, making it one of the largest entertainment networks in the world. Our audience includes a broad diversity of demographics in almost every country around the globe. The ability to cross promote our industry-leading franchises across this highly engaged network is incredibly exciting. As part of our growth strategy, not only do we have some of the leading owned intellectual property in interactive entertainment, but we've been building capabilities across platforms, genres, business models and geographies.
It is clear that our acquisition of King provides important, highly complementary capabilities in key areas: in mobile, free-to-play and the ability to reach casual gamers and emerging geographies. Our capabilities and infrastructure have never been better and we've never been in such a great position to deliver content to any audience on any platform. That is an exciting prospect for not only our fans, but for our employees and for our shareholders as well.
Now let me introduce Riccardo, who will walk you through King's business."

I would like to share a little about King, especially for those who are [indiscernible] company. King is a leader in mobile gaming and has been developing games since 2003. We have created a strong organization with 12 studios in Europe",767,"Thank you, Thomas. I would like to share a little about King, especially for those who are [indiscernible] company. King is a leader in mobile gaming and has been developing games since 2003. We have created a strong organization with 12 studios in Europe, Asia and the U.S. that are driven by dedicated world-class talent. King has a portfolio of best-in-class franchises that includes the top grossing games within their subgenres. Our 4 franchises: Candy Crush, Farm Heroes, Pet Rescue and Bubble Witch are category-leading brands. We operate them as a life service and continually give our players new highly engaging content by adding new levels, time-based live op and expansions with innovative modes of play.
We also launched new games within our existing franchises. Candy Crush Soda Saga is our highly successful sister title to the original hit, Candy Crush Saga. We have seen that these efforts have transformed our games into true game franchises. In third quarter 2015, more than 3 years after the original launch of Candy Crush Saga, an average of 92 million people played Candy Crush games every day. The popularity of our games and success of our monetization and franchise strategy have translated to a leading position in the mobile gaming business.
We have had 2 of the top 5 grossing games on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in the U.S. for 3 consecutive quarters, and at least 3 of the top 15 grossing games for 7 consecutive quarters. We have built one of the largest networks of mobile game players with 474 million monthly active users in Q3, who played 1.4 billion games per day. Our network is a key asset for launching new games through cross promotion.
We are excited about what we bring to the combined company. We have a strong pipeline, which includes new franchise games and other new games to diversify our portfolio into new genres, which we have just begun with our first noncasual game launch. And though our company already has a strong presence globally, we see meaningful opportunities in key Asian markets. Our strength as a company is reflected in our robust financial profile with significant scale and profitability.
In the 12 months ended September 30, we generated $2.2 billion of gross bookings and $875 million of adjusted EBITDA for a 42% adjusted EBITDA margin. We have a highly cash generative business with $920 million of cash on our balance sheet. We think we can have the combined company win in mobile. We have one of the largest networks, not just for a gaming company, but across the mobile sector with 474 million monthly active users and 133 million daily active users in Q3.
We have a portfolio of best-in-class game franchises on mobile, which are top grossing in their respective subgenres and a multiyear plan to operate our franchises with 3 new games planned for launch by the end of 2016. In addition to our focus on our franchise business, our strategy is to leverage our reach and capabilities to enter new genres. We recently launched our first resource management game and expect to release our first mid-core title in 2016.
Through this transaction, I think that both King and Activision Blizzard will be able to better serve our players by leveraging our complementary strengths, assets and operational expertise. We also will have the ability to cross promote games, providing our players more opportunities to engage with our content. Activision Blizzard has a long history of building, maintaining and growing what I think are iconic and successful franchises, and I believe we can benefit from their experience.
Our third quarter performance reflects the continued strength of our business. Our preliminary third quarter 2015 results include gross bookings of $502 million, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA for the period was $180 million for a 38% adjusted EBITDA margin. Our player metrics for the quarter, 474 million monthly active users, 330 million monthly unique users and 133 million daily active users underscore our massive player network.
Based on the timing of game releases and recent trends, King expects gross bookings in the fourth quarter to be between $475 million and $500 million. We look forward to sharing more with you about our third quarter performance during our earnings call tomorrow.
In closing, I think this deal makes sense because it makes us stronger in the industry, it brings together 2 world-class teams and it gives our shareholders an attractive liquidity event. And we look forward to working together with Activision Blizzard and I'm very excited."
4222231,315899151,892465,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2015",2015-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Riccardo. As Bobby, Thomas and Riccardo mentioned, we're incredibly excited to be combining the capabilities and portfolios of our companies together. This transaction enhances Activision Blizzard's current position as the most profitable, stand-a",674,"Thanks, Riccardo. As Bobby, Thomas and Riccardo mentioned, we're incredibly excited to be combining the capabilities and portfolios of our companies together. This transaction enhances Activision Blizzard's current position as the most profitable, stand-alone interactive entertainment company. We expect accretion to 2016 estimated non-GAAP revenues and earnings per share of approximately 30% based on IBES consensus estimates. The transaction is also significantly accretive to 2016 estimated free cash flow per share.
We'll be combining Activision Blizzard's trailing 12-month non-GAAP revenues of $4.7 billion with King's trailing 12-month adjusted revenues of $2.1 billion, and combining Activision Blizzard's adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion with King's $0.9 billion over the same period. Importantly, the accretion figures detailed in this presentation do not include potential synergies that could come from cross promotion and shared capabilities for the combined company.
Activision Blizzard's business today generates the bulk of its revenues from its high-performing console and PC businesses, which as we will discuss during our Q3 earnings report, continue to perform very well and are increasingly shifting to high-margin digital channels with increasingly long tails of player engagement and monetization.
King generates virtually all of its revenue from high-margin digital platforms with the vast majority of it on mobile. The industrial logic of combining these businesses, bringing leadership in gaming across PCs, consoles and mobile platforms is highlighted by the balanced post deal revenue mix of roughly 1/3 coming from each of these platforms. In addition, the combined company will be an online services business with roughly 2/3 of the combined revenue being delivered digitally.
One of the things we've learned from our Blizzard merger is that a broader IP portfolio across more platforms creates a diversified and highly profitable financial profile, which in turn provides us with more capital to reinvest in innovation and to deliver the great content that our fans expect.
And with the acquisition of King, we will now have some of the world's leading interactive entertainment franchises, not only on PC and console, but mobile as well.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and look at the sources and uses of capital as well as the combined capitalization of the company.
As mentioned earlier, the acquisition of King is an accretive use of Activision Blizzard's offshore cash. The transaction will be funded with $3.4 billion in offshore cash from our balance sheet along with $2.3 billion coming from fully committed term loan financing led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs and around $200 million of rollover unvested equity awards. The combined companies' capitalization will also maintain a conservative balance sheet with strong liquidity. Having a strong balance sheet with deep capital resources is very important to us and this transaction further diversifies and reinforces our financial profile.
And as Thomas mentioned, just last night, Moody's upgraded all of our debt rating to investment grade upon announcement of the deal, which is obviously great recognition for the progress we have made in the past 2 years since we've raised debt for the first time.
So in summary, Activision Blizzard's acquisition of King solidifies us as a world leader in interactive entertainment and positions us well for future growth opportunities. The transaction accelerates our current growth strategy, as it provides us with a leadership position in mobile gaming, the largest and fastest-growing gaming segment and it adds to our portfolio of iconic interactive entertainment franchises.
It is also highly accretive to earnings and free cash flow per share, while still providing King's shareholders with the premium and liquidity. And most importantly for the long-term growth prospects of our business, our acquisition of King brings with it a committed management team with a proven track record and talented employees with aligned objectives to drive innovation to better serve our player communities. So we couldn't be more excited than we are now to have Riccardo, Sebastian, Stephane and the entire King team as part of the Activision Blizzard family.
I will now turn the call back the Thomas to kick off our Q3 results discussion."

I will now turn to Activision Blizzard's earnings results for the third quarter of 2015. Our strong results reflect our strategic focus on expanding our franchise portfolio with innovative new intellectual property, broadening our reach",274,"Thank you, Dennis. I will now turn to Activision Blizzard's earnings results for the third quarter of 2015. Our strong results reflect our strategic focus on expanding our franchise portfolio with innovative new intellectual property, broadening our reach by expanding on to new platforms and geographies and driving deeper engagement through regular content updates that delight our audiences.
We outperformed our Q3 targets on revenues, digital growth and earnings per share, and we are raising our full year outlook yet again. We project year-over-year revenue and EPS growth as constant FX. We'll continue to invest in our franchises through the holiday to build our installed base, given the increasing opportunity of backend revenues. This investment sets us up for continued organic growth in 2016 and beyond.
And of course, the addition of King to our portfolio presents additional opportunities for growth ahead. As we successfully transition from a large to a year-round engagement model, our audience base and the total amount of time people spend with our franchises continue to grow.
In the third quarter, our monthly active users grew by 27% year-over-year and the amount of time our communities spent playing Activision Blizzard's games grew by 23% year-over-year. Our audiences yet again logged nearly 3.5 billion hours of game play in the quarter, not including rapidly growing hours spent spectating. You will hear more about our strategic initiatives at Investor Day later this week at BlizzCon, where you will also get to see some of the industry's most exciting eSports championships. We look forward to seeing you there.
And now I will turn the call over to Eric to discuss Activision Publishing's results."

Activision Publishing delivered another record quarter with record non-GAAP operating income, which at constant FX, was up by over 50% versus last year's Q3 performance. We also drove monthly active users up by 17% year-over-year, continue",932,"Thanks, Thomas. Activision Publishing delivered another record quarter with record non-GAAP operating income, which at constant FX, was up by over 50% versus last year's Q3 performance. We also drove monthly active users up by 17% year-over-year, continued to have 3 of the top 5 next-generation games live to date and have the largest digital revenues in our history both in Q3 and year-to-date. Our results are due to our proven ability to turn great games into long-term franchises with large passionate communities. We've strategically and methodically expanded our portfolio to include 3 such industry-leading franchises, each of which gamers enjoy playing year-round.
We've also just relaunched what we hope could become our fourth major franchise with Guitar Hero Live. We're only 2 weeks in, but early reception from fans and critics has been very positive. While sell-through comparisons to prior games from 5 years ago aren't exactly apples to apples, our current sell-through is significantly up versus each of the prior 2 Guitar Hero titles.
As you know, unlike past games, we also designed Guitar Hero Live to be a living platform to keep players engaged. And so far, people are responding well, with average engagement per player reaching nearly 2 hours per day. The game has also been featured in a wide array of the most influential must-have holiday toy lists. All that said, it's still very early and we anticipate that this title will ramp towards the holiday, which is why we have over half of our marketing investment this year, still yet to come.
Moving on to Destiny. We launched the Taken King in September with our partners at Bungie to an extremely positive reception from fans and critics. Day 1 downloads broke Sony PS4 records. Day 1 engagements saw the highest number of active players in Destiny's history. Daily player engagement is now well north of 3 hours per day and the Destiny community has now 20 million registered players -- 25 million registered players.
For new players, the Taken King, Legendary Edition gives new players the original Destiny game, both expansion packs and the Taken King all for the same price as a regular console game. We've also successfully introduced great new content into the game, which allows our players to express themselves and personalize their experience, which is available via in-game purchases and it's caused the number of Thriller dances in game to increase dramatically.
Onto Skylanders, which launched at the end of September with Skylanders SuperChargers, our first game featuring both vehicle and character toys. I said on our last call that we expected competition to continue to increase in the toys-to-life category, which we invented, and it has. I also said we will continue to lead because we deliver the best games and the biggest innovations, and we are, with Skylanders remaining the biggest franchise in the toys-to-life category year-to-date.
SuperChargers and the addition of vehicles into Skylanders have been positively received by both critics and fans. It's also one of our most engaging Skylanders games ever, with more toys per player than last year. So even though SuperChargers sell-through is down year-on-year due to increased competition, we are investing in the holiday to maintain our leadership position and we're optimistic that we'll see category expansion in the holiday. The full game will once again be available on tablet and for the first time on iPhone and Apple TV as well. As I mentioned on our last call, we are in development on a major new mobile initiative called Skylanders Battlecast, which brings cards to life in free-to-play card battle game. The game is looking great and we expect it to launch in 2016.
Last but not least, Call Of Duty. The year so far has been phenomenal for the franchise with revenues up double-digit percentages both this quarter and year-to-date. The over performance has been driven by: one, higher advanced warfare selling; two, deeper engagement from our community, driving up performance on Season Pass, DLC, and the new consumable microtransaction feature Supply Drops; and three, strong catalog sales of Black Ops, which have ramped with consumer anticipation for Black Ops III. In fact, monthly active users for Black Ops II grew quarter-over-quarter again to a new record of nearly 12 million monthly active users, and unprecedented level of engagement for a game that is now 3 years old and only available on old-gen.
This brings to our most anticipated launch of the year, Call Of Duty Black Ops III. We couldn't be more excited about the launch this Friday. We have strong momentum indicated by a number of factors but just to name a few, the growing engagement around the past Black Ops titles, the significant year-on-year lift in pre-orders, consumer sentiment around our marketing assets, which is more positive for Black Ops III than any Call of Duty title on record.
The great partnership with Sony across consumer trade and custom PS4 bundles and our ranking as Nielsen's #1 most anticipated title of the year. Even more importantly, we've got the game. It is simply awesome with innovations across single player, multiplayer, and of course, Zombies, Black Ops III has more content and more surprises packed inside than any game we've made to date. So in closing, we've had a great first 3 quarters built on innovative games that engage our passionate fans and the stage is set for a strong Q4. I look forward to seeing you and sharing more at Investor Day this Friday.
And now I'll turn the call over to my good friend, Mike, to discuss Blizzard."

We had significant activity across our franchises and our MAUs for the quarter were up 50% year-over-year. Blizzard continues to be well positioned for growth. We're operating more franchises on more platforms and in more regions than ever before. We have an exciting upcoming content slate and we're continuing to foster powerful connections with our community online, through our pro and amateur eSports programs and at live events like BlizzCon.
Hearthstone, in particular, had another great quarter, driven by the launch of The Grand Tournament expansion. Along with continued strength on mobile and continued strong performance in all markets, the new expansion helps push engagement for Hearthstone even higher in Q3 than in Q2.
Year-over-year, engagement was up 77% leading to Hearthstone's highest ever quarterly revenue. In addition, we recently launched a fully localized version of Hearthstone in Japan. The game already had an established audience in Japan. So we were pleased to provide them, as well as new players, with a version that makes access even easier. Activity around Hearthstone eSports is also continuing to grow and drive excitement. Over the past few months, we concluded several tournaments feeding into the world championship at BlizzCon.
For World of Warcraft this quarter, we released a key update, which helps maintain stability in the subscriber base and we're currently at work on the next update.
We also had very exciting news at Gamescom with the announcement of World of Warcraft: Legion, our next expansion. Players responded very positively, not only to the new features coming with the expansion, but to the care we're putting into the content. In addition to hosting the World of Warcraft, Arena Championship, we'll have more to share on Legion at BlizzCon this week.
On the StarCraft II front, excitement for Legacy of the Void, which will be sold as a standalone product launching on November 10, remains strong. In fact, prepurchases for Legacy of the Void have continued to outpace those for the previous release, Heart of the Swarm.
At the professional level, the StarCraft II World Championship Series competition has been intense and extremely fun to follow. I encourage everyone to tune in at BlizzCon or online for the final round. It's amazing to see some of the most skilled pro gamers in the world in action.
As for Diablo III, we were pleased that it continued to bring in new players in Q3. And in China, it passed the 2 million sales milestone. We released a huge well-received content update in the quarter. All together, we've added a ton of postlaunch content to Diablo III and this reflects our strong commitment to the game and to the community.
Heroes of the Storm also brings in -- brought in more players in Q3, driven in part by our Diablo-themed content series. While we are still in the early days for the game, it's been great to see the ongoing enthusiasm and support from players as the community continues to come together. We held the regional championships for our Road to BlizzCon series, including the Americas Championship in Las Vegas and the European Championship in Prague over the past few months. These events feature teams with international followings across multiple games, which is exciting for the Heroes of the Storm community and for eSports as a whole. We're looking forward to seeing the winners of the regional championships face off at BlizzCon for the World Championship Title.
There is also a lot of ongoing excitement around Overwatch, which just started its beta test last week. We've already had more than 7 million players sign up to participate and that's not including China. We're keeping access limited in order to focus feedback, but we plan to periodically run stress test weekends around the world that will allow many more players to join in. We'll be sharing the latest Overwatch news at BlizzCon, so I hope you will tune in.
As you can tell, we're very excited about BlizzCon and all the eSports action taking place there this week. BlizzCon represents the depth and breadth of our portfolio and the height of eSports competition in our games. It's a massive undertaking and it wouldn't exist without the super passionate, highly engaged audience of Blizzard gamers around the world.
Tickets again sold out very quickly and we're using more of the Anaheim Convention Center than ever before to host the 25,000-plus live attendees. The BlizzCon virtual ticket is again available this year and viewers will have multiple channels for catching as much of the show as possible. We'll be broadcasting the opening ceremony and all the eSports events for free globally, and we're expecting the total audience to again number in the millions. You can tune in via blizzcon.com.
Duncan Jones will be there to talk about the Warcraft movie and he'll debut the commercial trailer during our opening ceremony. We're also happy to have Wil Wheaton hosting our community contest and Linkin Park will help close out the show on Saturday night. I look forward to seeing those of you, who will be attending and I encourage everyone else to follow the action online.
Thanks, and I'll turn the call back over to Dennis."
4222231,315899151,892465,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2015",2015-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. I will now review our better-than-expected Q3 financial results and our raised outlook for Q4 and the full year 2015. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP measures, so please refer to our earnings release for full non-G",1039,"Thanks, Mike. I will now review our better-than-expected Q3 financial results and our raised outlook for Q4 and the full year 2015. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP measures, so please refer to our earnings release for full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations. For the quarter on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $990 million, up 31% year-over-year and operating margin of 20% and GAAP EPS of $0.17, up $0.09 versus our August guidance.
For the quarter on a non-GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.04 billion and operating margin of 24%, up 190 basis points year-over-year and EPS of $0.21. We outperformed our August guidance by $110 million on revenue and $0.07 on EPS. At constant FX, our year-to-date revenues are up 5% ahead of last year and EPS is 35% ahead of last year, despite the tougher comp with last year's Diablo III expansion and Destiny's full game launch.
Importantly, total digital revenues grew 38% year-over-year or 50% at constant FX to an all-time quarterly record of $697 million, a significant driver of that growth was sales from digital add-on content, which grew 60% year-over-year or 75% at constant FX.
Our digital full game downloads also grew 39% year-over-year or 48% at constant FX, largely driven by the Destiny expansion launch.
There are a few key franchise drivers worth highlighting. Hearthstone had its highest revenue quarter yet with the launch of its expansion, The Grand Tournament in August. Destiny's operating income grew by a double-digit percentage year-to-date on the back of the launch of The Taken King in September. Skylanders SuperChargers launched to great fan and critical reception though into a more competitive landscape. Activision's Call of Duty and Blizzard's Diablo III and Heroes of the Storm continued to perform well and attract new players. And World of Warcraft subscribers stabilized at 5.5 million subs in the quarter. And note that this is the last quarter that we plan to provide the subscriber number as there are other metrics that are better indicators of the overall Blizzard business performance.
In terms of EBITDA. In Q3, we generated non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $275 million and $1.63 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Operating cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $1.36 billion, up 39% year-over-year and free cash flow was $1.25 billion, up 43% year-over-year.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of September 30, we had approximately $4.5 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $870 million was held domestically. We had total debt of $4.12 billion and net cash of approximately $400 million. We had no share repurchases in the quarter.
Turning to FX. Please note that as discussed on our prior earnings calls, the strong dollar has and will continue to be a headwind this year, as our international revenues are translated at lower rates than last year. In Q3, the year-over-year impact of the strengthening of the dollar was $85 million on revenue and $0.05 on EPS. Year-to-date, the year-over-year FX impact was $239 million on revenue and $0.16 on EPS.
Now let's turn to our outlook for Q4 and full year 2015. First for Q4 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.22 billion, product costs of 30% and operating expenses of 57%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $51 million, a GAAP tax rate of 39%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 753 million and EPS of $0.09. For Q4 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $2.15 billion, product costs of 25% and operating expenses of 35%. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.82. Note that our guidance is at FX spot rates as laid out in the accompanying slides on our IR website.
Now to our full year 2015 numbers. For 2015, on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.53 billion, product costs of 24%, operating expenses of 49% and GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $201 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 22%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted shares of $750 million and GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.07. For 2015, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $4.65 billion, $50 million higher than our own August guidance, product costs of 24%, operating expenses of 44% and an operating margin of 32%. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 24%.
Once again, we are raising our full year EPS guidance now to $1.31. We are not fully passing through the entire $0.07 Q3 over performance largely due to 3 factors: the first, revenue pull forward on Destiny and Skylanders from Q4 into Q3, which had an impact of approximately $0.02; cost phasing and timing of expenses, which pushed into Q4 from Q3, which also was worth $0.02; and additional investments we'll be making in Q4 to build the installed base of players across our portfolio, which accounts for the other $0.02.
With the strong backend monetization we are seeing across our portfolio, we think these investments set us up well heading into next year. Importantly, we expect to end the year with more than half of our revenues coming from digital channels, up double-digit percentage points in aggregate from last year.
So in summary, strong engagement and recurring digital monetization trends continue to drive our financial results. Along with these positive digital tailwinds, our strategic investments in new franchises, platforms and geographies are paying off as shown by our year-to-date results. And going forward with King's franchises in our portfolio, we feel that our strategic growth opportunities across platforms, genres, business models, audience demographics and geographies are more promising than ever. We couldn't be more excited to welcome King and their talented employees into the fold and look forward to taking advantage of the great mutual opportunities we have in front of us.
Lastly, we look forward to seeing many of you in person, this Friday at Investor Day at the start of BlizzCon, to tell you more about the exciting times ahead.

Riccardo mentioned some of the incredible number of games people play every day, almost 100 million people coming to King to play their games every day. I think they have a tremendous track record and we really only got full appreciation of that as we spent a lot of time over the last 2 months going with Riccardo and his team through their business, the analytics that they built and the sophistication that their game developments have built in order to make the games fun to play, engaging, rewarding for players and that's why you see the strong performance that they have put on.
