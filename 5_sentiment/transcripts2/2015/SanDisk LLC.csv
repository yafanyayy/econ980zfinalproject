We are pleased to have returned more than 100% of our 2014 free cash flow to our investors through our capital return program. We successfully drove our portfolio mix shift towards high-value solutions during the year, with total SSD revenue contributing 29% of 2014 revenue, up from 19% of 2013 revenue.
Moving to the details of the business. We are disappointed with our fourth quarter execution. As we indicated in the October conference call, our inventory levels were extremely lean exiting the third quarter and are anticipated to become even leaner throughout the fourth quarter. We overestimated our ability to service our customers' demand variability with our lower levels of inventory, creating supply shortfalls in certain projects. Additionally, within the fourth quarter, unplanned maintenance activities in our Yokkaichi fab operation as well as lower yield on certain memory die led to unexpected reduction in production output. The combination of lean inventory and reduced memory output made our ability to meet our customer demand even more challenging during the seasonally strong period.
These factors impacted our business, most notably in our retail and iNAND product line. Within retail, the late timing of supply availability resulted in lost sales opportunities. within iNAND, demand for our previous-generation products fell more rapidly than forecasted by our customers, while we had limited ability to service demand for our newer products due to supply constraints. We are taking corrective measures to mitigate the recurrence of these events in the future to ensure that we can consistently meet our customers' expectation. It is clear that one of our top operational priorities for 2015 is to rebuild our inventory levels, which we expect to be restored to normal levels by midyear.
In embedded, in the second half of 2014, we estimate that the smartphone market consumed more embedded flash-based X3 NAND technology than ever before, and we are leading the industry in advancing the usage of X3 in embedded products with our Seventh Generation X2 Technology. Over the course of this year, because of our strong road map, we expect to win designs for our embedded X3 solution at multiple OEM customers, with strong production ramp in the second half of 2015. Beyond the smartphone and tablet market, we are pleased with the traction we have seen for our embedded and removable solutions with customers in the Connected Home, automotive and content delivery market.
Turning to enterprise SSDs. Revenue grew on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis during the fourth quarter, with full year revenue nearly doubling on a year-over-year basis. The fourth quarter enterprise SSD revenue was driven by continuing strength in fab SSDs and a significant increase in revenue from sales of CloudSpeed enterprise SATA products to hyperscale customers. We have largely completed our overall Fusion-io integration, and we're excited about the opportunities ahead with broadest portfolio of enterprise SSD products in the industry.
We made solid progress in moving the Fusion-io go-to-market strategy with an OEM-centric model and advancing sales force productivity. We continue to expect that our enterprise solutions revenue will achieve $1 billion in 2015.
Our client SSDs completed a very strong year in 2014 with 36% year-over-year growth with strong penetration in both OEM and retail market. Retail of our X3-based SanDisk Ultra II SSDs continues to be solid. With our OEM customers, we expanded our presence further with our 1Y nanometer X2 SSDs. Complete adoption of our client SSDs continues to accelerate, driven by an increasing attach rate of SSDs in notebooks. 
I'm pleased to note that qualification for our 1Y nanometer X3 SSDs is nearing completion with multiple OEM customers. one headwind for our client SSDs, however, is that a major customer has decided to move away from our client SSD solutions starting in Q1. Taking this into consideration, we estimate that our 2015 total SSD sales, enterprise and client solutions combined, as a percentage of revenue, to remain similar to the 2 -- 29% revenue mix in 2014. We expect this mix to be driven by significantly higher sales in enterprise, partially offset by a decline in client SSD sales.  Driven by market growth and continued share gains in corporate DC platforms, we anticipate that our client SSD revenue will grow again starting in 2016.
In retail, we do not see any material changes to the demand in the marketplace, although there could be pockets of demand weakness in certain regions like EMEA due to the macroeconomic factors. We expect our retail channel, in which we have the #1 flash NAND in the world, to continue to be a solid contributor to our overall business and profitability in 2015.
In manufacturing, the output from our vehicle fabs was below our expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year for the reasons I described earlier, with the full year bit supply growth in 2014 increasing by 20% from 2013, at the low end of our original 20% to 30% growth range estimate. The primary driver of the low bit growth was a high mix of 19-nanometer vehicles in order to service our OEM customers. The ramp-up on our 15-nanometer technology is proceeding well, with over to 1Y technology achieved late in the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect the strong production ramp of 15-nanometer throughout 2015 with a mix reaching 15% of our sales in the second half of the year. We are now utilizing 15-nanometer X2 technology in retail products, and in the first quarter of 2015, we will begin sampling the new technology in embedded applications.
Our 3D NAND technology development continues to make good progress, and we remain on track to begin pilot production in the second half of 2015, with volume production targeted in 2016. We remain confident that our 3D NAND memory products in production in 2016  will be competitive than those offered in by others in the market at that time.
From a NAND industry standpoint, our estimate for 2015 supply bit growth is in the range of 35% to 40%, and we continue to expect a healthy industry supply-demand environment. As we have previously mentioned, we will be implementing a 5% expansion to our wafer capacity in the first half of 2015, and this will increase our captive wafer capacity to approximately 3 million wafers in the second half of the year. We expect that our wafer capacity expansion, along with an increasing mix of 15-nanometer technology and an increasing mix of X3, will bring our captive supply bit growth for 2015 to the high end of the industry bit growth range.
To conclude, we're focused on improving our supply and product availability, and we will continue managing the business for profitable growth and strong cash flows. In 2015, while our revenue will be challenged in the first half of the year, we expect to return to solid growth in the second half of the year, driven by continuing share gains in enterprise storage and accelerating momentum in embedded solutions. We look forward to bringing greater value to a broader customer base with exciting new products and further extending our position and the preeminent supplier of innovative storage solutions. We remain excited about the future prospects of the company and plan to continue our strong capital return program. 
To this end, I will turn the call over to Judy for the financial review and outlook."
34032,281792106,747690,"SanDisk Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2015",2015-01-21,"Earnings Calls","SanDisk LLC","Executives","Thank you, Sanjay. For the full year 2014, we grew our revenue by 7% and our non-GAAP EPS by 5%, including the dilutive impact of the Fusion-io acquisition. While these total results were quite strong, we're disappointed in our fourth quarter performance,",1862,"Thank you, Sanjay. For the full year 2014, we grew our revenue by 7% and our non-GAAP EPS by 5%, including the dilutive impact of the Fusion-io acquisition. While these total results were quite strong, we're disappointed in our fourth quarter performance, and our first half of 2015 will be focused on recovering from the current headwinds in our supply and the our client SSD business.  We expect that in the second half of 2015, we will return to year-over-year top line growth and deliver a non-GAAP operating profit within our target financial model of 25% to 30% of revenue.
I'll take you through some details of our Q4 results and then, discuss 2015 expectations in more detail.  Our Q4 revenue was approximately flat, both sequentially and year-over-year, and was comprised of 69% commercial and 31% retail compared to the year-ago quarter, which was 62% commercial and 38% retail. Our retail revenue was down 2% sequentially and down 18% year-over-year. Typically, the fourth quarter has been the strongest quarter of the year for our retail revenue. While we expected some year-over-year decline in Q4 retail revenue due to the contraction of the imaging market, we believe the market did grow sequentially while our revenue was constrained by our supply and low channel inventory level.  In addition, there were some pockets of pricing weakness in EMEA and APAC.  On a regional basis, we generated sequential retail revenue growth in North America, where we were better able to meet the timing requirements of customer demand, and this was offset by a decline in revenue in Europe and APAC, where our supply constraints or more pronounced.
Our commercial revenue was flat sequentially and up 12% year-over-year. Within our commercial revenue, on a sequential basis, our enterprise SSD revenue grew strongly while our client SSD revenue was down modestly, primarily due to seasonality and anticipated supply constraints. Our combined SSD revenue increased to 31% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter, up from 27% in Q3. Our embedded revenue grew sequentially by 10%, with a decline in revenue from iNAND solutions and strong growth in custom embedded revenue.
As Sanjay described, our iNAND revenue was below our original expectations due to a faster-than-anticipated decline in demand iNAND for our older-generation products, combined with supply constraints for our newer iNAND products. Finally, within our commercial revenue, sales of wafers and components were down sequentially as we prioritized supply for value-added solutions, and our license and royalty revenue grew slightly on a sequential basis.
Turning to a few metrics for the fourth quarter. On a sequential basis, our gigabytes sold increased 4%, and ASP per gigabyte declined by 4%. On a year-over-year basis, our fourth quarter gigabytes sold increased 32%, and ASP per gigabyte declined 24%.
For the full year 2014, our revenue bit growth was 36% in comparison to the 20% supply bit growth that Sanjay described. This difference in bit growth left our inventory levels too lean, and we are working to rebuild our inventory levels in the first half of 2015.
Turning to gross margin. In 2014, our blended ASP per gigabyte declined by 22%, and our all-in cost per gigabyte also declined by 22%. For the full year, non-GAAP gross margin was 48%, in the middle of our target financial model of 45% to 51%, and up 70 basis points from 2013.
In the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP gross margin decreased sequentially from 49% to 45%, below our previous forecast of 47% to 49%. There were 3 primary factors that contributed to the sequential decline in gross margin and the miss from our forecast. First was a lower mix of retail revenue, which carries a higher-than-average gross margin. Lower retail mix was driven primarily by supply constraints. 
Second, as Sanjay previously discussed, we experienced faster-than-expected demand production margin primarily for certain end-of-life products, which made available trailing edge technology node X2 NAND. In an attempt to meet customer demand timing requirements, we used this older node, X2 NAND, in products that would normally use more current node, X3 NAND memory. This inefficient memory usage, as well as the lower fab output, put upward pressure on our memory cost. 
Third, we took inventory reserves related to a faster-than-expected decline in demand for certain end-of-life OEM products as well as for our ULLtraDIMM product, which has become a subject of a court injunction stemming from litigation to which we are not a party.
The yen rate in our fourth quarter cost of sales was JPY 102.5 compared to JPY 101 in Q3, which resulted in a small positive impact to gross margin. Including all these factors, our fourth quarter cost per gigabyte increased sequentially by 3% compared to the 4% decrease in ASP per gigabyte.
Our Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses decreased sequentially by $12 million, driven by a reduction in restructuring expenses related primarily to Fusion-io integration activities. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 24% in Q4 and 28% for the full year, inclusive of Fusion-io related restructuring charges.
Other income and expense was a net expense in Q4 due to charges related to the spin-out of the ioControl business, now known as NexGen. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate declined to the fourth quarter due to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.  For the full year, our non-GAAP tax rate was 30.9%, and the GAAP tax rate was 32.3%.
Our diluted share count came down on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, driven by strong share repurchases. In Q4, we spent approximately $500 million on the repurchase of over 5.5 million shares.
Q4 cash flow from operations was $488 million, bringing full year cash flow from operations to $1.7 billion. Our fourth quarter free cash flow was $476 million, including a net return of $55 million of cash from flash venture. For 2014, our free cash flow was $1.5 billion, and our capital return program totaled 103% of free cash flow.
During the year, we paid $235 million in dividends and repurchased 14.3 million shares, resulting in a net reduction in shares outstanding of 9.5 million shares. 
Our share of flash venture fab investments during Q4 was $209 million and non-fab capital investments were $67 million, bringing 2014 gross capital investments to approximately $1.15 billion. Our 2014 was capital investments were funded primarily by flash venture working capital and secondarily by flash venture operating leases. Our cash outlay for capital investments for 2014 was $207 million or 18% of the gross investment. 
Our inventory ended the year at $698 million, the lowest level in both dollars and weeks of supply since late 2011 when our product mix was very different and our revenue was much lower.  The longer cycle time for SSDs, coupled with the increased breadth of our product portfolio, has led to a need for higher inventory weeks of supply, whereas we currently have the lowest weeks of supply since Q3 of 2011.
Turning to our expectations for 2015. We will be rebuilding our inventory buffers in order to meet the needs of our customers and accommodate normal variability in product demand. In order to restore our inventory health, we believe 2015 revenue bit growth can be no more than 30% inclusive of non-captive inventory in comparison to our expected captive supply bit growth at the high end of the anticipated industry growth of 35% to 40%.
As Sanjay described, we expect our client SSD revenue to decline due to a large customer moving away from our solution. The key product areas where we expect revenue growth in 2015 our enterprise and Embedded Solutions.
In total, we expect our revenue to experience a year-on-year decline in both the first and second quarters and return to year-on-year growth in the second half of 2015.  Our first quarter revenue forecast is $1,400,000,000 to $1,450,000,000, and our 2015 revenue forecast is $6.5 billion to $6.8 billion.
In terms of gross margin, the first quarter will continue to be impacted by using an inefficient memory mix as well as some extra non-captive memory. We will also start to incur some start-up costs in cost of sales related to our Malaysia assembly and test factory, which will begin production in the middle of the year. These factors, plus the sequentially lower revenue levels, will put pressure on gross margin. Offsetting these factors will be a more favorable yen rate of approximately JPY 108 in our Q1 cost of sales, based primarily on Q4 purchase rates and previous hedges.
In total, we expect Q1 non-GAAP gross margin to be similar to that of the fourth quarter or approximately 45%. We expect gross margin to improve across the second through fourth quarters based on improving inventory levels, product transitions to 1Y and 1Z, a higher usage of X3 memory, increasing enterprise revenue mix and a more favorable yen rate, assuming the yen to dollar exchange rate stays at current levels.  We expect that the gross margin improvement will be more concentrated in the second half of the year. We forecast our full year 2015 non-GAAP gross margin to be 47% to 48%, in the middle of our target financial model of 45% to 51%, with Q3 and Q4 non-GAAP gross margin in the upper half of our model. 
We expect non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter to be between $365 million and $375 million. And for the full year, we expect our non-GAAP expenses to be approximately $1.5 billion. This is somewhat higher than our target financial model of 20% to 21% of revenue as we continue to make key investments.
In terms of non-GAAP operating margin, we expect to be solidly in our 25% to 30% target financial model in the second half of the year. Our forecast for non-GAAP other income and expense is approximately $15 million of income for the year. And we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain about the same at 31%.
Our 2015 capital investment is estimated at approximately $1.4 billion, including a 5% capacity add and the addition of a 3D NAND pilot line. We expect cash usage to be between $300 million and $400 million for these capital investments, with the remainder funded by flash venture working capital and leases. We will manage our business with a focus on achieving our target financial model for free cash flow of 15% of revenue. And we will continue a strong share repurchase program, which should lead to diluted shares coming down again in 2015.
In summary, we expect to strengthen the business across 2015. With our inventory rebuilding in the first half of 2015 and strong road maps and customer relationships in place, we look forward to a strong second half of the year. We expect full year 2015 revenue to be similar to slightly higher than in 2014, driven by growth in enterprise and Embedded Solutions revenue. We expect to deliver healthy profit margins and be solidly within our target financial model of 25% to 30% non-GAAP operating margin by the second half of the year. We intend to spend at least 100% of our 2015 free cash flow on our capital return program this year. 
We will now take your questions."

And that resulted in some of the bit growth being 20% versus the prior expectations that I mentioned earlier as well. So overall, we of course, continue to work on transitioning our customers to the new technology nodes, but all the technology nodes are required to be held for OEM parts of the business. In this particular case, it was more iNAND and enterprise solution that I mentioned."

I mean, the legal matter would have to be resolved soon in order for ULLtraDIMM momentum to begin again. Otherwise, the sales of ULLtraDIMM would get impacted. Regarding the Fusion-io part of the business, as we had expected before, the Fusion-io part of the business is not at the run rate that it was pre-acquisition. It is -- and that's what we expected during the time of the acquisition as well. However, we have made a strong progress in terms of integration. We have an excellent team, strong road map for Fusion-io products, and we expect in Q1 to have sequential growth in that part of the business. And certainly, as part of our $1 billion goal in 2015 for enterprise SSD solutions, Fusion-io revenue will be a significant contributor there as well. You may recall that $1 billion goal at our last May Investor Day was actually a 2016 goal, and we pulled it into 2015 once we acquired Fusion-io. Because now we have a broad base of Enterprise Storage Solutions, the broadest portfolio in the industry between fab, SATA, PCIe, getting complemented now by the our software capabilities and leading to some exciting solutions capabilities. So really, all of these in our enterprise business positioning us in a unique and differentiated position, leading to $1 billion goal for the year for enterprise."

There was really nothing that unusual about it. Such kind of yield excursions can occur in the past in any technology node, so nothing out of extraordinary there. We have, of course, addressed it. I want you know though is that those kinds of excursions happened in the field of very lean inventories where the business was already running very tight in terms of supply point of view meeting the customer expectations. Then that kind of yield impact has a bigger loss bigger impact on our serviceability to the customer. So that's what really happened there. I mean, the yield loss was nothing that unusual. These kinds of excursions in advanced technology nodes can occur from time to time. Normally, we would have sufficient inventory levels to really be able to correct those and overcome those effects without really pass it on any of that issue to the customer side or suffering so many mismatch in terms of demand and supply.

I would tell you that I believe our absolute prices in almost every area are higher than the competition because of the value of products that we are selling. And our price decline is modest. We had a 4% sequential price decline in the fourth quarter, and that, of course, includes the impact of fourth quarter retail promotion. And you don't sell in retail, especially in the fourth quarter, without participating in those promotions even if you're in short supply. That's the way the retail market works. And so I really believe our pricing position is very good, and our price decline is not in any way exaggerated. In fact, our prices tend to really reflect the value of our products."

We are pleased to have returned more than 100% of our 2014 free cash flow to our investors through our capital return program. We successfully drove our portfolio mix shift toward high-value solutions during the year, with total SSD revenue contributing 29% of 2014 revenue, up from 19% of 2013 revenue.
Moving to the details of the business. We are disappointed with our fourth quarter execution. As we indicated in the October conference call, our inventory levels were extremely lean exiting the third quarter and are anticipated to become even leaner throughout the fourth quarter. We overestimated our ability to service our customers' demand variability with our lowered levels of inventory, creating supply shortfalls in certain products. Additionally, within the fourth quarter, unplanned maintenance activities in our Yokkaichi fab operations, as well as lower yield on certain memory die led to unexpected reductions in production output. The combination of lean inventory and reduced memory output made our ability to meet our customer demand even more challenging during the seasonally strong period.
These factors impacted our business, most notably in our retail and iNAND product line. Within retail, the late timing of supply availability resulted in lost sales opportunities. Within iNAND, demand for our previous-generation products fell more rapidly than forecasted by our customers, while we had limited ability to service demands for our newer products due to supply constraints. We are taking corrective measures to mitigate the recurrence of these events in the future to ensure that we can consistently meet our customers' expectation. It is clear that one of our top operational priorities for 2015 is to rebuild our inventory levels, which we expect to be restored to normal levels by midyear.
In embedded, in the second half of 2014, we estimate that the smartphone market consumed more embedded flash based on X3 NAND technology than ever before, and we are leading the industry in advancing the usage of X3 in embedded products with our seventh generation X3 technology. Over the course of this year, with our strong road map, we expect to win designs for our embedded X3 solution at multiple OEM customers, with strong production ramp in the second half of 2015. Beyond the smartphone and tablet market, we are pleased with the traction we have seen for our embedded and removable solutions with customers in the connected home, automotive and content delivery markets.
Turning to enterprise SSDs. Revenue grew on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis during the fourth quarter, with full year revenue nearly doubling on a year-over-year basis. The fourth quarter enterprise SSD revenue was driven by continuing strength in fab SSDs and a significant increase in revenue from sales of CloudSpeed enterprise SATA products to hyperscale customers. We have largely completed our overall Fusion-io integration, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead with the broadest portfolio of enterprise SSD products in the industry.
We made solid progress in moving the Fusion-io go-to-market strategy with OEM-centric model and enhancing sales force productivity. We continue to expect that our enterprise solutions revenue will achieve $1 billion in 2015.
Our client SSDs completed a very strong year in 2014 with 36% year-over-year growth with strong penetration in both OEM and retail markets. Retail acceptance of our X3-based SanDisk Ultra II SSDs continues to be solid. With our OEM customers, we expanded our presence further with our 1Y nanometer X2 SSDs. Corporate adoption of our client SSDs continues to accelerate, driven by an increasing attach rate of SSDs in notebooks. 
I am pleased to note that qualification for our 1Y nanometer X3 SSDs is nearing completion with multiple OEM customers. One headwind for our client SSDs however, is that a major customer has decided to move away from our client SSD solutions starting in Q1. Taking this into consideration, we estimate our 2015 total SSD sales, enterprise and client solutions combined, as a percentage of revenue, to remain similar to the 2 -- 29% revenue mix in 2014. We expect this mix to be driven by significantly higher sales in enterprise, partially offset by a decline in client SSD sales.  Driven by market growth and continued share gains in corporate PC platforms, we anticipate that our client SSD revenue will grow again starting in 2016.
In retail, we do not see any material changes to the demand in the marketplace, although there could be pockets of demand weakness in certain regions like EMEA due to macroeconomic factors. We expect our retail channel, in which we have the #1 flash NAND in the world, to continue to be a solid contributor to our overall business and profitability in 2015.
In manufacturing, the output from our vehicle fabs was below our expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year, for the reasons I described earlier, with the full year bit supply growth in 2014 increasing by 20% from 2013, at the low end of our original 20% to 30% growth range estimate. The primary driver of the low bid growth was a high mix of 19-nanometer vehicles in order to service our OEM customers. The ramp-up of our 15-nanometer technology is proceeding well, with cost cross-over with 1Y technology achieved late in the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect the strong production ramp of 15-nanometer throughout 2015, with a mix reaching 15% of our sales in the second half of the year. We are now utilizing 15-nanometer X3 technology in retail products, and in the first quarter of 2015, we will begin sampling the new technology in embedded applications.
Our 3D NAND technology development continues to make good progress, and we remain on track to begin pilot production in the second half of 2015, with volume production targeted in 2016. We remain confident that our 3D NAND memory products in production in 2016 will be competitive than those offered in by others in the market at that time.
From a NAND industry standpoint, our estimate for 2015 supply bit growth is in the range of 35% to 40%, and we continue to expect a healthy industry supply-demand environment. As we have previously mentioned, we will be implementing a 5% expansion to our wafer capacity in the first half of 2015, and this will increase our captive wafer capacity to approximately 3 million wafers in the second half of the year. We expect that our wafer capacity expansion, along with an increasing mix of 15-nanometer technology and an increasing mix of X3, will bring our captive supply bit growth for 2015 to the high end of the industry bit growth range.
To conclude, we are focused on improving our supply and product availability, and we will continue managing the business for profitable growth and strong cash flows. In 2015, while our revenue will be challenged in the first half of the year, we expect to return to solid growth in the second half of the year, driven by continuing share gains in enterprise storage and accelerating momentum in embedded solutions. We look forward to bringing greater value to a broader customer base with exciting new products and further extending our position as the preeminent supplier of innovative storage solutions. We remain excited about the future prospects of the company and plan to continue our strong capital return program. 
To this end, I will turn over the call to Judy for the financial review and outlook."
34032,281792106,747742,"SanDisk Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2015",2015-01-21,"Earnings Calls","SanDisk LLC","Executives","Thank you, Sanjay. For the full year 2014, we grew our revenue by 7% and our non-GAAP EPS by 5%, including the dilutive impact of the Fusion-io acquisition. While these total results were quite strong, we are disappointed in our fourth quarter performance",1860,"Thank you, Sanjay. For the full year 2014, we grew our revenue by 7% and our non-GAAP EPS by 5%, including the dilutive impact of the Fusion-io acquisition. While these total results were quite strong, we are disappointed in our fourth quarter performance, and our first half of 2015 will be focused on recovering from the current headwinds in our supply and in our client SSD business.  We expect that in the second half of 2015, we will return to year-over-year top line growth and deliver a non-GAAP operating profit within our target financial model of 25% to 30% of revenue.
I'll take you through some details of our Q4 results and then, discuss 2015 expectations in more detail.  Our Q4 revenue was approximately flat, both sequentially and year-over-year, and was comprised of 69% commercial and 31% retail, compared to the year-ago quarter, which was 62% commercial and 38% retail. Our retail revenue was down 2% sequentially and down 18% year-over-year. Typically, the fourth quarter has been the strongest quarter of the year for our retail revenue. While we expected some year-over-year decline in Q4 retail revenue due to the contraction of the imaging market, we believe the market did grow sequentially, while our revenue was constrained by our limited supply and low channel inventory levels.  In addition, there were some pockets of pricing weakness in EMEA and APAC. On a regional basis, we generated sequential retail revenue growth in North America, where we were better able to meet the timing requirements of customer demand, and this was offset by a decline in revenue in Europe and APAC, where our supply constraints were more pronounced.
Our commercial revenue was flat sequentially and up 12% year-over-year. Within our commercial revenue, on a sequential basis, our enterprise SSD revenue grew strongly while our client SSD revenue was down modestly, primarily due to seasonality and anticipated supply constraints. Our combined SSD revenue increased to 31% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter, up from 27% in Q3. Our embedded revenue grew sequentially by 10%, with a decline in revenue from iNAND solutions and strong growth in custom embedded revenue.
As Sanjay described, our iNAND revenue was below our original expectations due to a faster-than-anticipated decline in demand for our older-generation products, combined with supply constraints for our newer iNAND products. Finally, within our commercial revenue, sales of wafers and components were down sequentially as we prioritized supply for value-added solutions, and our license and royalty revenue grew slightly on a sequential basis.
Turning to a few metrics for the fourth quarter. On a sequential basis, our gigabytes sold increased 4%, and ASP per gigabyte declined by 4%. On a year-over-year basis, our fourth quarter gigabytes sold increased 32%, and ASP per gigabyte declined 24%.
For the full year 2014, our revenue bit growth was 36% in comparison to the 20% supply bit growth that Sanjay described. This difference in bit growth left our inventory levels too lean, and we are working to rebuild our inventory levels in the first half of 2015.
Turning to gross margins. For 2014, our blended ASP per gigabyte declined by 22%, and our all-in cost per gigabyte also declined by 22%. Our full year, non-GAAP gross margin was 48%, in the middle of our target financial model of 45% to 51%, and up 70 basis points from 2013.
In the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP gross margin decreased sequentially from 49% to 45%, below our previous forecast of 47% to 49%. There were 3 primary factors that contributed to the sequential decline in gross margin and the miss from our forecast. First was a lower mix of retail revenue, which carries a higher-than-average gross margin. Lower retail mix was driven primarily by supply constraints. 
Second, as Sanjay previously discussed, we experienced faster-than-expected demand reduction for certain end-of-life products, which made available trailing edge technology node X2 NAND. In an attempt to meet customer demand timing requirements, we used this older node, X2 NAND, in products that would normally use more current node X3 NAND memory. This inefficient memory usage, as well as the lower fab output, put upward pressure on our memory costs. 
Third, we took inventory reserves related to a faster-than-expected decline in demand for certain end-of-life OEM products as well as for our ULLtraDIMM product, which has become the subject of a court injunction stemming from litigation to which we are not a party.
The yen rate in our fourth quarter cost of sales was JPY 102.5 compared to JPY 101 in Q3, which resulted in a small positive impact to gross margin. Including all these factors, our fourth quarter cost per gigabyte increased sequentially by 3% compared to the 4% decrease in ASP per gigabyte.
Our Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses decreased sequentially by $12 million, driven by a reduction in restructuring expenses related primarily to Fusion-io integration activities. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 24% in Q4 and 28% for the full year, inclusive of Fusion-io related restructuring charges.
Other income and expense was a net expense in Q4 due to charges related to the spin-out of the ioControl business, now known as NexGen. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate declined in the fourth quarter due to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.  For the full year, our non-GAAP tax rate was 30.9%, and the GAAP tax rate was 32.3%.
Our diluted share count came down on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, driven by strong share repurchases. In Q4, we spent approximately $500 million on the repurchase of over 5.5 million shares.
Q4 cash flow from operations was $488 million, bringing full year cash flow from operations to $1.7 billion. Our fourth quarter free cash flow was $476 million, including a net return of $55 million of cash from a flash venture. For 2014, our free cash flow was $1.5 billion, and our capital return program totaled 103% of free cash flow.
During the year, we paid $235 million in dividends and repurchased 14.3 million shares, resulting in a net reduction in shares outstanding of 9.5 million shares. 
Our share of flash venture fab investments during Q4 was $209 million and non-fab capital investments were $67 million, bringing 2014 gross capital investments to approximately $1.15 billion. Our 2014 capital investments were funded primarily by flash venture working capital and secondarily by flash venture operating leases. Our cash outlay for capital investments in 2014 was $207 million or 18% of the gross investment. 
Our inventory ended the year at $698 million, the lowest level in both dollars and weeks of supply since late 2011 when our product mix was very different and our revenue was much lower.  The longer cycle time for SSDs, coupled with the increased breadth of our product portfolio, has led to a need for higher inventory weeks of supply, whereas we currently have the lowest weeks of supply since Q3 of 2011.
Turning to our expectations for 2015. We will be rebuilding our inventory buffers in order to meet the needs of our customers and accommodate normal variability in product demand. In order to restore our inventory health, we believe 2015 revenue bit growth can be no more than 30%, inclusive of non-captive inventory in comparison to our expected captive supply bit growth at the high end of the anticipated industry growth of 35% to 40%.
As Sanjay described, we expect our client SSD revenue to decline due to a large customer moving away from our solution. The key product areas where we expect revenue growth in 2015 are Enterprise and Embedded Solutions.
In total, we expect our revenue to experience a year-on-year decline in both the first and second quarters and return to year-on-year growth in the second half of 2015. Our first quarter revenue forecast is $1,400,000,000 to $1,450,000,000, and our 2015 revenue forecast is $6.5 billion to $6.8 billion.
In terms of gross margin, the first quarter will continue to be impacted by using an inefficient memory mix as well as some extra non-captive memory. We will also start to incur some start-up costs in cost of sales related to our Malaysia assembly and test factory, which will begin production in the middle of the year. These factors, plus the sequentially lower revenue levels, will put pressure on gross margin. Offsetting these factors will be a more favorable yen rate of approximately JPY 108 in our Q1 cost of sales, based primarily on Q4 purchase rates and previous hedges.
In total, we expect Q1 non-GAAP gross margin to be similar to that of the fourth quarter or approximately 45%. We expect gross margins to improve across the second through the fourth quarters based on improving inventory levels, product transitions to 1Y and 1Z, a higher usage of X3 memory, increasing enterprise revenue mix and a more favorable yen rate, assuming the yen to dollar exchange rate stays at current levels.  We expect that the gross margin improvement will be more concentrated in the second half of the year. We forecast our full year 2015 non-GAAP gross margin to be 47% to 48%, in the middle of our target financial model of 45% to 51%, with Q3 and Q4 non-GAAP gross margin in the upper half of our model. 
We expect non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter to be between $365 million and $375 million. And for the full year, we expect our non-GAAP expenses to be approximately $1.5 billion. This is somewhat higher than our target financial model of 20% to 21% of revenue as we continue to make key investments.
In terms of non-GAAP operating margins, we expect to be solidly in our 25% to 30% target financial model in the second half of the year. Our forecast for non-GAAP other income and expense is approximately $15 million of income for the year, and we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain about the same at 31%.
Our 2015 capital investment is estimated at approximately $1.4 billion, including a 5% capacity add and the addition of a 3D NAND pilot line. We expect cash usage to be between $300 million and $400 million for these capital investments, with the remainder funded by flash venture working capital and leases. We will manage our business with a focus on achieving our target financial model for free cash flow of 15% of revenue. And we will continue a strong share repurchase program, which should lead to diluted shares coming down again in 2015.
In summary, we expect to strengthen the business across 2015. With inventory rebuilding in the first half of 2015 and strong road maps and customer relationships in place, we look forward to a strong second half of the year. We expect full year 2015 revenue to be similar to slightly higher than in 2014, driven by growth in Enterprise and Embedded Solutions revenue. We expect to deliver healthy profit margins and be solidly within our target financial model of 25% to 30% non-GAAP operating margin by the second half of the year. We intend to spend at least 100% of our 2015 free cash flow on our capital return program this year. 
We will now take your questions."

Of course, we also use our 19-nanometer production primarily for our enterprise products. Enterprise solutions and enterprise customers tend to stay on prior-generation nodes for longer period of time. And as our enterprise business grew during the course of the year, that's what made us bring in more 19-nanometer supply during 2015 to meet the requirements of some of our OEM customers. And that resulted in some of the bit growth being 20% versus the prior expectations that I mentioned earlier as well. So overall, we of course, continue to work on transitioning our customers to the new technology nodes, but all the technology nodes are required to be held for OEM parts of the business.

But at the same time, as the mix of our business shifts from -- to be less client SSD and more embedded, that mix shift will put some acceleration on that blended price decline statistic.

I would tell you that I believe our absolute prices in almost every area are higher than the competition, because of the value of the products that we are selling. And our price decline is modest. We had a 4% sequential price decline in the fourth quarter, and that, of course, includes the impact of fourth quarter retail promotion. And you don't sell in retail, especially in the fourth quarter, without participating in those promotions, even if you're in short supply. That's the way the retail market works.

34032,281792106,747756,"SanDisk Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2015",2015-01-21,"Earnings Calls","SanDisk LLC","Executives","Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. 2014 was a record year for revenue and non-GAAP earnings, and our business generated strong cash flows.

We are pleased to have returned more than 100% of our 2014 free cash flow to our investors through our capital return program. We successfully drove our portfolio mix shift toward high-value solutions during the year, with total SSD revenue contributing 29% of 2014 revenue, up from 19% of 2013 revenue.
Moving to the details of the business. We are disappointed with our fourth quarter execution. As we indicated in the October conference call, our inventory levels were extremely lean exiting the third quarter and are anticipated to become even leaner throughout the fourth quarter. We overestimated our ability to service our customers' demand variability with our lowered levels of inventory, creating supply shortfalls in certain products. Additionally, within the fourth quarter, unplanned maintenance activities in our Yokkaichi fab operations, as well as lower yield on certain memory die led to unexpected reductions in production output. The combination of lean inventory and reduced memory output made our ability to meet our customer demand even more challenging during the seasonally strong period.
These factors impacted our business, most notably in our retail and iNAND product line. Within retail, the late timing of supply availability resulted in lost sales opportunities. Within iNAND, demand for our previous-generation products fell more rapidly than forecasted by our customers, while we had limited ability to service demands for our newer products due to supply constraints. We are taking corrective measures to mitigate the recurrence of these events in the future to ensure that we can consistently meet our customers' expectation. It is clear that one of our top operational priorities for 2015 is to rebuild our inventory levels, which we expect to be restored to normal levels by midyear.
In embedded, in the second half of 2014, we estimate that the smartphone market consumed more embedded flash based on X3 NAND technology than ever before, and we are leading the industry in advancing the usage of X3 in embedded products with our seventh generation X3 technology. Over the course of this year, with our strong road map, we expect to win designs for our embedded X3 solution at multiple OEM customers, with strong production ramp in the second half of 2015. Beyond the smartphone and tablet market, we are pleased with the traction we have seen for our embedded and removable solutions with customers in the connected home, automotive and content delivery markets.
Turning to enterprise SSDs. Revenue grew on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis during the fourth quarter, with full year revenue nearly doubling on a year-over-year basis. The fourth quarter enterprise SSD revenue was driven by continuing strength in fab SSDs and a significant increase in revenue from sales of CloudSpeed enterprise SATA products to hyperscale customers. We have largely completed our overall Fusion-io integration, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead with the broadest portfolio of enterprise SSD products in the industry.
We made solid progress in moving the Fusion-io go-to-market strategy with OEM-centric model and enhancing sales force productivity. We continue to expect that our enterprise solutions revenue will achieve $1 billion in 2015.
Our client SSDs completed a very strong year in 2014 with 36% year-over-year growth with strong penetration in both OEM and retail markets. Retail acceptance of our X3-based SanDisk Ultra II SSDs continues to be solid. With our OEM customers, we expanded our presence further with our 1Y nanometer X2 SSDs. Corporate adoption of our client SSDs continues to accelerate, driven by an increasing attach rate of SSDs in notebooks. 
I am pleased to note that qualification for our 1Y nanometer X3 SSDs is nearing completion with multiple OEM customers. One headwind for our client SSDs however, is that a major customer has decided to move away from our client SSD solutions starting in Q1. Taking this into consideration, we estimate our 2015 total SSD sales, enterprise and client solutions combined, as a percentage of revenue, to remain similar to the 2 -- 29%[ph] revenue mix in 2014. We expect this mix to be driven by significantly higher sales in enterprise, partially offset by a decline in client SSD sales.  Driven by market growth and continued share gains in corporate PC platforms, we anticipate that our client SSD revenue will grow again starting in 2016.
In retail, we do not see any material changes to the demand in the marketplace, although there could be pockets of demand weakness in certain regions like EMEA due to macroeconomic factors. We expect our retail channel, in which we have the #1 flash NAND in the world, to continue to be a solid contributor to our overall business and profitability in 2015.
In manufacturing, the output from our vehicle fabs was below our expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year for the reasons I described earlier, with the full year bit supply growth in 2014 increasing by 20% from 2013, at the low end of our original 20% to 30% growth range estimate. The primary driver of the low bid growth was a high mix of 19-nanometer vehicles in order to service our OEM customers. The ramp-up of our 15-nanometer technology is proceeding well, with cost cross-over with 1Y technology achieved late in the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect the strong production ramp of 15-nanometer throughout 2015, with a mix reaching 15% of our sales in the second half of the year. We are now utilizing 15-nanometer X3 technology in retail products, and in the first quarter of 2015, we will begin sampling the new technology in embedded applications.
Our 3D NAND technology development continues to make good progress, and we remain on track to begin pilot production in the second half of 2015, with volume production targeted in 2016. We remain confident that our 3D NAND memory products in production in 2016 will be competitive with those offered in by others in the market at that time.
From a NAND industry standpoint, our estimate for 2015 supply bit growth is in the range of 35% to 40%, and we continue to expect a healthy industry supply-demand environment. As we have previously mentioned, we will be implementing a 5% expansion to our wafer capacity in the first half of 2015, and this will increase our captive wafer capacity to approximately 3 million wafers in the second half of the year. We expect that our wafer capacity expansion, along with an increasing mix of 15-nanometer technology and an increasing mix of X3, will bring our captive supply bit growth for 2015 to the high end of the industry bit growth range.
To conclude, we are focused on improving our supply and product availability, and we will continue managing the business for profitable growth and strong cash flows. In 2015, while our revenue will be challenged in the first half of the year, we expect to return to solid growth in the second half of the year, driven by continuing share gains in enterprise storage and accelerating momentum in embedded solutions. We look forward to bringing greater value to a broader customer base with exciting new products and further extending our position as the preeminent supplier of innovative storage solutions. We remain excited about the future prospects of the company and plan to continue our strong capital return program. 
With that, I will turn over the call to Judy for the financial review and outlook."
34032,281792106,747756,"SanDisk Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2015",2015-01-21,"Earnings Calls","SanDisk LLC","Executives","Thank you, Sanjay. For the full year 2014, we grew our revenue by 7% and our non-GAAP EPS by 5%, including the dilutive impact of the Fusion-io acquisition. While these total results were quite strong, we are disappointed in our fourth quarter performance",1859,"Thank you, Sanjay. For the full year 2014, we grew our revenue by 7% and our non-GAAP EPS by 5%, including the dilutive impact of the Fusion-io acquisition. While these total results were quite strong, we are disappointed in our fourth quarter performance, and our first half of 2015 will be focused on recovering from the current headwinds in our supply and in our client SSD business.  We expect that in the second half of 2015, we will return to year-over-year top line growth and deliver a non-GAAP operating profit within our target financial model of 25% to 30% of revenue.
I'll take you through some details of our Q4 results and then, discuss 2015 expectations in more detail.  Our Q4 revenue was approximately flat, both sequentially and year-over-year, and was comprised of 69% commercial and 31% retail, compared to the year-ago quarter, which was 62% commercial and 38% retail. Our retail revenue was down 2% sequentially and down 18% year-over-year. Typically, the fourth quarter has been the strongest quarter of the year for our retail revenue. While we expected some year-over-year decline in Q4 retail revenue due to the contraction of the imaging market, we believe the market did grow sequentially, while our revenue was constrained by our limited supply and low channel inventory levels.  In addition, there were some pockets of pricing weakness in EMEA and APAC. On a regional basis, we generated sequential retail revenue growth in North America, where we were better able to meet the timing requirements of customer demand, and this was offset by a decline in revenue in Europe and APAC, where our supply constraints were more pronounced.
Our commercial revenue was flat sequentially and up 12% year-over-year. Within our commercial revenue, on a sequential basis, our enterprise SSD revenue grew strongly while our client SSD revenue was down modestly, primarily due to seasonality and anticipated supply constraints. Our combined SSD revenue increased to 31% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter, up from 27% in Q3. Our embedded revenue grew sequentially by 10%, with a decline in revenue from iNAND solutions and strong growth in custom embedded revenue.
As Sanjay described, our iNAND revenue was below our original expectations due to a faster-than-anticipated decline in demand for our older-generation products, combined with supply constraints for our newer iNAND products. Finally, within our commercial revenue, sales of wafers and components were down sequentially as we prioritized supply for value-added solutions, and our license and royalty revenue grew slightly on a sequential basis.
Turning to a few metrics for the fourth quarter. On a sequential basis, our gigabytes sold increased 4%, and ASP per gigabyte declined by 4%. On a year-over-year basis, our fourth quarter gigabytes sold increased 32%, and ASP per gigabyte declined 24%.
For the full year 2014, our revenue bit growth was 36% in comparison to the 20% supply bit growth that Sanjay described. This difference in bit growth left our inventory levels too lean, and we are working to rebuild our inventory levels in the first half of 2015.
Turning to gross margins. For 2014, our blended ASP per gigabyte declined by 22%, and our all-in cost per gigabyte also declined by 22%. Our full year, non-GAAP gross margin was 48%, in the middle of our target financial model of 45% to 51%, and up 70 basis points from 2013.
In the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP gross margin decreased sequentially from 49% to 45%, below our previous forecast of 47% to 49%. There were 3 primary factors that contributed to the sequential decline in gross margin and the miss from our forecast. First was a lower mix of retail revenue, which carries a higher-than-average gross margin. Lower retail mix was driven primarily by supply constraints. 
Second, as Sanjay previously discussed, we experienced faster-than-expected demand reduction for certain end-of-life products, which made available trailing edge technology node X2 NAND. In an attempt to meet customer demand timing requirements, we used this older node, X2 NAND, in products that would normally use more current node X3 NAND memory. This inefficient memory usage, as well as the lower fab output, put upward pressure on our memory costs. 
Third, we took inventory reserves related to a faster-than-expected decline in demand for certain end-of-life OEM products as well as for our ULLtraDIMM product, which has become the subject of a court injunction stemming from litigation to which we are not a party.
The yen rate in our fourth quarter cost of sales was JPY 102.5 compared to JPY 101 in Q3, which resulted in a small positive impact to gross margin. Including all these factors, our fourth quarter cost per gigabyte increased sequentially by 3% compared to the 4% decrease in ASP per gigabyte.
Our Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses decreased sequentially by $12 million, driven by a reduction in restructuring expenses related primarily to Fusion-io integration activities. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 24% in Q4 and 28% for the full year, inclusive of Fusion-io related restructuring charges.
Other income and expense was a net expense in Q4 due to charges related to the spin-out of the ioControl business, now known as NexGen. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate declined in the fourth quarter due to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.  For the full year, our non-GAAP tax rate was 30.9%, and the GAAP tax rate was 32.3%.
Our diluted share count came down on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, driven by strong share repurchases. In Q4, we spent approximately $500 million on the repurchase of over 5.5 million shares.
Q4 cash flow from operations was $488 million, bringing full year cash flow from operations to $1.7 billion. Our fourth quarter free cash flow was $476 million, including a net return of $55 million of cash from a flash venture. For 2014, our free cash flow was $1.5 billion, and our capital return program totaled 103% of free cash flow.
During the year, we paid $235 million in dividends and repurchased 14.3 million shares, resulting in a net reduction in shares outstanding of 9.5 million shares. 
Our share of flash venture fab investments during Q4 was $209 million and non-fab capital investments were $67 million, bringing 2014 gross capital investments to approximately $1.15 billion. Our 2014 capital investments were funded primarily by flash venture working capital and secondarily by flash venture operating leases. Our cash outlay for capital investments in 2014 was $207 million or 18% of the gross investment. 
Our inventory ended the year at $698 million, the lowest level in both dollars and weeks of supply since late 2011 when our product mix was very different and our revenue was much lower.  The longer cycle time for SSDs, coupled with the increased breadth of our product portfolio, has led to a need for higher inventory weeks of supply, whereas we currently have the lowest weeks of supply since Q3 of 2011.
Turning to our expectations for 2015. We will be rebuilding our inventory buffers in order to meet the needs of our customers and accommodate normal variability in product demand. In order to restore our inventory health, we believe 2015 revenue bit growth can be no more than 30%, inclusive of non-captive inventory in comparison to our expected captive supply bit growth at the high end of the anticipated industry growth of 35% to 40%.
As Sanjay described, we expect our client SSD revenue to decline due to a large customer moving away from our solution. The key product areas where we expect revenue growth in 2015 are Enterprise and Embedded Solutions.
In total, we expect our revenue to experience a year-on-year decline in both the first and second quarters and return to year-on-year growth in the second half of 2015. Our first quarter revenue forecast is $1,400,000,000 to $1,450,000,000, and our 2015 revenue forecast is $6.5 billion to $6.8 billion.
In terms of gross margin, the first quarter will continue to be impacted by using an inefficient memory mix as well as some extra non-captive memory. We will also start to incur some start-up costs in cost of sales related to our Malaysia assembly and test factory, which will begin production in the middle of the year. These factors, plus the sequentially lower revenue levels, will put pressure on gross margin. Offsetting these factors will be a more favorable yen rate of approximately JPY 108 in our Q1 cost of sales, based primarily on Q4 purchase rates and previous hedges.
In total, we expect Q1 non-GAAP gross margin to be similar to that of the fourth quarter or approximately 45%. We expect gross margins to improve across the second through fourth quarters based on improving inventory levels, product transitions to 1Y and 1Z, a higher usage of X3 memory, increasing enterprise revenue mix and a more favorable yen rate, assuming the yen to dollar exchange rate stays at current levels.  We expect that the gross margin improvement will be more concentrated in the second half of the year. We forecast our full year 2015 non-GAAP gross margin to be 47% to 48%, in the middle of our target financial model of 45% to 51%, with Q3 and Q4 non-GAAP gross margin in the upper half of our model. 
We expect non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter to be between $365 million and $375 million. And for the full year, we expect our non-GAAP expenses to be approximately $1.5 billion. This is somewhat higher than our target financial model of 20% to 21% of revenue as we continue to make key investments.
In terms of non-GAAP operating margins, we expect to be solidly in our 25% to 30% target financial model in the second half of the year. Our forecast for non-GAAP other income and expense is approximately $15 million of income for the year, and we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain about the same at 31%.
Our 2015 capital investment is estimated at approximately $1.4 billion, including a 5% capacity add and the addition of a 3D NAND pilot line. We expect cash usage to be between $300 million and $400 million for these capital investments, with the remainder funded by flash venture working capital and leases. We will manage our business with a focus on achieving our target financial model for free cash flow of 15% of revenue. And we will continue a strong share repurchase program, which should lead to diluted shares coming down again in 2015.
In summary, we expect to strengthen the business across 2015. With inventory rebuilding in the first half of 2015 and strong road maps and customer relationships in place, we look forward to a strong second half of the year. We expect full year 2015 revenue to be similar to slightly higher than in 2014, driven by growth in Enterprise and Embedded Solutions revenue. We expect to deliver healthy profit margins and be solidly within our target financial model of 25% to 30% non-GAAP operating margin by the second half of the year. We intend to spend at least 100% of our 2015 free cash flow on our capital return program this year. 
We will now take your questions."

Of course, we also use our 19-nanometer production primarily for our enterprise products. Enterprise solutions and enterprise customers tend to stay on prior-generation nodes for longer period of time.

As you know, in terms of revenue, as you know, it's a very new product category and continuing to engage with the customer base. But clearly, ULLtraDIMM product category, as we mentioned, does get impacted by the injunction that we currently have, and that injunction will have to be lifted soon. I mean, the legal matter would have to be resolved soon in order for ULLtraDIMM momentum to begin again. Otherwise, the sales of ULLtraDIMM would get impacted. Regarding the Fusion-io part of the business, as we had expected before, the Fusion-io part of the business is not at the run rate that it was pre-acquisition. It is -- and that's what we expected during the time of the acquisition as well. However, we have made strong progress in terms of integration. We have an excellent team, strong road map for Fusion-io products, and we expect in Q1 to have sequential growth in that part of the business. And certainly, as part of our $1 billion goal in 2015 for enterprise SSD solutions, Fusion-io revenue will be a significant contributor there as well. You may recall that $1 billion goal at our last May Investor Day was actually a 2016 goal, and we pulled it to 2015 once we acquired Fusion-io. Because now we have a broad base of Enterprise Storage Solutions, the broadest portfolio in the industry between fab, SATA, PCIe, getting complemented now by our software capabilities and leading to some exciting solutions capabilities. So really, all of these on our enterprise business positioning us in a unique and differentiated position, leading to $1 billion goal for the year for us in enterprise."

I was just talking relative to cost about the growth in the enterprise mix of our business. And as the enterprise mix of our business grows, that will tend to dampen the blended price decline. But at the same time, as the mix of our business shifts from -- to be less client SSD and more embedded, that mix shift will put some acceleration on that blended price decline statistic.

Then that kind of yield impact has a bigger -- that kind of yield loss has a bigger impact on our serviceability to the customer. So that's what really happened there, that I mean, the yield loss was nothing that unusual. These kind of excursions in advanced technology nodes can occur from time to time.

We had a 4% sequential price decline in the fourth quarter, and that, of course, includes the impact of fourth quarter retail promotion. And you don't sell in retail, especially in the fourth quarter, without participating in those promotions, even if you're in short supply. That's the way the retail market works.

I will open my comments by saying that our financial performance over the past 2 quarters have been unacceptable to us as a management team. On today's call, we will discuss the underlying causes of our recent underperformance and the measures we are implementing that we believe will put SanDisk on a path to regain the excellence and execution that have come to expect from us over the years. I will also summarize what has changed since we reported Q4 2014 in January.  Judy will then describe her first quarter -- our first quarter results and guidance in more detail. And then, I'll conclude with a summary of our path forward.
Our Q1 results and 2015 outlook have been adversely impacted by the unusual confluence of 4 main factors: first, product issues including qualification delays impacting embedded and enterprise sales; second, our reduced 2015 opportunity in the enterprise market due to rapid market share; third, weaker-than-anticipated pricing; and fourth, supply challenges.  Now let me share more detail on each of these factors.
First, starting with product issues. We have been working with the customer to qualify an embedded component for client SSD application. Qualification work for this new embedded component was going well early in the first quarter. However, during Q1, we encountered an issue related to the material used in our product assembly at the very last stage of our customer's qualification process. We have a solution to this issue but it required our internal validation and customer prequalification before production shipments can begin. The delay in sales of this embedded component was the single largest contributor to our Q1 revenue shortfall and will also impact our second quarter and 2015 results.
Continuing with product issues, we now expect that some of the 6-gig SAS and 12-gig SAS opportunities that we have included in our 2015 revenue outlook are reduced, primarily due to certain demand changes and delays in customer qualification. As a result, we're reducing our estimates of 2015 sales of our SAS products. In spite of these challenges, we continue to believe that we will maintain a strong #2 market share position within the SAS market. In addition, we are advancing our 12-gig SAS product road map, 15-nanometer NAND and new higher performance controller, and we expect to sample this towards the end of this year.
The second factor impacting our performance is reduced opportunity for us in the enterprise market due to market shift in PCIe mSATA. First, let me address the PCIe market.
Our Q1 results as well as 2015 revenue estimates for our Fusion-io PCIe solutions are significantly below our original plan. The biggest contributor to our reduced 2015 enterprise PCIe outlook is that we are seeing a substantial portion of the PCIe turn moving to lower-cost solutions using enterprise SATA SSDs. This market shift has caused the near-term turn to move from PCIes where we are the market leader, to enterprise SATA solutions where our shared is low given our relatively recent entry. We believe that broadening the limit of NBME infrastructure and availability of NBME PCIe solutions, along with lower-cost PCIe solutions based non-captive NAND, is contribute to the PCIe market expanding again likely beginning in 2016. We plan to launch our new Fusion-io-based PCIe solutions with our captive 1Y technology-based NAND this month and expect revenue contribution from the new PCIe solution later in the year after customer's qualifications are completed. 
In enterprise SATA SSDs, we have recently seen a demand shift to the 2-terabyte capacity point it hyperscale portion of the market starting as early as the second quarter. We expect our 2-terabyte enterprise SATA products to be ready for production later this year. The current lack of this offering will also affect our enterprise SATA sales this year. Longer-term impact of the hyperscale market moving to these high-capacity SATA SSDs is that it will expand the TAM. In enterprise SATA, we're working to improve our market position and putting our portfolio with multiple new 15-nanometer product offering launching later in the year.
Given the overall impact of this market shift and certain SAS product issues that I described earlier, we no longer expect to reach our target of 1 billion of sales in enterprise this year. However, we still expect year-over-year enterprise revenue growth in 2015.
The third factor having an impact on our Q1 results and 2015 outlook is pricing. We experienced softer-than-expected pricing conditions in some parts of our business in Q1, including in global retail sales and in client SSDs. We also made the choice to pull back on sales of private label products late in the quarter because of the accelerated price decline in this channel. We now believe that there is some industry oversupply in first half of 2015.
Moving to the fourth factor, supply challenges. In the first quarter, due to our supply constraints, we were unable to meet the timing of delivery required to fulfill all of the demand for the large hyperscale customer in enterprise SATA. This mismatch in supply availability resulted in a reduced share orders with this customer. Separately, our overall petabytes supply for the year has been somewhat reduced as we're now planning for a higher mix of 1Y technology relative to 15-nanometer in the second half 2015 in support of our business requirements.
In response to these challenging business conditions and in order to position ourselves to successfully achieve our long-term growth objectives and to better align our sales with customers we are serving, I will highlight a few of the changes we are making within the company.
From an augmentation perspective, we are combining all of our enterprise solutions teams, including our InfiniFlash System solutions and software under a unified enterprise growth led by  , our Chief Strategy Officer. This will enable data synergies between the teams, accelerate decision-making and improve execution and enterprise. Jon Bass, SVB, Enterprise Storage Solutions, and Ravi Swaminathan, Vice President, Systems of Solutions will report to Sumit.  , we are combining our mobile solutions and client SSD groups into one group focused on client platforms, led by Drew who has been leading our mobile solutions growth. 
In addition, we have created a Chief Technology Officer position that will be assumed by Kevin. Kevin, our client SSD solutions group, has many years many years of strong engineering experience and has a keen understanding of customer ecosystem and market trend. Having given in this new position Kevin with a background in customer relationships, will improve our ability to production technology trends and tailor our road map and investments to meet customer needs. We believe all of these organizational changes to simplify and improve our product road map execution as well as enhance our focus on the customer.
Within our global engineering organization, we are sampling other products, development, validation and qualification processes. For example, we are deepening our engagements with our customers to validate our solutions on their next-generation platforms earlier than the development cycle and before entering final qualification.
In enterprise, we have had to support multiple hardware and firmware platforms as we integrated several companies that required over a fairly short time frame. We are now reducing the number of platforms and product architectures as we converge the road map. This will increase leverage of engineering resources and improve our product execution. We have discussed these changes with our customers and they're not only enthusiastic about these improvements we're making but it is clear that they are vested in our success.
Further, in light of the near-term revenue outlook, we are lowering our expenses with a reduction in force during Q2 of approximately 5% of our non-factory headcount and are implementing other measures to reduce our expenses from our original 2015 plans.
Before I ask Judy to provide a financial discussion, I will note that our team's top priority in 2015 is to focus, execute and reinvigorate SanDisk, and this will require the combined energy and time of the entire SanDisk team. I want to be clear that the reason we decided to postpone our Investor Day is because I want my team to be fully focused on execution. Having said that, we expect to be fully engaged with you through various conferences, meetings and other forums throughout the year. 
I will now turn the call to Judy for the financial discussion, and I will then come back for further remarks."
34032,282602451,789493,"SanDisk Corp., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2015",2015-04-15,"Earnings Calls","SanDisk LLC","Executives","Thank you, Sanjay. As Sanjay described, the entire management team is committed to substantially improving our financial performance. I will review our Q1 results and then discuss our outlook.Our first quarter revenue of $1.33 billion was down 23% seque",1617,"Thank you, Sanjay. As Sanjay described, the entire management team is committed to substantially improving our financial performance. I will review our Q1 results and then discuss our outlook.
Our first quarter revenue of $1.33 billion was down 23% sequentially and down 12% year-over-year. Our Q1 revenue came 35% from retail and 65% from commercial channels. Our retail revenue was down 15% sequentially and down 13% year-over-year. While there were lingering effects of our Q4 supply challenges on our retail sales, we were able to supply and sell a higher then forecasted number of units, albeit at lower prices than we had expected.  In total, our retail revenue met our expectations for the quarter.
By product category, the year-over-year retail revenue decline is being driven primarily by the imaging card market. Our Q1 forecast miss came from our commercial sales, where our revenue was down 27% sequentially and down 11% year-over-year. 
Within our commercial revenue, there were 3 key drivers of the sequential decline: The largest sequential decline within commercial revenue came from embedded products. While we expected a decline in this area due largely to seasonality and some supply limitation, we had expected some partial offset from a new embedded component for client SSD applications. As Sanjay described, we encountered qualification delays for this embedded component, which resulted in a larger-than-expected sequential decline in embedded revenue.
The second key driver of sequential decline in commercial revenue was the phasing out of our client SSD program with a large customer. This decline was as expected for Q1.
Enterprise SSD was the third key area contributing to the sequential commercial revenue decline, and this was also a miss from our Q1 forecast. The key drivers of the special enterprise decline included a lost opportunity in enterprise SATA due to a supply timing mismatch with a hyperscale customer and lower PCIe sales due largely to the rapidly shifting enterprise market, both as Sanjay described.
On a year-over-year basis, the Q1 decline in commercial revenue was driven by the client SSD program loss with one customer and by lower private label sales, partially offset by growth in enterprise embedded and also client SSD revenue from other OEM customers. Our sales to private label accounts were down year-over-year due to both supply constraints and our conscious pullback from this channel due to aggressive pricing late in Q1.
The overall ASP per gigabyte declined 10% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. The price decline was more pronounced in retail and private label markets. While prices were soft in most retail geographies, one contributing factor in Europe was the impact of the weak euro on our U.S. dollar sales. Our gigabytes sold declined 15% sequentially and increased 24% year-over-year.
Turning to gross margin. Our Q1 non-GAAP gross margin of 43% was lower than our January estimate due primarily to lower enterprise sales mix, higher inventory-related charges and higher price decline. The inventory-related charges were largest for non-captive memory used in our enterprise PCIe products and for SSD controllers, both due to demand reduction. Non-captive memory comprised 2% of our Q1 bit sales. And the yen to dollar exchange rate in our captive memory cost of sales was JPY 108 as expected. Our all-in cost per gigabyte declined 6% sequentially and 17% year-over-year.
Within our Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses of $376 million, we took a $41 million charge in the restructuring and other line that includes legal settlements as well as Fusion-io related restructuring charges. Excluding the legal settlements, our non-GAAP expenses were below our January forecast primarily due to lower incentive compensation and lower-than-planned headcount.
Our Q1 GAAP expenses include a $61 million impairment charge for an i_n process R&D project from the Fusion-io acquisition. The impairment charge was driven by our decision to cancel this project in order to reduce the number of platforms under development and to redirect resources toward our next-generation PCIe platform.
Our Q1 non-GAAP operating margin, inclusive of the restructuring and litigation settlements, was 15%.
Our GAAP taxes for Q1 include a discrete benefit of $21 million from a tax audit settlement. The non-GAAP tax rate of 32% includes the audit settlement and other onetime items spread in the full year rate.
Our diluted share count came down on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, driven by strong share repurchases. In Q1, we spent $750 million to repurchase over 9.3 million shares.
Our share of flash venture fab investments in Q1 was $282 million. And noncash capital investments settlements were $98 million primarily related to our Malaysia and China assembly and test facilities and our India development center. The combined fab and non-fab capital investments for Q1 of $380 million utilized cash of $109 million with the difference funded by joint venture working capital and leases.  With cash flow from operations of $309 million, our free cash flow for Q1 was $200 million. Our joint venture equipment lease guarantees were $606 million at the end of Q1.
Now I'll turn to our outlook. In Q2, we expect a sequential decline in revenue influenced by 3 primary drivers: first, our Q2 client SSD revenue will be down sequentially due to the end-of-life in Q1 of the SSD program with a major customer, which we previously expected would end in Q2. Second, we expect enterprise revenue to decline sequentially in Q2 in SATA and SAS for the reasons Sanjay described. Finally, the lower price points we saw in the latter part of Q1 will also impact price of our business in Q2. We expect our total Q2 revenue to be in the range of $1,150,000,000 to $1,225,000,000.
In the second half of the year, we expect sequential revenue growth in both Q3 and Q4, but we no longer expect year-over-year revenue growth in the second half. We believe that the primary drivers of sequential quarterly revenue growth in the second half will be our embedded products, continued gains with key client SSD customers and stronger seasonality. Within enterprise, we expect our business to stabilize in the second half of 2015 and regain growth momentum in 2016.
Our full year 2015 revenue forecast is now $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion. This represents a substantial year-over-year revenue decline and a significant reduction from our previous 2015 outlook. The largest driver of our forecasted year-over-year revenue decline is the loss of the client SSD program with a large customer. The other key contributors are expected higher price decline than in 2014, coupled with limited supply due to rebuilding inventory levels as we have previously discussed. 
When we provided our 2015 forecast in January, we had expected that our enterprise sales would generate significantly more growth in 2015 and provide a significant offset to the loss of the client SSD program. Since January, the biggest changes in our outlook for the year are reduced enterprise growth, higher price decline and a delay in the qualification of an embedded component for a client SSD application.
From a petabyte perspective, our expected revenue bit growth is now well below 30%. We will purchase fewer non-captive petabytes than previously planned. And we have adjusted our weight for nodal and die mix to align with to our latest forecast.
Turning to gross margin. We expect our Q2 gross margins to be adversely impacted by a sequential decline in enterprise revenue mix and mix of multichip package products within embedded sales, a reduction in overall sales volume and a full quarter impact of lower market prices late in Q1. Partially offsetting these factors is a benefit in our wafer cost from a weaker yen, which we expect will be at a rate of approximately JPY 117 in our Q2 cost of sales. We are forecasting our Q2 non-GAAP gross margin to be the range of 37% to 40%. In the second half of the year, we expect we expect positive impact to gross margins from a higher mix of X3 memory, improving sales volume and likely some further positive impact from the yen, although we expect partial offsetting impact to gross margin from an increased mix of embedded and client SSD products, which tend to carry lower than corporate average gross margins.
We expect our non-GAAP gross margin for the second half to be in the range of 40% to 43%. We are taking actions to minimize our expenses while still making the important technology and product investments for the future.
We expect Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses to be between $355 million and $365 million, inclusive of restructuring expenses related to our expense reduction measures.
We now expect total 2015 non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.4 billion, down from our previous forecast of $1.5 billion. And the $1.4 billion forecast is inclusive of restructuring and other expenses.
For the remainder of 2015, we expect our non-GAAP other income and expense to be approximately breakeven and our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at approximately 32%.
Our Fab and non-fab capital investment forecast remains at $1.4 billion, and we expect cash usage to be approximately $500 million, with the remainder funded by joint venture working capital and joint venture equipment leases.
We are disappointed that we will not achieve the operating margin in our target financial model in 2015, but we remain committed to our target model of 25% to 30% non-GAAP operating margin as the right profitability level for our company. The actions we have underway to improve our performance are targeted at restoring revenue growth and getting us back to our target financial model.  We remain confident in the significant opportunity ahead of us, and we have the breadth of products, expertise and capability to capitalize on it. Now I'll turn the call back to Sanjay for his further remarks."

To summarize, I want to assure you that we are acting quickly and decisively to address the issue that caused our recent underperformance. We understand the fundamental reasons challenges. We are confident that the initiatives you're working",830,"Thanks, Judy. To summarize, I want to assure you that we are acting quickly and decisively to address the issue that caused our recent underperformance. We understand the fundamental reasons challenges. We are confident that the initiatives you're working on both significantly improve our execution. And we are working to better anticipate and react more quickly to changes in the market and indeed, lead the market with breakthrough products.
SanDisk's fundamentals remain strong with solid growth strategy aimed at creating shareholder value. We remain a global leader in retail with a great NAND and strong consumer preference for our product. We believe supply challenges that affected our retail products based in 2014 and early in Q1 are behind us with execution in retail back to normal. Our iNAND portfolio for the embedded market is solid with very good progress achieved in qualifying our new 1Y X3 technology-based products, including our new iNAND 7132 high-performance platform that was launched in first quarter. We expect volume shipments of our 7132 to begin in the second half of 2015.  Our 15-nanometer X3 embedded products qualifications are underway, and we expect to ramp volume shipments in the second quarter. 
In client SSDs, we are shipping X3-based solutions for both the channel and OEM markets, signaling strong shifts of these markets to X3 where we have proven advantages. We have also released a 15-nanometer client SSD to retail and expect to begin OEM qualifications in the third quarter. 
We're seeing a continued increase in the attach rate of SSDs to laptops. bodes well for the broader adoption of client SSDs beyond 2015. Our efforts to diversify our client SSD revenue are proceeding well, including greater traction with Tier 1 OEMs and in the channel. As we have mentioned in our January call, we expect to return to year-over-year growth in our client SSD revenue in 2016.
In enterprise, we are strengthening our product road map and execution and expect to regain our momentum and continue to drive enterprise revenue growth in 2016 and beyond. Despite the near-term issues and enterprise which we are addressing, SanDisk remains one of the largest enterprise storage solutions providers in the highest growth portion of the flash industry. We believe that our unique ability to design solutions from the memory cell design to software that accelerates application performance has been a key enabler for us to bring innovative solutions such as our 4-terabyte SAS SSD in the InfiniFlash platform to market.
InfiniFlash, an industry first, is a massively scalable, highest density storage solution underscoring SanDisk's strong capabilities to innovate and differentiate our offerings high-value solutions and enterprise markets. We believe that when it comes to the breadth of solution and depth of our expertise and capabilities in the enterprise market. We are a clear leader in high-value enterprise solution and expect to continue to improve our position in this important market over time. From a SAS manufacturing perspective, the output challenges that we discussed on our Q4 call are behind us.
Regarding 15-nanometer technology, production ramp can continue to go well with excellent . We remain on track for our 15-nanometer technology to achieve greater than 50% of our second half bit sales. 
We begun production of 48-layer 3D NAND technology, which is an industry first. This breakthrough memory architecture utilizes unit of device information and demonstrates our strengths in introducing industry-leading memory technologies. Our 48-layer 3D NAND technology provides an exciting combination of increased density, higher performance and lower power NAND which will be used in a large range of solutions from your mobile products to enterprise SSDs. Our 3D NAND pilot production will commence in the second half of the year and will be introduced for commercial use in 2016. 
Given our expectations to return to stronger performance in 2016 and our confidence in our long-term prospects, we remain committed to our capital return program.  In Q1, we returned $750 million through share repurchases, a 50% increase over Q4. We expect to return another $750 million through share repurchase before the end of the fiscal year. This will result in total 2015 share repurchase of $1.5 billion and, combined with our dividend, total 2015 capital return of approximately $1.75 billion. This is more than we returned in 2014 and significantly higher than our expected 2015 free cash flow.
I have described in somewhat excruciating detail the of several issues that are impacting our business in 2015. I have every confidence that we will emerge stronger from the setback as we improve our execution and continue to evolve the company to remain at the forefront of the flash industry. I'm energized by the capabilities and deep expertise we have created to continue to bring industry-leading innovative solutions to customers. I look forward to sharing our progress for the over the next several months as we work towards our goals and return to sequential growth in the second half of 2015. This said, we will open the line for questions."

And this is because, you know, PCIe solutions have demand higher pricing in the market and have as well, a certain portion of the workflow requirement. On the other hand, enterprise SATA solutions are able to address the market to meet its performance requirements in an adequate fashion while using multiple SATA drive in configuration and basically being good enough of meeting the application the requirement and doing so in the most cost-effective fashion versus the PCIe solutions that are there in the marketplace today. However, we see that in the future, this market TAM will return to growth. That will be enabled by, first of all, solutions such as what we're building with our captive NAND. In fact, as I mentioned, we'll be announcing those later this month. The captive NAND will help us bring down the cost. It will enable us to offer PCIe solutions at lower price points and still strong margin, healthy margins. And this will then enable us to grow the PCIe as we grow forward. At the same time, the NVMe PCIe solutions will help expand the market opportunity because that, too, will go towards adjusting the broader set of industry infrastructure application. So it's really the combination of benefit of the captive memory on PCIe solutions lowering the price point and expanding the TAM, getting PCIe into new workload environments and really capturing the benefit of this low latency, IOPs capability at attractive cost structures and then, also the NVMe deployment as it becomes a commonplace in the industry over the next few years. So that this is what will start driving the growth of PCIe. And SanDisk is expect both of these aspects with our captive memory and PCIe solutions starting to come out this year, as I mentioned, and NVMe solutions starting to come out in 2016 time frame."

So these are all the actions that we're taking that help us enhance our customer focus, make us more nimble in responding to the market changes and customer requirements and will enhance our execution going forward. I would like to mention here that SanDisk has had strong track record of execution. when you look at today in our retail, our leadership and execution continues to be solid, again, embedded and clients SSDs. We are continuing to grow our expertise with X3 technology. client SSD measurable about 4 years from 2011 time frame onwards, we grew business to over $1 billion. And in enterprise as we have acquired different companies over the course of the last 4 years, we have grown our business from nothing, no presence in enterprise, to over $600 million of business in 2014 and looking at year-over-year growth in 2015 and 2016 as well.  One of the challenges, as we put together these various acquisitions, has been that each one of them brought with it its own product architecture, its own controller, installer and firmware and solution architecture. And now we have used that successfully to make the company -- to build the company into a powerful enterprise company. Now as we look at scaling this infrastructure further for enterprise business opportunity, we are streamlining our platforms and optimizing different the combinations of controller and firmware architectures to really get those a streamlined road map that this efficient and more scalable. And this is what we are focused on. I have confidence that the actions we have taken, we will be able to address these challenges. These speed bumps we are face here, the teams we have here with all the capabilities that they have that have that SanDisk our vertical integration and strong track record of presence execution, I'm confident that we will recover from this ever stronger and continue to march towards our goal of becoming an enterprise leader in the industry."

And then, I will also comment on some of the market shifts that we have seen in the enterprise SATA market itself.

And then, I will also comment on some of the market shifts that we have seen in the enterprise SATA market itself. So as I mentioned, on the PCIe side, due to the higher price points on PCIe that have existed, there have been opportunities to instead utilize lower price points SATA solution in a less acceptable performance to ultimately meet the infrastructure for data centers more cost-effective. We began to see some of this trend late last year, but certainly, we should have adjusted better in terms of understanding that this was a trend that was building into a wider trend in the marketplace. And we understood that during the course of the first quarter certainly. And what's happening there is that it's not just limited to 1 or 2 large customers. It is happening primarily across a broader range of custom applications for PCIe. I do believe that our market assessment shows that this trend will reverse itself with respect to PCIe solutions becoming more cost-effective and the TAM resuming growth going forward from 2016 onward. I would also like to comment on enterprise SATA. I mentioned there that we have seen an average shift in hyperscale market in particular toward 2-terabyte capacity point because that gives overall highest capacity point. availability of that capacity point in the industry enables a more cost-effective infrastructure in the data center. We had expected even last year that the market would be needing 2-terabyte capacity point in 2015 time frame, and we have been working closely hyperscale customers in this regard. I would like to point out that enterprise SATA in the market that we actually just began to engage with about 4 quarters ago, and our first quarter of meaningful revenue shipments with enterprise SATA in hyperscale market was fourth quarter of last year. But as we began on engagements last year with customers, we saw the need for 2-terabyte. But what happened here is that during the first quarter, the customers themselves decided to switch this availability of 2-terabyte capacity point becoming available in the market from 1-terabyte capacity point to 2-terabyte capacity point because again of the cost benefit. Of course, we have been engaged the customers with our portfolio solutions up to 1 terabyte capacity point. We need now 2-terabyte capacity points, which I mentioned we will have later in the year. And of course, we will also be having our 15-nanometer-based enterprise SATA solutions available to this market later in the year as well. So there are 2 different market shifts going on. And as I mentioned, PCIe is where we have had high shares; the market shifting toward enterprise SATA where we have had low shares, and within enterprise SATA or in hyperscale opportunities, increasing demand for 2-terabyte capacity points. As we enhance our road map on enterprise SATA, we will have growing opportunity in this part of the enterprise market. And of course, on the PCIe side, we believe that the TAM growth will resume next year. And we will be ready with our solutions with respect to captive NAND as well as NVMe solution sometime next year. Again, let me be clear. Captive NAND will be ramping with qualifications during the course of this year. And then, you asked about expenses. You asked about expenses as well. And of course, we will absolutely make sure that we are continuing to invest in our technology and innovation. This is how SanDisk has grown over the course of last 26 years, that is innovation and technology and system solutions. This is absolutely the lifeblood of the company. And now we have even more opportunities as we try -- as we work on growing the enterprise solutions how and where to our leadership and growing this market. So absolutely, we will not be cutting back with respect to our core of technology, engineering, addressing the market opportunities, the sales force that we need to continue to drive this business. But at the same time, we have an opportunity with a streamlined organization that we just announced to better benefit of efficiency gains and synergies. And this is what we will be leveraging towards this 5% reduction that I mentioned."

I mean, this is our industry's first Big Data Flash application. And these are the kinds of solutions where we bring together our hardware capabilities, our software capabilities and deep understanding of application acceleration and application requirement capabilities through software. Some of these, we acquired through Fusion-io. These are the kind of things we will be putting together to continue to advance our product and technology road map going forward."

However, our strategy absolutely remains solid and remain very committed to it and continue to drive growth in this market. And I would also point out that in addition to enterprise opportunities, of course, SanDisk opportunities in other parts of our business, such as mobile with continuing adoption of flash, increasing capacity as the smartphones really need more flash to deliver the experience that is needed by the consumers and SanDisk continues to drive opportunities in mobile, client SSDs, continuing to grow our share with a broad set of customers other than one large customer that we lost significant portion of client SSD business resulting in some of the year-over-year challenges. But client SSDs, the adoption rate for those SSDs in PCs continues to increase. And with our vertical integration, that is large opportunity for us, and of course, SanDisk leadership in retail.

I will open my comments by saying that our financial performance over the past 2 quarters have been unacceptable to us as a management team. On today's call, we will discuss the underlying causes of our recent underperformance and the measures we are implementing that we believe will put SanDisk on a path to regain the excellence and execution that you have come to expect from us over the years. I will also summarize what has changed since we reported Q4 2014 results in January. Judy will then describe her first quarter -- our first quarter results and guidance in more detail. And then I'll conclude with a summary of our path forward.
Our Q1 results and 2015 outlook have been adversely impacted by the unusual confluence of 4 main factors: first, product issues including qualification delays impacting embedded and enterprise sales; second, our reduced 2015 opportunity in the enterprise market due to rapid market share; third, weaker-than-anticipated pricing; and fourth, supply challenges. Now let me share more detail on each of these factors.
First, starting with product issues. We have been working with a customer to qualify an embedded component for client SSD application. Qualification work for this new embedded component was going well early in the first quarter. However, during Q1, we encountered an issue related to a material used in our product assembly at the very last stage of our customer's qualification process. We have a solution to this issue, but it requires our internal validation and customer requalification before production shipments can begin. The delay in sales of this embedded component was the single largest contributor to our Q1 revenue shortfall and will also impact our second quarter and 2015 results.
Continuing with product issues, we now expect that some of the 6-gig SAS and 12-gig SAS opportunities that we had included in our 2015 revenue outlook are reduced, primarily due to certain demand changes and delays in customer qualification. As a result, we are reducing our estimates of 2015 sales of our SAS products. In spite of these challenges, we continue to believe that we will maintain a strong #2 market share position within the SAS market. In addition, we are advancing our 12-gig SAS product road map with 15-nanometer NAND and new higher performance controller, and we expect to sample this product towards the end of this year.
The second factor impacting our performance is reduced opportunity for us in the enterprise market due to market shift in PCIe mSATA. First, let me address the PCIe market.
Our Q1 results as well as 2015 revenue estimates for our Fusion-io PCIe solutions are significantly below our original plan. The biggest contributor to our reduced 2015 enterprise PCIe outlook is that we are seeing a substantial portion of the PCIe TAM moving to lower-cost solutions using enterprise SATA SSDs. This market shift has caused the near-term TAM to move from PCIes, where we are the market leader, to enterprise SATA solutions, where our share is low given our relatively recent entry. We believe the broadening deployment of NVMe infrastructure and availability of NVMe PCIe solutions, along with lower-cost PCIe solutions built on captive NANDs, will contribute to the PCIe market expanding again likely beginning in 2016. We plan to launch our new Fusion-io-based PCIe solutions with our captive 1Y technology-based NAND later this month and expect revenue contribution from the new PCIe solution later in the year after customer qualifications are completed. 
In enterprise SATA SSDs, we have recently seen a demand shift to the 2-terabyte capacity point in the hyperscale portion of the market starting as early as the second quarter. We expect our 2-terabyte enterprise SATA products to be ready for production later this year. The current lack of this offering will also impact our enterprise SATA sales this year. Longer-term impact of the hyperscale market moving to these high-capacity SATA SSDs is that it will expand the TAM. In enterprise SATA, we are working to improve our market position and broaden our portfolio with multiple new 15-nanometer product offering launching later in the year.
Given the overall impact of this market shift and certain SAS product issues that I described earlier, we no longer expect to reach our target of 1 billion of sales in enterprise this year. However, we still expect year-over-year enterprise revenue growth in 2015.
The third factor having an impact on our Q1 results and 2015 outlook is pricing. We experienced softer-than-expected pricing conditions in some parts of our business in Q1, including in global retail sales and in client SSDs. We also made the choice to pull back on sales of private label products late in the quarter because of the accelerated price decline in this channel. We now believe there is some industry oversupply in the first half of 2015.
Moving to the fourth factor, supply challenges. In the first quarter, due to our supply constraints, we were unable to meet the timing of delivery required to fulfill all of the demand for a large hyperscale customer in enterprise SATA. This mismatch in supply availability resulted in a reduced share award for us with this customer. Separately, our overall petabyte supply for the year has been somewhat reduced as we are now planning for a higher mix of 1Y technology relative to 15-nanometer in the second half 2015 in support of mix of our business requirements.
In response to these challenging business conditions and in order to position ourselves to successfully achieve our long-term growth objective and to better align our sales with the market and customers we are serving, I will highlight a few of the changes we are making within the company.
From an augmentation perspective, we are combining all of our enterprise solutions teams, including our InfiniFlash system solutions and software, under a unified enterprise group led by Sumit Sadana, our Chief Strategy Officer. This will enable data synergies between the teams, accelerate decision-making and improve execution in enterprise. John Scaramuzzo, Senior Vice President, Enterprise Storage Solutions; and Ravi Swaminathan, Vice President, Systems and Software Solutions will report to Sumit. Further, we are combining our mobile solutions and client SSD groups into 1 group focused on client platforms, led by Drew Henry, who has been leading our mobile solutions group.
In addition, we have created a Chief Technology Officer position that will be assumed by Kevin Conley. Kevin, who has been leading our client SSD solutions group, has many years of strong engineering experience and has a keen understanding of customer ecosystem and market trends. Having Kevin in this new position, with his background in customer relationships, will improve our ability to both project technology trends and tailor our road map and investments to meet customer needs. We believe all of these organizational changes will simplify and improve our product road map execution as well as enhance our focus on the customer.
Within our global engineering organization, we are strengthening our product development, validation and qualification processes. For example, we are deepening our engagements with our customers to validate our solutions on their next-generation platforms earlier than the development cycle and before entering final qualification.
In enterprise, we have had to support multiple hardware and firmware platforms as we integrated several companies that were acquired over a fairly short time frame. We are now reducing the number of platforms and product architectures as we converge the road map. This will increase leverage of engineering resources and improve our product execution. We have discussed these changes with our customers and they're not only enthusiastic about these improvements we are making but it is clear that they are vested in our success.
Further, in light of the near-term revenue outlook, we are lowering our expenses with a reduction in force during Q2 of approximately 5% of our non-factory headcount and are implementing other measures to reduce our expenses from our original 2015 plans.
Before I ask Judy to provide a financial discussion, I will note that our team's top priority in 2015 is to focus, execute and reinvigorate SanDisk, and this will require the combined energy and time of the entire SanDisk team. I want to be clear that the reason we decided to postpone our Investor Day is because I want my team to be fully focused on execution. Having said that, we expect to be fully engaged with you through various conferences, meetings and other forums throughout the year.
I will now turn the call to Judy for the financial discussion, and I will then come back for further remarks."
34032,282602451,789522,"SanDisk Corp., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2015",2015-04-15,"Earnings Calls","SanDisk LLC","Executives","Thank you, Sanjay. As Sanjay described, the entire management team is committed to substantially improving our financial performance. I will review our Q1 results and then discuss our outlook.Our first quarter revenue of $1.33 billion was down 23% seque",1609,"Thank you, Sanjay. As Sanjay described, the entire management team is committed to substantially improving our financial performance. I will review our Q1 results and then discuss our outlook.
Our first quarter revenue of $1.33 billion was down 23% sequentially and down 12% year-over-year. Our Q1 revenue came 35% from retail and 65% from commercial channels. Our retail revenue was down 15% sequentially and down 13% year-over-year. While there were lingering effects of our Q4 supply challenges on our retail sales, we were able to supply and sell a higher-than-forecasted number of units, albeit at lower prices than we had expected. In total, our retail revenue met our expectations for the quarter.
By product category, the year-over-year retail revenue decline is being driven primarily by the imaging card market. Our Q1 forecast miss came from our commercial sales, where our revenue was down 27% sequentially and down 11% year-over-year.
Within our commercial revenue, there were 3 key drivers of the sequential decline. The largest sequential decline within commercial revenue came from embedded products. While we expected a decline in this area due largely to seasonality and some supply limitations, we had expected some partial offset from a new embedded component for client SSD applications. As Sanjay described, we encountered qualification delays for this embedded component, which resulted in a larger-than-expected sequential decline in embedded revenue.
The second key driver of sequential decline in commercial revenue was the phasing out of our client SSD program with a large customer. This decline was as expected for Q1.
Enterprise SSD was the third key area contributing to the sequential commercial revenue decline, and this was also a miss from our Q1 forecast. The key drivers of the sequential enterprise decline included a lost opportunity in enterprise SATA due to a supply timing mismatch with a hyperscale customer and lower PCIe sales due largely to the rapidly shifting enterprise market, both as Sanjay described.
On a year-over-year basis, the Q1 decline in commercial revenue was driven by the client SSD program loss with one customer and by lower private label sales, partially offset by growth in enterprise, embedded and also client SSD revenue from other OEM customers. Our sales to private label accounts were down year-over-year due to both supply constraints and our conscious pullback from this channel due to aggressive pricing late in Q1.
The overall ASP per gigabyte declined 10% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. The price decline was more pronounced in retail and private label markets. While prices were soft in most retail geographies, one contributing factor in Europe was the impact of the weak euro on our U.S. dollar sales. Our gigabytes sold declined 15% sequentially and increased 24% year-over-year.
Turning to gross margin. Our Q1 non-GAAP gross margin of 43% was lower than our January estimate due primarily to lower enterprise sales mix, higher inventory-related charges and higher price declines. The inventory-related charges were largest for non-captive memory used in our enterprise PCIe products and for SSD controllers, both due to demand reductions. Non-captive memory comprised 2% of our Q1 bit sales. And the yen-to-dollar exchange rate in our captive memory cost of sales was JPY 108 as expected. Our all-in cost per gigabyte declined 6% sequentially and 17% year-over-year.
Within our Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses of $376 million, we took a $41 million charge in the restructuring and other line that includes legal settlements as well as Fusion-io related restructuring charges. Excluding the legal settlements, our non-GAAP expenses were below our January forecast primarily due to lower incentive compensation and lower-than-planned headcount.
Our Q1 GAAP expenses include a $61 million impairment charge for an in-process R&D project from the Fusion-io acquisition. The impairment charge was driven by our decision to cancel this project in order to reduce the number of platforms under development and to redirect resources toward our next-generation PCIe platform.
Our Q1 non-GAAP operating margin, inclusive of the restructuring and litigation settlements, was 15%.
Our GAAP taxes for Q1 include a discrete benefit of $21 million from a tax audit settlement. The non-GAAP tax rate of 32% includes the audit settlement and other onetime items spread in the full year rate.
Our diluted share count came down on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, driven by strong share repurchases. In Q1, we spent $750 million to repurchase over 9.3 million shares.
Our share of flash venture fab investments during Q1 was $282 million, and non-fab capital investments settlements were $98 million primarily related to our Malaysia and China assembly and test facilities and our India development center. The combined fab and non-fab capital investments for Q1 of $380 million utilized cash of $109 million, with the difference funded by joint venture working capital and leases. With cash flow from operations of $309 million, our free cash flow for Q1 was $200 million. Our joint venture equipment lease guarantees were $606 million at the end of Q1.
Now I'll turn to our outlook. In Q2, we expect a sequential decline in revenue influenced by 3 primary drivers: first, our Q2 client SSD revenue will be down sequentially due to the end-of-life in Q1 of the SSD program with a major customer, which we previously expected would end in Q2. Second, we expect enterprise revenue to decline sequentially in Q2 in SATA and SAS for the reasons Sanjay described. Finally, the lower price points we saw in the latter part of Q1 will also impact several parts of our business in Q2. We expect our total Q2 revenue to be in the range of $1,150,000,000 to $1,225,000,000.
In the second half of the year, we expect sequential revenue growth in both Q3 and Q4, but we no longer expect year-over-year revenue growth in the second half. We believe that the primary drivers of sequential quarterly revenue growth in the second half will be our embedded products, continued gains with key client SSD customers and stronger seasonality. Within enterprise, we expect our business to stabilize in the second half of 2015 and regain growth momentum in 2016.
Our full year 2015 revenue forecast is now $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion. This represents a substantial year-over-year revenue decline and a significant reduction from our previous 2015 outlook. The largest driver of our forecasted year-over-year revenue decline is the loss of the client SSD program with a large customer. The other key contributors are expected higher price decline than in 2014, coupled with limited supply due to rebuilding inventory levels as we have previously discussed.
When we provided our 2015 forecast in January, we had expected that our enterprise sales would generate significantly more growth in 2015 and provide a significant offset to the loss of the client SSD program. Since January, the biggest changes in our outlook for the year are reduced enterprise growth, higher price decline and a delay in the qualification of an embedded component for a client SSD application.
From a petabyte perspective, our expected revenue bit growth is now well below 30%. We will purchase fewer non-captive petabytes than previously planned and we have adjusted our wafer nodal and die mix to align to our latest forecast.
Turning to gross margin. We expect our Q2 gross margin to be adversely impacted by a sequential decline in enterprise revenue, an increased mix of multichip package products within embedded sales, a reduction in overall sales volume and a full quarter impact of lower market prices late in Q1. Partially offsetting these factors is a benefit in our wafer cost from a weaker yen, which we expect will be at a rate of approximately JPY 117 in our Q2 cost of sales. We are forecasting our Q2 non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 37% to 40%. In the second half of the year, we expect positive impact to gross margins from a higher mix of X3 memory, improving sales volume and likely some further positive impact from the yen, although we expect a partial offsetting impact to gross margin from an increased mix of embedded and client SSD products, which tend to carry lower-than-corporate average gross margins.
We expect our non-GAAP gross margin for the second half to be in the range of 40% to 43%. We are taking actions to minimize our expenses while still making the important technology and product investments for the future.
We expect Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses to be between $355 million and $365 million, inclusive of restructuring expenses related to our expense reduction measures.
We now expect total 2015 non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.4 billion, down from our previous forecast of $1.5 billion. And the $1.4 billion forecast is inclusive of restructuring and other expenses.
For the remainder of 2015, we expect our non-GAAP other income and expense to be approximately breakeven and our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at approximately 32%.
Our fab and non-fab capital investment forecast remains at $1.4 billion, and we expect cash usage to be approximately $500 million, with the remainder funded by joint venture working capital and joint venture equipment leases.
We are disappointed that we will not achieve the operating margin in our target financial model in 2015, but we remain committed to our target model of 25% to 30% non-GAAP operating margin as the right profitability level for our company. The actions we have underway to improve our performance are targeted at restoring revenue growth and getting us back to our target financial model.  We remain confident in the significant opportunity ahead of us, and we have the breadth of products, expertise and capability to capitalize on it. Now I'll turn the call back to Sanjay for his further remarks."

To summarize, I want to assure you that we are acting quickly and decisively to address the issue that have caused our recent underperformance. We understand the fundamental reasons behind our challenges. We are confident that the initiatives we are working on will significantly improve our execution, and we are working to better anticipate and react more quickly to changes in the market and, indeed, lead the market with breakthrough products.
SanDisk's fundamentals remain strong with a solid growth strategy aimed at creating shareholder value. We remain a global leader in retail with a great NAND and strong consumer preference for our product. We believe the supply challenges that affected our retail products late in 2014 and early in Q1 are behind us, with execution in retail back to normal. Our iNAND portfolio for the embedded market is solid, with very good progress achieved in qualifying our new 1Y X3 technology-based products, including our iNAND 7132 high-performance platform that was launched in first quarter. We expect volume shipments of our 7132 to begin in the second half of 2015. Our 15-nanometer X3 embedded product qualifications are underway, and we expect to ramp volume shipments in the second quarter.
In client SSDs, we are shipping X3-based solutions for both the channel and OEM markets, signaling strong shift of these markets to X3 where we have proven advantages. We have also released a 15-nanometer client SSD to retail and expect to begin OEM qualifications in the third quarter.
We are seeing a continued increase in the attach rate of SSDs to laptops, which is a trend that bodes well for the broadening adoption of client SSDs beyond 2015. Our efforts to diversify our client SSD revenue are proceeding well, including greater traction with Tier 1 OEMs and in the channel. As we have had mentioned in our January call, we expect to return to year-over-year growth in our client SSD revenue in 2016.
In enterprise, we are strengthening our product road map and execution and expect to regain our momentum and continue to drive enterprise revenue growth in 2016 and beyond. Despite the near-term issues in enterprise which we are addressing, SanDisk remains one of the largest enterprise storage solutions providers in the highest growth portion of the flash industry. We believe that our unique ability to design solutions from the memory cell design to software that accelerates application performance has been a key enabler for us to bring innovative solutions such as our 4-terabyte SAS SSD and the InfiniFlash platform to market.
InfiniFlash, an industry-first, is a massively scalable, highest density storage solution underscoring SanDisk's strong capabilities to innovate and differentiate our offerings with high-value solutions in the enterprise markets. We believe that when it comes to the breadth of solution and depth of our expertise and capabilities in the enterprise market, we are a clear leader in high-value enterprise solutions and expect to continue to improve our position in this important market over time. From a SAS manufacturing perspective, the output challenges that we discussed on our Q4 call are behind us.
Regarding 15-nanometer technology, production ramp continues to go well with excellent yields. We remain on track for our 15-nanometer technology to achieve greater than 50% of our second half bit sales.
We have also begun gearing up for the pilot production of 48-layer 3D NAND technology, which is an industry-first. This breakthrough memory architecture utilizes numerous process and device innovations and demonstrates our strength in introducing industry-leading memory technologies. Our 48-layer 3D NAND technology provides an exciting combination of increased density, higher performance and lower power which will be used in a broad range of solutions from removable products to enterprise SSDs. Our 3D NAND pilot production will commence in the second half of the year and will be introduced for commercial use in 2016. 
Given our expectations to return to stronger performance in 2016 and our confidence in our long-term prospects, we remain committed to our capital return program. In Q1, we returned $750 million through share repurchases, a 50% increase over Q4. We expect to return another $750 million through share repurchase before the end of the fiscal year. This will result in total 2015 share repurchase of $1.5 billion and, combined with our dividend, total 2015 capital return of approximately $1.75 billion. This is more than we returned in 2014 and is significantly higher than our expected 2015 free cash flow.
I have described in somewhat excruciating detail the layered convergence of several issues that are impacting our business in 2015. I have every confidence that we will emerge stronger from the setback as we improve our execution and continue to evolve the company to remain in the forefront of the flash industry. I'm energized by the capabilities and deep expertise we have created to continue to bring industry-leading innovative solutions to customers. I look forward to sharing our progress with you over the next several months as we work towards our goal and return to sequential growth in the second half of 2015. This said, we will open the line for questions."

And this is because, as you know, PCIe solutions have commanded higher pricing in the market and have, as well, a certain portion of the workflow requirement. On the other hand, enterprise SATA solutions are able to address the market to meet its performance requirements in an adequate fashion while using multiple SATA drive in a rate configuration and basically being good enough in terms of meeting the application requirement and doing so in a more cost-effective fashion versus the PCIe solutions that are there in the marketplace today. However, we see that in the future, this market TAM will return to growth. That will be enabled by, first of all, solutions such as what we are building out with our captive NAND. In fact, as I mentioned, we'll be announcing those later this month. The captive NAND will help us bring down the cost. It will enable us to offer PCIe solutions at lower price points and still strong margin, healthy margins. And this will then enable us to grow the PCIe TAM as we go forward. At the same time, the NVMe PCIe solutions will help expand the market opportunity because that, too, will go towards addressing a broader set of industry infrastructure application. So it's really the combination of benefit of captive memory on PCIe solutions, lowering the price point and expanding the TAM, getting PCIe into new workload environments and really capturing the benefit of this low latency, high-ops capability at attractive cost structures and then, also the NVMe deployment as it becomes a commonplace in the industry over the next few years. So this is what will start driving the growth of PCIe. And SanDisk is addressing both of these aspects with our captive memory and PCIe solutions starting to come out this year, as I mentioned, and NVMe solutions starting to come out in 2016 time frame."

But as we have discussed before, 3D technology requires significant capital investment. There will be a production ramp happening over our 3D technology as it gets applied across various products that are there in the NAND industry as it gets qualified by customers, as well as the production ramp of 3D is managed in the industry by various suppliers at their own, taking to account there are more calculations at different basis. All of this, we believe, will continue to lead towards an industry supply growth which will be similar to the industry bit supply growth in 2015 time frame. We have said before that we expect the industry supply bit growth to be in the 35% to 40%, perhaps closer to 40% for 2015.

And then, I will also comment on some of the market shifts that we have seen in the enterprise SATA market itself. So as I mentioned, on the PCIe side, due to the higher price points on PCIe that have existed, there have been opportunities to instead, utilize lower price point SATA solution with acceptable performance to ultimately meet the infrastructure for data centers more cost-effective. We began to see some of this trend late last year but certainly, we should have just did better in terms of understanding that this was a trend that was building into a wider trend in the marketplace. And we understood that during the course of the first quarter, certainly. And what's happening there is that it's not just limited to 1 or 2 large customers, it is happening primarily across a broader range of customer applications for PCIe. I do believe that our market assessment shows that this trend will reverse itself with respect to PCIe solutions becoming more cost-effective and the TAM resuming growth going forward from 2016 onward. I would also like to comment on enterprise SATA. I mentioned there that we have seen an average shift in hyperscale market in particular toward 2-terabyte capacity points because that gives overall highest capacity point. With the availability of that capacity point in the industry, enables a more cost-effective infrastructure in the data center. We had expected even last year, that the market would be needing 2-terabyte capacity point in 2015 time frame, and we have been working closely hyperscale customers in this regard. I would like to point out that enterprise SATA is the market that we actually just began to engage with about 4 quarters ago. And our first quarter of meaningful revenue shipments with enterprise SATA in hyperscale market was fourth quarter of last year. But as we began on engagement last year with the customers, we saw the need for 2-terabyte. But what happened here is that during the first quarter, the customers themselves decided to switch this availability of 2-terabyte capacity point becoming available in the market from 1-terabyte capacity point to 2-terabyte capacity point, again, because of the cost benefit. Of course, we had been engaged the customers with our portfolio of solutions up to 1 terabyte capacity point. We need now 2-terabyte capacity points which I mentioned we will have later in the year. And of course, we will also be having our 15-nanometer-based enterprise SATA solutions available to address this market late in the year as well. So there are 2 different market shifts going on. And as I mentioned, PCIe is where we have had high shares, the market shifting toward enterprise SATA where we have had low shares, and within enterprise SATA or in hyperscale opportunities, increasing demand for 2-terabyte capacity points. As we enhance our road map on enterprise SATA, we will have growing opportunity in this part of the enterprise market. And of course, on the PCIe side, we believe that the TAM growth will resume next year. And we will be ready with our solutions with respect to captive NAND as well as NVMe solutions sometime next year. Again, let me be clear. captive NAND will be ramping with qualifications during the course of this year. And then, you asked about expenses. You asked about expenses as well. And of course, we will absolutely make sure that we are continuing to invest in our technology and innovation. This is how SanDisk has grown over the course of last 26 years, that is innovation and technology and system solutions. This is absolutely the lifeblood of the company. And now, we have even more opportunities as we try -- as we work on growing the enterprise solutions and work to our leadership position and growing this market. So absolutely, we will not be cutting back with respect to our core of technology, engineering, addressing the market opportunities, the sales force that we need to continue to drive this business. But at the same time, we have an opportunity with a streamlined organization that we have just announced, to have better benefit of efficiency gains and synergies. And this is what we will be leveraging towards this 5% reduction that I mentioned."

However, our strategy absolutely remains solid and we remain very committed to it and continuing to drive our growth in this market. And I will also point out that in addition to enterprise opportunities, of course, SanDisk opportunities in other parts of our business such as mobile with continuing adoption of flash, increasing capacity as the smartphones really need more flash to deliver the experience that is needed by the consumers and SanDisk excessively continues to drive opportunities in mobile, client SSDs, continuing to grow our share with a broad set of customers other than one large customer that we lost significant portion of client SSD business, resulting in some of the year-over-year challenges. But client SSDs, the adoption rate for those SSDs in PCs continue to increase. And with our vertical integration, that's another large opportunity for us and of course, SanDisk leadership in retail. So we are definitely continuing to aggressively drive forward the business on all fronts, and I believe we have a very solid strategy here.

On today's call, we will discuss the underlying causes of our recent",1434,"Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. I will open my comments by saying that our financial performance over the past 2 quarters has been unacceptable to us as a management team. On today's call, we will discuss the underlying causes of our recent underperformance and the measures we are implementing that we believe will put SanDisk on a path to regain the excellence in execution that you have come to expect from us over the years. I will also summarize what has changed since we reported Q4 2014 results in January. Judy will then describe her first quarter -- our first quarter results and guidance in more detail. And then I'll conclude with a summary of our path forward.
Our Q1 results and 2015 outlook have been adversely impacted by the unusual confluence of 4 main factors: first, product issues, including qualification delays impacting embedded and enterprise sales; second, our reduced 2015 opportunity in the enterprise market due to rapid market shifts; third, weaker-than-anticipated pricing; and fourth, supply challenges. Now let me share more detail on each of these factors.
First, starting with product issues. We have been working with a customer to qualify an embedded component for client SSD application. Qualification work for this new embedded component was going well early in the first quarter. However, during Q1, we encountered an issue related to a material used in our product assembly at the very last stage of our customer's qualification process. We have a solution to this issue, but it requires our internal validation and customer requalification before production shipments can begin. The delay in sales of this embedded component was the single largest contributor to our Q1 revenue shortfall and will also impact our second quarter and 2015 results.
Continuing with product issues, we now expect that some of the 6-gig SAS and 12-gig SAS opportunities that we had included in our 2015 revenue outlook are reduced, primarily due to certain demand changes and delays in customer qualifications. As a result, we are reducing our estimates of 2015 sales of our SAS products. In spite of these challenges, we continue to believe that we will maintain a strong #2 market share position within the SAS market. In addition, we are advancing our 12-gig SAS product road map with 15-nanometer NAND and a new higher performance controller, and we expect to sample this product towards the end of this year.
The second factor impacting our performance is reduced opportunity for us in the enterprise market due to market shifts in PCIe and SATA. First, let me address the PCIe market.
Our Q1 results as well as 2015 revenue estimates for our Fusion-io PCIe solutions are significantly below our original plan. The biggest contributor to our reduced 2015 enterprise PCIe outlook is that we are seeing a substantial portion of the PCIe TAM moving to lower-cost solutions using enterprise SATA SSDs. This market shift has caused the near-term TAM to move from PCIes, where we are the market leader, to enterprise SATA solutions, where our share is low given our relatively recent entry. We believe the broadening deployment of NVMe infrastructure and availability of NVMe PCIe solutions, along with lower-cost PCIe solutions built on captive NANDs, will contribute to the PCIe market expanding again, likely beginning in 2016. We plan to launch our new Fusion-io-based PCIe solutions with our captive 1Y technology-based NAND later this month and expect revenue contribution from the new PCIe solution later in the year, after customer qualifications are completed. 
In enterprise SATA SSDs, we have recently seen a demand shift to the 2-terabyte capacity point in the hyperscale portion of the market, starting as early as the second quarter. We expect our 2-terabyte enterprise SATA products to be ready for production later this year. The current lack of this offering will also impact our enterprise SATA sales this year. Longer-term impact of the hyperscale market moving to these high-capacity SATA SSDs is that it will expand the TAM. In enterprise SATA, we are working to improve our market position and broaden our portfolio with multiple new 15-nanometer product offerings launching later in the year.
Given the overall impact of these market shifts and certain SAS product issues that I described earlier, we no longer expect to reach our target of $1 billion of sales in enterprise this year. However, we still expect year-over-year enterprise revenue growth in 2015.
The third factor having an impact on our Q1 results and 2015 outlook is pricing. We experienced softer-than-expected pricing conditions in some parts of our business in Q1, including in global retail sales and in client SSDs. We also made the choice to pull back on sales of private-label products late in the quarter because of the accelerated price decline in this channel. We now believe there is some industry oversupply in the first half of 2015.
Moving to the fourth factor, supply challenges. In the first quarter, due to our supply constraints, we were unable to meet the timing of delivery required to fulfill all of the demand for a large hyperscale customer in enterprise SATA. This mismatch in supply availability resulted in a reduced share award for us with this customer. Separately, our overall petabyte supply for the year has been somewhat reduced as we are now planning for a higher mix of 1Y technology relative to 15-nanometer in the second half 2015 to support the mix of our business requirements.
In response to these challenging business conditions and in order to position ourselves to successfully achieve our long-term growth objectives and to better align our sales with the market and customers we are serving, I will highlight a few of the changes we are making within the company.
From an organization perspective, we are combining all of our enterprise solutions teams, including our InfiniFlash system solutions and software, under a unified enterprise group led by Sumit Sadana, our Chief Strategy Officer. This will enable data synergies between the teams, accelerate decision-making and improve execution in enterprise. John Scaramuzzo, Senior Vice President, Enterprise Storage Solutions; and Ravi Swaminathan, Vice President, Systems and Software Solutions, will report to Sumit. Further, we are combining our mobile solutions and client SSD groups into 1 group focused on client platforms, led by Drew Henry, who has been leading our mobile solutions group.
In addition, we have created a Chief Technology Officer position that will be assumed by Kevin Conley. Kevin, who has been leading our client SSD solutions group, has many years of strong engineering experience and has a keen understanding of customer ecosystems and market trends. Having Kevin in this new position, with his background in customer relationships, will improve our ability to both predict technology trends and tailor our road map and investments to meet customer needs. We believe all of these organizational changes will simplify and improve our product road map execution as well as enhance our focus on the customer.
Within our global engineering organization, we are strengthening our product development, validation and qualification processes. For example, we are deepening our engagements with our customers to validate our solutions on their next-generation platforms earlier in the development cycle and before entering final qualification.
In enterprise, we have had to support multiple hardware and firmware platforms as we integrated several companies that were acquired over a fairly short time frame. We are now reducing the number of platforms and product architectures as we converge the road map. This will increase leverage of engineering resources and improve our product execution. We have discussed these changes with our customers and they're not only enthusiastic about these improvements we are making but it is clear that they are vested in our success.
Further, in light of the near-term revenue outlook, we are lowering our expenses with a reduction in force during Q2 of approximately 5% of our non-factory headcount and are implementing other measures to reduce our expenses from our original 2015 plans.
Before I ask Judy to provide a financial discussion, I will note that our team's top priority in 2015 is to focus, execute and reinvigorate SanDisk, and this will require the combined energy and time of the entire SanDisk team. I want to be clear that the reason we decided to postpone our Investor Day is because I want my team to be fully focused on execution. Having said that, we expect to be fully engaged with you through various conferences, meetings and other forums throughout the year.
I will now turn the call to Judy for the financial discussion, and I will then come back for further remarks."
34032,282602451,789525,"SanDisk Corp., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2015",2015-04-15,"Earnings Calls","SanDisk LLC","Executives","Thank you, Sanjay. As Sanjay described, the entire management team is committed to substantially improving our financial performance. I will review our Q1 results and then discuss our outlook.Our first quarter revenue of $1.33 billion was down 23% seque",1604,"Thank you, Sanjay. As Sanjay described, the entire management team is committed to substantially improving our financial performance. I will review our Q1 results and then discuss our outlook.
Our first quarter revenue of $1.33 billion was down 23% sequentially and down 12% year-over-year. Our Q1 revenue came 35% from retail and 65% from commercial channels. Our retail revenue was down 15% sequentially and down 13% year-over-year. While there were lingering effects of our Q4 supply challenges on our retail sales, we were able to supply and sell a higher-than-forecasted number of units, albeit at lower prices than we had expected. In total, our retail revenue met our expectations for the quarter.
By product category, the year-over-year retail revenue decline is being driven primarily by the imaging card market. Our Q1 forecast miss came from our commercial sales, where our revenue was down 27% sequentially and down 11% year-over-year.
Within our commercial revenue, there were 3 key drivers of the sequential decline. The largest sequential decline within commercial revenue came from embedded products. While we expected a decline in this area due largely to seasonality and some supply limitations, we had expected some partial offset from a new embedded component for client SSD applications. As Sanjay described, we encountered qualification delays for this embedded component, which resulted in a larger-than-expected sequential decline in embedded revenue.
The second key driver of sequential decline in commercial revenue was the phasing out of our client SSD program with a large customer. This decline was as expected for Q1.
Enterprise SSD was the third key area contributing to the sequential commercial revenue decline, and this was also a miss from our Q1 forecast. The key drivers of the sequential enterprise decline included a lost opportunity in enterprise SATA due to a supply timing mismatch with a hyperscale customer and lower PCIe sales due largely to the rapidly shifting enterprise market, both as Sanjay described.
On a year-over-year basis, the Q1 decline in commercial revenue was driven by the client SSD program loss with one customer and by lower private-label sales, partially offset by growth in enterprise, embedded and also client SSD revenue from other OEM customers. Our sales to private-label accounts were down year-over-year due to both supply constraints and our conscious pullback from this channel due to aggressive pricing late in Q1.
The overall ASP per gigabyte declined 10% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. The price decline was more pronounced in retail and private-label markets. While prices were soft in most retail geographies, one contributing factor in Europe was the impact of the weak euro on our U.S. dollar sales. Our gigabytes sold declined 15% sequentially and increased 24% year-over-year.
Turning to gross margin. Our Q1 non-GAAP gross margin of 43% was lower than our January estimate, due primarily to lower enterprise sales mix, higher inventory-related charges and higher price declines. The inventory-related charges were largest for non-captive memory used in our enterprise PCIe products and for SSD controllers, both due to demand reductions. Non-captive memory comprised 2% of our Q1 bit sales. And the yen-to-dollar exchange rate in our captive memory cost of sales was JPY 108 as expected. Our all-in cost per gigabyte declined 6% sequentially and 17% year-over-year.
Within our Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses of $376 million, we took a $41 million charge in the restructuring and other line that includes legal settlements as well as Fusion-io-related restructuring charges. Excluding the legal settlements, our non-GAAP expenses were below our January forecast, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and lower-than-planned headcount.
Our Q1 GAAP expenses include a $61 million impairment charge for an in-process R&D project from the Fusion-io acquisition. The impairment charge was driven by our decision to cancel this project in order to reduce the number of platforms under development and to redirect resources toward our next-generation PCIe platform.
Our Q1 non-GAAP operating margin, inclusive of the restructuring and litigation settlements, was 15%.
Our GAAP taxes for Q1 include a discrete benefit of $21 million from a tax audit settlement. The non-GAAP tax rate of 32% includes the audit settlement and other onetime items spread in the full year rate.
Our diluted share count came down on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, driven by strong share repurchases. In Q1, we spent $750 million to repurchase over 9.3 million shares.
Our share of flash venture fab investments during Q1 was $282 million, and non-fab capital investments settlements were $98 million, primarily related to our Malaysia and China assembly and test facilities and our India development center. The combined fab and non-fab capital investments for Q1 of $380 million utilized cash of $109 million, with the difference funded by joint venture working capital and leases. With cash flow from operations of $309 million, our free cash flow for Q1 was $200 million. Our joint venture equipment lease guarantees were $606 million at the end of Q1.
Now I'll turn to our outlook. In Q2, we expect a sequential decline in revenue influenced by 3 primary drivers. First, our Q2 client SSD revenue will be down sequentially due to the end-of-life in Q1 of the SSD program with a major customer, which we previously expected would end in Q2. Second, we expect enterprise revenue to decline sequentially in Q2 in SATA and SAS for the reasons Sanjay described. Finally, the lower price points we saw in the latter part of Q1 will also impact several parts of our business in Q2. We expect our total Q2 revenue to be in the range of $1,150,000,000 to $1,225,000,000.
In the second half of the year, we expect sequential revenue growth in both Q3 and Q4, but we no longer expect year-over-year revenue growth in the second half. We believe that the primary drivers of sequential quarterly revenue growth in the second half will be our embedded products, continued gains with key client SSD customers and stronger seasonality. Within enterprise, we expect our business to stabilize in the second half of 2015 and regain growth momentum in 2016.
Our full year 2015 revenue forecast is now $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion. This represents a substantial year-over-year revenue decline and a significant reduction from our previous 2015 outlook. The largest driver of our forecasted year-over-year revenue decline is the loss of the client SSD program with a large customer. The other key contributors are expected higher price declines than in 2014, coupled with limited supply due to rebuilding inventory levels, as we have previously discussed.
When we provided our 2015 forecast in January, we had expected that our enterprise sales would generate significantly more growth in 2015 and provide a significant offset to the loss of the client SSD program. Since January, the biggest changes in our outlook for the year are reduced enterprise growth, higher price declines and a delay in the qualification of an embedded component for a client SSD application.
From a petabyte perspective, our expected revenue bit growth is now well below 30%. We will purchase fewer non-captive petabytes than previously planned, and we have adjusted our wafer nodal and die mix to align to our latest forecasts.
Turning to gross margin. We expect our Q2 gross margin to be adversely impacted by a sequential decline in enterprise revenue, an increased mix of multichip package products within embedded sales, a reduction in overall sales volume and the full-quarter impact of lower market prices late in Q1. Partially offsetting these factors is a benefit in our wafer cost from a weaker yen, which we expect will be at a rate of approximately JPY 117 in our Q2 cost of sales. We are forecasting our Q2 non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 37% to 40%. In the second half of the year, we expect positive impact to gross margins from a higher mix of X3 memory, improving sales volume and likely some further positive impact from the yen, although we expect a partial offsetting impact to gross margin from an increased mix of embedded and client SSD products, which tend to carry lower-than-corporate average gross margins.
We expect our non-GAAP gross margin for the second half to be in the range of 40% to 43%. We are taking actions to minimize our expenses while still making the important technology and product investments for the future.
We expect Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses to be between $355 million and $365 million, inclusive of restructuring expenses related to our expense reduction measures.
We now expect total 2015 non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.4 billion, down from our previous forecast of $1.5 billion. And the $1.4 billion forecast is inclusive of restructuring and other expenses.
For the remainder of 2015, we expect our non-GAAP other income and expense to be approximately breakeven and our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at approximately 32%.
Our fab and non-fab capital investment forecast remains at $1.4 billion, and we expect cash usage to be approximately $500 million, with the remainder funded by joint venture working capital and joint venture equipment leases.
We are disappointed that we will not achieve the operating margin in our target financial model in 2015, but we remain committed to our target model of 25% to 30% non-GAAP operating margin as the right profitability level for our company. The actions we have underway to improve our performance are targeted at restoring revenue growth and getting us back to our target financial model.  We remain confident in the significant opportunity ahead of us, and we have the breadth of products, expertise and capability to capitalize on it. Now I'll turn the call back to Sanjay for his further remarks."

To summarize, I want to assure you that we are acting quickly and decisively to address the issues that have caused our recent underperformance. We understand the fundamental reasons behind our challenges. We are confident that the initiatives we are working on will significantly improve our execution, and we are working to better anticipate and react more quickly to changes in the market and, indeed, lead the market with breakthrough products.
SanDisk's fundamentals remain strong with a solid growth strategy aimed at creating shareholder value. We remain a global leader in retail with a great brand and strong consumer preference for our products. We believe the supply challenges that affected our retail products late in 2014 and early in Q1 are behind us, with execution in retail back to normal. Our iNAND portfolio for the embedded market is solid, with very good progress achieved in qualifying our new 1Y X3 technology-based products, including our iNAND 7132 high-performance platform that was launched in the first quarter. We expect volume shipments of our 7132 to begin in the second half of 2015. Our 15-nanometer X3 embedded product qualifications are underway, and we expect to ramp volume shipments in the second quarter.
In client SSDs, we are shipping X3-based solutions for both the channel and OEM markets, signaling a strong shift of these markets to X3, where we have proven advantages. We have also released a 15-nanometer client SSD to retail and expect to begin OEM qualifications in the third quarter.
We are seeing a continued increase in the attach rate of SSDs to laptops, which is a trend that bodes well for the broadening adoption of client SSDs beyond 2015. Our efforts to diversify our client SSD revenue are proceeding well, including greater traction with Tier 1 OEMs and in the channel. As we had mentioned in our January call, we expect to return to year-over-year growth in our client SSD revenue in 2016.
In enterprise, we are strengthening our product road map and execution and expect to regain our momentum and continue to drive enterprise revenue growth in 2016 and beyond. Despite the near-term issues in enterprise which we are addressing, SanDisk remains one of the largest enterprise storage solutions providers in the highest-growth portion of the flash industry. We believe that our unique ability to design solutions from the memory cell design to software that accelerates application performance has been a key enabler for us to bring innovative solutions, such as our 4-terabyte SAS SSD and the InfiniFlash platform, to market.
InfiniFlash, an industry-first, is a massively scalable, highest-density storage solution underscoring SanDisk's strong capabilities to innovate and differentiate our offerings with high-value solutions in the enterprise market. We believe that when it comes to the breadth of solutions and depth of our expertise and capabilities in the enterprise market, we are a clear leader in high-value enterprise solutions and expect to continue to improve our position in this important market over time. From a fab manufacturing perspective, the output challenges that we discussed on our Q4 call are behind us.
Regarding 15-nanometer technology, production ramp continues to go well with excellent yields. We remain on track for our 15-nanometer technology to achieve greater than 50% of our second half bit sales.
We have also begun gearing up for the pilot production of 48-layer 3D NAND technology, which is an industry first. This breakthrough memory architecture utilizes numerous process and device innovations and demonstrates our strength in introducing industry-leading memory technologies. Our 48-layer 3D NAND technology provides an exciting combination of increased density, higher performance and lower power, which will be used in a broad range of solutions, from removable products to enterprise SSDs. Our 3D NAND pilot production will commence in the second half of the year and will be introduced for commercial use in 2016. 
Given our expectations to return to stronger performance in 2016 and our confidence in our long-term prospects, we remain committed to our capital return program. In Q1, we returned $750 million through share repurchases, a 50% increase over Q4. We expect to return another $750 million through share repurchase before the end of the fiscal year. This will result in total 2015 share repurchase of $1.5 billion and, combined with our dividend, total 2015 capital return of approximately $1.75 billion. This is more than we returned in 2014 and is significantly higher than our expected 2015 free cash flow.
I have described in somewhat excruciating detail the rare convergence of several issues that are impacting our business in 2015. I have every confidence that we will emerge stronger from this setback as we improve our execution and continue to evolve the company to remain in the forefront of the flash industry. I'm energized by the capabilities and deep expertise we have created to continue to bring industry-leading innovative solutions to customers. I look forward to sharing our progress with you over the next several months as we work towards our goals and return to sequential growth in the second half of 2015. With that, we will open the line for questions."

And this is because, as you know, PCIe solutions have commanded higher pricing in the market and have addressed a certain portion of the workload requirements. On the other hand, enterprise SATA solutions are able to address the market to meet its performance requirements in an adequate fashion while using multiple SATA drives in arrayed configuration and basically being good enough in terms of meeting the application requirement and doing so in a more cost-effective fashion versus the PCIe solutions that are there in the marketplace today. However, we see that in the future, this market TAM will return to growth. That will be enabled by, first of all, solutions such as what we are building out with our captive NAND. In fact, as I mentioned, we'll be announcing those later this month. The captive NAND will help us bring down the cost. It will enable us to offer PCIe solutions at lower price points and still strong margins, healthy margins. And this will then enable us to grow the PCIe TAM as we go forward. At the same time, the NVMe PCIe solutions will help expand the market opportunity because that, too, will go towards addressing a broader set of industry infrastructure applications. So it's really the combination of benefit of captive memory on PCIe solutions, lowering the price point and expanding the TAM, getting PCIe into new workload environments and really capturing the benefit of this low-latency, high-ops capability at attractive cost structures and then, also the NVMe deployment as it becomes commonplace in the industry over the next few years. So this is what will start driving the growth of PCIe. And SanDisk is addressing both of these aspects with our captive memory and PCIe solutions starting to come out this year, as I mentioned, and NVMe solutions starting to come out in 2016 time frame."

So our execution on client SSD with 1Y as well as our 15-nanometer technology node is going per our plans. The qualification delay that I talked about, it was related to a new component, a new embedded component that goes into SSD applications. This is different from the client SSDs that I just mentioned. Their 1Y and 15-nanometer qualifications and production plans are just going fine. Now related to this new embedded component for SSD applications with a particular customer here, I mentioned the challenge that we experienced here was at a very late stage of a qualification by the customer, and the solution to this has changed of a packaging material and assembly of this particular component. So we are engaged in qualification process with a customer, and we expect that to take another 2 to 3 months before that process can be completed.

And what I'm worried about is, does this mean that you're going to have potentially -- or could this mean you might have potentially a narrower set of expertise and products going forward, which might leave you more at risk of suffering from these market shifts in the future? Because I would have thought that possibly one of the reasons you're suffering from this is perhaps you're not equally positioned in all products. And so if the market shifts in a way that you're not prepared for, then you suffer. But if you have a more broad set of products, then perhaps, you would suffer less.

And then, I will also comment on some of the market shifts that we have seen in the enterprise SATA market itself. So as I mentioned, on the PCIe side",730,"So let me address that from the point of view of PCIe shifting towards enterprise SATA in the near term. And then, I will also comment on some of the market shifts that we have seen in the enterprise SATA market itself. So as I mentioned, on the PCIe side, due to the higher price points on PCIe that have existed, there have been opportunities to instead utilize lower-price-point SATA solutions with acceptable performance to ultimately make the infrastructure for data centers more cost-effective. We began to see some of this trend late last year but certainly, we should have just did better in terms of understanding that this was a trend that was building into a wider trend in the marketplace. And we understood that during the course of the first quarter, certainly. And what's happening there is that it's not just limited to 1 or 2 large customers, it is happening primarily across a broader range of customer applications for PCIe. I do believe that our market assessment shows that this trend will reverse itself with respect to PCIe solutions becoming more cost-effective and the TAM resuming growth going forward from 2016 onward. I would also like to comment on enterprise SATA. I mentioned there that we have seen a rapid shift in hyperscale market, in particular, toward 2-terabyte capacity points because that gives overall highest capacity point. With the availability of that capacity point in the industry, enables a more cost-effective infrastructure in the data center. We had expected even last year that the market would be needing 2-terabyte capacity point in 2015 time frame, and we have been working closely with hyperscale customers in this regard. I would like to point out that enterprise SATA is the market that we actually just began to engage with about 4 quarters ago. And our first quarter of meaningful revenue shipments with enterprise SATA in hyperscale market was fourth quarter of last year. But as we began our engagement last year with the customers, we saw the need for 2-terabyte. But what happened here is that during the first quarter, the customers themselves decided to switch this availability of 2-terabyte capacity point becoming available in the market from 1-terabyte capacity point to 2-terabyte capacity point, again, because of the cost benefit. Of course, we had been engaged with the customers with our portfolio of solutions up to 1 terabyte of capacity point. We need now 2-terabyte capacity points, which I mentioned we will have later in the year. And of course, we will also be having our 15-nanometer-based enterprise SATA solutions available to address this market late in the year as well. So there are 2 different market shifts going on. And as I mentioned, PCIe is where we have had high shares, the market shifting toward enterprise SATA where we have had low shares, and within enterprise SATA or in hyperscale opportunities, increasing demand for 2-terabyte capacity points. As we enhance our road map on enterprise SATA, we will have growing opportunity in this part of the enterprise market. And of course, on the PCIe side, we believe that the TAM growth will resume next year. And we will be ready with our solutions with respect to captive NAND as well as NVMe solutions sometime next year. Again, let me be clear. Captive NAND will be ramping with qualifications during the course of this year. And then, you asked about expenses. You asked about expenses as well. And of course, we will absolutely make sure that we are continuing to invest in our technology and innovation. This is how SanDisk has grown over the course of the last 26 years, that is innovation and technology and system solutions. This is absolutely the lifeblood of the company. And now, we have even more opportunities as we try -- as we work on growing the enterprise solutions and work toward leadership position in growing this market. So absolutely, we will not be cutting back with respect to our core of technology, engineering, addressing the market opportunities, the sales force that we need to continue to drive this business. But at the same time, we have an opportunity with a streamlined organization that we have just announced, to have better benefit of efficiency gains and synergies. And this is what we will be leveraging towards this 5% reduction that I mentioned."

Pricing is obviously playing a role there.

We believe that the more competitive pricing enabled by our captive memory-based PCIe product will open up new workloads for this new product set -- for this product category.
We are currently shipping these captive NAND-based PCIe solutions through distribution channels, and customer qualification at several OEMs are expected to be completed in the second half of this year.
Another factor that we believe will simulate the Fusion expansion of the Enterprise PCIe market is the expected deployment of NVMe infrastructure and availability of NVMe PCIe solution in 2016 and 2017.
In addition, PCIe flash solutions offer high-performance band SATA solutions due to the lower latency and higher bandwidth of PCIe. We plan to begin SSD in the PCIe market opportunities with a new offering available for qualification in mid-2016.
With this SanDisk penetration in the Enterprise SATA market, I'm pleased to report that we introduced the CloudSpeed EcoTM Gen. II, a highly competitive 15-nanometer 2-terabyte SATA SSD in the second quarter. The solution is now in qualification at multiple hyperscale customers with revenue contribution expected to begin later this year. Our Enterprise SAS SSD sales performed very well during the quarter driven by better-than-expected demand for several of our products. Our 4-terabyte Optimus SAS SSD was the first of its kind in the market and is making a compelling case for the replacement of 15-k and 10-k RTM Enterprise HDDs.
Optimus MAX SSDs has been an important high-capacity solution for one of our OEM customers all-flash array offerings. 7 other OEMs and hyperscale customers are now qualifying our 4-terabyte Enterprise SAS SSDs because they see the value of reducing the total cost of acquisition and ownership by utilizing this highest capacity solution. We are developing our next generation 15-nanometer base 12-gig SAS SSD for high capacity and performance and expect to introduce that solution to market in 2016 with revenue contribution starting in late 2016.
We are excited about the progress we are making in our next generation converged platform for Enterprise SAS, which brings the best technologies and IP together from our various acquisitions. This converged platform will be heavily leverage across multiple product families in the Enterprise segment and allow us to offer market-leading products integrated with our next generation 3D NAND memories. There is a long enduring development cycle typically associated with such programs. We expect to start sampling products based on this new architecture in 2017.  While we expect to continue to grow our Enterprise revenue over the next couple of years, we aim to rapidly increase our market momentum once this converged architecture is introduced into volume production.
Turning to our Enterprise system and software solution offerings. Since our announcement of our breakthrough Flash platform in March this year, we have been building up a strong pipeline of potential customers, many of whom have started proof-of-concept engagements with us. Customers are excited to see the potential of this flash platform that enable them to rethink how flash can improve the data capabilities then they play it in petabyte scale. Our flash platform allows customers to play hard disk drive solution and our all-flash solution.  Flash offers excellent performance in the industry's highest density of flash at a breakthrough price point that is complete with HDD-based solutions in both total cost of ownership as well as upfront acquisition costs, while solving a lot of challenges customers are facing today with scale-out deployments.  As the trends towards cloud computing, open source software and data analytics gather momentum, Flash is the solution at th eintersection of these imported chance, and we are excited about this potential to accelerate flash adoption in data centers over the next several years.
Switching to client SSDs. Traction for our solution increased with OEMs and in the channel. We announced we have started shipping our 15-nanometer X2 client SSDs to the channel and began qualification of these drives with our OEM customers, to whom we expect to begin revenue shipments in the second half of 2015.  From a market perspective, although the overall PC environment is weak, we believe OEM customers are rapidly increasing the use of SSDs due to the many benefits we have outlined in the past. For example in the corporate market served by OEMs, CIOs have embraced the benefit of SSDs, resulting in an SSD attach rate to corporate notebooks that is expected to approach 40% by the end of 2015.
Decline in unit prices of 128-gigabyte and 256-gigabyte SSDs continue to reduce the gap when compared to HDD unit prices, with 128-gigabyte drives approaching cost parity with low-capacity HDDs. This inflection point is expected to further cause the consumer notebook segment, which have a low SSD attach rate of less than 15%, to accelerate adoption of SSDs. We are well positioned to benefit from this trend with our new product offering such as the SanDisk Z400s based on 15-nanometer X2 technology and our 1Y X3 based SSDs, which offer a compelling value proposition for PC OEMs. We are excited to access this growth opportunity ahead of us as we expect SSDs will rapidly replace HDDs in laptops and desktops.
Moving on to our mobile embedded product portfolio. We completed the qualification and began shipment of our 15-nanometer X3 customer solution as planned. We have also been working on another new customer embedded 15-nanometer X3 solution that is in the late stages of customer qualification and expect to be shipping this new product in significant volume in the third quarter.
Within the iNAND product family, we are expanding the adoption of our solutions. Our 1Y X3-based products, which are designed to meet the requirements of high performance mobile platforms with our innovative Smart SSD technology, are expected to ship to multiple mobile OEMs in the third quarter. Additionally, this last week at Mobile World Congress in Shanghai, we introduced an iNAND product built on 15-nanometer X3 that increases embedded capacity to 128 gigabytes, providing greater performance and cost benefits to mobile OEMs.  We expect to qualify and ship these iNAND to key mobile customers in the second half of 2015.
We are also gaining traction in newer flash markets including connected home, automotive storage, industrial and the Internet of Things. In connected home, cable operators are beginning to use our flash 2D solutions in set-top boxes to improve delivery of high demand content across their networks. 
Automakers continue to add computational power to their cars as a means of providing infotainment differentiation and advanced driver assistance capabilities.  As the automotive industry marches towards a future that will include autonomous driving, storage requirements will grow immensely. And we expect to be a leader -- leading provider of innovative solutions to this industry.
IoT market is still in its early stages of development. However, we are excited to have been selected by some leading solution suppliers for inclusion in IOT design, which we believe will be to expanding opportunities for flash.
In retail, we have made progress recovering from our temporary share loss experienced in Q1 '14 and Q1 '15, which was due to the supply constraints we discussed in earlier calls. Overall, retail had a good second quarter driven by demand for imaging products and SSDs. In June, we introduced a new SanDisk product category with the SanDisk Extreme 900 and SanDisk Extreme 500 external SSDs at 1.92 terabytes and 480 gigabytes of capacities respectively. With moving parts and significantly faster speeds than portable HDDs, these external SSDs are the perfect solutions for photographers and videographers on the go.
To summarize my comments on products, we have made considerable progress towards addressing our road map. Many of our new products are now at various stages of qualification, and we expect our portfolio to continue to strengthen in 2015 and throughout 2016 as well.
From a fab manufacturing perspective, our 15-nanometer technology continued ramping through the quarter with bit output exceeding 1Y volume for Q2. The remained at more than 50% of total bits sold. We also completed the planned 5% wafer capacity for 2015 during the second quarter. And we believe the inventory challenges we discussed on the last 2 calls are now behind us.
In 3D NAND, we have began our equipment purchases to support the commencement of production of our 48-layer architecture in the second half of 2015. We are on track to begin using the output for product samples in 2015, and we continue to expect 3D NAND product sales to begin in 2016.  The 48-layer technology provides an excellent combination of increased density, high performance and lower power compared to 2D NAND. We plan to implement our 3D NAND first in high capacity removable products, then client SSDs and embedded solutions followed by Enterprise SSD solutions, which have longer design and qualification periods.
From a supply base growth rate standpoint, for 2015, we expect the industry's year-over-year supply base growth to be some points above our previous estimate of approximately 40%, and we expect our captive bit growth to be in line with industry. For 2016, our latest estimates is that both the industry and SanDisk supply base growth rates will be lower than in 2015.
Some of you may be wondering about the Toshiba announcement from yesterday. While change to the management structure of Toshiba semiconductor business, we continue to believe that this will not impact the strategy investments and execution of the joint venture. And NAND remains the highest priority for Toshiba.
To conclude, we are making progress in strengthening our product portfolio and improving our execution and get driving vigorously to regain our overall business momentum. We look forward to delivering improved results in the second half of 2015. I will now turn the call to Judy for the financial discussion."

Before I begin, I would like to add to Sanjay's comments on Toshiba and mention that while we are still evaluating the findings of the investigation, we do not expect Toshiba's announcement yesterday to have any impact to our financial results.
I will now review our Q2 results and then discuss our outlook, which remains within the range of expectations we outlined in April. Our second quarter revenue of $1.24 billion was down 7% sequentially and down 24% year-over-year. Our client SSD revenue declined as expected due to the end of life during Q1 of a program with a major customer, while our client SSD revenue with other OEM customers increased nicely from Q1 to Q2.
Our Enterprise revenue also declined sequentially for the reasons we discussed on our April call. Embedded revenue was down sequentially in Q2 due to the seasonality of certain embedded products, while our removable revenue increased sequentially driven by seasonality and share gains.
By channel, our retail revenue increased 4% sequentially and represented 39% of our Q2 revenue mix, while commercial revenue declined 13% sequentially and represented 61% of our revenue mix.
Our gigabytes sold were down sequentially by 1% and down year-over-year by 6%, with the year-over-year decline driven largely by rebuilding of our inventory levels combined with a loss of the client SSD program at a major customer as we have previously discussed.  The decline in our blended ASP per gigabyte was more modest than in Q1, with a sequential decline of 6% and a year-over-year decline of 21%.
Our all-in costs per gigabyte declined 4% sequentially and declined 10% year-over-year. Sequentially, the key drivers of cost reduction were a weaker yen, a higher mix of 15-nanometer memory and lower inventory-related charges, with these factors partially offset on the higher mix of noncaptive memory.  On a year-over-year basis, cost reduction benefited from technology transition, higher mix of X3, nonmemory cost reductions and a weaker yen, with these benefits partially offset by higher inventory reserves, Malaysia factory start-up costs and a higher mix of noncaptive memory. 
Our non-GAAP gross margin of 42% was better than we have forecasted due primarily to product mix, with a stronger mix of Retail and Enterprise products and a lower mix of embedded MCP products.
The yen to dollar exchange rate in our captive memory cost of sales was JPY 117. And noncaptive memory was used in 6% of our sales compared to 2% in Q1 and 1% in Q2 of last year.
Our Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses of $327 million were sequentially lower by $48 million due to reductions stemming from lower charges for restructuring and other, a reduction in force which was largely completed in the second quarter, and some engineering project expenses which shifted from the second quarter to the second half.  Our Q2 non-GAAP operating margin inclusive of the restructuring and other charges was 15%, consistent with the Q1 non-GAAP operating margin.
In Q2, our non-GAAP other income of $10 million included $7 million of onetime gain related to foreign exchange and venture investments.
Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate remained at 32%, while our Q2 GAAP tax rate was 11% due to a discrete benefit from a tax audit settlement. 
The reduction in our non-GAAP diluted share count was driven by a full quarter weighting of our Q1 share repurchases, a partial weighting of the 3.7 million shares repurchased in Q2 and elimination of dilution from the 2017 warrants related to our convertible debt as the warrants were not in the money for Q2.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Our share of Flash Venture fab investments during Q2 was $233 million, and non-fab capital investments were $96 million. With these total gross capital investments of $329 million, we utilized cash of $80 million, with the difference funded by new joint venture equipment leases of $97 million and joint venture working capital.
Our off-balance sheet joint venture equipment lease guarantees stood at $636 million at the end of Q2.
Our inventory increased sequentially by $68 million. And on a petabyte basis, the inventory reflects approximately 12 weeks of forward supply. We expect to continue holding inventory at approximately this level of weeks in order to provide adequate supply for our diverse products and customers.
For Q2, cash flow from operations was $29 million compared to $309 million in Q1 and $241 million in Q2 of 2014. The primary drivers of the sequential decline in cash flow from operations were the seasonality of our accounts receivable, which is typically a source of cash in Q1 and a use of cash in Q2, coupled with a planned increase in our inventory levels.  On a year-over-year basis, the decline in cash flow from operations was driven primarily by the decline in net income and the growth in inventory.
Free cash flow for Q2 was a negative $52 million. And we spent $250 million on share repurchases and $63 million on the quarterly dividend.  Our cash ended the quarter at $4.0 billion on a gross basis and $1.5 billion net of debt.
We expect our cash flow from operations to be at a significantly stronger run rate in the second half compared to Q2. And we currently plan to continue share repurchases in the second half of 2015.
Now I'll turn to our outlook. Our current estimates for 2015 revenue remains within the range of $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion that we provided in April. We expect the majority of our sequential second half revenue growth to come from mobile embedded products, with a significant portion of this revenue forecasted on the cusp between Q3 and Q4.  The ramp timing of several mobile embedded products, along with the market success of our customers mobile products, are key variables in where we land in our forecasted 2015 revenue range.  For the third quarter, we estimate our revenue to be in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion.
We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin for the second half of the year to be in the range of 40% to 43%.  Compared to Q2, we expect the key factors impacting second half gross margin to be an increased mix of mobile embedded sales, which will have a negative impact on gross margin, and a slightly weaker yen to dollar rate coupled with higher sales volume, which will have a positive impact.  For Q3, we expect the yen to dollar rate and cost of sales to be approximately JPY 120.
We expect non-GAAP operating expenses in Q3 to be between $335 million and $345 million, and continue to expect full year 2015 non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately or slightly below $1.4 billion.  For the second half, we expect our non-GAAP other income and expense to be approximately breakeven and our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at approximately 32%.
Our 2015 fab and non-fab capital investment forecast remains at $1.4 billion, with $709 million purchased in the first half. And our 2015 forecasted cash usage for capital investments remains at approximately $500 million with $190 million used in the first half.
To conclude my remarks, we look forward to delivering sequential growth in revenue and earnings in the second half of the year as we continue to focus on improving our execution in strengthening our product portfolio. We'll now open the call for your questions."

We are monitoring the U.S. trends. Yes, it does tend to have cost and certain power considerations, but we will be adequately prepared to address the U.S. market as it builds up in the future. But we are still, as I mentioned, continuing to evaluate this market opportunity for the future. And with respect to eMCP, we have said several times in the past that we do address this market in a really strategic fashion. And we do have a couple of sources of DRAM supply to address this.

Our second quarter results benefited from more favorable performance than expected in enterprise and retail. We are also making good progress in strengthening our product road map and customer engagements. For the second half of 2015, we expect the industry environment to remain stable and look forward to delivering sequential revenue and profit growth as we continue to make progress in enhancing our execution.
In our April 8 conference call, we discussed the pending requalification of a new embedded component for our customers' use in their client SSD application. We have completed the SanDisk internal validation of this new product, and the qualification work on the customers' side is progressing well. We expect to complete the full customer requalification process in the third quarter and begin revenue shipment soon thereafter.
In enterprise SSDs, our Fusion-io revenue grew sequentially in Q2. We also announced our next-generation Fusion ioMemory PCIe application accelerators based on our 1Y NAND technology, enabling a significantly lower price point for our customers. We believe that the more competitive pricing enabled by our captive memory-based PCIe product will open up new workloads for this new product -- for this product category. We are currently shipping these captive NAND-based PCIe solutions through distribution channels, and customer qualifications at several OEMs are expected to be completed in the second half of this year.
Another factor that we believe will simulate the future expansion of the enterprise PCIe market is the expected broadening deployment of NVMe infrastructure and availability of NVMe PCIe solution in 2016 and 2017. In addition, PCIe flash solutions offer high-performance RAM SATA SSDs due to the lower latency and high bandwidths of PCIe. We plan to begin addressing the NVMe PCIe market opportunity with a new offering available for qualification in mid-2016.
To increase SanDisk penetration in the enterprise SATA market, I'm pleased to report that we introduced the CloudSpeed Eco Gen. II, a highly competitive 15 nanometer-based 2-terabyte SATA SSD in the second quarter. The solution is now in qualification at multiple hyperscale customers, with revenue contribution expected to begin later this year. 
Our enterprise SAS SSD sales performed well during the quarter, driven by better-than-expected demand for several of our products. Our 4-terabyte Optimus MAX SAS SSD was the first of its kind in the market and is making a compelling case for the replacement of 15K and 10K rpm enterprise HDDs. The Optimus MAX SSD has become an important high-capacity solution for one of our OEM customers all-flash array offerings. Several other OEM and hyperscale customers are now qualifying our 4-terabyte enterprise SAS SSD because they see the value of reducing the total cost of acquisition and ownership by utilizing this highest capacity solution. We are developing our next-generation 15 nanometer-based 12-gig SAS SSD with highest capacity and performance and expect to introduce that solution to market in 2016, with revenue contribution starting in late 2016.
We are excited about the progress we are making with our next-generation converged platform for enterprise products, which brings the best technologies and IP together from our various acquisitions. This converged platform will be heavily leveraged across multiple product families in the enterprise segment and allow us to offer market-leading products integrated with our next-generation 3D NAND memories. Given the long engineering development cycle typically associated with such major programs, we expect to start sampling products based on this new architecture in 2017. While we expect to continue to grow our enterprise revenue over the next couple of years, we aim to rapidly increase our market momentum once this converged architecture is introduced into volume production.
Turning to our enterprise system and software solution offerings. Since our announcement of our breakthrough InfiniFlash platform in March this year, we have been building up a strong pipeline of potential customers, many of whom have started proof-of-concept engagements with us. Customers are excited to see the potential of this InfiniFlash platform, and it's enabled them to rethink how flash can structurally improve their data center capabilities, then deploy it at petabyte scale. Our InfiniFlash platform allows customers to replace hard disk drive-based solutions with our all-flash solution. InfiniFlash features excellent performance and the industry's highest density of flash at a breakthrough price point where it competes with HDD-based solutions in both total cost of ownership as well as upfront acquisition costs while solving a lot of challenges customers are facing today with scale-out deployments. As the mega trends towards cloud computing, open source software and data analytics gather momentum, InfiniFlash is the solution at the intersection of these important trends, and we are excited about this potential to accelerate flash adoption in data centers over the next several years.
Switching to client SSDs. Traction for our solutions increased with PC OEMs and in the channel. We announced and started shipping our 15-nanometer X2 client SSDs to the channel and began qualification of these drives with our OEM customers, to whom we expect to begin revenue shipments in the second half of 2015. From a market perspective, although the overall PC environment is weak, we believe OEM customers are rapidly increasing their use of SSDs due to the many benefits we have outlined in the past. For example, in the corporate market served by OEMs, CIOs have embraced the benefits of SSDs, resulting in an SSD attach rate to corporate notebooks that is expected to approach 40% by the end of 2015.
Decline in unit prices of 128-gigabyte and 256-gigabyte [ph] SSDs continues to reduce the gap when compared to HDD unit prices, with 128-gigabyte drive approaching cost parity with low-capacity HDDs. This inflection point is expected to further call the consumer notebook segment, which really has a low SSD attach rate of less than 15% to accelerate adoption of SSDs. We are well positioned to benefit from this trend with our new product offering such as the SanDisk Z400s based on 15-nanometer X2 technology and our 1Y X3-based SSDs, which offer a compelling value proposition for PC OEMs. We are excited to address this growth opportunity ahead of us as we expect SSDs will rapidly replace HDDs in laptops and desktops.
Moving on to our mobile embedded product portfolio. We completed the qualification and began shipments of our 15-nanometer X3 customized solution as planned. We have also been working on another new custom embedded 15-nanometer X3 solution that is in the late stages of customer qualification and expect to be shipping this new product in significant volume in the third quarter.
Within the iNAND product family, we are expanding the adoption of our solutions. Our 1Y X3-based iNAND products, which are designed to meet the requirements of high performance mobile platform with our innovative SMART SSD technology, are expected to ship to multiple mobile OEMs in the third quarter. Additionally, just last week at Mobile World Congress in Shanghai, we introduced an iNAND product built on 15-nanometer X3 that increases embedded capacity to 128 gigabytes, providing greater performance and cost benefits to mobile OEMs. We expect to qualify and ship these iNAND products to key mobile customers in the second half of 2015.
We are also gaining traction in newer flash markets, including connected home, automotive storage, industrial and the Internet of Things. In connected home, cable operators are beginning to use our flash storage solutions in set-top boxes to improve delivery of high demand content across their networks. 
Automakers continue to add computational power to their cars as a means of providing infotainment differentiation and advanced driver assistance capabilities.  As the automotive industry marches towards a future that will include autonomous driving, storage requirements will grow immensely, and we expect to be a leader -- leading provider of innovative solutions to this industry.
The IoT market is still in its early stages of development. However, we are excited to have been selected by some leading solution suppliers for inclusion in the IoT reference designs, which we believe will lead to expanding opportunities for flash.
In retail, we have made progress recovering from our temporary share loss experienced in Q1 '14 and Q1 '15, which was due to the supply constraints we discussed in earlier calls. Overall, retail had a good second quarter, driven by demand for imaging cards and SSDs. 
In June, we introduced a new SanDisk product category with the SanDisk Extreme 900 and SanDisk Extreme 500 external SSDs at 1.92 terabytes and 480 gigabytes of capacities, respectively. With no moving parts and significantly faster speeds than portable HDDs, these rugged external SSDs are the perfect solution for photographers and videographers on the go.
To summarize my comments on products, we have made considerable progress towards addressing our road map. Many of our new products are now at various stages of qualification, and we expect our portfolio to continue to strengthen in 2015 and throughout 2016 as well.
From a fab manufacturing perspective, our 15-nanometer technology continued ramping through the quarter, with bit output exceeding 1Y volume for Q2. The mix of X3 remained at more than 50% of total bits sold. We also completed the planned 5% wafer capacity expansion for 2015 during the second quarter. And we believe the inventory challenges we discussed on the last 2 calls are now behind us.
In 3D NAND, we have begun our equipment purchases to support the commencement of pilot production of our 48-layer architecture in the second half of 2015. We are on track to begin using the pilot line output for product samples in 2015, and we continue to expect 3D NAND product sales to begin in 2016. The 48-layer technology provides an excellent combination of increased density, higher performance and lower power compared to 2D NAND. We plan to implement our 3D NAND first in high-capacity removable products, then client SSDs and embedded solutions, followed by enterprise SSD solutions, which have longer design and qualification periods.
From a supply bit growth rate standpoint, for 2015, we expect the industry's year-over-year supply bit growth to be some port [ph] above our previous estimate of approximately 40%. And we expect our captive bit growth to be in line with the industry. For 2016, our latest estimate is that both the industry and SanDisk supply bit growth rate will be lower than in 2015.
Some of you may be wondering about the Toshiba announcement from yesterday. While there is some change to the management structure of Toshiba semiconductor business, we continue to believe that this will not impact the strategy, investments and execution of the joint venture. And that NAND remains a high priority for Toshiba.
To conclude, we are making progress in strengthening our product portfolio and improving our execution, and we are driving vigorously to regain our overall business momentum. We look forward to delivering improved results in the second half of 2015. 
I will now turn the call to Judy for the financial discussion."

Before I begin, I would like to add to Sanjay's comments on Toshiba and mention that while we are still evaluating the findings of the investigation, we do not expect Toshiba's announcement yesterday to have any impact to our financial results.
I will now review our Q2 results and then discuss our outlook, which remains within the range of expectations we outlined in April. Our second quarter revenue of $1.24 billion was down 7% sequentially and down 24% year-over-year. Our client SSD revenue declined as expected due to the end of life during Q1 of a program with a major customer, while our client SSD revenue with other OEM customers increased nicely from Q1 to Q2.
Our enterprise revenue also declined sequentially for the reasons we discussed on our April call. Embedded revenue was down sequentially in Q2 due to the seasonality of certain embedded products, while our removable revenue increased sequentially driven by seasonality and share gains.
By channel, our retail revenue increased 4% sequentially and represented 39% of our Q2 revenue mix, while commercial revenue declined 13% sequentially and represented 61% of our revenue mix.
Our gigabytes sold were down sequentially by 1% and down year-over-year by 6%, with the year-over-year decline driven largely by rebuilding of our inventory levels, combined with a loss of the client SSD program at a major customer as we have previously discussed. The decline in our blended ASP per gigabyte was more modest than in Q1, with a sequential decline of 6% and a year-over-year decline of 21%.
Our all-in costs per gigabyte declined 4% sequentially and declined 10% year-over-year. Sequentially, the key drivers of cost reduction were a weaker yen, a higher mix of 15-nanometer memory and lower inventory-related charges, with these factors partially offset by a higher mix of non-captive memory. On a year-over-year basis, cost reduction benefited from technology transition, higher mix of X3, non-memory cost reductions and a weaker yen, with these benefits partially offset by higher inventory reserves, Malaysia factory start-up costs and a higher mix of non-captive memory. 
Our non-GAAP gross margin of 42% was better than we had forecasted due primarily to product mix, with a stronger mix of retail and enterprise products and a lower mix of embedded MCP products.
The yen to dollar exchange rate in our captive memory cost of sales was JPY 117. And non-captive memory was used in 6% of our sales compared to 2% in Q1 and 1% in Q2 of last year.
Our Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses of $327 million were sequentially lower by $48 million, with the reductions stemming from lower charges for restructuring and other, a reduction in force which was largely completed in the second quarter, and some engineering project expenses which shifted from the second quarter to the second half. Our Q2 non-GAAP operating margin, inclusive of the restructuring and other charges, was 15%, consistent with the Q1 non-GAAP operating margin.
In Q2, our non-GAAP other income of $10 million included $7 million of onetime gain related to foreign exchange and venture investments.
Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate remained at 32%, while our Q2 GAAP tax rate was 11% due to a discrete benefit from a tax audit settlement. 
The reduction in our non-GAAP diluted share count was driven by a full quarter weighting of our Q1 share repurchases, a partial weighting of the 3.7 million shares repurchased in Q2 and elimination of dilution from the 2017 warrants related to our convertible debt as the warrants were not in the money for Q2.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Our share of Flash Venture fab investments during Q2 was $233 million, and non-fab capital investments were $96 million. With these total gross capital investments of $329 million, we utilized cash of $80 million, with the difference funded by new joint venture equipment leases of $97 million and joint venture working capital.
And our off-balance sheet joint venture equipment lease guarantees stood at $636 million at the end of Q2.
Our inventory increased sequentially by $68 million. And on a petabyte basis, the inventory reflects approximately 12 weeks of forward supply. We expect to continue holding inventory at approximately this level of weeks in order to provide adequate supply for our diverse products and customers.
For Q2, cash flow from operations was $29 million compared to $309 million in Q1 and $241 million in Q2 of 2014. The primary drivers of the sequential decline in cash flow from operations were the seasonality of our accounts receivable, which is typically a source of cash in Q1 and a use of cash in Q2, coupled with a planned increase in our inventory levels. On a year-over-year basis, the decline in cash flow from operations was driven primarily by the decline in net income and the growth in inventory.
Free cash flow for Q2 was a negative $52 million, and we spent $250 million on share repurchases and $63 million on the quarterly dividend. Our cash ended the quarter at $4.0 billion on a gross basis and $1.5 billion net of debt.
We expect our cash flow from operations to be at a significantly stronger run rate in the second half compared to Q2. And we currently plan to continue share repurchases in the second half of 2015.
Now I'll turn to our outlook. Our current estimate for 2015 revenue remains within the range of $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion that we provided in April. We expect the majority of our sequential second half revenue growth to come from mobile embedded products, with a significant portion of this revenue forecasted on the cusp between Q3 and Q4. The ramp timing of several mobile embedded products, along with the market success of our customers' mobile products, are key variables in where we land in our forecasted 2015 revenue range. For the third quarter, we estimate our revenue to be in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion.
We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin for the second half of the year to be in the range of 40% to 43%. Compared to Q2, we expect the key factors impacting second half gross margin to be an increased mix of mobile embedded sales, which will have a negative impact on gross margin, and a slightly weaker yen to dollar rate coupled with higher sales volume, which will have a positive impact. For Q3, we expect the yen to dollar rate and cost of sales to be approximately JPY 120.
We expect non-GAAP operating expenses in Q3 to be between $335 million and $345 million and continue to expect full year 2015 non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately or slightly below $1.4 billion. For the second half, we expect our non-GAAP other income and expense to be approximately breakeven and our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at approximately 32%.
Our 2015 fab and non-fab capital investments forecast remains at $1.4 billion, with $709 million purchased in the first half. And our 2015 forecasted cash usage for capital investments remains at approximately $500 million, with $190 million used in the first half.
To conclude my remarks, we look forward to delivering sequential growth in revenue and earnings in the second half of the year as we continue to focus on improving our execution and strengthening our product portfolio.

In terms of X3, our X3 mix remains over 50% of our sales, and we expect that our X3 mix will increase both due primarily to our mobile embedded products as well as our client SSD products. And that's factored into our expectations as well. And of course, we are planning to begin the transition of some of our existing capacity to 3D in 2016. In terms of percent of capacity that is on 3D, I believe that was another of your questions, our expectation is for the industry -- that the industry will likely exit 2016 in the range of 15% to 20% of wafer capacity on 3D. And our expectation is that we will likely be around the low end of that range."

So as you mentioned, enterprise performed better than you expected. And looking at the retail mix -- or rather I should say the removal mix is increased substantially. So first of all, on the enterprise side, you mentioned a number of product improvements, the PCIe with captive NAND, the 2-terabyte SATA and a few other things. But as far as I can see, correct me if I'm wrong, these are not impacting revenue in Q2. Could you correct me if I'm wrong? And if so, what is driving the improvement in enterprise solutions? I guess I didn't quite catch that. What is the core reason? Is it pricing-related? Is it demand being better? Or is it share? So that's the first part of the question. And then similarly, on removable, you've made a substantial improvement to the mix there. And as I recall back in Q4 last year, that was a big reason for the disappointment in Q4 was the removable mix. So there's -- removable on retail was very disappointing due to not the right bits. I believe it was not enough X3. And you had said at that time that, that problem was going to continue to Q1.

Our second quarter results benefited from more favorable performance than expected in enterprise and retail. We are also making good progress in strengthening our product road map and customer engagements. For the second half of 2015, we expect the industry environment to remain stable and look forward to delivering sequential revenue and profit growth as we continue to make progress in enhancing our execution.
In our April 8 conference call, we discussed the pending requalification of a new embedded component for our customers' use in their client SSD application. We have completed the SanDisk internal validation of this new product, and the qualification work on the customers' side is progressing well. We expect to complete the full customer requalification process in the third quarter and begin revenue shipment soon thereafter.
In enterprise SSDs, our Fusion-io revenue grew sequentially in Q2. We also announced our next-generation Fusion ioMemory PCIe application accelerators based on our 1Y NAND technology, enabling a significantly lower price point for our customers. We believe that the more competitive pricing enabled by our captive memory-based PCIe product will open up new workloads for this new product -- for this product category. We are currently shipping these captive NAND-based PCIe solutions through distribution channels, and customer qualifications at several OEMs are expected to be completed in the second half of this year.
Another factor that we believe will stimulate the future expansion of the enterprise PCIe market is the expected broadening deployment of NVMe infrastructure and availability of NVMe PCIe solution in 2016 and 2017. In addition, PCIe flash solutions offer high-performance RAM SATA SSDs due to the lower latency and high bandwidths of PCIe. We plan to begin addressing the NVMe PCIe market opportunity with a new offering available for qualification in mid-2016.
To increase SanDisk penetration in the enterprise SATA market, I'm pleased to report that we introduced the CloudSpeed Eco Gen. II, a highly competitive 15 nanometer-based 2-terabyte SATA SSD in the second quarter. The solution is now in qualification at multiple hyperscale customers, with revenue contribution expected to begin later this year. 
Our enterprise SAS SSD sales performed well during the quarter, driven by better-than-expected demand for several of our products. Our 4-terabyte Optimus MAX SAS SSD was the first of its kind in the market and is making a compelling case for the replacement of 15K and 10K rpm enterprise HDDs. The Optimus MAX SSD has become an important high-capacity solution for one of our OEM customers all-flash array offerings. Several other OEM and hyperscale customers are now qualifying our 4-terabyte enterprise SAS SSD because they see the value of reducing the total cost of acquisition and ownership by utilizing this highest capacity solution. We are developing our next-generation 15 nanometer-based 12-gig SAS SSD with highest capacity and performance and expect to introduce that solution to market in 2016, with revenue contribution starting in late 2016.
We are excited about the progress we are making with our next-generation converged platform for enterprise products, which brings the best technologies and IP together from our various acquisitions. This converged platform will be heavily leveraged across multiple product families in the enterprise segment and allow us to offer market-leading products integrated with our next-generation 3D NAND memories. Given the long engineering development cycle typically associated with such major programs, we expect to start sampling products based on this new architecture in 2017. While we expect to continue to grow our enterprise revenue over the next couple of years, we aim to rapidly increase our market momentum once this converged architecture is introduced into volume production.
Turning to our enterprise system and software solution offerings. Since our announcement of our breakthrough InfiniFlash platform in March this year, we have been building up a strong pipeline of potential customers, many of whom have started proof-of-concept engagements with us. Customers are excited to see the potential of this InfiniFlash platform, and it's enabled them to rethink how flash can structurally improve their data center capabilities, then deploy it at petabyte scale. Our InfiniFlash platform allows customers to replace hard disk drive-based solutions with our all-flash solution. InfiniFlash features excellent performance and the industry's highest density of flash at a breakthrough price point where it competes with HDD-based solutions in both total cost of ownership as well as upfront acquisition costs while solving a lot of challenges customers are facing today with scale-out deployments. As the mega trends towards cloud computing, open source software and data analytics gather momentum, InfiniFlash is the solution at the intersection of these important trends, and we are excited about this potential to accelerate flash adoption in data centers over the next several years.
Switching to client SSDs. Traction for our solutions increased with PC OEMs and in the channel. We announced and started shipping our 15-nanometer X2 client SSDs to the channel and began qualification of these drives with our OEM customers, to whom we expect to begin revenue shipments in the second half of 2015. From a market perspective, although the overall PC environment is weak, we believe OEM customers are rapidly increasing their use of SSDs due to the many benefits we have outlined in the past. For example, in the corporate market served by OEMs, CIOs have embraced the benefits of SSDs, resulting in an SSD attach rate to corporate notebooks that is expected to approach 40% by the end of 2015.
Decline in unit prices of 128-gigabyte and 256-gigabyte [ph] SSDs continues to reduce the gap when compared to HDD unit prices, with 128-gigabyte drive approaching cost parity with low-capacity HDDs. This inflection point is expected to further call the consumer notebook segment, which really has a low SSD attach rate of less than 15% to accelerate adoption of SSDs. We are well positioned to benefit from this trend with our new product offering such as the SanDisk Z400s based on 15-nanometer X2 technology and our 1Y X3-based SSDs, which offer a compelling value proposition for PC OEMs. We are excited to address this growth opportunity ahead of us as we expect SSDs will rapidly replace HDDs in laptops and desktops.
Moving on to our mobile embedded product portfolio. We completed the qualification and began shipments of our 15-nanometer X3 customized solution as planned. We have also been working on another new custom embedded 15-nanometer X3 solution that is in the late stages of customer qualification and expect to be shipping this new product in significant volume in the third quarter.
Within the iNAND product family, we are expanding the adoption of our solutions. Our 1Y X3-based iNAND products, which are designed to meet the requirements of high performance mobile platform with our innovative SMART SSD technology, are expected to ship to multiple mobile OEMs in the third quarter. Additionally, just last week at Mobile World Congress in Shanghai, we introduced an iNAND product built on 15-nanometer X3 that increases embedded capacity to 128 gigabytes, providing greater performance and cost benefits to mobile OEMs. We expect to qualify and ship these iNAND products to key mobile customers in the second half of 2015.
We are also gaining traction in newer flash markets, including connected home, automotive storage, industrial and the Internet of Things. In connected home, cable operators are beginning to use our flash storage solutions in set-top boxes to improve delivery of high demand content across their networks. 
Automakers continue to add computational power to their cars as a means of providing infotainment differentiation and advanced driver assistance capabilities.  As the automotive industry marches towards a future that will include autonomous driving, storage requirements will grow immensely, and we expect to be a leader -- leading provider of innovative solutions to this industry.
The IoT market is still in its early stages of development. However, we are excited to have been selected by some leading solution suppliers for inclusion in the IoT reference designs, which we believe will lead to expanding opportunities for flash.
In retail, we have made progress recovering from our temporary share loss experienced in Q1 '14 and Q1 '15, which was due to the supply constraints we discussed in earlier calls. Overall, retail had a good second quarter, driven by demand for imaging cards and SSDs. 
In June, we introduced a new SanDisk product category with the SanDisk Extreme 900 and SanDisk Extreme 500 external SSDs at 1.92 terabytes and 480 gigabytes of capacities, respectively. With no moving parts and significantly faster speeds than portable HDDs, these rugged external SSDs are the perfect solution for photographers and videographers on the go.
To summarize my comments on products, we have made considerable progress towards addressing our road map. Many of our new products are now at various stages of qualification, and we expect our portfolio to continue to strengthen in 2015 and throughout 2016 as well.
From a fab manufacturing perspective, our 15-nanometer technology continued ramping through the quarter, with bit output exceeding 1Y volume for Q2. The mix of X3 remained at more than 50% of total bits sold. We also completed the planned 5% wafer capacity expansion for 2015 during the second quarter. And we believe the inventory challenges we discussed on the last 2 calls are now behind us.
In 3D NAND, we have begun our equipment purchases to support the commencement of pilot production of our 48-layer architecture in the second half of 2015. We are on track to begin using the pilot line output for product samples in 2015, and we continue to expect 3D NAND product sales to begin in 2016. The 48-layer technology provides an excellent combination of increased density, higher performance and lower power compared to 2D NAND. We plan to implement our 3D NAND first in high-capacity removable products, then client SSDs and embedded solutions, followed by enterprise SSD solutions, which have longer design and qualification periods.
From a supply bit growth rate standpoint, for 2015, we expect the industry's year-over-year supply bit growth to be some port [ph] above our previous estimate of approximately 40%. And we expect our captive bit growth to be in line with the industry. For 2016, our latest estimate is that both the industry and SanDisk supply bit growth rate will be lower than in 2015.
Some of you may be wondering about the Toshiba announcement from yesterday. While there is some change to the management structure of Toshiba semiconductor business, we continue to believe that this will not impact the strategy, investments and execution of the joint venture. And that NAND remains a high priority for Toshiba.
To conclude, we are making progress in strengthening our product portfolio and improving our execution, and we are driving vigorously to regain our overall business momentum. We look forward to delivering improved results in the second half of 2015. 
I will now turn the call to Judy for the financial discussion."

Before I begin, I would like to add to Sanjay's comments on Toshiba and mention that while we are still evaluating the findings of the investigation, we do not expect Toshiba's announcement yesterday to have any impact to our financial results.
I will now review our Q2 results and then discuss our outlook, which remains within the range of expectations we outlined in April. Our second quarter revenue of $1.24 billion was down 7% sequentially and down 24% year-over-year. Our client SSD revenue declined as expected due to the end of life during Q1 of a program with a major customer, while our client SSD revenue with other OEM customers increased nicely from Q1 to Q2.
Our enterprise revenue also declined sequentially for the reasons we discussed on our April call. Embedded revenue was down sequentially in Q2 due to the seasonality of certain embedded products, while our removable revenue increased sequentially driven by seasonality and share gains.
By channel, our retail revenue increased 4% sequentially and represented 39% of our Q2 revenue mix, while commercial revenue declined 13% sequentially and represented 61% of our revenue mix.
Our gigabytes sold were down sequentially by 1% and down year-over-year by 6%, with the year-over-year decline driven largely by rebuilding of our inventory levels, combined with a loss of the client SSD program at a major customer as we have previously discussed. The decline in our blended ASP per gigabyte was more modest than in Q1, with a sequential decline of 6% and a year-over-year decline of 21%.
Our all-in costs per gigabyte declined 4% sequentially and declined 10% year-over-year. Sequentially, the key drivers of cost reduction were a weaker yen, a higher mix of 15-nanometer memory and lower inventory-related charges, with these factors partially offset by a higher mix of non-captive memory. On a year-over-year basis, cost reduction benefited from technology transition, higher mix of X3, non-memory cost reductions and a weaker yen, with these benefits partially offset by higher inventory reserves, Malaysia factory start-up costs and a higher mix of non-captive memory. 
Our non-GAAP gross margin of 42% was better than we had forecasted due primarily to product mix, with a stronger mix of retail and enterprise products and a lower mix of embedded MCP products.
The yen to dollar exchange rate in our captive memory cost of sales was JPY 117. And non-captive memory was used in 6% of our sales compared to 2% in Q1 and 1% in Q2 of last year.
Our Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses of $327 million were sequentially lower by $48 million, with the reductions stemming from lower charges for restructuring and other, a reduction in force which was largely completed in the second quarter, and some engineering project expenses which shifted from the second quarter to the second half. Our Q2 non-GAAP operating margin, inclusive of the restructuring and other charges, was 15%, consistent with the Q1 non-GAAP operating margin.
In Q2, our non-GAAP other income of $10 million included $7 million of onetime gain related to foreign exchange and venture investments.
Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate remained at 32%, while our Q2 GAAP tax rate was 11% due to a discrete benefit from a tax audit settlement. 
The reduction in our non-GAAP diluted share count was driven by a full quarter weighting of our Q1 share repurchases, a partial weighting of the 3.7 million shares repurchased in Q2 and elimination of dilution from the 2017 warrants related to our convertible debt as the warrants were not in the money for Q2.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Our share of Flash Venture fab investments during Q2 was $233 million, and non-fab capital investments were $96 million. With these total gross capital investments of $329 million, we utilized cash of $80 million, with the difference funded by new joint venture equipment leases of $97 million and joint venture working capital.
Our off-balance sheet joint venture equipment lease guarantees stood at $636 million at the end of Q2.
Our inventory increased sequentially by $68 million. And on a petabyte basis, the inventory reflects approximately 12 weeks of forward supply. We expect to continue holding inventory at approximately this level of weeks in order to provide adequate supply for our diverse products and customers.
For Q2, cash flow from operations was $29 million compared to $309 million in Q1 and $241 million in Q2 of 2014. The primary drivers of the sequential decline in cash flow from operations were the seasonality of our accounts receivable, which is typically a source of cash in Q1 and a use of cash in Q2, coupled with a planned increase in our inventory levels. On a year-over-year basis, the decline in cash flow from operations was driven primarily by the decline in net income and the growth in inventory.
Free cash flow for Q2 was a negative $52 million, and we spent $250 million on share repurchases and $63 million on the quarterly dividend. Our cash ended the quarter at $4.0 billion on a gross basis and $1.5 billion net of debt.
We expect our cash flow from operations to be at a significantly stronger run rate in the second half compared to Q2. And we currently plan to continue share repurchases in the second half of 2015.
Now I'll turn to our outlook. Our current estimate for 2015 revenue remains within the range of $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion that we provided in April. We expect the majority of our sequential second half revenue growth to come from mobile embedded products, with a significant portion of this revenue forecasted on the cusp between Q3 and Q4. The ramp timing of several mobile embedded products, along with the market success of our customers' mobile products, are key variables in where we land in our forecasted 2015 revenue range. For the third quarter, we estimate our revenue to be in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion.
We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin for the second half of the year to be in the range of 40% to 43%. Compared to Q2, we expect the key factors impacting second half gross margin to be an increased mix of mobile embedded sales, which will have a negative impact on gross margin, and a slightly weaker yen to dollar rate coupled with higher sales volume, which will have a positive impact. For Q3, we expect the yen to dollar rate and cost of sales to be approximately JPY 120.
We expect non-GAAP operating expenses in Q3 to be between $335 million and $345 million and continue to expect full year 2015 non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately or slightly below $1.4 billion. For the second half, we expect our non-GAAP other income and expense to be approximately breakeven and our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at approximately 32%.
Our 2015 fab and non-fab capital investments forecast remains at $1.4 billion, with $709 million purchased in the first half. And our 2015 forecasted cash usage for capital investments remains at approximately $500 million, with $190 million used in the first half.
To conclude my remarks, we look forward to delivering sequential growth in revenue and earnings in the second half of the year as we continue to focus on improving our execution and strengthening our product portfolio.

And SanDisk has a unique view, given the hundreds of thousands of stores that it ships products into. As you look across the retail business and look at the intensity of demand, can you just characterize some of the regions globally where demand is either tracking well and in line with expectations or where there might have been variances either on the upside or downside versus the expectations in the quarter that you reported?"

However, we have always said that the TAM for retail in general is declining year-over-year in single digits, in mid-single-digit rate. And that's because imaging is moving to the phones, to the smartphones. Therefore, [indiscernible] camera sales, of course, are going down. And associated with that, imaging card sales are going down as well. USB also is overall the market that is somewhat in a decline. Mobile cards, of course, is a category that is one of the largest categories within retail and does grow. But of course, there are embedded -- phones with -- that have embedded solutions as well. So overall, TAM for retail declining, but certain pockets of weakness. But SanDisk's focus is with our strong penetration in retail channels across the globe with our strong brand, with a broad portfolio of solutions and very strong recognition of SanDisk's high quality of products in the retail brand. Our goal, of course, is to continue to gain share in the retail channel and use that to drive a strong position across the globe here. We mentioned that we -- in terms of our retail share position, because of the amount of the supply challenges that we had in Q4 and Q1 time frame, we lost some shares. But we are back on track in terms of positioning our share gains well in the retail channels."
