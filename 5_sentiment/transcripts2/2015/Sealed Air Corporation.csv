We exceeded our financial objectives in the fourth quarter and for the full year. We delivered 8% adjusted EBITDA growth in 2014 and expanded margins by 90 basis points despite currency headwinds. We had favorable price/mix in every region and in every division in the quarter and for the full year. We improved the health of our balance sheet and generated over $600 million of -- in free cash flow. We continued on our innovation path, including, for example, Diversey Care, Instapak and [indiscernible] platform. We also announced the relocation of our headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina, and launched a new website. These are just some of the many successes that we had over the last 12 months. And while we are pleased with our 2014 financial results, we still believe that there's significant improvement to be had in terms of top line potential growth and further margin expansion, as well as maximizing our free cash flow generation.
But before we review our fourth quarter and year-end results, I want to share some insights on how we are approaching 2015. Based on foreign exchange rates today, we are assuming unfavorable currency translation of approximately $550 million in sales and $80 million on EBITDA in 2015. And while we anticipate as reported sales in 2015 to be down approximately 5% compared to 2014, we expect to grow approximately 2.5% in constant currency and are confident that we will deliver adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion. EBITDA growth and margin expansion will be driven not only for favored -- not only by February input costs, but also our continued focus on value-adding selling, operational disciplines and earnings quality improvement efforts.
With that said, let me turn back on the fourth quarter and year-end results, and Carol will provide, of course, more details on our 2015 outlook.
Let's start with 2014 full year performance by region on Slide 4. Net sales were up slightly on an as-reported basis and are up 3% in constant currency. Currency translation had a negative $183 million impact on net sales in 2014. By region, sales in North America increased 3% on a constant-currency basis due to 5% growth in Product Care, 2% growth in both Food Care and Diversey Care. In Europe, sales improved in constant-currency basis each quarter throughout the year, resulting in a modest increase in constant-currency sales in 2014 as compared to a slight decline in 2013. Latin America and AMAT were our fastest-growing regions in constant-currency sales growth in the middle -- in the high single digits. Constant-currency sales in Japan, Australia and New Zealand were up 2% in 2014.
On Slide 5, you can see our performance by region for the fourth quarter. Net sales declined 2% on an as-reported basis but were up 3% in constant currency. Currency translation had a negative $105 million impact on net sales in the quarter compared to $183 million for the full year. Sales in North America were up 2%, led by 5% growth in Product Care and 4% growth in Diversey Care. Food Care sales were essentially unchanged compared to last year. Sales in Europe were down 6% on a reported basis and up 2% in constant currency.
To be more specific on our performance in Europe, let me provide you with country trends on a constant-currency basis in the quarter, as the U.K. delivered strong growth of 9% with double-digit growth in Food Care and mid-single-digit growth in Diversey Care and Product Care. Spain, Switzerland and Holland were flat to slightly up, while France, Italy and Germany declined. The 7 countries I just referenced accounted for 21% of our fourth quarter's consolidated sales. And I also would like to highlight that Russia continued to deliver strong growth with net sales in Q4 increasing 5% on an as-reported basis, which translate approximately 40% growth in constant currency.
Moving on to Latin America and AMAT. Both regions delivered constant-currency sales growth in the high single-digit in the quarter. And in AMAT, China and India, delivered double-digit sales growth. And in Latin America, Brazil and Mexico, delivered mid-single-digit growth. On an as-reported basis, AMAT was up approximately 3% and Latin America down 4% in the fourth quarter as a result of significant currency devaluations. Constant-currency sales in Japan, Australia and New Zealand were up slightly in the quarter. Growth in Australia was slightly offset by the decline in New Zealand.
On Slide 6, we will [indiscernible] our price/mix volume trends and sales growth on a constant-dollar basis by division and by region. As you can see from the slide, we have constant-currency sales growth and variable price/mix in every division and every region in the fourth quarter and in 2014. Food Care had solid performance despite the challenging protein market in North America. Constant-currency sales in both Diversey Care and Product Care improved each quarter throughout the year. We also stayed focused on our commitment to shift our business to our more innovative, value-added solutions and provide best-in-class service to our customers on a global basis. We have made significant progress on this front, but there's still plenty of room for improvement as we continue to evolve into a knowledge-based company. You will hear more about all of this at our Analyst Day on June 18 in New York City.
Turning to our performance by division. I will focus my comments on fourth quarter results on a constant-currency basis. On Slide 7, Food Care sales increased 3% with approximately 3% in packaging and 2% in hygiene. Latin America increased sales by 10% and AMAT increased 2%. Europe had a strong performance with a growth of 5%, while North America was relatively flat. Developing regions, which include Latin America, AMAT and Eastern European countries delivered double-digit growth led by strong performance in Argentina, Russia and China. In Europe, packaging sales increased nearly 9%, while hygiene declined 3%. The protein market was up slightly in the quarter, which helps, but we also continued to see increased demand for our value-added solutions and new platforms. In hygiene, you know that we continue to prune low-margin businesses. And while these efforts impacted top line, it made a significant contribution to our EBITDA margin performance. Food Care adjusted EBITDA in Europe delivered margin expansions of 300 basis points in 2014. This significant improvement was due to a combination of a low-margin pruning and operational improvements in our hygiene business as well as the accelerated adoption of our innovative packaging portfolio. In North America, capital and production were down approximately 8% and 4%, respectively, compared to last year. Despite this unfavorable market trends in North America, our sales were relatively flat compared to last year due to favorable product mix and better pricing. To reiterate what we said in our last earnings call, we believe the this cycle is close to the bottom, and we expect that the rate of decline to moderate over the next 12 months. It is worth noting that on a global basis, our 3 largest market segments: fresh red meats, smoked and processed and poultry, delivered sales growth in the quarter and for the full year. Poultry had also been a key growth driver in North America and in Latin America. The strong performance is a direct result of increased demand for our advanced solutions such as case-ready, Darfresh, Fluids, Grip & Tear and QuickRip. We introduced Darfresh entrée during the fourth quarter, and we have already experienced significant traction in both Europe and North America. Darfresh entrée is a system solution that reduces food waste in the total distribution system, while also utilizing less material.
I want to highlight the EBITDA margin performance in the fourth quarter for Food Care. Adjusted EBITDA of $172 million or 17.5% of net sales increased 8% compared to last year. This increase was largely a result of pricing discipline, improved mix and cost synergies. And for the full year, Food Care's net sales of $3.8 billion increased 4% in constant currency and was essentially unchanged on an as-reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin in 2014 of 17.5% increased 140 basis points over 2013, which is an outstanding performance. And going forward in '15, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion, favorable input cost and our continued focus on innovation and operational discipline are expected to more than offset the forecasted currency headwinds.
Slide 8 highlights the results from our Diversey division. Diversey Care net sales in constant-currency basis were up 4% in the fourth quarter. Volume and price/mix were up approximately 2% each. Developing regions increased 11%, led by 16% [ph] growth in Latin America and 10% growth in AMAT. Our fastest-growing countries where China, India and Brazil. And North America increased sales 4%, which is our strongest performance in North America over the last 24 months. In Europe, sales were essentially unchanged. Positive trends in the U.K. and Switzerland, offset by declines in France and Germany. Holland, Italy and Spain were relatively flat. And from an end market perspective on a global basis, our strongest sectors in the quarter were Building service contractors and hospitality. We have had a number of solid customer wins that are beginning to ramp up and contribute to our top line results. And during the quarter, we introduced, amongst others, the TASKI XP platform, a stand-alone -- a stand-on, sorry, flow care machine that delivers 30% more productivity than the conventional work behind flow care machines. As you can see, we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $58 million or 10.9% of net sales in the quarter. We are beginning to reap the benefits of our targeted investments in R&D and sales and marketing, but unfavorable currency translation and certain supply chain costs had a negative impact on margins during that fourth quarter.
Diversey Care generates nearly 45% of its sales from Europe, and its performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year was negatively impacted by currency declines. For the full year, Diversey Care's net sales of $2.2 billion increased 3% in constant currency and were essentially unchanged on an as-reported basis. But adjusted EBITDA in '14 of $245 million increased 3% compared to last year. To be noted is that excluding unfavorable currency translation in the fourth quarter and in 2014, Diversey Care's adjusted EBITDA was up 5% and 8%, respectively. In 2015, we expect Diversey Care's adjusted EBITDA growth to be moderated due to its high exposure to the euro.
Turning to Slide 9. Product Care delivered 5% constant-currency sales in the fourth quarter -- sales growth in the fourth quarter, which is its highest growth rate all year. This growth was attributable to favorable price/mix of 4%. And as we have continued to shift our business towards high-performance solutions, including cushioning and packaging systems, and continued to focus on improved -- improving the quality of our general use business. As we have discussed, growth in e-commerce and third-party logistics is increasing demand for our cushioning and packaging systems. And we expect these trends to continue going forward. If you recall last quarter, I highlighted the Instapak Simple as one of our key innovations that brings the benefit of cost-effective, high-performance damage reduction to emerging regions and the e-commerce market. This product was successfully launched from October of last year. North America, which accounts for about 60% [ph] of our Product Care business increased sales 5%. Europe represents just over 20% of Product Care sales and had its strongest performance of the year with over 3% growth. AMAT also had its strongest performance of the year with 11% sales growth. And AMAT and Japan, Australia, New Zealand combined account for just under 20% of Product Care sales, but it is worth highlighting that both China and Japan had double-digit growth in the quarter. Latin America accounts for only 4% of Product Care sales and declined 2% due to the rationalization efforts that were completed during the quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 6% to $77 million or 79% of net sales. Growth in cushioning and packaging systems, along with product and customer rationalization actions in general use, have a significant impact on our adjusted EBITDA margins in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. Every quarter in 2014, we delivered both top line and adjusted EBITDA growth. For the full year, Product Care's net sales of $1.7 billion increased 4% in constant currency and 3% on an as-reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 10% compared to last year and margins improved 120 basis points to 17.7%. The rates of adjusted EBITDA growth supports sales growth throughout the year, underscoring our commitment to securing the appropriate value for our solutions. Going forward in 2015, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion, favorable input costs and our continuous focus on innovation and operation discipline in general use are expected to more than offset currency headwinds.
And now let me pass the call to Carol to review our total sales and EBITDA bridges cash flow and outlook for 2015. Carol?"

Turning to Slide 10 and Slide 11. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with net sales on Slide 10. We delivered $2 billion in sales in the fourth quarter and $7.8 bill",1414,"Thank you, Jerome. Turning to Slide 10 and Slide 11. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with net sales on Slide 10. We delivered $2 billion in sales in the fourth quarter and $7.8 billion for the year. On a constant-currency basis, sales increased approximately 3% for both periods. Sales growth was attributable to favorable price/mix, which was 3% or $61 million in the quarter and 3.2% or $249 million for the full year. Volume was essentially unchanged in both periods. Unfavorable currency translation was $105 million in the quarter and $183 million for the full year. Approximately 20% of our total sales are exposed to the euro, approximately 4% to the Brazilian real and then we have approximately 2% exposure to both the Russian ruble and the Turkish lira.
Turning to Slide 11. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 4% on a year-over-year basis to $282 million or 14.3% of net sales. For the total company, the increase in adjusted EBITDA was due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of $48 million. Cost synergies were $22 million in the quarter.
Selling, general and administrative and other expenses increased by $40 million, of which $17 million was attributable to an increase in incentive performance-based compensation and $14 million was related to salary inflation. Currency translation had a negative $17 million impact on EBITDA in the quarter. Despite currency headwinds, we delivered a 100 basis point improvement in adjusted gross profit margin and a 90 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA increased 8% year-over-year to $1.12 or to $1.12 billion [ph] or 14.4% of net sales. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of 3.2% or $150 million on essentially flat volume. Cost synergies of $97 million were more than offset by an increase in SG&A and other expenses of $127 million, of which $46 million was attributable to an increase in incentive performance-based compensation and $54 million was related to salary inflation. For the full year, currency had a negative impact of $30 million on adjusted EBITDA, yet we delivered a 100 basis point improvement in adjusted gross profit margin and a 90 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to 2013. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.59 as compared to $0.39 in the fourth quarter last year. 2014 EPS was $1.86 as compared to $1.39 and 2013, an increase of over 30%. The 2014 tax rate of 22% was lower than our previously provided guidance of 27%, largely due to the December enactment of credit extenders as well as favorable earnings mix. In 2013, our tax rate was 21%.
During the fourth quarter 2014, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares for approximately $50 million at an average price of $36 per share. For the full year, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares for $184 million at an average price of $34 per share. This includes approximately 3.9 million shares purchased from the WRG Asbestos Personal Injury Trust in the second quarter of 2014. Since the beginning of this year, 2015, we have repurchased approximately 498,000 shares for $21 million at an average price of $41 per share. We will continue to be active in the market and have the capacity to buy an additional $69 million in shares through the end of 2015. We continue to evaluate alternatives that will enable us to increase returns to our shareholders and maintain our target leverage of 3.5x to 4x.
Now turning to Slide 12. Free cash flow was, of course, up $612 million in 2014, excluding the grace settlement. This compares favorably to a source of $509 million in 2013 due to higher earnings and an improvement in operating working capital management. Operating working capital, as a percent of net sales, improved from 17% at the end of 2013 to 14% at the end of 2013 compared to 14% at the end of 2014. The company focuses its management of operating working capital on a 13-month average target. Through the 13-month period ending December 31, 2014, the average for operating working capital, as a percent of net sales, was 17%. This represents a 200 basis point improvement compared to 2013. CapEx was $154 million, and cash restructuring cost were $108 million in 2014. Cash payments related to SARS were $21 million as compared with $46 million in the prior year. Cash interest payment in 2014, excluding the settlement, were $293 million compared to $290 million in 2013.
Turning to Slide 13. In December 2014, we issued $425 million 4 7/8 senior notes due 2022 and $425 million 5 1/8 senior notes due 2024. Net proceeds from the offering were used to repurchase the $750 million 8 1/8 senior notes. In July, we amended and restated our senior secured credit facilities. All together, these transactions reduce our annualized interest expense by approximately $30 million, provide extended maturities an increase covenant flexibility.
Turning to Slide 14, our outlook for 2015 is presented. We expect net sales to be approximately $7.4 billion, a decline of approximately 5% on a reported basis, but an increase of approximately 2.5% in constant currency. As Jerome mentioned earlier, we estimate an unfavorable impact of approximately $550 million on sales from foreign currency translation. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.18 as compared to 2014 adjusted EPS of $1.86. We anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 25% in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be in the range of $1.15 billion to $1.18 billion or approximately 3% to 5.5% growth rate on a reported basis. Currency is estimated to have a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $80 million. We are confident that we can achieve the level of EBITDA presented as we continue to focus on our discipline to improve the quality of earnings and benefit from favorable input cost. Additionally, we expect approximately $50 million in cost synergy, most of which will come from the earnings quality and improvement restructuring program. In late December, our board approved a new restructuring program, The Fusion Program, which will consist of projects across our 3 divisions as well as functional support. This program is expected to generate savings of approximately $80 million to $85 million by the end of 2018. We do not expect to realize any savings from this program until early 2016. The cost of The Fusion Program is expected to be approximately $275 million to $285 million, of which the net cash outflow is expected to be in the range of $210 million to $220 million. We anticipate the proceeds from asset sales and state incentives to be approximately $65 million. Our guidance for free cash flow is approximately $600 million for 2015, which excludes the tax refund related to the grace settlement of approximately $245 million. Our outlook for free cash flow is derived from higher earnings, improvement from working capital and lower cash interest payments, offset by higher restructuring cash cost and capital expenditures as compared to 2014. Cash restructuring cost, excluding restructuring CapEx, are expected to be $120 million. This $120 million consists of approximately $50 million from previously announced restructuring programs and approximately $70 million from the new Fusion Program. Capital expenditures are expected to be $180 million, which includes approximately $45 million of CapEx related to restructuring activities. In 2014, CapEx was $154 million, of which approximately $25 million was related to restructuring. The year-over-year increase in CapEx for 2015 as compared to 2014, excluding the restructuring activities I just mentioned, is associated with target growth projects for Food Care, Product Care and Diversey Care and R&D pilot plant in the second phase of our ERP implementation. Cash interest payments are expected to be $255 million, and cash taxes are expected to be $110 million.
Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, April 28 at 8:30 a.m. And Ken Chrisman, President of our Product Care division, will be joining us for that discussion. We are also hosting our Analyst Day on Thursday, June 18, in New York City, as previously mentioned. I look forward to speaking with you again in the near future.
With that, operator, can you please open the call for questions?"

We're going to see volume growth in the 3 divisions, led by Diversey Care and Product Care and also some in Food Care. So the story of price/mix is going to be somewhat different than the one  of 2014 because obviously the resin prices have been and are coming down. And as a result of that, it is not so much price which is going to be important into 2015, but just margin and margin expansion. And we do believe that we're going to be having margin expansion from all kind of things. Number one, we need to remember that we are in a recovery mode. We have lost a lot of pricing over the past few years, and we need to rehabilitate pricing. This is true for what I would call the commodity parts of our portfolio, specifically in Product Care and in Food Care. In Product Care, we still have a whole segment which is we call the general use, which I would tend to call the more commoditized type of product line. And those, whereas they have been doing better in 2014, they are far from being at an acceptable level. So we're going to be holding very firm, and we are holding very firm on our pricing. We'll only respond to competitive aggression, and that's all we're going to do. On Food Care, we do have some regional weaknesses in some product lines, and that is what we're going to be addressing on pricing. Obviously, currency translation is hurting. And as they are continue to go down, because the dollar is revaluating regularly amongst almost all currencies, we are -- we need to adjust our pricing."

So Jerome and Carol, as we think about how you have confidence in that goal, which you said you did, is most of the progress towards that going to come from mix and further value selling? Or will more of that come from productivity or other buckets? And within that, how do we think about the mixture across the 3 segments? And the last thing is, sounds like Diversey will have a tough time growing this year because of FX. Would you confirm that or add color?"

The big hitter in 2015 is obviously that we're going to have more than $0.5 billion of currency translation. Just imagine, just go back one second to the fourth quarter and imagine us publishing a constant-currency EBITDA number of about $300 million in the fourth quarter, which is what you would get if you add the $280 million and the $17 million of EBITDA currency translation loss. So you would have -- we would've all celebrated an extraordinary quarter. I can assure you that we would have just blown away our numbers on constant-currency basis for 2015. But life is what it is, and we're taking -- we have felt it was coming actually very early in the fourth -- in September actually. And we have started very early to take measures. Hence, our Fusion project. To come to the point, half it more -- $550 million and more possibly of foreign currency translation equally balanced by volume, about $500 million, and price/mix. So that's the way we're seeing it. We're going to stay very firm in prices, first of all, because resin is not the only component of our cost. It's only a part of it. We have -- we are a highly service company. As a result of that, we have a lot of manpower. We have 25,000 employees or 24,000 employees in this company. And therefore, you remember my comment of 2 years ago about the salary match increase year-on-year. So this is a big part of the cost. And we have conversion cost, et cetera. Coming onto Diversey Care, where by definition, with 45% of our sales in Europe, we are -- we're exposed to currency and the translation that I just talked about. And therefore, we are anticipating the slight improvement in our profitability in dollar basis. Having said that, let me remind you that we are very clearly on the right track, as proven in 2013 EBITDA improvement and as proven in our 2014 EBITDA improvement growth as we have in constant currency, we have grown about 8%. So we're making wins in the field. It happens in the field. But we are very focused on margin improvement in that business, which is the thing which is going to last over time, no matter what currency is doing."

In addition, we've -- for a couple of years now, we talked very publicly that we have approximately around $60 million [ph] in annual inflationary cost related to wages, benefits. So if you take those 2 as cost increases to go from the $1.18 billion to the guidance we've provided for EBITDA for 2015, that tells you, and then you take the $50 million positive for cost synergies, you can do the math and see what's remaining, and that it's all coming -- a lot of good benefit from mix and price/cost spread as well as the volume growth that Jerome highlighted, so both benefiting the company, and again staying firm on our good practices and policies and the cultural changes that we're making. Also I'll just mention real quickly, back to John's question, because of the great advances of technology, I got an update from our President of our Product Care division to answer about the quality of the products. And he -- it's not meaningful yet, but we are starting to see a shift towards some of our core view products for e-commerce, which is a much higher-quality product, as well as our inflatable bubble, which is also higher quality than some of our general use products. So we're starting to see a little bit of that trend, but it's still very minor at this point."

But what we have embarked into is a whole program of margin restoration. I said sometime ago that we were not having reinvestment economics, and we did need -- we do need to have that.

In the future, we have, in Europe, for example, last year -- sorry, before coming to the future, we had last year pricing power also in Europe in -- despite a very poor environment. So this company is in transformation. And it is on the way of doing 2 things in a very disciplined way. The first one is good business management. You saw it in terms of margin expansion. We need margin expansion because we have -- because they have dramatically deteriorated in the past. And we're going to continue to be doing this. We're going to have mix improvement because, by definition, we're not putting the resources on our lower-margin products. We are shifting them towards higher-margin projects -- products. And we're doing working capital management. You've seen what we have done in just one year. We moved 300 basis points from 14% of operating working capital to -- no, from 17% operating working capital to 14%. And this is -- and we are continuing to do this kind of things. And at the very same time, we have started to reinvent this company. And this company is not going to be just about more plastic. It is going to be about the cutting-edge of the technologies which will enable our customers to win. That is what we are going towards.

Well, the buzzword, which is not mine, which is everybody's, is volatility, right? I got it all wrong in fourth quarter when in October I said that we were anticipating -- we were already into the fourth quarter, and we were anticipating a $10 million negative EBITDA as a result of currency translation. We got $17 million. Almost double. During the fourth quarter, our average exchange rate for the euro was 1 26, and the real at 2 47. The ruble at 43. Guess what? The ruble is at 66 today. The euro is at 1 13. The Brazilian reals is at 2 81. So more volatile than that, I don't know. So which is why I'm stopping making projections on resin prices, for example, on currencies, et cetera. And our exchange rates for 2015 are at around those levels that we have today, although possibly just a little bit more conservative and so. So where is it going to grow? We have -- we are expecting innovation to pull us -- and actually, in Food Care, the innovation has already pulled us, pulled our results and our product mix, which is going really well. We're going to see a deceleration of the beef cycle -- negative beef cycle, so things should be improving a little bit in volume in North America. And we should see the hogs business have a little bit of growth in North America, which should be all good. Real at 2 80 is good for meat exports and for local profitability. So we should benefit a little bit about this. In Diversey Care, we're continuing to eliminate low-margin businesses. And at the same time, we have had a few solid customer wins and in hospitality -- and we're going to have even more in health care, in the kitchen and on TASKI. So I'm positive there. We should have some volume growth there. We continue to grow volume nicely in emerging countries. In Latin America and TASKI, we have been hurt by very fast devaluations, but we're up in reported dollars in AMAT. And we growing very, very nicely in quite a few countries down there. And in Product Care, we have -- Carol talked about our core view line. We have some specialty packaging there which are doing very well and our systems, which are doing extremely well also. And that's where we are planning to shift. You have seen that we have growth in Product Care in Europe, which didn't have for a while. We think we have a lot of momentum in North America and intend to do that. And by the way also, in Asia, on our Product Care division, we are extremely optimistic that we're going to be succeeding there."

We still are slightly over $100 million in past due receivables. So we expect some of that benefit to come from continuing to decrease our past due. If you recall, we finished 2012 at over $200 million. So we've made great progress, but there's still some additional progress that we can make. Also, our management of inventory, we feel like there are continuing opportunities as we make our processes more robust around our sales and operations planning as well as SKU optimization. We also had some investments in inventory as we started to implement some of our new distribution programs that our supply chain team is working on. So as we make those transitions, at times we carry slightly higher levels of inventory, and then we right-size those. So we did have that right at year-end. So we do have opportunities in both. Our payables, we've made great progress in increasing our days payable outstanding, and we will continue to focus on that as well, where it makes sense and where we have large dollars spend and large volume. In terms of the $97 million in savings that we provided for the improvement from 2013 to 2014, for cost synergies, most of that -- a large portion of that came from our Equip Program. We still had a little bit trailing from our integration and optimization program, but the larger portion was from the Equip Program. And as we look to 2015, as we noted, almost all of that $50 million [ph] in cost synergies will come from the Equip Program as well, with the new Fusion Program starting to give us a positive return at the beginning, as we move into 2016. The new program has an internal rate of return in excess of 40%. So we're really excited about what that's going to bring to our cost structure as well."

We have our people who believe, our people who see how we're winning and how we can continue to win, have taken the responsibility of the price leadership and of the product mix leadership and of the innovation -- the need for innovation. And therefore, things are moving at a pace which is very different than from the past. And I could see that, as I said, sometimes late Q3, early Q4 of last year. And therefore, you now are seeing the results that we had. We started in the first quarter, but in fact, it amplified throughout the year. You should -- as we have said during the prepared remarks, our Product Care and Diversey Care business had constant-currency sales improving every single quarter. In Q1, our Diversey Care business improved in constant currency by 1.2% in Q1 of '14. It went up and up and up. And in the fourth quarter of 2014, it went up by 4%. And this is obviously something extremely important. And same with our Product Care, which started the year at 2.6% and finished the year at 4.6%. And this is extremely important because there is a changing pace. There is more courage in the organization, et cetera. Doesn't mean that it's going to continue to grow crescendo like this because we have, as I said before, a very volatile environment and so on. So we're not going to take currency as an excuse. We have to do what we have to do. We're going to continue doing and forging ahead through a disciplined approach to our business to improve operationally and to start building. And we have started that to start building the future. So as to what didn't go that well, I would say I'm not going to contradict myself in what I said before, because I have been really positively surprised as to how we're gaining this -- how we're making this cultural change and so. So the negative are uncontrollable factors. And I don't control currency. And I don't control the overall economy. Having said that, we were not expecting the economy to improve much better. So this is going to be considered as a plus, if it does come. It's been easy in the last 2 to 3 years, and we believe that in 2015, it's going to continue to be easy."

We delivered 8% adjusted EBITDA growth in 2014, and",2190,"Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report that 2014 was a very strong year for Sealed Air. We exceeded our financial objectives in the fourth quarter and for the full year. We delivered 8% adjusted EBITDA growth in 2014, and expanded margins by 90 basis points despite currency headwinds. We had favorable price/mix in every region and in every division in the quarter and for the full year. We improved the health of our balance sheet and generated over $600 million of -- in free cash flow. We continued on our innovation path, including, for example, Darfresh entrée, Instapak Simple and a new Taski XP platform. We also announced the relocation of our headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina, and launched a new website. These are just some of the many successes that we had over the last 12 months. And while we are pleased with our 2014 financial results, we still believe that there's significant improvement to be had in terms of top line potential growth and further margin expansion, as well as maximizing our free cash flow generation.
But before we review our fourth quarter and year-end results, I want to share some insights on how we are approaching 2015. Based on foreign exchange rates today, we are assuming unfavorable currency translation of approximately $550 million in sales and $80 million on EBITDA in 2015. And while we anticipate as reported sales in 2015 to be down approximately 5% compared to 2014, we expect to grow approximately 2.5% in constant currency, and are confident that we will deliver adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion. EBITDA growth and margin expansion will be driven not only for -- not only by February input costs, but also our continued focus on value-adding selling, operational disciplines and earnings quality improvement efforts.
With that said, let me turn back on the fourth quarter and year-end results, and Carol will provide, of course, more details on our 2015 outlook. Let's start with 2014 full year performance by region on Slide 4. Net sales were up slightly on an as-reported basis and are 3% in constant currency. Currency translation had a negative $183 million impact on net sales in 2014. By region, sales in North America increased 3% on a constant-currency basis due to 5% growth in Product Care, 2% growth in both Food Care and Diversey Care. In Europe, sales improved on constant-currency basis each quarter throughout the year, resulting in a modest increase in constant-currency sales in 2014 as compared to a slight decline in 2013. Latin America and AMAT were our fastest-growing regions in constant-currency sales growth in the middle high -- in the high single digits. Constant-currency sales in Japan, Australia and New Zealand were up 2% in 2014.
On Slide 5, you can see our performance by region for the fourth quarter. Net sales declined 2% on an as-reported basis, but were up 3% in constant currency. Currency translation had a negative $105 million impact on net sales in the quarter compared to $183 million for the full year. Sales in North America were up 2%, led by 5% growth in Product Care and 4% growth in Diversey Care. Food Care sales were essentially unchanged compared to last year. Sales in Europe were down 6% on a reported basis and up 2% in constant currency.
To be more specific on our performance in Europe, let me provide you with country trends on a constant-currency basis in the quarter, as the U.K. delivered strong growth of 9% with double-digit growth in Food Care and mid-single-digit growth in Diversey Care and Product Care. Spain, Switzerland and Holland were flat to slightly up, while France, Italy and Germany declined. The 7 countries I just referenced accounted for 21% of our fourth quarter's consolidated sales, and I also would like to highlight that Russia continued to deliver strong growth with net sales in Q4 increasing 5% on an as-reported basis, which translate to approximately 40% growth in constant currency.
Moving on to Latin America and AMAT. Both regions delivered constant-currency sales growth in the high single-digit in the quarter, and in AMAT, China and India, delivered double-digit sales growth. And in Latin America, Brazil and Mexico, delivered mid-single-digit growth. On an as-reported basis, AMAT was up approximately 3%, and Latin America down 4% in the fourth quarter as a result of significant currency devaluations. Constant-currency sales in Japan, Australia and New Zealand were up slightly in the quarter. Growth in Australia was slightly offset by the decline in New Zealand.
On Slide 6, we move on our price/mix volume trends and sales growth on a constant-dollar basis by division and by region. As you can see from the slide, we have constant-currency sales growth and variable price/mix in every division and every region in the fourth quarter and in 2014. Food Care had solid performance despite the challenging protein market in North America. Constant-currency sales in both Diversey Care and Product Care improved each quarter throughout the year. We also stayed focused on our commitment to shift our business to our more innovative, value-added solutions and provide best-in-class service to our customers on a global basis. We have made significant progress on this front, but there's still plenty of room for improvement as we continue to evolve into a knowledge-based company. You will hear more about all of this at our Analyst Day on June 18 in New York City.
Turning to our performance by division. I will focus my comments on fourth quarter results on a constant-currency basis. On Slide 7, Food Care sales increased 3% with approximately 3% in packaging and 2% in hygiene. Latin America increased sales by 10% and AMAT increased 2%. Europe had a strong performance with a growth of 5%, while North America was relatively flat. Developing regions, which include Latin America, AMAT and Eastern European countries delivered double-digit growth, led by strong performance in Argentina, Russia and China. In Europe, packaging sales increased nearly 9%, while hygiene declined 3%. The protein market was up slightly in the quarter, which helps, but we also continued to see increased demand for our value-added solutions and new platforms. In hygiene, you know that we continue to prune low-margin businesses, and while these efforts impacted top line, it made a significant contribution to our EBITDA margin performance. Food Care adjusted EBITDA in Europe delivered margin expansions of 300 basis points in 2014. This significant improvement was due to a combination of a low-margin pruning and operational improvements in our hygiene business, as well as the accelerated adoption of our innovative packaging portfolio. In North America, capital and hog production were down approximately 8% and 4%, respectively, compared to last year. Despite this unfavorable market trends in North America, our sales were relatively flat compared to last year due to favorable product mix and better pricing. To reiterate what we said in our last earnings call, we believe that this cycle is close to the bottom, and we expect that the rate of decline to moderate over the next 12 months. It is worth noting that on a global basis, our 3 largest market segments: fresh red meats, smoked and processed and poultry, delivered sales growth in the quarter and for the full year. Poultry had also been a key growth driver in North America and in Latin America. This strong performance is a direct result of increased demand for our advanced solutions such as case-ready, Darfresh, Fluids, Grip & Tear and QuickRip. We introduced Darfresh entrée during the fourth quarter, and we have already experienced significant traction in both Europe and North America. Darfresh entrée is a system solution that reduces food waste in the total distribution system, while also utilizing less material.
I want to highlight the EBITDA margin performance in the fourth quarter for Food Care. Adjusted EBITDA of $172 million or 17.5% of net sales increased 8% compared to last year. This increase was largely a result of pricing discipline, improved mix and cost synergies, and for the full year, Food Care's net sales of $3.8 billion increased 4% in constant currency, and was essentially unchanged on an as-reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin in 2014 of 17.5% increased 140 basis points over 2013, which is an outstanding performance. And going forward in '15, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion, favorable input cost and our continued focus on innovation and operational discipline are expected to more than offset the forecasted currency headwinds.
Slide 8 highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on constant-currency basis were up 4% in the fourth quarter. Volume and price/mix were up approximately 2% each. Developing regions increased 11%, led by 16% growth in Latin America and 10% growth in AMAT. Our fastest-growing countries where China, India and Brazil, and North America increased sales 4%, which is our strongest performance in North America over the last 24 months. In Europe, sales were essentially unchanged, positive trends in the U.K. and Switzerland, offset by declines in France and Germany. Holland, Italy and Spain were relatively flat, and from an end market perspective on a global basis, our strongest sectors in the quarter were Building Service Contractors and hospitality. We have had a number of solid customer wins that are beginning to ramp up and contribute to our top line results. And during the quarter, we introduced, amongst others, the Taski XP platform, a stand-alone -- a stand-on, sorry, flow care machine that delivers 30% more productivity than the conventional work behind flow care machines. As you can see, we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $58 million or 10.9% of net sales in the quarter. We are beginning to reap the benefits of our targeted investments in R&D and sales and marketing, but unfavorable currency translation and certain supply chain costs had a negative impact on margins during that fourth quarter.
Diversey Care generates nearly 45% of its sales from Europe, and its performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year was negatively impacted by currency declines. For the full year, Diversey Care's net sales of $2.2 billion increased 3% in constant currency, and were essentially unchanged on an as-reported basis, but adjusted EBITDA in '14 of $245 million increased 3% compared to last year. To be noted is that excluding unfavorable currency translation in the fourth quarter and in 2014, Diversey Care's adjusted EBITDA was up 5% and 8%, respectively. In 2015, we expect Diversey Care's adjusted EBITDA growth to be moderated due to its high exposure to the euro.
Turning to Slide 9. Product Care delivered 5% constant-currency sales in the fourth quarter -- sales growth in the fourth quarter, which its highest growth rate all year. This growth was attributable to favorable price/mix of 4%. And as we have continued to shift our business towards high-performance solutions, including cushioning and packaging systems and continued to focus on improved -- improving the quality of our general use business. As we have discussed, growth in e-commerce and third-party logistics is increasing demand for our cushioning and packaging systems, and we expect these trends to continue going forward. 
If you recall last quarter, I highlighted the Instapak Simple as one of our key innovations that brings the benefit of cost-effective, high-performance damage reduction to emerging regions and the e-commerce market. This product was successfully launched from October of last year. North America, which accounts for about 60% of our Product Care business increased sales 5%. Europe represents just over 20% of Product Care sales, and had its strongest performance of the year with over 3% growth. AMAT also had its strongest performance of the year with 11% sales growth, and AMAT and Japan, Australia, New Zealand, combined, account for just under 20% of Product Care sales, but it is worth highlighting that both China and Japan had double-digit growth in the quarter. Latin America accounts for only 4% of Product Care sales and declined 2% due to the rationalization efforts that were completed during the quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 6% to $77 million or 79% of net sales. Growth in cushioning and packaging systems, along with product and customer rationalization actions in general use have a significant impact on our adjusted EBITDA margins in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. Every quarter in 2014, we delivered both top line and adjusted EBITDA growth. For the full year, Product Care's net sales of $1.7 billion increased 4% in constant currency and 3% on an as-reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 10% compared to last year, and margins improved 120 basis points to 17.7%. The rates of adjusted EBITDA growth supports sales growth throughout the year, underscoring our commitment to securing the appropriate value for our solutions. Going forward in 2015, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion, favorable input cost and our continuous focus on innovation and operation disciplines in general use are expected to more than offset currency headwinds.
And now let me pass the call to Carol to review our total sales and EBITDA bridges cash flow and outlook for 2015. Carol?"

Turning to Slide 10 and Slide 11. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with net sales on Slide 10. We delivered $2 billion in sales in the fourth quarter and $7.8 bill",1413,"Thank you, Jerome. Turning to Slide 10 and Slide 11. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with net sales on Slide 10. We delivered $2 billion in sales in the fourth quarter and $7.8 billion for the year. On a constant-currency basis, sales increased approximately 3% for both periods. Sales growth was attributable to favorable price/mix, which was 3% or $61 million in the quarter and 3.2% or $249 million for the full year. Volume was essentially unchanged in both periods. Unfavorable currency translation was $105 million in the quarter and $183 million for the full year. Approximately 20% of our total sales are exposed to the euro, approximately 4% to the Brazilian real, and then we have approximately 2% exposure to both the Russian ruble and the Turkish lira.
Turning to Slide 11. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 4% on a year-over-year basis to $282 million or 14.3% of net sales. For the total company, the increase in adjusted EBITDA was due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of $48 million. Cost synergies were $22 million in the quarter. Selling, general and administrative and other expenses increased by $40 million, of which $17 million was attributable to an increase in incentive performance-based compensation and $14 million was related to salary inflation. Currency translation had a negative $17 million impact on EBITDA in the quarter. 
Despite currency headwinds, we delivered a 100 basis point improvement in adjusted gross profit margin and a 90 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA increased 8% year-over-year to $1.12 or to $1.12 billion or 14.4% of net sales. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of 3.2% or $150 million on essentially flat volume. Cost synergies of $97 million were more than offset by an increase in SG&A and other expenses of $127 million, of which $46 million was attributable to an increase in incentive performance-based compensation, and $54 million was related to salary inflation. For the full year, currency had a negative impact of $30 million on adjusted EBITDA, yet we delivered a 100 basis point improvement in adjusted gross profit margin and a 90 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to 2013. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.59 as compared to $0.39 in the fourth quarter last year. 2014 EPS was $1.86 as compared to $1.39 in 2013, an increase of over 30%. The 2014 tax rate of 22% was lower than our previously provided guidance of 27%, largely due to the December enactment of credit extenders, as well as favorable earnings mix. In 2013, our tax rate was 21%.
During the fourth quarter 2014, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares for approximately $50 million at an average price of $36 per share. For the full year, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares for $184 million at an average price of $34 per share. This includes approximately 3.9 million shares purchased from the WRG Asbestos Personal Injury Trust in the second quarter of 2014. Since the beginning of this year, 2015, we have repurchased approximately 498,000 shares for $21 million at an average price of $41 per share. We will continue to be active in the market, and have the capacity to buy an additional $69 million in shares through the end of 2015. We continue to evaluate alternatives that will enable us to increase returns to our shareholders, and maintain our target leverage of 3.5x to 4x.
Now turning to Slide 12. Free cash flow was, of course, up $612 million in 2014, excluding the Grace settlement. This compares favorably to a source of $509 million in 2013 due to higher earnings and an improvement in operating working capital management. Operating working capital, as a percent of net sales, improved from 17% at the end of 2013 to 14% at the end of 2013 compared to 14% at the end of 2014. The company focuses its management of operating working capital on a 13-month average target. For the 13-month period ending December 31, 2014, the average for operating working capital, as a percent of net sales, was 17%. This represents a 200 basis point improvement compared to 2013. CapEx was $154 million, and cash restructuring cost were $108 million in 2014. Cash payments related to SARs were $21 million as compared with $46 million in the prior year. Cash interest payment in 2014, excluding the settlement, were $293 million compared to $290 million in 2013.
Turning to Slide 13. In December 2014, we issued $425 million 4 7/8 senior notes due 2022, and $425 million 5 1/8 senior notes due 2024. Net proceeds from the offering were used to repurchase the $750 million 8 1/8 senior notes. In July, we amended and restated our senior secured credit facilities. All together, these transactions reduced our annualized interest expense by approximately $30 million, provide extended maturities, and increase covenant flexibility.
Turning to Slide 14. Our outlook for 2015 is presented. We expect net sales to be approximately $7.4 billion, a decline of approximately 5% on a reported basis, but an increase of approximately 2.5% in constant currency. As Jerome mentioned earlier, we estimate an unfavorable impact of approximately $550 million on sales from foreign currency translation. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.18 as compared to 2014 adjusted EPS of $1.86. We anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 25% in 2015. 
Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be in the range of $1.15 billion to $1.18 billion or approximately 3% to 5.5% growth rate on a reported basis. Currency is estimated to have a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $80 million. We are confident that we can achieve the level of EBITDA presented as we continue to focus on our discipline to improve the quality of earnings, and benefit from favorable input cost. Additionally, we expect approximately $50 million in cost synergy, most of which will come from the earnings quality and improvement restructuring program. In late December, our board approved a new restructuring program, the ""Fusion Program"", which will consist of projects across our 3 divisions, as well as functional support. This program is expected to generate savings of approximately $80 million to $85 million by the end of 2018. We do not expect to realize any savings from this program until early 2016. The cost of the ""Fusion Program"" is expected to be approximately $275 million to $285 million, of which the net cash outflow is expected to be in the range of $210 million to $220 million. We anticipate the proceeds from asset sales and state incentives to be approximately $65 million. Our guidance for free cash flow is approximately $600 million for 2015, which excludes the tax refund related to the Grace settlement of approximately $245 million. Our outlook for free cash flow is derived from higher earnings, improvement from working capital and lower cash interest payments, offset by higher restructuring cash cost and capital expenditures as compared to 2014. Cash restructuring cost, excluding restructuring CapEx, are expected to be $120 million. This $120 million consists of approximately $50 million from previously announced restructuring programs, and approximately $70 million from the new ""Fusion Program"". Capital expenditures are expected to be $180 million, which includes approximately $45 million of CapEx related to restructuring activities. In 2014, CapEx was $154 million, of which approximately $25 million was related to restructuring. The year-over-year increase in CapEx for 2015 as compared to 2014, excluding the restructuring activities I just mentioned, is associated with target growth projects for Food Care, Product Care and Diversey Care and R&D pilot plant in the second phase of our ERP implementation. Cash interest payments are expected to be $255 million, and cash taxes are expected to be $110 million.
Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, April 28 at 8:30 a.m, and Ken Chrisman, President of our Product Care Division, will be joining us for that discussion. We are also hosting our Analyst Day on Thursday, June 18, in New York City, as previously mentioned. I look forward to speaking with you again in the near future.
With that, operator, can you please open the call for questions?"

So our volume for the 2015 is going to be at about 1.5% or so, and this compares with 0 volume growth that we had in 2014 and about slightly higher than 1% in 2013. We're going to see volume growth in the 3 divisions, led by Diversey Care and Product Care and also some in Food Care. So the story of price/mix is going to be somewhat different than the one  of 2014 because, obviously, the resin prices have been and are coming down. And as a result of that, it is not so much price which is going to be important into 2015, but just margin and margin expansion, and we do believe that we're going to be having margin expansion from all kind of things. Number one, we need to remember that we are in a recovery mode. We have lost a lot of pricing over the past few years, and we need to rehabilitate pricing. This is true for what I would call the commodity parts of our portfolio, specifically in Product Care and in Food Care. In Product Care, we still have a whole segment, which is we call the general use, which I would tend to call the more commoditized type of product line. And those, whereas they have been doing better in 2014, they are far from being at an acceptable level. So we're going to be holding very firm, and we are holding very firm on our pricing. We'll only respond to competitive aggression, and that's all we're going to do. On Food Care, we do have some regional weaknesses in some product lines, and that is what we're going to be addressing on pricing. Obviously, currency translation is hurting, and as they all continue to go down, because the dollar is revaluating regularly amongst almost all currencies. We are in need to adjust our pricing."

Well, the big hitter in 2015 is obviously that we're going to have more than $0.5 billion of currency translation. Just imagine, just go back one second to the fourth quarter and imagine us publishing a constant-currency EBITDA number of about $300 million in the fourth quarter, which is what you would get if you add the $280 million and the $17 million of EBITDA currency translation loss. So you would have -- we would've all celebrated an extraordinary quarter. I can assure you that we would have just blown away our numbers on a constant-currency basis for 2015. But life is what it is, and we're taking -- we have felt it was coming, actually, very early in the fourth -- in September actually, and we have started very early to take measures, hence, our ""Fusion Project"". To come to the point, have $550 million and more possibly of foreign currency translation equally balanced by volume, about $100 million, and price/mix. So that's the way we're seeing it. We're going to stay in very firm prices, first of all, because resin is not the only component of our cost. It's only a part of it. We have -- we are a highly service company. As a result of that, we have a lot of manpower. We have 25,000 employees or 24,000 employees in this company. And therefore, you remember my comment of 2 years ago about the salary much increased year-on-year, so this is a big part of the cost, and we have conversion cost, et cetera. Coming onto Diversey Care, well, by definition, with 45% of our sales in Europe, we are -- we're exposed to currency and the translation that I just talked about. And therefore, we are anticipating a slight improvement in our profitability in dollar basis. Having said that, let me remind you that we are very clearly on the right track, as proven in 2013 EBITDA improvement, and as proven in our 2014 EBITDA improvement growth, as we have in constant currency. We have grown about 8%. So we're making wins in the field. It happens in the field. But we are very focused on margin improvement in that business, which is the thing which is going to last over time, no matter what currency is doing."

In addition, we've -- for a couple of years now, we've talked very publicly that we have approximately around $60 million in annual inflationary cost related to wages, benefits. So if you take those 2 as cost increases to go from the $1.18 billion to the guidance we've provided for EBITDA for 2015, that tells you, and then you take the $50 million positive for cost synergies, you can do the math and see what's remaining, and that it's all coming -- a lot of good benefit from mix and price/cost spread, as well as the volume growth that Jerome highlighted, so both benefiting the company, and again, staying firm on our good practices and policies and the cultural changes that we're making. Also, I'll just mention real quickly, back to John's question, because of the great advances of technology, I got an update from our President of our Product Care Division to answer about the quality of the products, and he -- it's not meaningful yet, but we are starting to see a shift towards some of our core view products for e-commerce, which is a much higher-quality product, as well as our inflatable bubble, which is also higher quality than some of our general use products. So we're starting to see a little bit of that trend, but it's still very minor at this point."

I said sometime ago that we were not having reinvestment economics, and we did need -- we do need to have that. That -- this is the very basis of proper business management. So we have gotten pricing as a result of resins, and we have gotten other type of pricing at the very same time. In the future, we have, in Europe, for example, last year -- sorry, before coming to the future, we had last year pricing power also in Europe in -- despite a very poor environment. So this company is in transformation, and it is on the way of doing 2 things in a very disciplined way. The first one is good business management. You saw it in terms of margin expansion. We need margin expansion because we have -- because they have dramatically deteriorated in the past, and we're going to continue to be doing this. We're going to have mix improvement because, by definition, we're not putting the resources on our lower-margin products. We are shifting them towards higher-margin products. And we're doing working capital management. You've seen what we have done in just 1 year. We moved 300 basis points from 14% of operating working capital to -- no, from 17% operating working capital to 14%, and this is -- and we are continuing to do this kind of things. And at the very same time, we have started to reinvent this company, and this company is not going to be just about more plastic. It is going to be about the cutting-edge of the technologies which will enable our customers to win. That is what we are going towards.

Well, the buzzword, which is not mine, which is everybody's, is volatility, right? I got it all wrong in the fourth quarter when in October I said that we were anticipating -- we were already into the fourth quarter, and we were anticipating a $10 million negative EBITDA as a result of currency translation. We got $17 million, almost double. During the fourth quarter, our average exchange rate for the euro was 1.26, and the real at 2.47. The ruble at 43. Guess what? The ruble is at 66 today. The euro is at 1.13. The Brazilian real is at 2.81, so more volatile than that. I don't know. So which is why I'm stopping making projections on resin prices, for example, on currencies, et cetera, and our exchange rates for 2015 are at around those levels that we have today, although possibly, just a little bit more conservative and so. So where is it going to grow? We have -- we are expecting innovation to pull us, and actually, in Food Care, the innovation has already pulled us, pulled our results and our product mix, which is going really well. We're going to see a deceleration of the beef cycle -- negative beef cycle, so things should be improving a little bit in volume in North America, and we should see the hogs business have a little bit of growth in North America, which should be all good. Real at 2.80 is good for meat exports and for local profitability. So we should benefit a little bit about this. In Diversey Care, we're continuing to eliminate low-margin businesses, and at the same time, we have had a few solid customer wins and in hospitality -- we're going to have even more on health care, in the kitchen and on TASKI. So I'm positive there. We should have some volume growth there. We continue to grow volume nicely in emerging countries. In Latin America and TASKI, we have been hurt by very fast devaluations, but we're up in reported dollars in AMAT, and we're growing very, very nicely in quite a few countries down there, and in Product Care, we have -- Carol talked about our core new line. We have some specialty packaging there which are doing very well, and our systems, which are doing extremely well also, and that's where we are planning to shift. You have seen that we have growth in Product Care in Europe, which we didn't have for a while. We think we have a lot of momentum in North America and intend to do that, and by the way, also, in Asia on our Product Care division, we are extremely optimistic that we're going to be succeeding there."

We still are slightly over $100 million in past due receivables. So we expect some of that benefit to come from -- continuing to decrease our past dues. If you recall, we finished 2012 at over $200 million. So we've made great progress, but there's still some additional progress that we can make. Also, our management of inventory, we feel like there are continuing opportunities as we make our processes more robust around our sales and operations planning, as well as SKU optimization. We also had some investments in inventory as we started to implement some of our new distribution programs that our supply chain team is working on. So as we make those transitions, at times, we carry slightly higher levels of inventory, and then we right-size those. So we did have that right at year-end. So we do have opportunities in both. Our payables, we've made great progress in increasing our days payable outstanding, and we will continue to focus on that as well, where it makes sense and where we have large dollar spend and large volume. In terms of the $97 million in savings that we provided for the improvement from 2013 to 2014, for cost synergies, most of that -- a large portion of that came from our Equip Program. We still had a little bit trailing from our integration and optimization program, but the larger portion was from the Equip program. And as we look to 2015, as we noted, almost all of that $15 million in cost synergies will come from the Equip program as well, with the new ""Fusion Program"" starting to give us a positive return at the beginning, as we move into 2016. The new program has an internal rate of return in excess of 40%. So we're really excited about what that's going to bring to our cost structure as well."

The -- what surprised me is not so much the results, but because the result -- because the financials are the consequence of what we're doing. What surprises me is the speed at which from Q3 to Q4 of 2013 this organization has shifted its mind, and this organization is now a courageous organization. We have our people who believe, our people who see how we're winning and how we can continue to win, have taken the responsibility of the price leadership and of the product mix leadership and of the innovation -- the need for innovation, and therefore, things are moving at a pace which is very different than from the past, and I could see that, as I said, sometimes, late Q3, early Q4 of last year. And therefore, you now are seeing the results that we had. We started in the first quarter, but in fact, it amplified throughout the year. You should -- as we have said during the prepared remarks, our Product Care and Diversey Care business had constant-currency sales improving every single quarter. In Q1, our Diversey Care business improved in constant currency by 1.2% in Q1 of '14. It went up and up and up, and in the fourth quarter of 2014, it went up by 4%, and this is obviously something extremely important, and same with our Product Care, which started the year at 2.6% and finished the year at 4.6%, and this is extremely important because there is a changing pace. There is more courage in the organization, et cetera. Doesn't mean that it's going to continue to grow crescendo like this because we have, as I said before, a very volatile environment and so on. So we're not going to take currency as an excuse. We have to do what we have to do. We're going to continue doing and forging ahead through a disciplined approach to our business to improve operationally and to start building, and we have started that to start building the future. So as to what didn't go that well, I would say I'm not going to contradict myself with what I said before because I've been really positively surprised as to how we're gaining this -- how we're making this cultural change and so. So the negative are uncontrollable factors, and I don't control currency, and I don't control the overall economy. Having said that, we were not expecting the economy to improve much better. So this is going to be considered as a plus if it does come. It's been easy in the last 2 to 3 years, and we believe that in 2015, it's going to continue to be easy."

We delivered 8% adjusted EBITDA growth in 2014, and",2196,"Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report that 2014 was a very strong year for Sealed Air. We exceeded our financial objectives in the fourth quarter and for the full year. We delivered 8% adjusted EBITDA growth in 2014, and expanded margins by 90 basis points despite currency headwinds. We had favorable price/mix in every region and in every division in the quarter and for the full year. We improved the health of our balance sheet and generated over $600 million of -- in free cash flow. We continued on our innovation path, including, for example, Darfresh on Tray, Instapak Simple and a new Taski XP platform. We also announced the relocation of our headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina, and launched a new website. These are just some of the many successes that we had over the last 12 months. And while we are pleased with our 2014 financial results, we still believe that there's significant improvement to be had in terms of top line potential growth and further margin expansion, as well as maximizing our free cash flow generation.
But before we review our fourth quarter and year-end results, I want to share some insights on how we are approaching 2015. Based on foreign exchange rates today, we are assuming unfavorable currency translation of approximately $550 million in sales and $80 million on EBITDA in 2015. And while we anticipate as-reported sales in 2015 to be down approximately 5% compared to 2014, we expect to grow approximately 2.5% in constant currency, and are confident that we will deliver adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion. EBITDA growth and margin expansion will be driven not only for -- not only by favorable input costs, but also our continued focus on value-adding selling, operational discipline and earnings quality improvement efforts.
With that said, let me turn back on the fourth quarter and year-end results, and Carol will provide, of course, more details on our 2015 outlook. Let's start with 2014 full year performance by region on Slide 4. Net sales were up slightly on an as-reported basis and are 3% in constant currency. Currency translation had a negative $183 million impact on net sales in 2014. By region, sales in North America increased 3% on a constant-currency basis due to 5% growth in Product Care, 2% growth in both Food Care and Diversey Care. In Europe, sales improved on constant-currency basis each quarter throughout the year, resulting in a modest increase in constant-currency sales in 2014 as compared to a slight decline in 2013. Latin America and AMAT were our fastest-growing regions in constant-currency sales growth in the middle high -- in the high single digits. Constant-currency sales in Japan, Australia and New Zealand were up 2% in 2014.
On Slide 5, you can see our performance by region for the fourth quarter. Net sales declined 2% on an as-reported basis, but were up 3% in constant currency. Currency translation had a negative $105 million impact on net sales in the quarter compared to $183 million for the full year. Sales in North America were up 2%, led by 5% growth in Product Care and 4% growth in Diversey Care. Food Care sales were essentially unchanged compared to last year. Sales in Europe were down 6% on a reported basis and up 2% in constant currency.
To be more specific on our performance in Europe, let me provide you with country trends on a constant-currency basis in the quarter, as the U.K. delivered strong growth of 9% with double-digit growth in Food Care and mid-single-digit growth in Diversey Care and Product Care. Spain, Switzerland and Holland were flat to slightly up, while France, Italy and Germany declined. The 7 countries I just referenced accounted for 21% of our fourth quarter's consolidated sales, and I also would like to highlight that Russia continued to deliver strong growth with net sales in Q4 increasing 5% on an as-reported basis, which translates to approximately 40% growth in constant currency.
Moving on to Latin America and AMAT. Both regions delivered constant-currency sales growth in the high single digits in the quarter, and in AMAT, China and India, delivered double-digit sales growth. And in Latin America, Brazil and Mexico, delivered mid-single-digit growth. On an as-reported basis, AMAT was up approximately 3%, and Latin America down 4% in the fourth quarter as a result of significant currency devaluations. Constant-currency sales in Japan, Australia and New Zealand were up slightly in the quarter. Growth in Australia was slightly offset by the decline in New Zealand.
On Slide 6, we move on to our price/mix, volume trends and sales growth on a constant-dollar basis by division and by region. As you can see from the slide, we had constant-currency sales growth and variable price/mix in every division and every region in the fourth quarter and in 2014. Food Care had solid performance despite the challenge in the protein market in North America. Constant-currency sales in both Diversey Care and Product Care improved each quarter throughout the year. We also stayed focused on our commitment to shift our business to our more innovative, value-added solutions and provide best-in-class service to our customers on a global basis. We have made significant progress on this front, but there's still plenty of room for improvement as we continue to evolve into a knowledge-based company. You will hear more about all of this at our Analyst Day on June 18 in New York City.
Turning to our performance by division. I will focus my comments on fourth quarter results on a constant-currency basis. On Slide 7, Food Care sales increased 3% with approximately 3% in packaging and 2% in hygiene. Latin America increased sales by 10% and AMAT increased 2%. Europe had a strong performance with a growth of 5%, while North America was relatively flat. Developing regions, which include Latin America, AMAT and Eastern European countries, delivered double-digit growth, led by strong performance in Argentina, Russia and China. In Europe, packaging sales increased nearly 9%, while hygiene declined 3%. The protein market was up slightly in the quarter, which helped, but we also continued to see increased demand for our value-added solutions and new platforms. In hygiene, you know that we continue to prune low-margin businesses, and while these efforts impacted top line, it made a significant contribution to our EBITDA margin performance. Food Care adjusted EBITDA in Europe delivered margin expansions of 300 basis points in 2014. This significant improvement was due to a combination of our low-margin pruning and operational improvements in our hygiene business, as well as the accelerated adoption of our innovative packaging portfolio. In North America, cattle and hog production were down approximately 8% and 4%, respectively, compared to last year. Despite these unfavorable market trends in North America, our sales were relatively flat compared to last year due to favorable product mix and better pricing. To reiterate what we said in our last earnings call, we believe the beef cycle is close to the bottom, and we expect that the rate of decline to moderate over the next 12 months. It is worth noting that on a global basis, our 3 largest market segments: fresh red meat, smoked and processed and poultry, delivered sales growth in the quarter and for the full year. Poultry had also been a key growth driver in North America and in Latin America. This strong performance is a direct result of increased demand for our advanced solutions such as case-ready, Darfresh, Fluids, Grip & Tear and QuickRip. We introduced Darfresh on Tray during the fourth quarter, and we have already experienced significant traction in both Europe and North America. Darfresh on Tray is a system solution that reduces food waste in the total distribution system, while also utilizing less material.
I want to highlight the EBITDA margin performance in the fourth quarter for Food Care. Adjusted EBITDA of $172 million, or 17.5% of net sales, increased 8% compared to last year. This increase was largely a result of pricing discipline, improved mix and cost synergies. And for the full year, Food Care's net sales of $3.8 billion increased 4% in constant currency, and was essentially unchanged on an as-reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin in 2014 of 17.5% increased 140 basis points over 2013, which is an outstanding performance. And going forward in '15, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion. Favorable input cost and our continued focus on innovation and operational discipline are expected to more than offset the forecasted currency headwinds.
Slide 8 highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on constant-currency basis were up 4% in the fourth quarter. Volume and price/mix were up approximately 2% each. Developing regions increased 11%, led by 16% growth in Latin America and 10% growth in AMAT. Our fastest-growing countries where China, India and Brazil, and North America increased sales 4%, which is our strongest performance in North America over the last 24 months. In Europe, sales were essentially unchanged, positive trends in the U.K. and Switzerland offset by declines in France and Germany. Holland, Italy and Spain were relatively flat, and from an end market perspective on a global basis, our strongest sectors in the quarter were Building Service Contractors and hospitality. We have had a number of solid customer wins that are beginning to ramp up and contribute to our top line results. And during the quarter, we introduced, amongst others, the Taski XP platform, a stand-alone -- a stand-on, sorry, floor care machine that delivers 30% more productivity than the conventional walk-behind floor care machines. As you can see, we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $58 million or 10.9% of net sales in the quarter. We are beginning to reap the benefits of our targeted investments in R&D and sales and marketing, but unfavorable currency translation and certain supply chain costs had a negative impact on margins during that fourth quarter.
Diversey Care generates nearly 45% of its sales from Europe, and its performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year was negatively impacted by currency declines. For the full year, Diversey Care's net sales of $2.2 billion increased 3% in constant currency, and were essentially unchanged on an as-reported basis, but adjusted EBITDA in '14 of $245 million increased 3% compared to last year. To be noted is that excluding unfavorable currency translation in the fourth quarter and in 2014, Diversey Care's adjusted EBITDA was up 5% and 8%, respectively. In 2015, we expect Diversey Care's adjusted EBITDA growth to be moderated due to its high exposure to the euro.
Turning to Slide 9. Product Care delivered 5% constant-currency sales in the fourth quarter -- sales growth in the fourth quarter, which is its highest growth rate all year. This growth was attributable to favorable price/mix of 4%, and as we have continued to shift our business towards high-performance solutions, including cushioning and packaging systems and continued to focus on improved -- improving the quality of our general use business. As we have discussed, growth in e-commerce and third-party logistics is increasing demand for our cushioning and packaging systems, and we expect these trends to continue going forward. 
If you recall last quarter, I highlighted the Instapak Simple as one of our key innovations that brings the benefit of cost-effective, high-performance damage reduction to emerging regions and the e-commerce market. This product was successfully launched from October of last year. North America, which accounts for about 60% of our Product Care business, increased sales 5%. Europe represents just over 20% of Product Care sales, and had its strongest performance of the year with over 3% growth. AMAT also had its strongest performance of the year with 11% sales growth, and AMAT and Japan, Australia, New Zealand combined account for just under 20% of Product Care sales, but it is worth highlighting that both China and Japan had double-digit growth in the quarter. Latin America accounts for only 4% of Product Care sales and declined 2% due to the rationalization efforts that were completed during the quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 6% to $77 million or 79% of net sales. Growth in cushioning and packaging systems, along with product and customer rationalization actions in general use, had a significant impact on our adjusted EBITDA margins in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. Every quarter in 2014, we delivered both top line and adjusted EBITDA growth. For the full year, Product Care's net sales of $1.7 billion increased 4% in constant currency and 3% on an as-reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 10% compared to last year, and margins improved 120 basis points to 17.7%. The rate of adjusted EBITDA growth surpassed sales growth throughout the year, underscoring our commitment to securing the appropriate value for our solutions. Going forward in 2015, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion, favorable input costs and our continuous focus on innovation and operational discipline in general use are expected to more than offset currency headwinds.
And now let me pass the call to Carol to review our total sales and EBITDA bridges, cash flow and outlook for 2015. Carol?"
382724,280037593,758654,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2015",2015-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jerome. Turning to Slide 10 and Slide 11. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with net sales on Slide 10. We delivered $2 billion in sales in the fourth quarter and $7.8 bill",1415,"Thank you, Jerome. Turning to Slide 10 and Slide 11. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with net sales on Slide 10. We delivered $2 billion in sales in the fourth quarter and $7.8 billion for the year. On a constant-currency basis, sales increased approximately 3% for both periods. Sales growth was attributable to favorable price/mix, which was 3% or $61 million in the quarter, and 3.2% or $249 million for the full year. Volume was essentially unchanged in both periods. Unfavorable currency translation was $105 million in the quarter and $183 million for the full year. Approximately 20% of our total sales are exposed to the euro, approximately 4% to the Brazilian real, and then we have approximately 2% exposure to both the Russian ruble and the Turkish lira.
Turning to Slide 11. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 4% on a year-over-year basis to $282 million or 14.3% of net sales. For the total company, the increase in adjusted EBITDA was due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of $48 million. Cost synergies were $22 million in the quarter. Selling, general and administrative and other expenses increased by $40 million, of which $17 million was attributable to an increase in incentive performance-based compensation and $14 million was related to salary inflation. Currency translation had a negative $17 million impact on EBITDA in the quarter. 
Despite currency headwinds, we delivered a 100 basis point improvement in adjusted gross profit margin and a 90 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA increased 8% year-over-year to $1.12 -- or to $1.12 billion or 14.4% of net sales. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of 3.2% or $150 million on essentially flat volume. Cost synergies of $97 million were more than offset by an increase in SG&A and other expenses of $127 million, of which $46 million was attributable to an increase in incentive performance-based compensation and $54 million was related to salary inflation. For the full year, currency had a negative impact of $30 million on adjusted EBITDA, yet we delivered a 100 basis point improvement in adjusted gross profit margin and a 90 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to 2013. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.59, as compared to $0.39 in the fourth quarter last year. 2014 EPS was $1.86, as compared to $1.39 in 2013, an increase of over 30%. The 2014 tax rate of 22% was lower than our previously provided guidance of 27%, largely due to the December enactment of credit extenders, as well as favorable earnings mix. In 2013, our tax rate was 21%.
During the fourth quarter 2014, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares for approximately $50 million at an average price of $36 per share. For the full year, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares for $184 million at an average price of $34 per share. This includes approximately 3.9 million shares purchased from the WRG Asbestos Personal Injury Trust in the second quarter of 2014. Since the beginning of this year, 2015, we have repurchased approximately 498,000 shares for $21 million at an average price of $41 per share. We will continue to be active in the market, and have the capacity to buy an additional $69 million in shares through the end of 2015. We continue to evaluate alternatives that will enable us to increase returns to our shareholders and maintain our target leverage of 3.5x to 4x.
Now turning to Slide 12. Free cash flow was a source of $612 million in 2014, excluding the Grace settlement. This compares favorably to a source of $509 million in 2013, due to higher earnings and an improvement in operating working capital management. Operating working capital, as a percent of net sales, improved from 17% at the end of 2013 to 14% -- at the end of 2013 compared to 14% at the end of 2014. The company focuses its management of operating working capital on a 13-month average target. For the 13-month period ending December 31, 2014, the average for operating working capital, as a percent of net sales, was 17%. This represents a 200 basis point improvement compared to 2013. CapEx was $154 million, and cash restructuring costs were $108 million in 2014. Cash payments related to SARs were $21 million, as compared with $46 million in the prior year. Cash interest payments in 2014, excluding the settlement, were $293 million, compared to $290 million in 2013.
Turning to Slide 13. In December 2014, we issued $425 million 4 7/8 senior notes due 2022, and $425 million 5 1/8 senior notes due 2024. Net proceeds from the offerings were used to repurchase the $750 million 8 1/8 senior notes. In July, we amended and restated our senior secured credit facilities. All together, these transactions reduced our annualized interest expense by approximately $30 million, provide extended maturities and increase covenant flexibility.
Turning to Slide 14. Our outlook for 2015 is presented. We expect net sales to be approximately $7.4 billion, a decline of approximately 5% on a reported basis, but an increase of approximately 2.5% in constant currency. As Jerome mentioned earlier, we estimate an unfavorable impact of approximately $550 million on sales from foreign currency translation. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.18, as compared to 2014 adjusted EPS of $1.86. We anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 25% in 2015. 
Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be in the range of $1.15 billion to $1.18 billion, or approximately 3% to 5.5% growth rate on a reported basis. Currency is estimated to have a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $80 million. We are confident that we can achieve the level of EBITDA presented as we continue to focus on our discipline to improve the quality of earnings, and benefit from favorable input cost. Additionally, we expect approximately $50 million in cost synergies, most of which will come from the earnings quality and improvement restructuring program. In late December, our board approved a new restructuring program, the ""Fusion Program"", which will consist of projects across our 3 divisions, as well as functional support. This program is expected to generate savings of approximately $80 million to $85 million by the end of 2018. We do not expect to realize any savings from this program until early 2016. The cost of the ""Fusion Program"" is expected to be approximately $275 million to $285 million, of which the net cash outflow is expected to be in the range of $210 million to $220 million. We anticipate the proceeds from asset sales and state incentives to be approximately $65 million. Our guidance for free cash flow is approximately $600 million for 2015, which excludes the tax refund related to the Grace settlement of approximately $245 million. Our outlook for free cash flow is derived from higher earnings, improvement from working capital and lower cash interest payments, offset by higher restructuring cash cost and capital expenditures as compared to 2014. Cash restructuring cost, excluding restructuring CapEx, are expected to be $120 million. This $120 million consists of approximately $50 million from previously announced restructuring programs, and approximately $70 million from the new ""Fusion Program"". Capital expenditures are expected to be $180 million, which includes approximately $45 million of CapEx related to restructuring activities. In 2014, CapEx was $154 million, of which approximately $25 million was related to restructuring. The year-over-year increase in CapEx for 2015 as compared to 2014, excluding the restructuring activities I just mentioned, is associated with target growth projects for Food Care, Product Care and Diversey Care, an R&D pilot plant and the second phase of our ERP implementation. Cash interest payments are expected to be $255 million, and cash taxes are expected to be $110 million.
Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, April 28 at 8:30 a.m., and Ken Chrisman, President of our Product Care Division, will be joining us for that discussion. We are also hosting our Analyst Day on Thursday, June 18 in New York City, as previously mentioned. I look forward to speaking with you again in the near future.
With that, operator, can you please open the call for questions?"

So our volume for 2015 is going to be at about 1.5% or so, and this compares with 0 volume growth that we had in 2014 and about slightly higher than 1% in 2013. We're going to see volume growth in the 3 divisions, led by Diversey Care and Product Care and also some in Food Care. So the story of price/mix is going to be somewhat different than the one of 2014, because obviously, the resin prices have been and are coming down. And as a result of that, it is not so much price which is going to be important in 2015, but just margin and margin expansion, and we do believe that we're going to be having margin expansion from all kind of things. Number one, we need to remember that we are in a recovery mode. We have lost a lot of pricing over the past few years, and we need to rehabilitate pricing. This is true for what I would call the commodity parts of our portfolio, specifically in Product Care and in Food Care. In Product Care, we still have a whole segment, which is we call the general use, which I would tend to call the more commoditized type of product line. And those, whereas they have been doing better in 2014, they are far from being at an acceptable level. So we're going to be holding very firm, and we are holding very firm, on our pricing. We'll only respond to competitive aggression, and that's all we're going to do. On Food Care, we do have some regional weaknesses in some product lines, and that is what we're going to be addressing on pricing. Obviously, currency translation is hurting, and as they all continue to go down, because the dollar is revaluating regularly amongst almost all currencies, we are in need to adjust our pricing."

So what we have in Sealed Air now is a whole commercial organization absolutely obsessed with understanding and satisfying customer needs.

So Jerome and Carol, as we think about how you have confidence in that goal, which you said you did, is most of the progress towards that going to come from mix and further value selling or will more of it come from productivity or other buckets?

Well, the big hitter in 2015 is obviously that we're going to have more than $0.5 billion of currency translation. Just imagine, just go back one second to the fourth quarter and imagine us publishing a constant-currency EBITDA number of about $300 million in the fourth quarter, which is what you would get if you add the $280 million and the $17 million of EBITDA currency translation loss. So you would have -- we would've all celebrated an extraordinary quarter. I can assure you that we would have just blown away our numbers on a constant-currency basis for 2015. But life is what it is, and we're taking -- we have felt it was coming, actually, very early in the fourth -- in September actually, and we have started very early to take measures, hence our Fusion project. To come to the point, half a -- $550 million and more possibly of foreign currency translation, equally balanced by volume, about $100 million, and price/mix. So that's the way we're seeing it. We're going to stay very firm on prices, first of all because resin is not the only component of our cost. It's only a part of it. We have -- we are a highly service company. As a result of that, we have a lot of manpower. We have 25,000 employees, or 24,000 employees in this company. And therefore, you remember my comment of 2 years ago about the salary match increase year-on-year. So this is a big part of the cost, and we have conversion cost, et cetera. Coming on to Diversey Care. Well, by definition, with 45% of our sales in Europe, we are -- we're exposed to currency and the translation that I just talked about. And therefore, we are anticipating a slight improvement in our profitability in dollar basis. Having said that, let me remind you that we are very clearly on the right track, as proven in 2013 EBITDA improvement, and as proven in our 2014 EBITDA improvement growth, as we have in constant currency, we have grown about 8%. So we're making wins in the field. It happens in the field. But we are very focused on margin improvement in that business, which is the thing which is going to last over time, no matter what currency is doing."

So if you take those 2 as cost increases to go from the $1.18 billion to the guidance we've provided for EBITDA for 2015, that tells you, and then you take the $50 million positive for cost synergies, you can do the math and see what's remaining, and that it's all coming -- a lot of good benefit from mix and price/cost spread, as well as the volume growth that Jerome highlighted, so both benefiting the company, and again, staying firm on our good practices and policies and the cultural changes that we're making. Also, I'll just mention real quickly, back to John's question, because of the great advances of technology, I got an update from our President of our Product Care Division to answer about the quality of the products, and he -- it's not meaningful yet, but we are starting to see a shift towards some of our Korrvu products for e-commerce, which is a much higher-quality product, as well as our inflatable bubble, which is also higher quality than some of our general use products. So we're starting to see a little bit of that trend, but it's still very minor at this point."

I said some time ago that we were not having reinvestment economics, and we did need -- we do need to have that. That -- this is the very basis of proper business management. So we have gotten pricing as a result of resins, and we have gotten other type of pricing at the very same time. In the future, we have, in Europe, for example, last year -- sorry, before coming to the future, we had last year pricing power also in Europe in -- despite a very poor environment. So this company is in transformation, and it is on the way of doing 2 things in a very disciplined way. The first one is good business management. You saw it in terms of margin expansion. We need margin expansion because we have -- because they have dramatically deteriorated in the past, and we're going to continue to be doing this. We're going to have mix improvement, because by definition, we're not putting the resources on our lower-margin products. We are shifting them towards higher-margin products. And we're doing working capital management. You've seen what we have done in just 1 year. We moved 300 basis points from 14% of operating working capital to -- no, from 17% operating working capital to 14%, and this is -- and we are continuing to do this kind of things. And at the very same time, we have started to reinvent this company, and this company is not going to be just about more plastic. It is going to be about the cutting-edge of the technologies which will enable our customers to win. That is what we are going towards. That should give them higher margins and give us higher margins."

Well, the buzzword, which is not mine, which is everybody's, is volatility, right? I got it all wrong in the fourth quarter when in October I said that we were anticipating -- we were already into the fourth quarter, and we were anticipating a $10 million negative EBITDA as a result of currency translation. We got $17 million, almost double. During the fourth quarter, our average exchange rate for the euro was 1.26, and the real at 2.47. The ruble at 43. Guess what? The ruble is at 66 today. The euro is at 1.13. The Brazilian real is at 2.81. So more volatile than that, I don't know. So which is why I'm stopping making projections on resin prices, for example, on currencies, et cetera, and our exchange rates for 2015 are at around those levels that we have today, although possibly, just a little bit more conservative and so. So where is it going to grow? We have -- we are expecting innovation to pull us, and actually, in Food Care, the innovation has already pulled us, pulled our results and our product mix, which is going really well. We're going to see a deceleration of the beef cycle -- negative beef cycle, so things should be improving a little bit in volume in North America, and we should see the hogs business have a little bit of growth in North America, which should be all good. Real at 2.80 is good for meat exports and for local profitability. So we should benefit a little bit about this. In Diversey Care, we're continuing to eliminate low-margin businesses, and at the same time, we have had a few solid customer wins and in hospitality -- we're going to have even more in health care, in the kitchen and on Taski. So I'm positive there. We should have some volume growth there. We continue to grow volume nicely in emerging countries. In Latin America, in Taski, we have been hurt by very fast devaluations, but we're up in reported dollars in AMAT, and we're growing very, very nicely in quite a few countries down there. And in Product Care, we have -- Carol talked about our Korrvu line. We have some specialty packaging there which are doing very well, and our systems, which are doing extremely well also, and that's where we are planning to shift. You have seen that we had growth in Product Care in Europe, which we didn't have for a while. We think we have a lot of momentum in North America and intend to do that. And by the way also, in Asia on our Product Care division, we are extremely optimistic that we're going to be succeeding there."

And as we look towards 2015, if you go kind of looking at the $600 million that we guided, we would anticipate -- if you do the math, taking into account  I gave you CapEx and restructuring payments, interest payments, you're going to come right somewhere around $110 million expected benefit from working capital management. We still are slightly over $100 million in past due receivables. So we expect some of that benefit to come from continuing to decrease our past dues. If you recall, we finished 2012 at over $200 million. So we've made great progress, but there's still some additional progress that we can make. Also, our management of inventory, we feel like there are continuing opportunities as we make our processes more robust around our sales and operations planning, as well as SKU optimization. We also had some investments in inventory as we started to implement some of our new distribution programs that our supply chain team is working on. So as we make those transitions, at times, we carry slightly higher levels of inventory, and then we right-size those. So we did have that right at year end. So we do have opportunities in both. Our payables, we've made great progress in increasing our days payable outstanding, and we will continue to focus on that as well, where it makes sense and where we have large dollar spend and large volume. In terms of the $97 million in savings that we provided for the improvement from 2013 to 2014, for cost synergies, most of that -- a large portion of that came from our EQIP program. We still had a little bit trailing from our Integration and Optimization Program, but the larger portion was from the EQIP program. And as we look to 2015, as we noted, almost all of that $50 million in cost synergies will come from the EQIP program as well, with the new ""Fusion Program"" starting to give us a positive return at the beginning, as we move into 2016. The new program has an internal rate of return in excess of 40%. So we're really excited about what that's going to bring to our cost structure as well."

The -- what surprised me is not so much the results, but because the result -- because the financials are the consequence of what we're doing. What surprises me is the speed at which from Q3 to Q4 of 2013 this organization has shifted its mind, and this organization is now a courageous organization. We have our people who believe, our people who see how we're winning and how we can continue to win, have taken the responsibility of the price leadership and of the product mix leadership and of the innovation -- the need for innovation, and therefore, things are moving at a pace which is very different than from the past. And I could see that, as I said, sometimes, late Q3, early Q4 of last year. And therefore, you now are seeing the results that we had. We started in the first quarter, but in fact, it amplified throughout the year. You should -- as we have said during the prepared remarks, our Product Care and Diversey Care business had constant-currency sales improving every single quarter. In Q1, our Diversey Care business improved in constant currency by 1.2% in Q1 of '14. It went up and up and up, and in the fourth quarter of 2014, it went up by 4%, and this is obviously something extremely important. And same with our Product Care, which started the year at 2.6% and finished the year at 4.6%, and this is extremely important because there is a change in pace. There is more courage in the organization, et cetera. Doesn't mean that it's going to continue to grow crescendo like this, because we have, as I said before, a very volatile environment and so on. So we're not going to take currency as an excuse. We have to do what we have to do. We're going to continue doing and forging ahead through a disciplined approach to our business to improve operationally and to start building, and we have started that, to start building the future. So as to what didn't go that well, I would say I'm not going to contradict myself with what I said before, because I've been really positively surprised as to how we're gaining this -- how we're making this cultural change and so. So the negative are uncontrollable factors, and I don't control currency, and I don't control the overall economy. Having said that, we were not expecting the economy to improve much better. So this is going to be considered as a plus if it does come. It's been iffy in the last 2 to 3 years, and we believe that in 2015, it's going to continue to be iffy."

In -- we are resolutely on our way to 20% EBITDA in the mid- to long-term.

At this point, I'm sure that you had the chance to review our press release and earnings results for the first quarter. I have to say that I'm very pleased with the results and we had a great start to the year. 
We stayed discipline throughout the quarter and delivered on our objectives despite heavy currency headwinds. Net sales of $1.7 billion are down 4.4% as reported, but in constant dollars, net sales were up 3.5% compared to last year first quarter. 
Each and all regions delivered constant dollar sales growth and favorable price mix. The combination of favorable price/mix and lower input costs resulted in a gross margin improvement over 200 basis points with strong performance in both Food Care and Product Care. 
For adjusted EBITDA, we delivered $284 million of 16.3% of net sales despite $22 million of unfavorable currency translation. This represents a 260 basis point margin improvement and in constant dollars an increase of 22% compared to last year performance. 
Food Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of 21.7% and Product Care adjusted EBITDA was 20%. Diversey Care was hit the hardest by currency, but still delivered 6% adjusted EBITDA growth on a constant dollar basis. I will leave the details of the financials and business trends to Carol and our guest executive speaker, Ken Chrisman, who is the President of our Product Care division. 
Before I pass the call to Carol and Ken, I want to highlight a few items. As we have communicated many times, we are very committed to a disciplined approach to portfolio management with a focus on innovation and becoming a knowledge-based company. In alignment with this strategy, in March, we acquired the assets of Intellibot Robotics, a startup U.S. based private company, that pioneered in the development of robotic commercial flow cleaning machines. Intellibot is really the only currently selling advanced robotics flow care machine outside of the consumer market. These intelligent machines are empowered with sensors used for navigation and are also connected to the cloud for data monitoring, optimization, troubleshooting, servicing and upgrading software. The robotic technology is agnostic to different types of sensors, which will enable new features to be seamlessly incorporated into the platform as they come to market. 
The combination of Intellibot Robotics' expertise and Diversey Care's Taski mechanical cleaning leadership will accelerate the growth of robotics and what is known as the Internet of Things in the flow cleaning market. We are still early stages of robotics and automation in the cleaning and hygiene industry and we are excited to bring the first team of artificial intelligence specialists from Intellibot to Sealed Air Diversey Care. 
In early April, we completed the sale of our North American trade business, our non-core asset within our Food Care division. While we had become the global leader in the food grade absorbent pads, this business was becoming quickly commoditized and face significant competitive pricing pressures. The business was heading below 10% profit margin and the North American trays and bass business generated about $200 million of sales in 2014 and approximately $50 million in the first quarter. 
I also wanted to share 2 important organization decisions. First, we have decided to build and pwn the campus in Charlotte, North Carolina -- we have decided to build and own the campus and Charlotte, North Carolina for financial reasons. After conducting extensive financial analysis, owning the campus versus signing a long-term these made the most economical sense. This new state-of-the-art global headquarters will be the home of not just our 3 divisional headquarters but also the home of our largest R&D center. 
The proceeds from the ales of our trade and bass business and the sale of our building will fund approximately 2/3 of this capital investment. As a result of this decision, we increased our CapEx budget from $180 million to $210 million in 2015. And second, we made a decision effective in April that we will realign the countries within Asia, Middle East, Africa and Turkey, which we had referred to as our AMAT region. We are also realigning the Japan, Australia and New Zealand region and going forward we will report network sales of Europe, Mid East, Africa and Turkey as the EMEA region. The remaining region will include Asia, Australia, New Zealand and Japan and will be reported as Asia Pacific. We believe that this realignment will increase local focus and place more accountability in the hands of regional and divisional leaders to create greater cross-selling opportunities across divisions and especially a faster decision-making process. 
For today's discussion, Q1 results are presented under the historic regions as these changes are just now taking place. We will provide you with the sales trends by new regional alignment at our Analyst Day on June 18 and on our July 30 second quarter earnings call. 
With that, let's get started with an overview of our financial results. Carol?"

I will highlight sales trends on a constant dollar basis as compared to last year, unless otherwise noted. In the first quarter, Latin America and the region comprised of Japan and Australia and New Zealand were our fastest-growing region, with constant dollar growth of 7% and 5%, respectively. 
On a reported basis, both regions were down mid-single digits. Constant dollar growth in Latin America and Japan ANZ were driven by strength in our Food Care business with increased demand in Argentina, Mexico and Australia. The AMAT region was up 3% in the quarter with positive trends in India and Africa for both Food Care and Diversey Care. 
North America sales were up 3% compared to last year with 3% growth in each of our divisions. Europe was also up 3% in the quarter in constant dollars, but down 13% as reported. We delivered 7% constant dollar sales growth in the U.K. and 1% growth in Spain. France, Italy, Germany and Switzerland were flat to down 1%, and Holland was down in the mid-single digits. The 7 countries I just referenced accounted for approximately 20% of first quarter consolidated sales. 
Russia and Poland had solid performance, with Russia delivering a 50% constant dollar sales growth and Poland delivering 7% growth. 
Turning to Slide 5. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.7 billion in sales, an increase of 3.5% in constant dollars and favorable currency translation had an impact on net sales of $146 million or 8%, mostly due to the declines in the euro and the Russian ruble. Net sales on an as-reported basis were down 4.4%. Favorable price/mix was 3.2% or $58 million and volume was up slightly. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% on a year-over-year basis to $284 million or 16.3% of net sales. For the total company, the increase in adjusted EBITDA was largely due to favorable mix and price cost spreads of $56 million. Cost synergies also made a positive contribution of $17 million in the quarter. SG&A and other expenses increased by $18 million, with wage inflation being our largest driver. As a reminder, our annual compensation increases occur April 1 each year. 
Unfavorable currency translation had an impact on adjusted EBITDA of $22 million. We delivered a 210 basis point improvement and adjusted gross profit margin and a 260 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, our adjusted EBITDA increased 22% as compared to last year's results. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.54 as compared to $0.33 in the first quarter last year. Currency negatively impacted EPS by $0.05. The tax rate for Q1 2015 was 25% as compared with 21% for Q1 2014. 
In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares for a total value of approximately $64 million. As communicated on our last earnings call, our EBITDA leverage ratio target is 3.5 to 4x. We believe this is an optimal leverage ratio for our company. We are currently evaluating options that will enable us to increase returns to our shareholders while maintaining our target leverage. 
On Slide 6, we outlined our price/mix, volume trends and sales growth on a constant dollar basis by division and by region. As you can see, we had constant dollar sales growth and favorable price/mix in every division and in every region. And this is our fourth consecutive quarter where we delivered at least the percent constant dollar sales growth despite our global rationalization efforts. 
I will now turn the call over to Ken who will provide you with a more detailed review of Product Care, as well as highlighted performance of Diversey Care and Food Care. Ken?"

Slide 7 highlights the results from our Product Care division. Before we get into the quarter, I want to briefly discuss the organizational changes we made in Product Care that we believe will accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. Effective January 1, we realigned Product Care into Global Performance Packaging, which is approximately 40% of Product Care sales and Global General packaging, representing approximately 60% of Product Care sales. 
Global Performance packaging includes our differentiated proprietary platforms that focus primarily on cushioning and damage reduction such as Instapak, automated systems, core view and specialty foams. Global General packaging is derived of our more highly distributed solutions such as our utility offerings, including bubble wrap and foam and our higher growth offerings including mailers, inflatable bubble and paper systems. We also formed a dedicated global sales team to focus on the rapidly expanding e-commerce marketplace and our automated systems. Our end-to-end innovative product offering, combined with our packaging design expertise and global reach, provides us with a significant competitive advantage across multiple industries, including e-commerce. And with this realignment, we are confident we are well positioned to take full advantage of future growth opportunities. 
One thing to keep in mind is that while we are focusing on growth opportunities, we remain committed to delivering earnings quality and our customer and product rationalization efforts are ongoing. Let's take a look at our first quarter performance. Net sales were up slightly in constant dollars. You can see that we had a favorable price/mix of 3.4% on volumes that declined 2.3%. Favorable price/mix is a direct result of the success we've had in shifting our business to higher performance packaging and our ability to maintain our pricing discipline.  First quarter volume was impacted by rationalization efforts in general packaging in all regions. 
Let's turn to adjusted EBITDA. Product Care achieved adjusted EBITDA margins of 20% or $76 million in the first quarter. Favorable price/mix, lower input costs and cost synergies more than offset FX headwinds, resulting in an increase in adjusted EBITDA of 9% as compared to first quarter 2014. In constant dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 16%. In Product Care, we remain on track to deliver EBITDA growth and margin expansion in 2015. 
Slide 8 highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant currency basis were up 1.5% in the first quarter. Favorable price/mix was up nearly 2% with positive trends across all regions. Volume was relatively flat. In constant dollars, AMAT sales increased to 4% led by mid-single-digit growth in China and double-digit growth in India. North America sales increased 3% on volumes that were up just over 2%, representing the fifth consecutive quarter of sales growth from North America. 
Sales in Latin America and Australia and New Zealand were up slightly, while Europe was essentially unchanged. In Europe, sales were up in the U.K., France and Italy. From a global end market perspective, our strongest sectors in the quarter were building service contractors, hospitality and health care. 
In February, we announced that we signed a 5-year global contract with Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group, which represents a significant expansion from our previous 4-year EMEA contract. For those of you who didn't see this press release, our contract with Carlson includes more than 1,300 hotels spanning 105 countries and territories. In addition to the Intellibot Robotics acquisition that Jerome highlighted, Diversey Care introduced a revolutionary small sized scrubber, the Taski 2100 Micro, equipped with Intellitrail, a GPS enabled remote monitoring device for Taski machines. 
Diversey Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $41 million or 8.8% of net sales in the quarter. As we anticipated, currency translation negatively impacted our performance in the quarter. Excluding FX, adjusted EBITDA was up 6% compared to last year. Also it is important to note that while top line was relatively flat in Europe, we had record level EBITDA margins in this region. 
Aside from FX, we also continued to invest in R&D and sales and marketing to drive future growth, which offset the margin improvements we delivered in Europe. With that said, we continue to estimate constant dollar EBITDA growth and margin expansion for the full year. 
On Slide 9, we highlight results for our Food Care division, which had an outstanding quarter. In the first quarter, Food Care sales increased 5.8% in constant dollars with favorable price/mix of 3.8% and volume growth of 2%. Our fastest-growing countries in constant dollars were Australia, the U.K., Russia, Mexico and Argentina, which all delivered double-digit growth. 
Developing regions, which include Latin America, AMAT and Eastern European countries, were up 15%, with Latin America up 12% and AMAT up 5%. Europe and JANZ were both up 7% in North America was up 3%. Price/mix was favorable in every region except for AMAT, which declined slightly due to favorable mix. For volume, we had positive trends in every region except for Latin America due to pricing adjustments in response to currency devaluations. 
In Europe, we outperformed the protein market, which was up in the low single digits due to a more favorable mix driven by demand for our new products and continued pricing discipline. We also had double-digit growth in equipment solution sales in the quarter. 
In North America, our sales were up in the single digits despite cattle production being down nearly 6%. Despite unfavorable market trends in cattle, we still experienced increased demand in fresh red meat due to the adoption in new products and our continued focus an value selling. For the remainder of the year, we expect that these markets to continue to decline but at a decelerating rate that than what we've been expressing over the last 6 to 9 months. We also experienced strong sales is booked and processed meats and poultry. Both markets were up approximately 4% to 5% in the quarter. 
While we expect these trends to continue, we are closely monitoring the poultry market due to the recent outbreak of avian influenza. From a product perspective, I want to highlight that during the first quarter, our dark breast entrée package receive the highest achievement award from the Flexible Packaging Associations 59th annual awards and innovation showcase. Darfresh on Tray improves product visibility and extend shelf life for the consumers and retailers while processors benefit from sustainable operational efficiency improvements and throughput and up to 40% reduction in top film with no material scrap. 
Turning to Food Care's adjusted EBITDA performance, Food Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $191 million or 21.7% of net sales, an increase of 20% as compared to last year. This increase was largely a result of an improved mix of premium products, pricing initiatives and cost synergies. Going forward, in 2015, we expect to continue to benefit from further adoption of our new products and continued focus on value selling, which would be offset partially by currency headwinds and formula pricing.  I will note, however, that we're well on track to deliver adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion. 
Now let me pass the call back to cattle to review our cash flow and outlook. Carol?"
382724,291489398,798539,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ken. Turning to Slide 10. Free cash flow was a source of $63 million for the first 3 months of the year. Excluding the $235 million tax refund received related to the growth settlement. This compares favorably to a use of $31 million and the 3",803,"Thank you, Ken. Turning to Slide 10. Free cash flow was a source of $63 million for the first 3 months of the year. Excluding the $235 million tax refund received related to the growth settlement. This compares favorably to a use of $31 million and the 3 months ending 2014 due to higher earnings and an improvement in operating working capital management. As many of you know, the company focuses its management of operating working capital on a 13-month average target. For the 13-month period and in March 31, 2015, the average for operating working capital as a percent of net sales was 16%. This represents a 230 basis point improvement compared to March 31, 2014. 
CapEx was $21 million and cash restructuring costs were $22 million for the 3 months of Q1 2013. Our updated outlook for 2015 is reflected on Slide 11. We now expect net sales to be approximately $7.1 billion as compared to our previously provided guidance of $7.4 billion. Unfavorable currency is expected to be approximately 9% or nearly $700 million as compared to our previous guidance of approximately 7% or $550 million. Our current outlook assumes a year-over-year rate of $1 10. 
Additionally, our previous outlook included approximately $200 million in sales for the trays and pads business. This disposition does not qualify under the accounting rules for treatment as discontinued operations. Therefore, prior years and Q1 2015 will continue to include North America trays and pads, but we will have no benefit from this business going forward. Excluding the impact of the divestiture and currency headwinds, we anticipate an organic growth of approximately 3%. This compares our previous guidance of approximately 2.5%. 
Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.14 billion to $1.16 billion, which compares to our previous guidance of $1.15 billion to $1.18 billion. This reflects a slight reduction for the removal of the trays and pads business as well as the increased FX headwinds. Currency is now estimated to have a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $100 million as compared to our previous forecast of approximately $80 million. If you exclude the FX headwinds and $15 million impact of the divestiture of our trays and pads business, adjusted EBITDA guidance would have been above the high end of our previous range. 
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.15. As compared to 2014 adjusted earnings per share of $1.86. Currency is expected to negatively impact earnings per share by approximately $0.35. Our constant currency earnings per share would be approximately $2.43 to $2.50. Our interest expense for 2015 is now expected to be $245 million as compared to our previous forecast of $255 million. We anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 25% in 2015. 
We are revising our free cash flow guidance to $575 million from $600 million to reflect the lower adjusted EBITDA forecast and higher CapEx, partially offset by lower cash interest payments. Free cash flow outlook also excludes the $235 million tax refund we received during the first quarter related to the great settlement. As Jerome mentioned, owning the campus in Charlotte instead of signing a long-term lease is the right economic decision. The decision has led to an increase on our CapEx budget of $210 million from our original forecast of $180 million, of which approximately $75 million is related to these restructuring activities. While the proceeds from the sale of the trays and pads business and the sale of our facility are not part of free cash flow, they have in fact resulted in cash receipts. These proceeds will be reflected in investing activities on our cash flow statement, which sits below free cash flow. 
During the quarter, we entered into a cross currency swap for U.S.-based debt to euro denominated, increasing our euro based debt exposure to 14% from the previous 4% level. This transaction, combined with higher cash balances, reduces our cash interest payments to $240 million for the year as compared to our previous expectation of $255 million. 
Other key elements of our free cash flow have not changed. Cash restructuring costs, excluding restructuring CapEx, are still expected to be $120 million. We are on track to recognize $50 million in cost synergies in 2015 from our restructuring efforts. 
This concludes my prepared remarks. But before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, July 30, at 8:30 a.m. We are also hosting our Analyst Day on Thursday, June 18, in New York City.

We had a 9% negative translation in the first quarter at the sales level, which is $45 million and obviously, this had been hurt most. So the highlights of Diversey Care for the quarter are that we're sustaining now and accelerating our growth in the U.S. You have seen a 4% sales growth, which is really good and then we're continuing to making roads in that important and large market. Our hospitality market globally has been very strong with double-digit growth and our health care market in North America has been very, very strong. Where we have right now short-term difficulties is probably in Russia and in some parts of the Middle East because the Russians were a lot and were spending a lot in hospitality and given the local political and economic situation, you have a little bit of reduction of that, which is affecting Dubai or -- for example, and affecting also tourism within Russia. And this is short term because we believe it is going to be turning around. With regards to China, the first quarter, we had middle digit growth -- middle single-digit growth in Diversey Care in China and this is a little bit of a disappointment because we're used to double-digit growth. But this is mostly coming from the fact that we have -- that the new hotel opening, because of the real estate crisis in China, has been much slower than in the past. We are growing nicely in restaurants and quick service with local chains, some international chains have been hurt in the recent past, but we also expect that this is going to get much better. Brazil is a region where the whole company and the result of the whole economy has been hurt including Diversey Care. And again, you know the economic environment there and the very strong devaluations. All of those things, nevertheless, make me very positive. We had 6% EBITDA growth in constant currency in Diversey Care, we have lots of innovation. The Intellibot, which is a startup, is not going to impact sales but it is going to have a midterm tremendous benefit on our business. And we are growing where we really want to grow. Hospitality, health care and so on a very important segment for us."

You've seen what we've been doing on price/mix in the divisions which are quite exposed to resins, which are Food Care and Product Care. But we've done -- in Food Care, we've done 2.8% price/mix in the first quarter. The very bulk of it, the very large majority of this 2.8% is price. You've seen what we've done in Product Care and we've been doing 3.4% in the whole -- sorry, I've made a mistake. In North America, in Food Care, we had a price/mix of 2.8%, in the total company we had the price/mix for Food Care globally of 3.8%. And again, the very large majority is in price. In Product Care, globally 3.4%, in North America is 4.2%. So we are very active on price and the reason is that I keep on saying and our customers accept that when we talk, have good conversations on of the value we create, is that in most of the cases, our packaging cost, be in Product Care or be in Food Care, have a negative cost. What I mean by negative cost is that the cost of damage coming from products being broken in Product Care or the cost of shell of foodwaste as a result of shared, et cetera, et cetera, is much higher than the cost of the packaging. As a result of that, it is not about reducing the cost of our package by $0.01, $0.02 cents, et cetera, et cetera, it is about reducing the food waste and reducing the damage. These are the serious conversations that we're having with our customers, which allow us to price for value and this is extremely important there. 
And maybe Ken can add something here, give some color."

Also the dedicated sales team in e-commerce is also a significant driver. As we look at markets, the biggest change of Product Care is the emphasis of product and an emphasis on markets.

So that's the spend -- approximately the spend for 2015. I would like to note that one of the reasons that the decision makes sense from an economic standpoint is what Jerome emphasized that the campus includes our largest R&D center and the cost for an R&D center as compared to a regular office building, it's significantly different. It's more than twice the cost. We will reap the value of this investment, but it makes it difficult when you come to trying to do what would be a triple net lease or standard lease. No lessor is going to want to finance that because is not necessarily transferable to someone else if you vacated the building. So the cost we would have paid on a lease-based basis would have been significantly higher than our cash cost even with an interest burden and at the end of the lease period, we would end up owning only nothing, whereas we will own this asset and it will be very valuable for our future as a company to attract talent and to support innovation and growth for the company. 
With respect to sort of maintenance CapEx, it really runs less, slightly under $100 million. So everything that you're seeing this year between that $100 million to $180 million, including restructuring investments, has a very positive return for the company. So some of the focus above and beyond the maintenance CapEx we obviously are always investing to improve the quality of our products. We're investing in capital that helps us with our innovation such as producing the Darfresh on Tray. We also are investing to make sure our assets are located in the right regions where we have growth. So we've said that we expect our growth to be disproportionately higher in our developing regions, such as Asia-Pacific and Eastern Europe as well as in Latin America. So that's where a lot of focus for investments are headed."

But we feel like that $200 million, based on the current business, is plenty to fund us and actually if you look at our spend trend, we typically fall well below that absent any restructuring spend and had very healthy investments from an d innovation standpoint. And as a reminder, the Diversey Care business is very low on capital intensity. And also, if you look at our investment requirements for CapEx relative to a lot of our peers, we have a much lower requirement for investment of our total operating cost relative to our peers, yet we produced some of the highest returns in the industry.

At this point, I'm sure that you had the chance to review our press release and earnings results for the first quarter. I have to say that I'm very pleased with the results, and we had a great start into the year.
We stayed disciplined throughout the quarter and delivered on our objectives despite heavy currency headwinds. Net sales of $1.7 billion are down 4.4% as reported, but in constant dollars, net sales were up 3.5% compared to last year's first quarter.
Each division and all regions delivered constant-dollar sales growth and favorable price/mix. The combination of favorable price/mix and lower input costs resulted in a gross margin improvement of over 200 basis points, with strong performance in both Food Care and Product Care.
For adjusted EBITDA, we delivered $284 million or 16.3% of net sales despite $22 million of unfavorable currency translation. This represents a, 260-basis-point margin improvement, and in constant dollars, an increase of 22% compared to last year's performance.
Food Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of 21.7%, and Product Care adjusted EBITDA was 20%. Diversey Care was hit the hardest by currency but still delivered 6% adjusted EBITDA growth on a constant-dollar basis. I will leave the details on the financials and business trends to Carol and our guest executive speaker, Ken Chrisman, who is the President of our Product Care division.
Before I pass the call to Carol and Ken, I want to highlight a few items. As we have communicated many times, we are very committed to a disciplined approach to portfolio management, with a focus on innovation and becoming a knowledge-based company. In alignment with this strategy, in March, we acquired the assets of Intellibot Robotics, a startup U.S.-based private company that pioneered the development of robotic commercial floor cleaning machines. Intellibot is really the only currently selling advanced robotics floor care machine outside of the consumer market. These intelligent machines are empowered with sensors used for navigation and are also connected to the cloud for data monitoring, optimization, troubleshooting, servicing and upgrading software. The robotic technology is agnostic to different types of sensors, which will enable new features to be seamlessly incorporated into the platform as they come to market.
The combination of Intellibot Robotics' expertise and Diversey Care's TASKI mechanical cleaning leadership will accelerate the growth of robotics and what is known as the Internet of Things in the floor cleaning market. We are still at the early stages of robotics and automation in the cleaning and hygiene industry, and we are excited to bring the first team of artificial intelligence specialists from Intellibot to Sealed Air Diversey Care.
In early April, we completed the sale of our North American trays and pads business, our noncore asset within our Food Care division. While we had become the global leader in the food grade absorbent pads, this business was becoming quickly commoditized and faced significant competitive pricing pressures. The business was heading below 10% profit margin, and the North American trays and pads business generated about $200 million of sales -- in sales in 2014 and approximately $50 million in the first quarter.
I also wanted to share 2 important organizational decisions. First, we have decided to build and own the campus in Charlotte, North Carolina to -- we have decided to build and own the campus in Charlotte, North Carolina for financial reasons. After conducting extensive financial analysis, owning the campus versus signing a long-term lease made the most economical sense. This new state-of-the-art global headquarters will be the home of not just our 3 divisional headquarters, but also the home of our largest R&D center.
The proceeds from the sales of our trays and pads business and the sale of our building in Racine will fund approximately 2/3 of this capital investment. As a result of this decision, we increased our CapEx budget from $180 million to $210 million in 2015. And second, we made a decision effective in April that we will realign the countries within Asia, Middle East, Africa and Turkey, which we had referred to as our AMAT region. We are also realigning the Japan, Australia and New Zealand region, and going forward, we will report network sales of Europe, Middle East, Africa and Turkey as the EMEA region. The remaining region will include Asia, Australia, New Zealand and Japan and will be reported as Asia-Pacific. We believe that this realignment will increase local focus and place more accountability in the hands of regional and divisional leaders to create greater cross-selling opportunities across divisions and especially a faster decision-making process.
For today's discussion, Q1 results are presented under the historic regions as these changes are just now taking place. We will provide you with sales trends by new regional alignment at our Analyst Day on June 18 and on our July 30 Second Quarter Earnings Call. 
With that, let's get started with an overview of our financial results. Carol?"

On Slide 4, we present our performance by region for the first quarter. I will highlight sales trends on a constant-dollar basis as compared to last year, unless otherwise noted.
In the first quarter, Latin America and the region comprised of Japan and Australia and New Zealand were our fastest-growing region, with constant-dollar growth of 7% and 5%, respectively.
On a reported basis, both regions were down mid-single digits. Constant-dollar growth in Latin America and Japan/ANZ were driven by strength in our Food Care business with increased demand in Argentina, Mexico and Australia. The AMAT region was up 3% in the quarter, with positive trends in India and Africa for both Food Care and Diversey Care.
North America sales were up 3% compared to last year, with 3% growth in each of our divisions. Europe was also up 3% in the quarter in constant dollars but down 13% as reported. We delivered 7% constant-dollar sales growth in the U.K. and 1% growth in Spain. France, Italy, Germany and Switzerland were flat to down 1%, and Holland was down in the mid-single digits. The 7 countries I just referenced accounted for approximately 20% of first quarter consolidated sales.
Russia and Poland had solid performance, with Russia delivering nearly 50% constant-dollar sales growth and Poland delivering 7% growth.
Turning to Slide 5. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.7 billion in sales, an increase of 3.5% in constant dollars, and favorable currency translation had an impact on net sales of $146 million or 8%, mostly due to the declines in the euro and the Russian ruble. Net sales on an as-reported basis were down 4.4%. Favorable price/mix was 3.2% or $58 million, and volume was up slightly.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% on a year-over-year basis to $284 million or 16.3% of net sales. For the total company, the increase in adjusted EBITDA was largely due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of $56 million. Cost synergies also made a positive contribution of $17 million in the quarter. SG&A and other expenses increased by $18 million, with wage inflation being our largest driver. As a reminder, our annual compensation increases occur April 1 each year.
Unfavorable currency translation had an impact on adjusted EBITDA of $22 million. We delivered a 210-basis-point improvement in adjusted gross profit margin and a 260-basis-point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to the prior year. On a constant-currency basis, our adjusted EBITDA increased 22% as compared to last year's results.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.54 as compared to $0.33 in the first quarter last year. Currency has negatively impacted EPS by $0.05. The tax rate for Q1 2015 was 25% as compared with 21% for Q1 2014.
In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares for a total value of approximately $64 million. As communicated on our last earnings call, our EBITDA leverage ratio target is 3.5x to 4x. We believe this is an optimal leverage ratio for our company. We are currently evaluating options that will enable us to increase returns to our shareholders while maintaining our target leverage.
On Slide 6, we outlined our price/mix, volume trends and sales growth on a constant-dollar basis by division and by region. As you can see, we had constant-dollar sales growth and favorable price/mix in every division and in every region. And this is our fourth consecutive quarter where we delivered at least 3% constant-dollar sales growth despite our global rationalization efforts.
I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will provide you with a more detailed review of Product Care as well as highlight the performance of Diversey Care and Food Care. Ken?"

Slide 7 highlights the results from our Product Care division. Before we get into the quarter, I want to briefly discuss the organizational changes we made in Product Care that we believe will accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. Effective January 1, we realigned Product Care into Global Performance Packaging, which is approximately 40% of Product Care sales, and Global General Packaging, representing approximately 60% of Product Care sales.
Global Performance Packaging includes our differentiated proprietary platforms that focus primarily on cushioning and damage reduction, such as Instapak, automated systems, core view and specialty foams. Global General Packaging is derived of our more highly distributed solutions, such as our utility offerings, including bubble wrap and cellular foam, and our higher-growth offerings, including mailers, inflatable bubble and paper systems.
We also formed a dedicated global sales team to focus on the rapidly expanding e-commerce marketplace and our automated systems. Our end-to-end innovative product offering, combined with our packaging design expertise and global reach, provides us with a significant competitive advantage across multiple industries, including e-commerce. And with this realignment, we are confident we are well positioned to take full advantage of future growth opportunities.
One thing to keep in mind is that while we are focusing on growth opportunities, we remain committed to delivering earnings quality, and our customer and product rationalization efforts are ongoing.
Let's take a look at our first quarter performance. Net sales were up slightly in constant dollars. You can see that we had a favorable price/mix of 3.4% on volumes that declined 2.3%. Favorable price/mix is a direct result of the success we have had in shifting our business to higher-performance packaging and our ability to maintain our pricing discipline. First quarter volume was impacted by rationalization efforts in general packaging in all regions.
Let's turn to adjusted EBITDA. Product Care achieved adjusted EBITDA margins of 20% or $76 million in the first quarter. Favorable price/mix, lower input costs and cost synergies more than offset FX headwinds, resulting in an increase in adjusted EBITDA of 9% as compared to first quarter 2014. In constant dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 16%. In Product Care, we remain on track to deliver EBITDA growth and margin expansion in 2015.
Slide 8 highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales, on a constant-currency basis, were up 1.5% in the first quarter. Favorable price/mix was up nearly 2% with positive trends across all regions. Volume was relatively flat. In constant dollars, AMAT sales increased 4% led by mid-single-digit growth in China and double-digit growth in India. North America sales increased 3% on volumes that were up just over 2%, representing the fifth consecutive quarter of sales growth in North America.
Sales in Latin America and Australia and New Zealand were up slightly, while Europe was essentially unchanged. In Europe, sales were up in the U.K., France and Italy. From a global end market perspective, our strongest sectors in the quarter were building service contractors, hospitality and health care.
In February, we announced that we signed a 5-year global contract with Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group, which represents a significant expansion from our previous 4-year EMEA contract. For those of you who didn't see this press release, our contract with, Carlson includes more than 1,300 hotels spanning 105 countries and territories. In addition to the Intellibot Robotics acquisition that Jerome highlighted, Diversey Care introduced a revolutionary small-sized scrubber, the TASKI 2100 Micro, equipped with IntelliTrail, a GPS-enabled remote monitoring device for TASKI machines.
Diversey Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $41 million or 8.8% of net sales in the quarter. As we anticipated, currency translation negatively impacted our performance in the quarter. Excluding FX, adjusted EBITDA was up 6% compared to last year. Also, it is important to note that while top line was relatively flat in Europe, we had record level EBITDA margins in this region.
Aside from FX, we also continued to invest in R&D and sales and marketing to drive future growth, which offset the margin improvements we delivered in Europe. With that said, we continue to estimate constant-dollar EBITDA growth and margin expansion for the full year.
On Slide 9, we highlight results for our Food Care division, which had an outstanding quarter. In the first quarter, Food Care sales increased 5.8% in constant dollars with favorable price/mix of 3.8% and volume growth of 2%. Our fastest-growing countries in constant dollars were Australia, the U.K., Russia, Mexico and Argentina, which all delivered double-digit growth.
Developing regions, which include Latin America, AMAT and Eastern European countries, were up 15%, with Latin America up 12% and AMAT up 5%. Europe and JANZ were both up 7%, and North America was up 3%. Price/mix was favorable in every region except for AMAT, which declined slightly due to unfavorable mix. For volume, we had positive trends in every region, except for Latin America due to pricing adjustments in response to currency devaluations.
In Europe, we outperformed the protein market, which was up in the low single digits due to a more favorable mix driven by demand for our new products and continued pricing discipline. We also had double-digit growth in equipment solution sales in the quarter.
In North America, our sales were up in the single digits despite cattle production being down nearly 6%. Despite unfavorable market trends in cattle, we still experienced increased demand in fresh red meat due to the adoption of new products and our continued focus on value selling. For the remainder of the year, we expect that these markets to continue to decline but at a decelerating rate than what we've been experiencing over the last 6 to 9 months. We also experienced strong sales in smoked and processed meats and poultry. Both markets were up approximately 4% to 5% in the quarter. While we expect these trends to continue in pork, we are closely monitoring the poultry market due to the recent outbreak of avian influenza.
From a product perspective, I want to highlight that during the first quarter, our Darfresh On Tray package received the Highest Achievement Award from the Flexible Packaging Association's 59th annual awards in Innovation Showcase. Darfresh On Tray improves product visibility and extend shelf life for the consumers and retailers, while processors benefit from sustainable operational efficiency improvements in throughput and up to 40% reduction in top film with no material scrap
Turning to Food Care's adjusted EBITDA performance. Food Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $191 million or 21.7% of net sales, an increase of 20% as compared to last year. This increase was largely a result of an improved mix of premium products, pricing initiatives and cost synergies. Going forward, in 2015, we expect to continue to benefit from further adoption of our new products and continued focus on value selling, which will be offset partially by currency headwinds and formula pricing. I will note, however, that we are well on track to deliver adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion.
Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our cash flow and outlook. Carol?"
382724,291489398,798789,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ken. Turning to Slide 10. Free cash flow was the source of $63 million for the first 3 months of the year. Excluding the $235 million tax refund received related to the growth settlement, this compares favorably to a use of $31 million in the 3",798,"Thank you, Ken. Turning to Slide 10. Free cash flow was the source of $63 million for the first 3 months of the year. Excluding the $235 million tax refund received related to the growth settlement, this compares favorably to a use of $31 million in the 3 months ending 2014 due to higher earnings and an improvement in operating working capital management.
As many of you know, the company focuses its management of operating working capital on a 13-month average target. For the 13-month period ending March 31, 2015, the average for operating working capital as a percent of net sales was 16%. This represents a 230-basis-point improvement compared to March 31, 2014.
CapEx was $21 million, and cash restructuring costs were $22 million for the 3 months of Q1 2013. Our updated outlook for 2015 is reflected on Slide 11. We now expect net sales to be approximately $7.1 billion as compared to our previously provided guidance of $7.4 billion. Unfavorable currency is expected to be approximately 9% or nearly $700 million as compared to our previous guidance of approximately 7% or $550 million. Our current outlook assumes a euro rate of $1.10.
Additionally, our previous outlook included approximately $200 million in sales for the trays and pads business. This disposition does not qualify under the accounting rules for treatment as discontinued operations. Therefore, prior years and Q1 2015 will continue to include North America trays and pads, but we will have no benefit from this business going forward. Excluding the impact of the divestiture and currency headwinds, we anticipate an organic growth of approximately 3%. This compares to our previous guidance of approximately 2.5%.
Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.14 billion to $1.16 billion, which compares to our previous guidance of $1.15 billion to $1.18 billion. This reflects a slight reduction for the removal of the trays and pads business as well as the increased FX headwinds. Currency is now estimated to have a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $100 million as compared to our previous forecast of approximately $80 million. If you exclude the FX headwinds and $15 million impact of the divestiture of our trays and pads business, adjusted EBITDA guidance would have been above the high end of our previous range. 
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.15 as compared to 2014 adjusted earnings per share of $1.86. Currency is expected to negatively impact earnings per share by approximately $0.35. Our constant currency earnings per share would be approximately $2.43 to $2.50. Our interest expense for 2015 is now expected to be $245 million as compared to our previous forecast of $255 million. We anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 25% in 2015.
We are revising our free cash flow guidance to $575 million from $600 million to reflect the lower adjusted EBITDA forecast and higher CapEx, partially offset by lower cash interest payments. Free cash flow outlook also excludes the $235 million tax refund we received during the first quarter related to the Grace settlement.
As Jerome mentioned, owning the campus in Charlotte instead of signing a long-term lease is the right economic decision. The decision has led to an increase in our CapEx budget to $210 million from our original forecast of $180 million, of which approximately $75 million is related to these restructuring activities. While the proceeds from the sale of the trays and pads business and the sale of our Racine facility are not part of free cash flow, they have, in fact, resulted in cash receipts. These proceeds will be reflected in investing activities on our cash flow statement, which sits below free cash flow.
During the quarter, we entered into a cross-currency swap for U.S.-based debt to euro-denominated, increasing our euro-based debt exposure to 14% from the previous 4% level. This transaction, combined with higher cash balances, reduces our cash interest payments to $240 million for the year as compared to our previous expectation of $255 million.
Other key elements of our free cash flow have not changed. Cash restructuring costs, excluding restructuring CapEx, are still expected to be $120 million. We are on track to recognize $50 million in cost synergies in 2015 from our restructuring efforts.
This concludes my prepared remarks. But before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, July 30, at 8:30 a.m. We are also hosting our Analyst Day on Thursday, June 18, in New York City. I look forward to seeing you at our Analyst Day and to speaking with you again in the future.
With that, operator, can you please open up the call for questions?"

We had a 9% negative translation in the first quarter at the sales level, which is $45 million, and obviously, this has been hurt most. So the highlights of Diversey Care for the quarter are that we're sustaining now and accelerating our growth in the U.S. You have seen a 4% sales growth, which is really good, and then we're continuing to make inroads in that important and large market. Our hospitality market globally has been very strong with double-digit growth, and our health care market in North America has been very, very strong. The -- where we have right now short-term difficulties is probably in Russia and in some parts of the Middle East because the Russians were throbbing a lot and were spending a lot in the hospitality. And given the local political and economic situation, you have a little bit of reduction of that, which is affecting Dubai, for example, and affecting also tourism within Russia. And this is short-term because we believe it is going to be turning around. With regards to China, the first quarter, we had middle-digit growth -- middle single-digit growth in Diversey Care in China, and this is a little bit of a disappointment because we're used to double-digit growth. But this is mostly coming from the fact that we have -- that the new hotel opening, because of the real estate crisis in China, has been much slower than in the past. We are growing nicely in restaurants and quick-service with local chains. Some international chains have been hurt in the recent past, but we also expect that this is going to get much better. Brazil is a region where the whole company and the result of the whole economy has been hurt, including Diversey Care. And again, you know the economic environment there and the very strong devaluations. All of those things, nevertheless, make me very positive. We had 6% EBITDA growth in constant currency in Diversey Care. We have lots of innovation. The Intellibot, which is a startup, is not going to impact sales, but it is going to have a midterm tremendous benefit on our business, and we are growing where we really want to grow. Hospitality, health care and so on are very important segments for us."

You've seen what we've been doing on price/mix in the divisions which are quite exposed to resins, which are Food Care and Product Care, but we've done -- in Food Care, we've done 2.8% price/mix in the first quarter. The very bulk of it, the very large majority of this 2.8% is price. You've seen what we've done in Product Care, and we've been doing 3.4% in the whole -- sorry, I made a mistake. In North America, in Food Care, we had a price/mix of 2.8%. In the total company, we had a price/mix for Food Care globally of 3.8%. In -- and again, the very large majority is in price. In Product Care, globally, it's 3.4%. In North America, it's 4.2%. So we are very active on price. And the reason is that I keep on saying, and our customers accept that when we talked, had good conversations on the value we create, is that in most of the cases, our packaging costs, be in Product Care or be in Food Care, have a negative cost. What I mean by negative cost is that the cost of damage coming from a list of products being broken in Product Care or the cost of shell of food waste as a result of shelf life, et cetera, et cetera, is much higher than the cost of the packaging. As a result of that, it is not about reducing the cost of our package by $0.01, $0.02, et cetera, et cetera; it is about reducing that food waste and reducing the damage. These are the serious conversations that we're having with our customers, which allow us to price for value, and this is extremely important there. And maybe Ken can add something here or give some color."

So basically, the increase in CapEx to go from our previous $180 million to $210 million, that's all being driven by the new campus in Charlotte. So that's the spend -- approximately the spend for 2015. I would like to note that one",356,"Yes. Thank you, Gabe. So basically, the increase in CapEx to go from our previous $180 million to $210 million, that's all being driven by the new campus in Charlotte. So that's the spend -- approximately the spend for 2015. I would like to note that one of the reasons that the decision makes sense from an economic standpoint is what Jerome emphasized that the campus includes our largest R&D center, and the cost for an R&D center as compared to a regular office building is significantly different. It's more than twice the cost. We will reap the value of this investment, but it makes it difficult when you come to trying to do what would be a triple net lease or standard lease. No lessor is going to want to finance that because it's not necessarily transferable to someone else if you vacated the building. So the cost we would have been paid on a net lease basis would have been significantly higher than our cash cost even with an interest burden. And at the end of the lease period, we would end up owning nothing, whereas we will own this asset, and it will be very valuable for our future as a company to attract talent and to support innovation and growth for the company. With respect to sort of maintenance CapEx, it really runs less, slightly under $100 million. So everything that you're seeing this year between that $100 million to $180 million, including restructuring investments, has a very positive return for the company. So some of the focus above and beyond the maintenance CapEx, we obviously are always investing to improve the quality of our products. We're investing in capital that helps us with our innovation, such as producing the Darfresh On Tray. We also are investing to make sure our assets are located in the right regions where we have growth. So we've said that we expect our growth to be disproportionately higher in our developing regions, such as Asia-Pacific and Eastern Europe, as well as in Latin America. So that's where a lot of focus for our investments are headed."

For next year, we'll have slightly high -- we'll have higher CapEx because of the restructuring that we've communicated on, which also will include the remainder for the Charlotte campus. But we feel like that $200 million, based on the current business, is plenty to fund us. And actually, if you look at our spend trend, we typically fall well below that absent any restructuring spend and had very healthy investments from an innovation standpoint. And as a reminder, the Diversey Care business is very low on capital intensity. And also, if you look at our investment requirements for CapEx relative to a lot of our peers, we have a much lower requirement for investment of our total operating cost relative to our peers, yet we produce some of the highest returns in the industry. So in terms of getting the value out of our capital, I'd put us at the very top of the list."

At this point, I'm sure that you had the chance to review our press release and earnings results for the first quarter. I have to say that I'm very pleased with our results, and we had a great start off to the year.
We stayed disciplined throughout the quarter and delivered on our objectives despite heavy currency headwinds. Net sales of $1.7 billion are down 4.4% as reported, but in constant dollars, net sales were up 3.5% compared to last year's first quarter.
Each division and all regions delivered constant-dollar sales growth and favorable price/mix. The combination of favorable price/mix and lower input costs resulted in a gross margin improvement of over 200 basis points, with strong performance in both Food Care and Product Care.
For adjusted EBITDA, we delivered $284 million or 16.3% of net sales despite $22 million of unfavorable currency translation. This represents a 260-basis-point margin improvement and, in constant dollars, an increase of 22% compared to last year's performance.
Food Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of 21.7%, and Product Care adjusted EBITDA was 20%. Diversey Care was hit the hardest by currency but still delivered 6% adjusted EBITDA growth on a constant-dollar basis. I will leave the details on the financials and business trends to Carol and our guest executive speaker, Ken Chrisman, who is the President of our Product Care division.
Before I pass the call to Carol and Ken, I want to highlight a few items. As we have communicated many times, we are very committed to a disciplined approach to portfolio management, with a focus on innovation and becoming a knowledge-based company. In alignment with this strategy, in March, we acquired the assets of Intellibot Robotics, a startup U.S.-based private company that pioneered the development of robotic commercial floor cleaning machines. Intellibot is really the only currently selling advanced robotics floor care machine outside of the consumer market. These intelligent machines are empowered with sensors used for navigation and are also connected to the cloud for data monitoring, optimization, troubleshooting, servicing and upgrading software. The robotic technology is agnostic to different types of sensors, which will enable new features to be seamlessly incorporated into the platform as they come to market.
The combination of Intellibot Robotics' expertise and Diversey Care's TASKI mechanical cleaning leadership will accelerate the growth of robotics and what is known as the Internet of Things in the floor cleaning market. We are still at early stages of robotics and automation in the cleaning and hygiene industry, and we are excited to bring the first team of artificial intelligence specialists from Intellibot to Sealed Air Diversey Care.
In early April, we completed the sale of our North American trays and pads business, a noncore asset within our Food Care division. While we had become the global leader in the food grade absorbent pads, this business was becoming quickly commoditized and faced significant competitive pricing pressures. The business was heading below 10% profit margin, and the North American trays and pads business generated about $200 million of sales -- in sales in 2014 and approximately $50 million in the first quarter.
I also wanted to share 2 important organizational decisions. First, we have decided to build and own the campus in Charlotte, North Carolina to -- we have decided to build and own the campus in Charlotte, North Carolina for financial reasons. After conducting extensive financial analysis, owning the campus versus signing a long-term lease made the most economical sense. This new state-of-the-art global headquarters will be the home of not just our 3 divisional headquarters, but also the home of our largest R&D center.
The proceeds from the sales of our trays and pads business and the sale of our building in Racine will fund approximately 2/3 of this capital investment. As a result of this decision, we increased our CapEx budget from $180 million to $210 million in 2015. And second, we made a decision effective in April that we will realign the countries within Asia, Middle East, Africa and Turkey, which we had referred to as our AMAT region. We are also realigning the Japan, Australia and New Zealand region, and going forward, we will report network sales of Europe, Mid-East, Africa and Turkey as the EMEA region. The remaining region will include Asia, Australia, New Zealand and Japan and will be reported as Asia-Pacific. We believe that this realignment will increase local focus and place more accountability in the hands of regional and divisional leaders to create greater cross-selling opportunities across divisions and, especially, a faster decision-making process.
For today's discussion, Q1 results are presented under the historic regions as these changes are just now taking place. We will provide you with sales trends by new regional alignment at our Analyst Day on June 18 and on our July 30 Second Quarter Earnings Call. 
With that, let's get started with an overview of our financial results. Carol?"

On Slide 4, we present our performance by region for the first quarter. I will highlight sales trends on a constant-dollar basis as compared to last year, unless otherwise noted.
In the first quarter, Latin America and the region comprised of Japan and Australia and New Zealand were our fastest-growing regions, with constant-dollar growth of 7% and 5%, respectively.
On a reported basis, both regions were down mid-single digits. Constant-dollar growth in Latin America and Japan/ANZ were driven by strength in our Food Care business with increased demand in Argentina, Mexico and Australia. The AMAT region was up 3% in the quarter, with positive trends in India and Africa for both Food Care and Diversey Care.
North America sales were up 3% compared to last year, with 3% growth in each of our divisions. Europe was also up 3% in the quarter in constant dollars but down 13% as reported. We delivered 7% constant-dollar sales growth in the U.K. and 1% growth in Spain. France, Italy, Germany and Switzerland were flat to down 1%, and Holland was down in the mid-single digits. The 7 countries I just referenced accounted for approximately 20% of first quarter consolidated sales.
Russia and Poland had solid performance, with Russia delivering nearly 50% constant-dollar sales growth and Poland delivering 7% growth.
Turning to Slide 5. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.7 billion in sales, an increase of 3.5% in constant dollars, unfavorable currency translation had an impact on net sales of $146 million or 8%, mostly due to the declines in the euro and the Russian ruble. Net sales on an as-reported basis were down 4.4%. Favorable price/mix was 3.2% or $58 million, and volume was up slightly.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% on a year-over-year basis to $284 million or 16.3% of net sales. For the total company, the increase in adjusted EBITDA was largely due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of $56 million. Cost synergies also made a positive contribution of $17 million in the quarter. SG&A and other expenses increased by $18 million, with wage inflation being our largest driver. As a reminder, our annual compensation increases occur April 1 each year.
Unfavorable currency translation had an impact on adjusted EBITDA of $22 million. We delivered a 210-basis-point improvement in adjusted gross profit margin and a 260-basis-point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to the prior year. On a constant-currency basis, our adjusted EBITDA increased 22% as compared to last year's results.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.54 as compared to $0.33 in the first quarter last year. Currency negatively impacted EPS by $0.05. The tax rate for Q1 2015 was 25% as compared with 21% for Q1 2014.
In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares for a total value of approximately $64 million. As communicated on our last earnings call, our EBITDA leverage ratio target is 3.5x to 4x. We believe this is an optimal leverage ratio for our company. We are currently evaluating options that will enable us to increase returns to our shareholders while maintaining our target leverage.
On Slide 6, we outlined our price/mix, volume trends and sales growth on a constant-dollar basis by division and by region. As you can see, we had constant-dollar sales growth and favorable price/mix in every division and in every region. And this is our fourth consecutive quarter where we delivered at least 3% constant-dollar sales growth despite our global rationalization efforts.
I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will provide you with a more detailed review of Product Care as well as highlight the performance of Diversey Care and Food Care. Ken?"

Slide 7 highlights the results from our Product Care division. Before we get into the quarter, I want to briefly discuss the organizational changes we made in Product Care that we believe will accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. Effective January 1, we realigned Product Care into Global Performance Packaging, which is approximately 40% of Product Care sales, and Global General Packaging, representing approximately 60% of Product Care sales.
Global Performance Packaging includes our differentiated proprietary platforms that focus primarily on cushioning and damage reduction, such as Instapak, automated systems, core view and specialty foams. Global General Packaging is derived of our more highly distributed solutions, such as our utility offerings, including bubble wrap and Cell-Aire foam, and our higher-growth offerings, including mailers, inflatable bubble and paper systems.
We also formed a dedicated global sales team to focus on the rapidly expanding e-commerce marketplace and our automated systems. Our end-to-end innovative product offering, combined with our packaging design expertise and global reach, provides us with a significant competitive advantage across multiple industries, including e-commerce. And with this realignment, we are confident we are well positioned to take full advantage of future growth opportunities.
One thing to keep in mind is that while we are focusing on growth opportunities, we remain committed to delivering earnings quality, and our customer and product rationalization efforts are ongoing.
Let's take a look at our first quarter performance. Net sales were up slightly in constant dollars. You can see that we had a favorable price/mix of 3.4% on volumes that declined 2.3%. Favorable price/mix is a direct result of the success we have had in shifting our business to higher-performance packaging and our ability to maintain our pricing discipline. First quarter volume was impacted by rationalization efforts in general packaging in all regions.
Let's turn to adjusted EBITDA. Product Care achieved adjusted EBITDA margins of 20% or $76 million in the first quarter. Favorable price/mix, lower input costs and cost synergies more than offset FX headwinds, resulting in an increase in adjusted EBITDA of 9% as compared to first quarter 2014. In constant dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 16%. In Product Care, we remain on track to deliver EBITDA growth and margin expansion in 2015.
Slide 8 highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales, on a constant-currency basis, were up 1.5% in the first quarter. Favorable price/mix was up nearly 2% with positive trends across all regions. Volume was relatively flat. In constant dollars, AMAT sales increased 4% led by mid-single-digit growth in China and double-digit growth in India. North America sales increased 3% on volumes that were up just over 2%, representing the fifth consecutive quarter of sales growth in North America.
Sales in Latin America and Australia/New Zealand were up slightly, while Europe was essentially unchanged. In Europe, sales were up in the U.K., France and Italy. From a global end market perspective, our strongest sectors in the quarter were building service contractors, hospitality and health care.
In February, we announced that we signed a 5-year global contract with Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group, which represents a significant expansion from our previous 4-year EMEA contract. For those of you who didn't see this press release, our contract with Carlson includes more than 1,300 hotels spanning 105 countries and territories. In addition to the Intellibot Robotics acquisition that Jerome highlighted, Diversey Care introduced a revolutionary small-sized scrubber, the TASKI 2100 Micro, equipped with IntelliTrail, a GPS-enabled remote monitoring device for TASKI machines.
Diversey Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $41 million or 8.8% of net sales in the quarter. As we anticipated, currency translation negatively impacted our performance in the quarter. Excluding FX, adjusted EBITDA was up 6% compared to last year. Also, it is important to note that while top line was relatively flat in Europe, we had record level EBITDA margins in this region.
Aside from FX, we also continued to invest in R&D and sales and marketing to drive future growth, which offset the margin improvements we delivered in Europe. With that said, we continue to estimate constant-dollar EBITDA growth and margin expansion for the full year.
On Slide 9, we highlight results for our Food Care division, which had an outstanding quarter. In the first quarter, Food Care sales increased 5.8% in constant dollars with favorable price/mix of 3.8% and volume growth of 2%. Our fastest-growing countries in constant dollars were Australia, the U.K., Russia, Mexico and Argentina, which all delivered double-digit growth.
Developing regions, which include Latin America, AMAT and Eastern European countries, were up 15%, with Latin America up 12% and AMAT up 5%. Europe and JANZ were both up 7%, and North America was up 3%. Price/mix was favorable in every region except for AMAT, which declined slightly due to unfavorable mix. For volume, we had positive trends in every region, except for Latin America due to pricing adjustments in response to currency devaluations.
In Europe, we outperformed the protein market, which was up in the low single digits due to a more favorable mix driven by demand for our new products and continued pricing discipline. We also had double-digit growth in equipment solution sales in the quarter.
In North America, our sales were up in the single digits despite cattle production being down nearly 6%. Despite unfavorable market trends in cattle, we still experienced increased demand in fresh red meat due to the adoption of new products and our continued focus on value selling. For the remainder of the year, we expect that these markets -- to continue to decline but at a decelerating rate than what we've been experiencing over the last 6 to 9 months. We also experienced strong sales in smoked and processed meats and poultry. Both markets were up approximately 4% to 5% in the quarter. While we expect these trends to continue in pork, we are closely monitoring the poultry market due to the recent outbreak of avian influenza.
From a product perspective, I want to highlight that during the first quarter, our Darfresh On Tray package received the Highest Achievement Award from the Flexible Packaging Association's 59th annual Awards and Innovation Showcase. Darfresh On Tray improves product visibility and extend shelf life for the consumers and retailers, while processors benefit from sustainable operational efficiency improvements in throughput and up to 40% reduction in top film with no material scrap
Turning to Food Care's adjusted EBITDA performance. Food Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $191 million or 21.7% of net sales, an increase of 20% as compared to last year. This increase was largely a result of an improved mix of premium products, pricing initiatives and cost synergies. Going forward, in 2015, we expect to continue to benefit from further adoption of our new products and continued focus on value selling, which will be offset partially by currency headwinds and formula pricing. I will note, however, that we are well on track to deliver adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion.
Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our cash flow and outlook. Carol?"
382724,291489398,799076,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ken. Turning to Slide 10. Free cash flow was the source of $63 million for the first 3 months of the year. Excluding the $235 million tax refund received related to the Grace settlement, this compares favorably to a use of $31 million in the 3",798,"Thank you, Ken. Turning to Slide 10. Free cash flow was the source of $63 million for the first 3 months of the year. Excluding the $235 million tax refund received related to the Grace settlement, this compares favorably to a use of $31 million in the 3 months ending 2014 due to higher earnings and an improvement in operating working capital management.
As many of you know, the company focuses its management of operating working capital on a 13-month average target. For the 13-month period ending March 31, 2015, the average for operating working capital as a percent of net sales was 16%. This represents a 230-basis-point improvement compared to March 31, 2014.
CapEx was $21 million, and cash restructuring costs were $22 million for the 3 months of Q1 2015. Our updated outlook for 2015 is reflected on Slide 11. We now expect net sales to be approximately $7.1 billion as compared to our previously provided guidance of $7.4 billion. Unfavorable currency is expected to be approximately 9% or nearly $700 million as compared to our previous guidance of approximately 7% or $550 million. Our current outlook assumes a euro rate of $1.10.
Additionally, our previous outlook included approximately $200 million in sales for the trays and pads business. This disposition does not qualify under the accounting rules for treatment as discontinued operations. Therefore, prior years and Q1 2015 will continue to include North America trays and pads, but we will have no benefit from this business going forward. Excluding the impact of the divestiture and currency headwinds, we anticipate an organic growth of approximately 3%. This compares to our previous guidance of approximately 2.5%.
Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.14 billion to $1.16 billion, which compares to our previous guidance of $1.15 billion to $1.18 billion. This reflects a slight reduction for the removal of the trays and pads business as well as the increased FX headwinds. Currency is now estimated to have a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $100 million as compared to our previous forecast of approximately $80 million. If you exclude the FX headwinds and $15 million impact of the divestiture of our trays and pads business, adjusted EBITDA guidance would have been above the high end of our previous range. 
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.15 as compared to 2014 adjusted earnings per share of $1.86. Currency is expected to negatively impact earnings per share by approximately $0.35. Our constant currency earnings per share would be approximately $2.43 to $2.50. Our interest expense for 2015 is now expected to be $245 million as compared to our previous forecast of $255 million. We anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 25% in 2015.
We are revising our free cash flow guidance to $575 million from $600 million to reflect the lower adjusted EBITDA forecast and higher CapEx, partially offset by lower cash interest payments. Free cash flow outlook also excludes the $235 million tax refund we received during the first quarter related to the Grace settlement.
As Jerome mentioned, owning the campus in Charlotte instead of signing a long-term lease is the right economic decision. The decision has led to an increase in our CapEx budget to $210 million from our original forecast of $180 million, of which approximately $75 million is related to these restructuring activities. While the proceeds from the sale of the trays and pads business and the sale of our Racine facility are not part of free cash flow, they have, in fact, resulted in cash receipts. These proceeds will be reflected in investing activities on our cash flow statement, which sits below free cash flow.
During the quarter, we entered into a cross-currency swap for U.S.-based debt to euro-denominated, increasing our euro-based debt exposure to 14% from the previous 4% level. This transaction, combined with higher cash balances, reduces our cash interest payments to $240 million for the year as compared to our previous expectation of $255 million.
Other key elements of our free cash flow have not changed. Cash restructuring costs, excluding restructuring CapEx, are still expected to be $120 million. We are on track to recognize $50 million in cost synergies in 2015 from our restructuring efforts.
This concludes my prepared remarks. But before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, July 30, at 8:30 a.m. We are also hosting our Analyst Day on Thursday, June 18, in New York City. I look forward to seeing you at our Analyst Day and to speaking with you again in the future.
With that, operator, can you please open up the call for questions?"

We had a 9% negative translation in the first quarter at the sales level, which is $45 million, and obviously, this has been hurt most. So the highlights of Diversey Care for the quarter are that we're sustaining now and accelerating our growth in the U.S. You have seen a 4% sales growth, which is really good, and we're continuing to make inroads in that important and large market. Our hospitality market globally has been very strong with double-digit growth, and our health care market in North America has been very, very strong. The -- where we have right now short-term difficulties is probably in Russia and in some parts of the Middle East because the Russians were traveling a lot and were spending a lot in hospitality. And given the local political and economic situation, you have a little bit of reduction of that, which is affecting Dubai, for example, and affecting also tourism within Russia. And this is short-term because we believe it is going to be turning around. With regards to China, the first quarter, we had middle-digit growth -- middle-single-digit growth in Diversey Care in China, and this is a little bit of a disappointment because we're used to double-digit growth. But this is mostly coming from the fact that we have -- that the new hotel opening, because of the real estate crisis in China, has been much slower than in the past. We are growing nicely in restaurants and quick service with local chains. Some international chains have been hurt in the recent past, but we also expect that this is going to get much better. Brazil is a region where the whole company and the result of the whole economy has been hurt, including Diversey Care. And again, you know the economic environment there and the very strong devaluations. All of those things, nevertheless, make me very positive. We had 6% EBITDA growth in constant currency in Diversey Care. We have lots of innovation. The Intellibot, which is a startup, is not going to impact sales, but it is going to have a midterm tremendous benefit on our business, and we are growing where we really want to grow. Hospitality, health care and so on are very important segments for us."

You've seen what we've been doing on price/mix in the divisions which are quite exposed to resins, which are Food Care and Product Care. But we've done -- in Food Care, we've done 2.8% price/mix in the first quarter. The very bulk of it, the very large majority of this 2.8% is price. You've seen what we've done in Product Care, and we've been doing 3.4% in the whole -- sorry, I made a mistake. In North America, in Food Care, we had a price/mix of 2.8%. In the total company, we had a price/mix for Food Care globally of 3.8%. In -- and again, the very large majority is in price. In Product Care, globally, it's 3.4%. In North America, it's 4.2%. So we are very active on price. And the reason is that I keep on saying, and our customers accept that when we talk, have good conversations on the value we create, is that in most of the cases, our packaging costs, be in Product Care or be in Food Care, have a negative cost. What I mean by negative cost is that the cost of damage coming from either products being broken in Product Care or the cost of food waste as a result of shelf life, et cetera, et cetera, is much higher than the cost of the packaging. As a result of that, it is not about reducing the cost of our package by $0.01, $0.02, et cetera, et cetera; it is about reducing that food waste and reducing the damage. These are the serious conversations that we're having with our customers, which allow us to price for value, and this is extremely important there. And maybe Ken can add something here and give some color."

There is some pressure on price, but we've been able to address that by communicating clearly our value. We also see a very favorable mix shift as we spend time working in the direction of higher-performance solutions in our performance packaging portfolio. So that combination has certainly worked favorably for us in Q1, and we expect to see that working as we go forward."

And we do expect that to drive our portfolio going forward. Also, the dedicated sales team in e-commerce is also a significant driver. As we look at markets, the biggest change in Product Care is a de-emphasis of product and an emphasis on markets. So when we look at e-commerce, third-party logistics and electronics, we're putting more effort and resource in those spaces, and they're growing faster than the market. We also say this affects the volume trends we're reporting, but it's important to note that excluding the rationalization efforts, we are experiencing healthy single-digit volume growth."

So basically, the increase in CapEx to go from our previous $180 million to $210 million, that's all being driven by the new campus in Charlotte. So that's the spend -- approximately the spend for 2015. I would like to note that one of the reasons that the decision makes sense from an economic standpoint is what Jerome emphasized: that the campus includes our largest R&D center. And the cost for an R&D center as compared to a regular office building is significantly different. It's more than twice the cost. We will reap the value of this investment, but it makes it difficult when you come to trying to do what would be a triple net lease or standard lease. No lessor is going to want to finance that because it's not necessarily transferable to someone else if you vacated the building. So the cost we would have paid on a net lease basis would have been significantly higher than our cash cost even with an interest burden. And at the end of the lease period, we would end up owning nothing, whereas we will own this asset, and it will be very valuable for our future as a company to attract talent and to support innovation and growth for the company. With respect to sort of maintenance CapEx, it really runs less, slightly under $100 million. So everything that you're seeing this year between that $100 million to $180 million, including restructuring investments, has a very positive return for the company. So some of the focus above and beyond the maintenance CapEx, we obviously are always investing to improve the quality of our products. We're investing in capital that helps us with our innovation, such as producing the Darfresh On Tray. We also are investing to make sure our assets are located in the right regions where we have growth. So we've said that we expect our growth to be disproportionately higher in our developing regions, such as Asia-Pacific and Eastern Europe, as well as in Latin America. So that's where a lot of focus for our investments are headed."

Actually no, we feel like -- we've always said we expect our capital to run somewhere around $200 million a year, giving us plenty of room for maintenance CapEx, quality investment as well as innovation investment, and we don't really expect that to change. For next year, we'll have slightly high -- we'll have higher CapEx because of the restructuring that we've communicated on, which also will include the remainder for the Charlotte campus. But we feel like that $200 million, based on the current business, is plenty to fund us. And actually, if you look at our spend trend, we typically fall well below that, absent any restructuring spend, and have very healthy investments from an innovation standpoint. And as a reminder, the Diversey Care business is very low on capital intensity. And also, if you look at our investment requirements for CapEx relative to a lot of our peers, we have a much lower requirement for investment of our total operating cost relative to our peers, yet we produce some of the highest returns in the industry. So in terms of getting the value out of our capital, I'd put us at the very top of the list."

We've put dedicated resources in North America, Europe and China, specifically in e-commerce, because it is growing so fast. But not just growing fast, what we're seeing is it's becoming more sophisticated. The requirements for packaging used to just be the lowest-cost packaging is all they need. Now it really is becoming an extension of the retail experience. So that's why we are putting more resource in the space. It is growing faster than the underlying market, so it deserves consideration from that standpoint.

But before I get started, I want to briefly highlight significant events that have taken place in June and July. 
First, let me highlight our Analyst Day that took place on June 18. For those of you who couldn't make it, if you haven't done so already, I would encourage you to visit our IR website, download the presentation and listen to the replay. 
To quickly recap. We outlined our financial and operational objectives for 2018 and our key targets for 2020. We discussed in detail how those objectives and targets will be achieved as we continue executing on our Get Fit and Change the Game strategy. We have executed on many Get Fit programs to date, but as we discussed at our Analyst Day, we still have more to be done. And we will stay focused on driving profitable growth and margin expansion opportunities. We clearly defined our Change the Game strategy and outlined the investments that we're making in new markets, new business models and disruptive innovation. 
You have all heard me say this before, but let me remind you that our Get Fit and Change the Game strategy is not a destination. It is a journey. And that journey is already transforming us into a knowledge-based company with unique know-how, resolutely dedicated to making our customers win and sharing in the value being created. 
Second, earlier in June, we completed the refinancing of our 2021 senior notes and issued new U.S. and euro senior notes that extended maturities, increased covenant flexibility and reduced our annualized interest expense. 
With the completion of this transaction, we announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program on July 15, which reflects our commitment to return value to shareholders. And with that, let me now turn to what I would qualify a very strong second quarter. 
At this point, I'm sure that you have had a chance to review our press release and earnings results for the second quarter. 
Net sales of $1.8 billion increased 3.3% on an organic basis, which excludes both currency headwinds and the results from North America trays and pads business, which was sold at the beginning of April in 2015. Adjusted gross margins were up 260 basis points compared to last year as a result of favorable price/mix, lower input costs and manufacturing improvements. Our adjusted EBITDA was a record of $308 million or 17.2% of net sales, an organic increase of 25%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 280 basis points, with both Food Care and Product Care delivering 20%-plus margins for the second consecutive quarter. And while Diversey Care was hit the hardest by currency, it delivered 12% adjusted EBITDA growth on a constant dollar basis. 
Let me now turn to Slide 4 where we present our performance by region for the second quarter. On an organic basis, North America sales were up over 2% compared to last year. Food care and Diversey Care were up approximately 4%, and in Product Care, North America declined approximately 2% as a result of rationalization efforts and weakness in the manufacturing and electronics sectors. 
Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, was up 3% in constant dollars and down 15% on an as-reported basis as a result of currency devaluations. In constant dollars, Russia was our fastest-growing country with growth of 26%. Turkey was up 7%, Italy was up 6%, both Germany and Spain were up 4% and France and Holland were flat to slightly up. Growth in these countries were offset a slight decline in the U.K. and in Switzerland. The 9 countries I just referenced accounting for approximately 24% of the second quarter consolidated sales. 
In APAC, we delivered constant currency growth of 4% and a decline on 5% on as-reported basis. And in constant dollars, Australia was up 6%, led by Food Care; India and Southeast Asia were up 8%; and New Zealand was up 2%. Constant dollar growth in Latin America was up 9% -- was 9%, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Mexico and Argentina, offset by a 3% decline in Brazil. 
Let's now turn to Slide 5, and this highlights the results of our Food Care division. In the second quarter, Food Care sales increased 4.2% on an organic basis with growth across all the regions. Favorable price/mix was 2.7%, and volume was up 1.5%. We had favorable price/mix and positive volume trends in every region except Latin America, where volume was negatively impacted by the market conditions in Brazil. 
Net sales in constant dollars in Latin America were up 11%, APAC increased 5%, EMEA was up 2%. And on an organic basis, North America increased 4%. We delivered strong double-digit constant dollar sales growth in Russia, Argentina, Mexico and mid- to high single-digit growth in Italy, Australia and New Zealand. 
We're still constant dollar declines in France and Brazil, 2 countries that each account for 3% to 4% of our global Food Care sales. 
China, which is approximately 2% of our Food Care sales, was down 7%, primarily due to weakness in our hygiene business. 
In North America, capital production was down 8%, which was offset by mid-single-digit growth in smoke and processed food and poultry. Fresh red meat is our largest market, and yet, despite declines in the cattle market, we still delivered 4% organic growth in North America. 
Our fresh red meat business was up slightly, and we experienced strong growth in the poultry market. This performance as a result of continued adoption of our advanced product offering, and overall, in North America, we had favorable price/mix and volume growth. For the remainder of the year, we expect continued decline in the beef market, but after decelerating rate that we have been experiencing over the last 9 to 12 months. 
In Europe, we have seen a slight improvement in the protein market. The improved market conditions, coupled with the adoption of our new very successful products, resulted in a 4.5 constant dollar growth rate in our European Food Packaging business. We are experiencing increased demand for Darfresh On Tray and Optidur and have also been successful in our value-added selling approach. 
Turning to Food Care's adjusted EBITDA performance. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $174 million, which is a 10% increase on an as-reported basis and a 27% increase on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.5% were up 410 basis points. This increase was largely a result of an improved mix of premium products, portfolio management, global pricing initiatives and cost synergies. 
Within our European hygiene business, it is worth noting that we have seen a meaningful increase in our EBITDA margins as a result of our portfolio management efforts and pricing initiatives. As we head into the back half of the year, we expect further adoptions of our new products on a global basis and continue to focus on value-added selling. However, this will be partially offset by formula pricing in North America, currency headwinds and other external factors, including, for example, the fact that the slower rates in Australia are starting to decline and will further do that. Some of these extended focus also include economy challenges in Brazil and Venezuela and a slowdown in Australia, as I just mentioned. 
We anticipate EBITDA growth in the second half of the year but not at the same rate experienced in the first half. And for the full year 2015, we are on track to deliver strong annual EBITDA growth and margin expansion. 
Slide 6 highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant currency basis were up 3.8% in the second quarter. Favorable price/mix was up 2.2%, and volume increased 1.6%. We delivered favorable price/mix and positive volume trends in all the regions. Our fastest-growing regions in the quarter were Latin America and North America, with constant daily sales growth of 9% and 5%, respectively. Asia-Pacific was up 3.5% and EMEA over 2%. 
From an end market perspective, we experienced increased demand in food service, hospitality and health care. And we also increased demand in our distribution channels. EMEA accounts for approximately 50% of our net sales, as you know. And among our largest markets throughout this region, we experienced high single-digit growth in Turkey, positive sales in France, Italy, Holland and Germany. Challenging economic condition and stability are slowing down Russian and local tourism in Turkey and Dubai. 
In addition, the ongoing economic crisis in Greece is also negatively impacting tourism, and this decline in tourism, which we are currently experiencing, will have an impact in the second half of the year in our hospitality market, especially in the third quarter. 
North American accounts for 30% of our net sales and delivered 5% constant dollar sales growth, with increasing demand from our hospitality and health care segments. In Asia-Pacific, double-digit growth in India and Australia was partially offset by softness in China. Performance in Latin America was driven by growth in Argentina and Chile, partially offset by low single-digit decline in Brazil. 
Diversey Care delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of $69 million or 12.9% of net sales in the quarter, and as we anticipate, currency translation negatively impacted our performance in the quarter, and on a reported basis, adjusted EBITDA declined 5%. In constant dollars, however, adjusted EBITDA was up 12% compared to last year. This growth was driven by our success in our value-added selling approach, high volumes and cost synergies, partially offset by higher G&A, as we continue to heavily invest in sales and marketing and R&D to further support growth opportunities. For example, we are already seeing strong interest in our robotic floor care machines with our recent acquisition of Intellibot and are having many conversations with our customers around our Internet of Clean solutions. As a result, we are accelerating our investment in both equipment and data analytics into humans. And despite these investments and currency headwinds, we're still on track to deliver EBITDA growth on a constant dollar basis and margin expansion for the full year. 
Slide 7 highlights the results from our Product Care division. Net sales were essentially unchanged in constant dollars on a year-over-year basis. We had favorable price/mix of just over 1% on volumes that nearly declined 2%. Favorable price/mix continues to be driven by our pricing efforts across global -- both Global Performance Packaging and general packaging. Second quarter volume was impacted, in fact, by rationalization efforts in Latin America and, to a lesser extent, also in North America. Our rationalization efforts are focused on our general packaging solutions and should be mostly behind us by mid-2016. 
On a regional basis, North America net sales were down 1.6% in constant currency, while EMEA was up 3.6%. It is also worth noting that both China and Japan were up in the mid- to high single digits.  Excluding rationalization efforts in North America, net sales would have been slightly up. And as I said earlier, in North America, we experienced market weakness in manufacturing and electronics, but that was -- this was offset by strength in e-commerce and third-party logistics. 
Our growth in EMEA was due to increased demand in our performing packaging solutions, particularly in Germany and in Spain, which is recovering now. 
On a global basis, we're seeing strong growth in both e-commerce and third-party logistics and are confident that this growth will continue for the foreseeable future, given our global -- our product breadth, global reach and focused investment in performance-based packaging. 
And let's now turn to adjusted EBITDA. Product Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $79 million, which is a 10% increase on an as-reported basis and an 18% increase in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.7% expanded 310 basis points compared to last year's results. This increase was a result of an increasing mix of Global Performance Packaging and pricing discipline. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued EBITDA growth and margin expansion as well. 
And now let me pass the call to Carol to review our total net sales, adjusted EBITDA, cash flow and outlook. Carol?"

We delivered $1.8 billion in sales, an increase of 3.3% on an organic basis. Favorable price/mix was 2.4% or $48 million, and volume was up 1% or $18 million. Unfavorable currency translation had an impact on net sales of $199 million or 10%, mostly due to the declines in the euro and Russian ruble. Net sales on an as-reported basis were down 9.6%. 
Turning to Slide 9. You can see our adjusted EBITDA; performance for the quarter and first half of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8.4% as reported to $308 million or 17.2% of net sales. For the total company, the increase in adjusted EBITDA was largely due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of $58 million. Cost synergies also made a positive contribution of $16 million in the quarter. The North America trays and pads divestiture had a $12 million negative comparison for adjusted EBITDA and unfavorable currency translation with $34 million. Despite currency headwinds, we still delivered a 260 basis point improvement in adjusted gross margin and a 280 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to last year. On an organic basis, our adjusted EBITDA increased 25% as compared to the 2014 results for the same period. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.60 as compared to $0.42 in the second quarter last year. Currency negatively impacted EPS by $0.09. The tax rate for the second quarter of 2015 was 29% as compared with 29.5% for the second quarter of 2014. In the first quarter of 2015, the tax rate was 25%, and we are still anticipating a 25% tax rate for the full year of 2015. The sequential increase from the first quarter was primarily due to higher taxable earnings in the U.S., which has one of our highest tax rates. For the full year, we expect to have higher earnings in some of our lower tax jurisdictions. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares for a total value of approximately $86 million. In the first half of 2015, we repurchased 3.2 million shares, and as of July 28, we have repurchased an additional 2.7 million shares, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to a total of 5.9 million shares. 
Now turning to Slide 10. We outline our price/mix, volume trends and sales growth on a constant dollar basis by division and by region. As you can see from the slide, we have favorable price/mix in every division and in every region. Volume was up in Food Care and Diversey Care, and excluding rationalization efforts in Product Care, volume would have been up slightly. We delivered volume growth in all regions, except Latin America, which was impacted by the economic environment in Brazil as Jerome previously referenced and our rationalization efforts in Product Care. For the total company, we delivered 3.3% organic growth. 
Turning to Slide 11. You can see free cash flow was a source of $171 million for the first 6 months of the year, excluding the $235 million tax refund received related to the growth settlement. This compares favorably to a source of $119 million for the 6 months ending 2014 due to higher earnings and an improvement in operating working capital management. As many of you know, the company focuses its management of operating working capital on a 13-month average target. For the 13-month period ending June 30, 2015, the average for operating working capital as a percent of net sales was 16%. This represents a 250 basis point improvement compared to June 30, 2014. CapEx was $58 million, and cash restructuring costs were $45 million for the 6 months ending June 30, 2015. Our updated outlook for 2015 is presented on Slide 12. 
We continue to expect net sales to be approximately $7.1 billion, and favorable currency is expected to be approximately 9% or $700 million. Also, as a reminder, the trays and pads business generated approximately $200 million in sales in 2014. This disposition did not qualify under the accounting rules for treatment as discontinued operations. Therefore, prior years in the first quarter of 2015 include the North America trays and pads business, but there is no benefit from this business going forward nor was there any in the second quarter of this year. Excluding the impact of the divestiture and currency headwinds, we continue to anticipate an organic growth rate of approximately 3%. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.16 billion to $1.17 billion, which compares to our previous guidance of $1.14 billion to $1.16 billion. This reflects our strong performance in the first half of the year. We will continue to face currency challenges as compared to last year. We are now estimating FX to have a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $110 million. 
We'd like you to keep in mind that in the third quarter of 2014, the euro was at 1.34, and in Q4 2014, the euro was at 1.26. Our forecast for the second half of the year assumes the euro at 1.10. Other currencies where we have exposure include Russian ruble, the Brazilian real and Australian dollar. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.24 to $2.28 as compared to 2014 adjusted earnings per share of $1.86. As a reminder, at our Analyst Day in June, we increased our EPS range by $0.03 to $2.11 to $2.18 to account for the interest savings related to our senior note refinancing. Our interest expense for 2015 will be $235 million, a $10 million reduction from the forecast we had provided earlier in the year. On an annualized basis, the senior note refinancing transaction will reduce our interest expense by $20 million. Constant currency earnings per share would be approximately $2.54 [ph] to $2.58 without the impact of currency. As I highlighted earlier, we repurchased a total of 5.9 million shares as of July 28, and we will continue to be active in our share repurchase program. Our earnings per share outlook for 2015 is based on 209 million shares outstanding for the balance of the year, which reflects the weighted average fully year effect of all the share repurchase completed as of July 28. We are revising our free cash flow guidance to $585 million from the previous $575 million to reflect the higher adjusted EBITDA forecast. Our free cash flow outlook also excludes the $235 million refund related to the Grace settlement, which I previously referenced. Cash interest payments are expected to be $230 million as compared to our previous forecast of $240 million, and cash tax payments are now estimated at $115 million. We are on track to invest $210 million in capital expenditures and are still anticipating $120 million in restructuring activity. We also continue to estimate approximately $50 million in cost synergies for 2015 from these restructuring efforts. 
This concludes my prepared remarks, but before we open the call to questions, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, October 27, at 10:00 a.m. 
Operator, can you please open the call for questions?"

And we're making -- we're putting lots of effort in some very specific sectors in there. And I must say that we are having -- we're on the verge of having some pretty nice customer wins.

We have had nice volume growth in an environment, which is not necessarily very favorable. When you look at the overall market, you see that the red fresh meet market in the U.S. has been very depressed in the second quarter. I think I remember 8% reduction, which is one of the biggest negative percentages. We believe that the percentages of reduction are going to slowly taper down, but we haven't seen that yet. In Brazil, the situation is really bad. There are many slaughterhouses, which have been closing. I think the number is 15. JBS has recently published that they have closed 5. And this is the result of droughts, of high prices of red meat at the capital level, reducing purchasing power. And you know that red meat is an expensive meat, and as a result, there's been transfers into poultry. So we have had negative volume in Brazil. For the rest of the year, we are going to see -- we're carefully optimistic, but the poultry market has been good for us. And we expect that this is going to continue being good. Our EMEA business is actually pulled by new products. And Optidur, Darfresh On Tray are doing obsolete wonderful, and we're expecting those new products to continue pulling our business there. So we had positive growth, not us much in the second quarter as we have in the first quarter, and -- but we believe that it's going to be okay. Diversey has been improving its volume. And we had flat volume in Q1. We had definitely growth in Q2, and we're happy with what we're seeing here. So having said that, in Diversey, the comp in the third quarter is not going to be very favorable because we had strong TASKI sales in Q3 of last year."

The interesting thing is that we've got positive pricing. And we've got positive pricing in every single of our divisions, not as much as we got in the first quarter, but we've got positive pricing. And that is important. That leads me to the second half, and the resin prices have been [indiscernible] in North America to raise resin prices in July. It's not going through. And we'll see what August gives. But the volume overall is -- and the business is fairly weak in the polyethylene arena, polyolefins arena globally. And we just don't believe at this point in time that there's going to be major price increases. And as a result of that, what we're going to be seeing is, excuse me, is formula pricing get the impact during the third quarter."

It happens that the export markets for Brazil, as an example, is fairly weak. And you have some major companies out of Brazil, which have made comments recently saying that not only the local market is very weak. Their local market is extremely weak for fresh red meat, but also the export market is fairly weak for them also. And yes, you're right that normally, a lower real should help, but it seems to be export markets are fairly weak. We look out to Australia. The slaughter rate of the herd has been double-digit in the first quarter and is slightly coming down. And the reason is very normal. Those levels are completely unsustainable, completely unsustainable. And as a result of that, we are seeing a little bit less growth, very strong growth actually in Australia on our business, but a little bit less growth, not the first quarter was, if I remember well, double digits. And here, we're talking about high single-digit. With regards to currency in general, we had $57 million of negative EBITDA as a result of currency translation when you take first and second quarter combined. And we have said that we are seeing -- that we're forecasting $110 million. My view is that it's likely to be slightly higher than that because with all being very low, with commodities, ag commodities, minerals being very low, countries like Brazil and so are going to be -- have seen the real and their local currency devalue compared to the dollar versus the dollar. And we might see further devaluations. I'm not going to anticipate too much, but this is why we need to be a little bit cautious because the reality is -- was yesterday, I didn't check today, but it was at 3 36 [ph]. Well, 3 36 [ph] versus forecast of -- or versus what it was a year ago exactly at this time at about 2 22 [ph], 2 23 [ph] and versus the first -- second quarter this year at 3 10 [ph]. So we have to be careful there."

The Product Care in North America would have been up if we would exclude the voluntary rationalization of our portfolio. You know that I am keen in margin expansion and the quality of business. And as a result of that, we are leading there and being very forceful. The other thing that we have done is that in Latin American countries, starting with Mexico, we had a commodity business, which was really unprofitable. And therefore, we just weeded that out. Having said that, we would have seen higher growth in volume in North America should the electronic business be more positive. And actually, it's been fairly negative when you look at the computers consumption, when you look at the -- those kinds of devices consumption. It's been fairly weak. On the positive, we're seeing a lot of momentum in 3PL and e-commerce. And we're introducing some very, very interesting solutions here, which make me very positive for the next 12 months. On Diversey, I'm pretty happy of what I'm seeing because the trend is a positive trend, and we're having nice volume in every single region. So volume growth is accelerating. We're seeing -- we had that quarter for account of reasons at the beginning of the year in Canada. We're seeing a strong volume growth there. We're seeing very nice in the U.S. EMEA is doing much better, and we're seeing volume growth there. And when I compare quarter 1 and quarter 2, I'm just seeing a trend. So these are not businesses which turn around very quickly because customer wins and the share of wallet at the customer is coming -- is just a long-term process. But I'm positive. So coming to the Internet of Clean, et cetera. Internet of Clean was a Change the Game initiative that we talked to you during our Analyst Day. It's not -- these are not big products today. We are starting, we're having very interesting pilots with customers and things are moving favorably, but you're not going to see a huge swing all of a sudden out of it. Intellibot, I can't tell you how happy I am. I really am. We have seen a pickup in our machine ordering, a pickup in our sales, and we are investing on that. We're going to do this money in 2015 out of these Intellibot operations because in fact, we are accelerating our R&D and our commitment to that. So actually, this is going to impact the second half of the year, but I just -- I'm very happy with that."

So we're just being very prudent in how we have structured the program so they can operate automatically when we have our blackout period and things like that. And we'll just continue to operate that way. So the market will determine whether that $1.5 billion in shares is used quicker or if it takes more time. That's really going to largely depend on a lot of the market dynamics. And with respect to the amortization, we are -- obviously, what you see with Diversey Care is the amortization of intangibles. That was acquired through the Diversey acquisition. And we will see a decrease in that as we go forward. But for example, if we look at the amortization of intangibles for 2014, it was approximately $120 million. And for 2015, it's approximately $95 million. So we will continue to see that come down around that scale."

Our comments today will focus on the second quarter and our outlook. But before I get started, I want to briefly highlight significant events that have taken place in June and July.
First, let me highlight our Analyst Day that took place on June 18. For those of you who couldn't make it, if you haven't done so already, I would encourage you to visit our IR website, download the presentation and listen to the replay. To quickly recap, we outlined our financial and operational objectives for 2018 and our key targets for 2020. We discussed in detail how those objectives and targets will be achieved as we continue executing on our Get Fit and Change the Game strategy. We have executed on many Get Fit programs to date, but as we discussed at our Analyst Day, we still have more to be done. And we will stay focused on driving profitable growth and margin expansion opportunities. We clearly defined our Change the Game strategy and outlined the investments that we're making in new markets, new business models and disruptive innovation. You have all heard me say this before, but let me remind you that our Get Fit and Change the Game strategy is not a destination. It is a journey, and that journey is already transforming us into a knowledge-based company with unique know-how resolutely dedicated to making our customers win and sharing in the value being created.
Second, earlier in June, we completed the refinancing of our 2021 senior notes and issued new U.S. and euro senior notes as extended -- that extended maturities, increased covenant flexibility and reduced our annualized interest expense. With the completion of this transaction, we announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program on July 15, which reflects our commitment to return value to shareholders.
And with that, let me now turn to what I would qualify a very strong second quarter. At this point, I'm sure that you have had a chance to review our press release and earnings result for the second quarter. Net sales of $1.8 billion increased 3.3% on an organic basis, which excludes both currency headwinds and the results from North America tray and pads business, which was sold at the beginning of April in 2015. Adjusted gross margins were up 260 basis points compared to last year as a result of favorable price/mix, lower input cost and manufacturing improvements. Our adjusted EBITDA was a record of $308 million or 17.2% of net sales, an organic increase of 25%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 280 basis points, with both Food Care and Product Care delivering 20%-plus margins for the second consecutive quarter. And while Diversey Care was hit the hardest by currency, it delivered 12% adjusted EBITDA growth on a constant dollar basis.
Let me now turn to Slide 4, where we present our performance by region for the second quarter. On an organic basis, North America sales were up over 2% compared to last year. Food Care and Diversey Care were up approximately 4%. And in Product Care, North America declined approximately 2% as a result of rationalization efforts and weakness in the manufacturing and electronics sectors.
Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, was up 3% in constant dollars and down 15% on an as-reported basis as a result of currency devaluations. In constant dollars, Russia was our fastest-growing country with growth of 26%. Turkey was up 7%, Italy was up 6%, both Germany and Spain were up 4%, and France and Holland were flat to slightly up. Growth in these countries was offset a slight decline in the U.K. and in Switzerland, the 9 countries I just referenced accounting for approximately 24% of the second quarter consolidated sales.
In APAC, we delivered constant currency growth of 4% and a decline on 5% on an as-reported basis. And in constant dollars, Australia was up 6%, led by Food Care. India and Southeast Asia were up 8%, and New Zealand was up 2%. Constant dollar growth in Latin America was up 9 -- was 9%, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Mexico and Argentina, offset by a 3% decline in Brazil.
Let's now turn to Slide 5, and this highlights the results of our Food Care division. In the second quarter, Food Care sales increased 4.2% on an organic basis with growth across all the regions. Favorable price/mix was 2.7%, and volume was up 1.5%. We had favorable price/mix and positive volume trends in every region except Latin America, where volume was negatively impacted by the market conditions in Brazil. Net sales in constant dollars in Latin America were up 11%. APAC increased 5%. EMEA was up 2%. And on an organic basis, North America increased 4%. We delivered strong double-digit constant dollar sales growth in Russia, Argentina, Mexico; and mid- to high single-digit growth in Italy, Australia and New Zealand. We have still constant dollar declines in France and Brazil, 2 countries that each account for 3% to 4% of our global Food Care sales. China, which is approximately 2% of our Food Care sales, was down 7% primarily due to weakness in our hygiene business.
In North America, cattle production was down 8%, which was offset by mid-single-digit growth in smoke and processed food and poultry. Fresh red meat is our largest market, and yet despite declines in the cattle market, we still delivered 4% organic growth in North America. Our fresh red meat business was up slightly, and we experienced strong growth in the poultry market. This performance was a result of continued adoption of our advanced product offering, and overall in North America, we had favorable price/mix and volume growth. For the remainder of the year, we expect continued decline in the beef market but after decelerating rate that we have been experiencing over the last 9 to 12 months.
In Europe, we have seen a slight improvement in the protein market. The improved market conditions, coupled with the adoption of our new, very successful products, resulted in a 4.5% constant dollar growth rate in our European food packaging business. We are experiencing the increased demand for Darfresh On Tray and Optidur and have also been successful in our value-added selling approach.
Turning to Food Care's adjusted EBITDA performance. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $174 million, which is a 10% increase on an as-reported basis and a 27% increase on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.5% were up 410 basis points. This increase was largely a result of an improved mix of premium products, portfolio management, global pricing initiatives and cost synergies.
Within our European hygiene business, it is worth noting that we have seen a meaningful increase in our EBITDA margins as a result of our portfolio management efforts and pricing initiatives. As we head into the back half of the year, we expect further adoptions of our new products on a global basis and continue to focus on value-added selling. However, this will be partially offset by formula pricing in North America, currency headwinds and other external factors, including, for example, the fact that the slower rates in Australia are starting to decline and will further do that. Some of this extended focus also include economic challenges in Brazil and Venezuela and a slowdown in Australia, as I just mentioned.
We anticipate EBITDA growth in the second half of the year but not at the same rate experienced in the first half. And for the full year 2015, we are on track to deliver strong annual EBITDA growth and margin expansion.
Slide 6 highlights the result from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant currency basis were up 3.8% in the second quarter. Favorable price/mix was up 2.2%, and volume increased 1.6%. We delivered favorable price/mix and positive volume trends in all the regions. Our fastest-growing regions in the quarter were Latin America and North America, with constant daily sales growth of 9% and 5%, respectively. Asia Pacific was up 3.5%; and EMEA, over 2%. 
From an end-market perspective, we experienced increased demand in food service, hospitality and health care, and we also increased demand in our distribution channels. EMEA accounts for approximately 50% of our net sales, as you know. And among our largest markets throughout this region, we experienced high single-digit growth in Turkey; positive sales in France, Italy, Holland and Germany. Challenging economic condition and instability are slowing down Russian and local tourism in Turkey and Dubai. In addition, the ongoing economic crisis in Greece is also negatively impacting tourism, and this decline in tourism, which we are currently experiencing, will have an impact in the second half of the year in our hospitality market, especially in the third quarter. North American accounts for 30% of our net sales and delivered 5% constant dollar sales growth, with increasing demand from our hospitality and health care segments. In Asia Pacific, double-digit growth in India and Australia was partially offset by softness in China. Performance in Latin America was driven by growth in Argentina and Chile, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in Brazil.
Diversey Care delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of $69 million or 12.9% of net sales in the quarter. And as we anticipated, currency translation negatively impacted our performance in the quarter; and on a reported basis, adjusted EBITDA declined 5%. In constant dollars, however, adjusted EBITDA was up 12% compared to last year. This growth was driven by our success in our value-added selling approach, high volumes and cost synergies, partially offset by higher SG&A as we continue to heavily invest in sales and marketing and R&D to further support growth opportunities. For example, we're already seeing strong interest in our robotic floor care machines with our recent acquisition of Intellibot and are having many conversation with our customers around our Internet of Clean solutions. As a result, we are accelerating our investment in both equipment and data analytics into year-end. And despite these investments and currency headwinds, we are still on track to deliver EBITDA growth on a constant dollar basis and margin expansion for the full year.
Slide 7 highlights the results from our Product Care division. Net sales were essentially unchanged in constant dollars on a year-over-year basis. We had favorable price/mix of just over 1% on volumes that declined nearly 2%. Favorable price/mix continues to be driven by our pricing efforts across global -- both Global Performance Packaging and General Packaging. Second quarter volume was impacted, in fact, by rationalization efforts in Latin America and, to a lesser extent, also in North America. Our rationalization efforts are focused on our general packaging solutions and should be mostly behind us by mid-2016.
On a regional basis, North America net sales were down 1.6% in constant currency, while EMEA was up 3.6%. It is also worth noting that both China and Japan were up in the mid- to high single digits. Excluding rationalization efforts in North America, net sales would have been slightly up. And as I said earlier, in North America, we experienced market weakness in manufacturing and electronics, but that was -- this was offset by strength in e-commerce and third-party logistics. Our growth in EMEA was due to increased demand in our performing packaging solutions, particularly in Germany and in Spain, which is recovering now. On a global basis, we're seeing strong growth in both e-commerce and third-party logistics and are confident that this growth will continue for the foreseeable future given our global -- our product breadth, global reach and focused investment in performance-based packaging.
And let's now turn to adjusted EBITDA. Product Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $79 million, which is a 10% increase on an as-reported basis and an 18% increase in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.7% expanded 310 basis points compared to last year's results. This increase was a result of an increasing mix of Global Performance Packaging and pricing discipline. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued EBITDA growth and margin expansion as well.
And now let me pass the call to Carol to review our total net sales, adjusted EBITDA, cash flow and outlook. Carol?"

Turning to Slide 8. Let me walk you through our net sales performance on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.8 billion in sales, an increase of 3.3% on an organic basis. Favorable price/mix was 2.4% or $48 million, and volume was up 1% or $18 million. Unfavorable currency translation had an impact on net sales of $199 million or 10%, mostly due to the declines in the euro and Russian ruble. Net sales on an as-reported basis were down 9.6%.
Turning to Slide 9. You can see our adjusted EBITDA performance for the quarter and first half of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8.4%, as reported, to $308 million or 17.2% of net sales. For the total company, the increase in adjusted EBITDA was largely due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of $58 million. Cost synergies also made a positive contribution of $16 million in the quarter. The North America trays and pads divestiture had a $12 million negative comparison for adjusted EBITDA and unfavorable currency translation with $34 million. Despite currency headwinds, we still delivered a 260 basis point improvement in adjusted gross margin and a 280 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to last year. On an organic basis, our adjusted EBITDA increased 25% as compared to the 2014 results for the same period.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.60 as compared to $0.42 in the second quarter last year. Currency negatively impacted EPS by $0.09. The tax rate for the second quarter of 2015 was 29% as compared with 29.5% for the second quarter of 2014. In the first quarter of 2015, the tax rate was 25%, and we are still anticipating a 25% tax rate for the full year of 2015. The sequential increase from the first quarter was primarily due to higher taxable earnings in the U.S., which has one of our highest tax rates. For the full year, we expect to have higher earnings in some of our lower tax jurisdictions. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares for a total value of approximately $86 million. In the first half of 2015, we repurchased 3.2 million shares, and as of July 28, we have repurchased an additional 2.7 million shares, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to a total of 5.9 million shares.
Now turning to Slide 10. We outline our price/mix, volume trends and sales growth on a constant dollar basis by division and by region. As you can see from the slide, we had favorable price/mix in every division and in every region. Volume was up in Food Care and Diversey Care, and excluding rationalization efforts in Product Care, volume would have been up slightly. We delivered volume growth in all regions, except Latin America, which was impacted by the economic environment in Brazil, as Jerome previously referenced, and our rationalization efforts in Product Care. For the total company, we delivered 3.3% organic growth.
Turning to Slide 11. You can see free cash flow was a source of $171 million for the first 6 months of the year, excluding the $235 million tax refund received related to the Grace settlement. This compares favorably to a source of $119 million for the 6 months ending 2014 due to higher earnings and an improvement in operating working capital management. As many of you know, the company focuses its management of operating working capital on a 13-month average target. For the 13-month period ending June 30, 2015, the average for operating working capital as a percent of net sales was 16%. This represents a 250-basis-point improvement compared to June 30, 2014. CapEx was $58 million and cash restructuring costs were $45 million for the 6 months ending June 30, 2015.
Our updated outlook for 2015 is presented on Slide 12. We continue to expect net sales to be approximately $7.1 billion. Unfavorable currency is expected to be approximately 9% or $700 million. Also, as a reminder, the trays and pads business generated approximately $200 million in sales in 2014. This disposition did not qualify under the accounting rules for treatment as discontinued operations. Therefore, prior years in the first quarter of 2015 include the North America trays and pads business, but there is no benefit from this business going forward nor was there any in the second quarter of this year. Excluding the impact of the divestiture and currency headwinds, we continue to anticipate an organic growth rate of approximately 3%.
Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.16 billion to $1.17 billion, which compares to our previous guidance of $1.14 billion to $1.16 billion. This reflects our strong performance in the first half of the year. We will continue to face currency challenges as compared to last year. We are now estimating FX to have a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $110 million. 
We'd like you to keep in mind that in the third quarter of 2014, the euro was at $1.34; and in Q4 2014, the euro was at $1.26. Our forecast for the second half of the year assumes the euro at $.1.10. Other currencies where we have exposure the include Russian ruble, the Brazilian real and Australian dollar.
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.24 to $2.28 as compared to 2014 adjusted earnings per share of $1.86. As a reminder, at our Analyst Day in June, we increased our EPS range by $0.03 to $2.11 to $2.18 to account for the interest savings related to our senior note refinancing. Our interest expense for 2015 will be $235 million, a $10 million reduction from the forecast we had provided earlier in the year. On an annualized basis, the senior note refinancing transaction will reduce our interest expense by $20 million. Constant currency earnings per share would be approximately $2.54 to $2.58 without the impact of currency. As I highlighted earlier, we repurchased a total of 5.9 million shares as of July 28, and we will continue to be active in our share repurchase program. Our earnings per share outlook for 2015 is based on 209 million shares outstanding for the balance of the year, which reflects the weighted average full year effect of all the share repurchase completed as of July 28.
We are revising our free cash flow guidance to $585 million from the previous $575 million to reflect the higher adjusted EBITDA forecast. Our free cash flow outlook also excludes the $235 million refund related to the Grace settlement, which I previously referenced. Cash interest payments are expected to be $230 million as compared to our previous forecast of $240 million; and cash tax payments are now estimated at $115 million. We are on track to invest $210 million in capital expenditures and are still anticipating $120 million in restructuring activity. We also continue to estimate approximately $50 million in cost synergies for 2015 from these restructuring efforts.

So what we had is a negative almost 2.5% global in the first quarter in Product Care, and now it's about 1%. We're seeing this improve over time. And probably, in the second half, definitely, we are going to be hitting the e-commerce season. And we're making -- we're putting lots of efforts in some very specific sectors in there. And I must say that we are having -- or we're on the verge of having some pretty nice customer wins. And so we're also introducing quite nice, new products, which have a lot of momentum. And this is in both equipment and in new products themselves. So I would be -- I'm quite positive that the very forceful efforts put by Ken in -- and his forceful leadership are going to bring pretty good results."

We have had nice volume growth in an environment which is not necessarily very favorable. When you look at the overall market, you see that the red fresh meat market in the U.S. has been very depressed in the second quarter. I think I remember 8% reduction, which is one of the biggest negative percentages. We believe that the percentages of reduction are going to slowly taper down, but we haven't seen that yet. In Brazil, the situation is really bad. There are many slaughterhouses which have been closing. I think the number is 15. JBS has recently published that they have closed 5. And this is the result of drought, high prices of red meat at the cattle level, reducing purchasing Power. And you know that red meat is an expensive meat, and as a result, there's been transfers into poultry. So we have had negative volume in Brazil. For the rest of the year, we're going to see -- we're carefully optimistic, but the poultry market has been good for us and we expect that this is going to continue being good. Our EMEA business is actually pulled by new products. And Optidur, Darfresh On Tray are doing absolutely wonderful, and we're expecting those new products to continue pulling our business there. So we had positive growth not as much in the second quarter as we had in the first quarter and -- but we believe that it's going to be okay. Diversey has been improving its volume, and we had flat volume in Q1. We had definitely growth in Q2, and we're happy with what we're seeing here. So having said that, in Diversey, the comp in the third quarter is not going to be very favorable because we had strong TASKI sales in Q3 of last year."

I always like to -- in a growing -- in an increasing raw material environment, it is very important to see whether you've got price increases and whether you've got price. In a decreasing environment, and we have had that compared to 12 months ago with resins, what is important is mostly to see whether you get margin expansion or whether you don't to see -- to look at your pricing discipline. The interesting thing is that we've got positive pricing. And we've got positive pricing in every single of our divisions, not as much as we got in the first quarter but we've got positive pricing. And that is important. That leads me to the second half and the resin prices. There have been attempts in North America to raise resin prices in July. It's not going through. And we'll see what August gives, but the volume overall is -- and the business is fairly weak in the polyethylene arena -- olefins arena globally. And we just don't believe at this point in time that there is going to be major price increases. And as a result of that, what we're going to be seeing is formula pricing get impact during the third quarter."

It happens that the export markets for Brazil, as an example, is fairly weak. And you have some major companies out of Brazil which have made comments recently, saying that not only the local market is very weak -- their local market is extremely weak for fresh red meat, but also the export market is fairly weak for them also. And yes, you're right that normally, a lower real should help, but it seems that the export markets are fairly weak. We look out to Australia. The slaughter rate of the herd has been double digit in the first quarter and is slightly coming down, and the reason is very normal. Those levels are completely unsustainable, completely unsustainable. And as a result of that, we are seeing a little bit less growth, very strong growth actually in Australia on our business, but a little bit less growth, not -- the first quarter was, if I remember well, double digit. And here, we are talking about a high single digit. With regards to currency in general, we had $57 million of negative EBITDA as a result of currency translation when you take first and second quarter combined. And we have said that we are seeing -- that we are forecasting $110 million. My view is that it's likely to be slightly higher than that because with all being very low with commodities, ag commodities, minerals being very low, countries like Brazil and so are going to be -- have seen the real and their local currency devalue compared to the dollar versus the dollar. And we might see further devaluations. I'm not going to anticipate too much, but this is why we need to be a little bit cautious because the real is -- was yesterday. I didn't check today, but it was at BRL 3.36. Well, BRL 3.36 versus a forecast of -- or versus what it was a year ago exactly at this time at about BRL 2.22, BRL 2.23 and versus the first -- second quarter this year at BRL 3.10. So we have to be careful there."

The Product Care in North America would have been up if we would exclude the voluntary rationalization of our portfolio. You know that I am keen in margin expansion and the quality of business. And as a result of that, we are leading there and being very forceful. The other thing that we have done is that in Latin American countries, starting with Mexico, we had a commodity business which was really unprofitable. And therefore, we just weeded that out. Having said that, we would have seen higher growth in volume in North America should the electronic business be more positive. And actually, it's been fairly negative when you look at the computers consumption, when you look at the -- those kind of devices consumption. It's been fairly weak. On the positive, we're seeing a lot of momentum on 3PL and e-commerce. And we're introducing some very, very interesting solutions here, which make me very positive for the next 12 months. On Diversey, I'm pretty happy of what I'm seeing because the trend is a positive trend and we are having nice volume in every single region. So volume growth is accelerating. We're seeing -- we had a bad quarter for all kind of reasons. At the beginning of the year in Canada, we're seeing a strong volume growth there. We're seeing very nice in the U.S. EMEA is doing much better, and we're seeing volume growth there. And when I compare quarter 1 and quarter 2, I'm just seeing a trend. So it's -- these are not businesses which turn around very quickly because customer wins and the share at -- of wallet at the customer is coming -- is just a long-term process, but I'm positive. So coming to the Internet of Clean, et cetera, Internet of Clean was a Change the Game initiative that we talked to you during our Analyst Day. It's not -- these are not big products today. We are starting. We're having very interesting pilots with customers and things are moving favorably, but you're not going to see a huge swing all of a sudden out of it. Intellibot, I can't tell you how happy I am. I really am. We have seen a pickup in our machine ordering, a pickup in our sales, and we are investing a lot. We're going to lose money in 2015 out of these Intellibot operations because in fact, we are accelerating our R&D and our commitment to that. So actually, this is going to impact the second half of the year, but I just -- I'm very happy with that."

And we went through a process of analyzing all of those investments and where we did not see opportunity for a favorable return. And we had been investing in those ventures sometimes 3-plus years. We made decisions to exit. And we have exited substantially all of those equity investments that were not wholly owned."

Our comments today will focus on the second quarter and our outlook. But before I get started, I want to briefly highlight significant events that have taken place in June and July.
First, let me highlight our Analyst Day that took place on June 18. For those of you who couldn't make it, if you haven't done so already, I would encourage you to visit our IR website, download the presentation and listen to the replay. To quickly recap, we outlined our financial and operational objectives for 2018 and our key targets for 2020. We discussed in detail how those objectives and targets will be achieved as we continue executing on our Get Fit and Change the Game strategy. We have executed on many Get Fit programs to date, but as we discussed at our Analyst Day, we still have more to be done. And we will stay focused on driving profitable growth and margin expansion opportunities. We clearly defined our Change the Game strategy and outlined the investments that we're making in new markets, new business models and disruptive innovation. You have all heard me say this before, but let me remind you that our Get Fit and Change the Game strategy is not a destination. It is a journey, and that journey is already transforming us into a knowledge-based company with unique know-how resolutely dedicated to making our customers win and sharing in the value being created.
Second, earlier in June, we completed the refinancing of our 2021 senior notes and issued new U.S. and euro senior notes as extended -- that extended maturities, increased covenant flexibility and reduced our annualized interest expense. With the completion of this transaction, we announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program on July 15, which reflects our commitment to return value to shareholders.
And with that, let me now turn to what I would qualify a very strong second quarter. At this point, I'm sure that you have had a chance to review our press release and earnings result for the second quarter. Net sales of $1.8 billion increased 3.3% on an organic basis, which excludes both currency headwinds and the results from North America tray and pads business, which was sold at the beginning of April in 2015. Adjusted gross margins were up 260 basis points compared to last year as a result of favorable price/mix, lower input cost and manufacturing improvements. Our adjusted EBITDA was a record of $308 million or 17.2% of net sales, an organic increase of 25%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 280 basis points, with both Food Care and Product Care delivering 20%-plus margins for the second consecutive quarter. And while Diversey Care was hit the hardest by currency, it delivered 12% adjusted EBITDA growth on a constant dollar basis.
Let me now turn to Slide 4, where we present our performance by region for the second quarter. On an organic basis, North America sales were up over 2% compared to last year. Food Care and Diversey Care were up approximately 4%. And in Product Care, North America declined approximately 2% as a result of rationalization efforts and weakness in the manufacturing and electronics sectors.
Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, was up 3% in constant dollars and down 15% on an as-reported basis as a result of currency devaluations. In constant dollars, Russia was our fastest-growing country with growth of 26%. Turkey was up 7%, Italy was up 6%, both Germany and Spain were up 4%, and France and Holland were flat to slightly up. Growth in these countries was offset a slight decline in the U.K. and in Switzerland, the 9 countries I just referenced accounting for approximately 24% of the second quarter consolidated sales.
In APAC, we delivered constant currency growth of 4% and a decline on 5% on an as-reported basis. And in constant dollars, Australia was up 6%, led by Food Care. India and Southeast Asia were up 8%, and New Zealand was up 2%. Constant dollar growth in Latin America was up 9 -- was 9%, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Mexico and Argentina, offset by a 3% decline in Brazil.
Let's now turn to Slide 5, and this highlights the results of our Food Care division. In the second quarter, Food Care sales increased 4.2% on an organic basis with growth across all the regions. Favorable price/mix was 2.7%, and volume was up 1.5%. We had favorable price/mix and positive volume trends in every region except Latin America, where volume was negatively impacted by the market conditions in Brazil. Net sales in constant dollars in Latin America were up 11%. APAC increased 5%. EMEA was up 2%. And on an organic basis, North America increased 4%. We delivered strong double-digit constant dollar sales growth in Russia, Argentina, Mexico; and mid- to high single-digit growth in Italy, Australia and New Zealand. We experienced constant dollar declines in France and Brazil, 2 countries that each account for 3% to 4% of our global Food Care sales. China, which is approximately 2% of our Food Care sales, was down 7% primarily due to weakness in our hygiene business.
In North America, cattle production was down 8%, which was offset by mid-single-digit growth in smoke and processed food and poultry. Fresh red meat is our largest market, and yet despite declines in the cattle market, we still delivered 4% organic growth in North America. Our fresh red meat business was up slightly, and we experienced strong growth in the poultry market. This performance was a result of continued adoption of our advanced product offering, and overall in North America, we had favorable price/mix and volume growth. For the remainder of the year, we expect continued decline in the beef market but at the decelerating rate that we have been experiencing over the last 9 to 12 months.
In Europe, we have seen a slight improvement in the protein market. The improved market conditions, coupled with the adoption of our new, very successful products, resulted in a 4.5% constant dollar growth rate in our European food packaging business. We are experiencing the increased demand for Darfresh On Tray and Optidur and have also been successful in our value-added selling approach.
Turning to Food Care's adjusted EBITDA performance. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $174 million, which is a 10% increase on an as-reported basis and a 27% increase on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.5% were up 410 basis points. This increase was largely a result of an improved mix of premium products, portfolio management, global pricing initiatives and cost synergies.
Within our European hygiene business, it is worth noting that we have seen a meaningful increase in our EBITDA margins as a result of our portfolio management efforts and pricing initiatives. As we head into the back half of the year, we expect further adoptions of our new products on a global basis and continue to focus on value-added selling. However, this will be partially offset by formula pricing in North America, currency headwinds and other external factors, including, for example, the fact that the slaughter rates in Australia are starting to decline and will further do that. Some of this extended focus also include economic challenges in Brazil and Venezuela and a slowdown in Australia, as I just mentioned.
We anticipate EBITDA growth in the second half of the year but not at the same rate experienced in the first half. And for the full year 2015, we are on track to deliver strong annual EBITDA growth and margin expansion.
Slide 6 highlights the result from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant currency basis were up 3.8% in the second quarter. Favorable price/mix was up 2.2%, and volume increased 1.6%. We delivered favorable price/mix and positive volume trends in all the regions. Our fastest-growing regions in the quarter were Latin America and North America, with constant daily sales growth of 9% and 5%, respectively. Asia Pacific was up 3.5%; and EMEA, over 2%. 
From an end-market perspective, we experienced increased demand in food service, hospitality and health care, and we also increased demand in our distribution channels. EMEA accounts for approximately 50% of our net sales, as you know. And among our largest markets throughout this region, we experienced high single-digit growth in Turkey; positive sales in France, Italy, Holland and Germany. Challenging economic condition and instability are slowing down Russian and local tourism in Turkey and Dubai. In addition, the ongoing economic crisis in Greece is also negatively impacting tourism, and this decline in tourism, which we are currently experiencing, will have an impact in the second half of the year in our hospitality market, especially in the third quarter. North American accounts for 30% of our net sales and delivered 5% constant dollar sales growth, with increasing demand from our hospitality and health care segments. In Asia Pacific, double-digit growth in India and Australia was partially offset by softness in China. Performance in Latin America was driven by growth in Argentina and Chile, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in Brazil.
Diversey Care delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of $69 million or 12.9% of net sales in the quarter. And as we anticipated, currency translation negatively impacted our performance in the quarter; and on a reported basis, adjusted EBITDA declined 5%. In constant dollars, however, adjusted EBITDA was up 12% compared to last year. This growth was driven by our success in our value-added selling approach, high volumes and cost synergies, partially offset by higher SG&A as we continue to heavily invest in sales and marketing and R&D to further support growth opportunities. For example, we're already seeing strong interest in our robotic floor care machines with our recent acquisition of Intellibot and are having many conversation with our customers around our Internet of Clean solutions. As a result, we are accelerating our investment in both equipment and data analytics into year-end. And despite these investments and currency headwinds, we are still on track to deliver EBITDA growth on a constant dollar basis and margin expansion for the full year.
Slide 7 highlights the results from our Product Care division. Net sales were essentially unchanged in constant dollars on a year-over-year basis. We had favorable price/mix of just over 1% on volumes that declined nearly 2%. Favorable price/mix continues to be driven by our pricing efforts across global -- both Global Performance Packaging and General Packaging. Second quarter volume was impacted, in fact, by rationalization efforts in Latin America and, to a lesser extent, also in North America. Our rationalization efforts are focused on our general packaging solutions and should be mostly behind us by mid-2016.
On a regional basis, North America net sales were down 1.6% in constant currency, while EMEA was up 3.6%. It is also worth noting that both China and Japan were up in the mid- to high single digits. Excluding rationalization efforts in North America, net sales would have been slightly up. And as I said earlier, in North America, we experienced market weakness in manufacturing and electronics, but that was -- this was offset by strength in e-commerce and third-party logistics. Our growth in EMEA was due to increased demand in our performing packaging solutions, particularly in Germany and in Spain, which is recovering now. On a global basis, we're seeing strong growth in both e-commerce and third-party logistics and are confident that this growth will continue for the foreseeable future given our global -- our product breadth, global reach and focused investment in performance-based packaging.
And let's now turn to adjusted EBITDA. Product Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $79 million, which is a 10% increase on an as-reported basis and an 18% increase in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.7% expanded 310 basis points compared to last year's results. This increase was a result of an increasing mix of Global Performance Packaging and pricing discipline. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued EBITDA growth and margin expansion as well.
And now let me pass the call to Carol to review our total net sales, adjusted EBITDA, cash flow and outlook. Carol?"

Turning to Slide 8. Let me walk you through our net sales performance on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.8 billion in sales, an increase of 3.3% on an organic basis. Favorable price/mix was 2.4% or $48 million, and volume was up 1% or $18 million. Unfavorable currency translation had an impact on net sales of $199 million or 10%, mostly due to the declines in the euro and Russian ruble. Net sales on an as-reported basis were down 9.6%.
Turning to Slide 9. You can see our adjusted EBITDA performance for the quarter and first half of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8.4%, as reported, to $308 million or 17.2% of net sales. For the total company, the increase in adjusted EBITDA was largely due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of $58 million. Cost synergies also made a positive contribution of $16 million in the quarter. The North America trays and pads divestiture had a $12 million negative comparison for adjusted EBITDA and unfavorable currency translation with $34 million. Despite currency headwinds, we still delivered a 260 basis point improvement in adjusted gross margin and a 280 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to last year. On an organic basis, our adjusted EBITDA increased 25% as compared to the 2014 results for the same period.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.60 as compared to $0.42 in the second quarter last year. Currency negatively impacted EPS by $0.09. The tax rate for the second quarter of 2015 was 29% as compared with 29.5% for the second quarter of 2014. In the first quarter of 2015, the tax rate was 25%, and we are still anticipating a 25% tax rate for the full year of 2015. The sequential increase from the first quarter was primarily due to higher taxable earnings in the U.S., which has one of our highest tax rates. For the full year, we expect to have higher earnings in some of our lower tax jurisdictions. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares for a total value of approximately $86 million. In the first half of 2015, we repurchased 3.2 million shares, and as of July 28, we have repurchased an additional 2.7 million shares, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to a total of 5.9 million shares.
Now turning to Slide 10. We outline our price/mix, volume trends and sales growth on a constant dollar basis by division and by region. As you can see from the slide, we had favorable price/mix in every division and in every region. Volume was up in Food Care and Diversey Care, and excluding rationalization efforts in Product Care, volume would have been up slightly. We delivered volume growth in all regions, except Latin America, which was impacted by the economic environment in Brazil, as Jerome previously referenced, and our rationalization efforts in Product Care. For the total company, we delivered 3.3% organic growth.
Turning to Slide 11. You can see free cash flow was a source of $171 million for the first 6 months of the year, excluding the $235 million tax refund received related to the Grace settlement. This compares favorably to a source of $119 million for the 6 months ending 2014 due to higher earnings and an improvement in operating working capital management. As many of you know, the company focuses its management of operating working capital on a 13-month average target. For the 13-month period ending June 30, 2015, the average for operating working capital as a percent of net sales was 16%. This represents a 250-basis-point improvement compared to June 30, 2014. CapEx was $58 million and cash restructuring costs were $45 million for the 6 months ending June 30, 2015.
Our updated outlook for 2015 is presented on Slide 12. We continue to expect net sales to be approximately $7.1 billion. Unfavorable currency is expected to be approximately 9% or $700 million. Also, as a reminder, the trays and pads business generated approximately $200 million in sales in 2014. This disposition did not qualify under the accounting rules for treatment as discontinued operations. Therefore, prior years in the first quarter of 2015 include the North America trays and pads business, but there is no benefit from this business going forward nor was there any in the second quarter of this year. Excluding the impact of the divestiture and currency headwinds, we continue to anticipate an organic growth rate of approximately 3%.
Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.16 billion to $1.17 billion, which compares to our previous guidance of $1.14 billion to $1.16 billion. This reflects our strong performance in the first half of the year. We will continue to face currency challenges as compared to last year. We are now estimating FX to have a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $110 million. 
We'd like you to keep in mind that in the third quarter of 2014, the euro was at $1.34; and in Q4 2014, the euro was at $1.26. Our forecast for the second half of the year assumes the euro at $1.10. Other currencies where we have exposure the include Russian ruble, the Brazilian real and Australian dollar.
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.24 to $2.28 as compared to 2014 adjusted earnings per share of $1.86. As a reminder, at our Analyst Day in June, we increased our EPS range by $0.03 to $2.11 to $2.18 to account for the interest savings related to our senior note refinancing. Our interest expense for 2015 will be $235 million, a $10 million reduction from the forecast we had provided earlier in the year. On an annualized basis, the senior note refinancing transaction will reduce our interest expense by $20 million. Constant currency earnings per share would be approximately $2.54 to $2.58 without the impact of currency. As I highlighted earlier, we repurchased a total of 5.9 million shares as of July 28, and we will continue to be active in our share repurchase program. Our earnings per share outlook for 2015 is based on 209 million shares outstanding for the balance of the year, which reflects the weighted average full year effect of all the share repurchase completed as of July 28.
We are revising our free cash flow guidance to $585 million from the previous $575 million to reflect the higher adjusted EBITDA forecast. Our free cash flow outlook also excludes the $235 million refund related to the Grace settlement, which I previously referenced. Cash interest payments are expected to be $230 million as compared to our previous forecast of $240 million; and cash tax payments are now estimated at $115 million. We are on track to invest $210 million in capital expenditures and are still anticipating $120 million in restructuring activity. We also continue to estimate approximately $50 million in cost synergies for 2015 from these restructuring efforts.
This concludes my prepared remarks, but before we open the call to questions, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday (sic) [ Tuesday ], October 27, at 10:00 a.m. Operator, can you please open the call for questions?"

The volumes out there, except in Product Care -- but this is mostly the result of rationalization. So what we had is a negative almost 2.5% global in the first quarter in Product Care, and now it's about 1%. We're seeing this improve over time. And probably, in the second half, definitely, we are going to be hitting the e-commerce season. And we're making -- we're putting lots of efforts in some very specific sectors in there. And I must say that we are having -- or we're on the verge of having some pretty nice customer wins. And so we're also introducing quite nice, new products, which have a lot of momentum. And this is in both equipment and in new products themselves. So I would be -- I'm quite positive that the very forceful efforts put by Ken in -- and his forceful leadership are going to bring pretty good results. 
On Food Care? On Food Care -- well, on Food Care, it's quite interesting. We have had nice volume growth in an environment which is not necessarily very favorable. When you look at the overall market, you see that the red fresh meat market in the U.S. has been very depressed in the second quarter. I think I remember 8% reduction, which is one of the biggest negative percentages. We believe that the percentages of reduction are going to slowly taper down, but we haven't seen that yet. In Brazil, the situation is really bad. There are many slaughterhouses which have been closing. I think the number is 15. JBS has recently published that they have closed 5. And this is the result of drought, high prices of red meat at the cattle level, reducing purchasing Power. And you know that red meat is an expensive meat, and as a result, there's been transfers into poultry. So we have had negative volume in Brazil. For the rest of the year, we're going to see -- we're carefully optimistic, but the poultry market has been good for us and we expect that this is going to continue being good. Our EMEA business is actually pulled by new products. And Optidur, Darfresh On Tray are doing absolutely wonderful, and we're expecting those new products to continue pulling our business there. So we had positive growth not as much in the second quarter as we had in the first quarter and -- but we believe that it's going to be okay. Diversey has been improving its volume, and we had flat volume in Q1. We had definitely growth in Q2, and we're happy with what we're seeing here. So having said that, in Diversey, the comp in the third quarter is not going to be very favorable because we had strong TASKI sales in Q3 of last year."

But at the same time, as everyone is aware, we do have the formula pricing for Food Care, as Jerome referenced in his opening remarks.

I always like to -- in a growing -- in an increasing raw material environment, it is very important to see whether you've got price increases and whether you've got price. In a decreasing environment, and we have had that compared to 12 months ago with resins, what is important is mostly to see whether you get margin expansion or whether you don't to see -- to look at your pricing discipline. The interesting thing is that we've got positive pricing. And we've got positive pricing in every single of our divisions, not as much as we got in the first quarter but we've got positive pricing. And that is important. That leads me to the second half and the resin prices. There have been attempts in North America to raise resin prices in July. It's not going through. And we'll see what August gives, but the volume overall is -- and the business is fairly weak in the polyethylene arena -- olefins arena globally. And we just don't believe at this point in time that there is going to be major price increases. And as a result of that, what we're going to be seeing is formula pricing get impact during the third quarter."

It happens that the export markets for Brazil, as an example, is fairly weak. And you have some major companies out of Brazil which have made comments recently, saying that not only the local market is very weak -- their local market is extremely weak for fresh red meat, but also the export market is fairly weak for them also. And yes, you're right that normally, a lower real should help, but it seems that the export markets are fairly weak. We look out to Australia. The slaughter rate of the herd has been double digit in the first quarter and is slightly coming down, and the reason is very normal. Those levels are completely unsustainable, completely unsustainable. And as a result of that, we are seeing a little bit less growth, very strong growth actually in Australia on our business, but a little bit less growth, not -- the first quarter was, if I remember well, double digit. And here, we are talking about a high single digit. With regards to currency in general, we had $57 million of negative EBITDA as a result of currency translation when you take first and second quarter combined. And we have said that we are seeing -- that we are forecasting $110 million. My view is that it's likely to be slightly higher than that because with all being very low with commodities, ag commodities, minerals being very low, countries like Brazil and so are going to be -- have seen the real and their local currency devalue compared to the dollar versus the dollar. And we might see further devaluations. I'm not going to anticipate too much, but this is why we need to be a little bit cautious because the real is -- was yesterday. I didn't check today, but it was at BRL 3.36. Well, BRL 3.36 versus a forecast of -- or versus what it was a year ago exactly at this time at about BRL 2.22, BRL 2.23 and versus the first -- second quarter this year at BRL 3.10. So we have to be careful there."

The Product Care in North America would have been up if we would include the voluntary rationalization of our portfolio. You know that I am keen in margin expansion and the quality of business. And as a result of that, we are leading there and being very forceful. The other thing that we have done is that in Latin American countries, starting with Mexico, we had a commodity business which was really unprofitable. And therefore, we just weeded that out. Having said that, we would have seen higher growth in volume in North America should the electronic business be more positive. And actually, it's been fairly negative when you look at the computers consumption, when you look at the -- those kind of devices consumption. It's been fairly weak. On the positive, we're seeing a lot of momentum on 3PL and e-commerce. And we're introducing some very, very interesting solutions here, which make me very positive for the next 12 months. On Diversey, I'm pretty happy of what I'm seeing because the trend is a positive trend and we are having nice volume in every single region. So volume growth is accelerating. We're seeing -- we had a bad quarter for all kind of reasons. At the beginning of the year in Canada, we're seeing a strong volume growth there. We're seeing very nice in the U.S. EMEA is doing much better, and we're seeing volume growth there. And when I compare quarter 1 and quarter 2, I'm just seeing a trend. So it's -- these are not businesses which turn around very quickly because customer wins and the share at -- of wallet at the customer is coming -- is just a long-term process, but I'm positive. So coming to the Internet of Clean, et cetera, Internet of Clean was a Change the Game initiative that we talked to you during our Analyst Day. It's not -- these are not big products today. We are starting. We're having very interesting pilots with customers and things are moving favorably, but you're not going to see a huge swing all of a sudden out of it. Intellibot, I can't tell you how happy I am. I really am. We have seen a pickup in our machine ordering, a pickup in our sales, and we are investing a lot. We're going to lose money in 2015 out of these Intellibot operations because in fact, we are accelerating our R&D and our commitment to that. So actually, this is going to impact the second half of the year, but I just -- I'm very happy with that."

Our comments today will focus on the second quarter and our outlook. But before I get started, I want to briefly highlight significant events that have taken place in June and July.
First, let me highlight our Analyst Day that took place on June 18. For those of you who couldn't make it, if you haven't done so already, I would encourage you to visit our IR website, download the presentation and listen to the replay. To quickly recap, we outlined our financial and operational objectives for 2018 and our key targets for 2020. We discussed in detail how those objectives and targets will be achieved as we continue executing on our Get Fit and Change the Game strategy. We have executed on many Get Fit programs to date, but as we discussed at our Analyst Day, we still have more to be done. And we will stay focused on driving profitable growth and margin expansion opportunities. We clearly defined our Change the Game strategy and outlined the investments that we're making in new markets, new business models and disruptive innovation. You have all heard me say this before, but let me remind you that our Get Fit and Change the Game strategy is not a destination. It is a journey, and that journey is already transforming us into a knowledge-based company with unique know-how resolutely dedicated to making our customers win and sharing in the value being created.
Second, earlier in June, we completed the refinancing of our 2021 senior notes and issued new U.S. and euro senior notes as extended -- that extended maturities, increased covenant flexibility and reduced our annualized interest expense. With the completion of this transaction, we announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program on July 15, which reflects our commitment to return value to shareholders.
And with that, let me now turn to what I would qualify a very strong second quarter. At this point, I'm sure that you have had a chance to review our press release and earnings result for the second quarter. Net sales of $1.8 billion increased 3.3% on an organic basis, which excludes both currency headwinds and the results from North America tray and pads business, which was sold at the beginning of April in 2015. Adjusted gross margins were up 260 basis points compared to last year as a result of favorable price/mix, lower input cost and manufacturing improvements. Our adjusted EBITDA was a record of $308 million or 17.2% of net sales, an organic increase of 25%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 280 basis points, with both Food Care and Product Care delivering 20%-plus margins for the second consecutive quarter. And while Diversey Care was hit the hardest by currency, it delivered 12% adjusted EBITDA growth on a constant dollar basis.
Let me now turn to Slide 4, where we present our performance by region for the second quarter. On an organic basis, North America sales were up over 2% compared to last year. Food Care and Diversey Care were up approximately 4%. And in Product Care, North America declined approximately 2% as a result of rationalization efforts and weakness in the manufacturing and electronics sectors.
Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, was up 3% in constant dollars and down 15% on an as-reported basis as a result of currency devaluations. In constant dollars, Russia was our fastest-growing country with growth of 26%. Turkey was up 7%, Italy was up 6%, both Germany and Spain were up 4%, and France and Holland were flat to slightly up. Growth in these countries was offset a slight decline in the U.K. and in Switzerland, the 9 countries I just referenced accounting for approximately 24% of the second quarter consolidated sales.
In APAC, we delivered constant currency growth of 4% and a decline on 5% on an as-reported basis. And in constant dollars, Australia was up 6%, led by Food Care. India and Southeast Asia were up 8%, and New Zealand was up 2%. Constant dollar growth in Latin America was up 9 -- was 9%, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Mexico and Argentina, offset by a 3% decline in Brazil.
Let's now turn to Slide 5, and this highlights the results of our Food Care division. In the second quarter, Food Care sales increased 4.2% on an organic basis with growth across all the regions. Favorable price/mix was 2.7%, and volume was up 1.5%. We had favorable price/mix and positive volume trends in every region except Latin America, where volume was negatively impacted by the market conditions in Brazil. Net sales in constant dollars in Latin America were up 11%. APAC increased 5%. EMEA was up 2%. And on an organic basis, North America increased 4%. We delivered strong double-digit constant dollar sales growth in Russia, Argentina, Mexico; and mid- to high single-digit growth in Italy, Australia and New Zealand. We experienced constant dollar declines in France and Brazil, 2 countries that each account for 3% to 4% of our global Food Care sales. China, which is approximately 2% of our Food Care sales, was down 7% primarily due to weakness in our hygiene business.
In North America, cattle production was down 8%, which was offset by mid-single-digit growth in smoke and processed food and poultry. Fresh red meat is our largest market, and yet despite declines in the cattle market, we still delivered 4% organic growth in North America. Our fresh red meat business was up slightly, and we experienced strong growth in the poultry market. This performance was a result of continued adoption of our advanced product offering, and overall in North America, we had favorable price/mix and volume growth. For the remainder of the year, we expect continued decline in the beef market but at the decelerating rate that we have been experiencing over the last 9 to 12 months.
In Europe, we have seen a slight improvement in the protein market. The improved market conditions, coupled with the adoption of our new, very successful products, resulted in a 4.5% constant dollar growth rate in our European food packaging business. We are experiencing the increased demand for Darfresh On Tray and Optidur and have also been successful in our value-added selling approach.
Turning to Food Care's adjusted EBITDA performance. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $174 million, which is a 10% increase on an as-reported basis and a 27% increase on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.5% were up 410 basis points. This increase was largely a result of an improved mix of premium products, portfolio management, global pricing initiatives and cost synergies.
Within our European hygiene business, it is worth noting that we have seen a meaningful increase in our EBITDA margins as a result of our portfolio management efforts and pricing initiatives. As we head into the back half of the year, we expect further adoptions of our new products on a global basis and continue to focus on value-added selling. However, this will be partially offset by formula pricing in North America, currency headwinds and other external factors, including, for example, the fact that the slaughter rates in Australia are starting to decline and will further do that. Some of this extended focus also include economic challenges in Brazil and Venezuela and a slowdown in Australia, as I just mentioned.
We anticipate EBITDA growth in the second half of the year but not at the same rate experienced in the first half. And for the full year 2015, we are on track to deliver strong annual EBITDA growth and margin expansion.
Slide 6 highlights the result from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant currency basis were up 3.8% in the second quarter. Favorable price/mix was up 2.2%, and volume increased 1.6%. We delivered favorable price/mix and positive volume trends in all the regions. Our fastest-growing regions in the quarter were Latin America and North America, with constant daily sales growth of 9% and 5%, respectively. Asia Pacific was up 3.5%; and EMEA, over 2%. 
From an end-market perspective, we experienced increased demand in food service, hospitality and health care, and we also increased demand in our distribution channels. EMEA accounts for approximately 50% of our net sales, as you know. And among our largest markets throughout this region, we experienced high single-digit growth in Turkey; positive sales in France, Italy, Holland and Germany. Challenging economic condition and instability are slowing down Russian and local tourism in Turkey and Dubai. In addition, the ongoing economic crisis in Greece is also negatively impacting tourism, and this decline in tourism, which we are currently experiencing, will have an impact in the second half of the year in our hospitality market, especially in the third quarter. North American accounts for 30% of our net sales and delivered 5% constant dollar sales growth, with increasing demand from our hospitality and health care segments. In Asia Pacific, double-digit growth in India and Australia was partially offset by softness in China. Performance in Latin America was driven by growth in Argentina and Chile, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in Brazil.
Diversey Care delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of $69 million or 12.9% of net sales in the quarter. And as we anticipated, currency translation negatively impacted our performance in the quarter; and on a reported basis, adjusted EBITDA declined 5%. In constant dollars, however, adjusted EBITDA was up 12% compared to last year. This growth was driven by our success in our value-added selling approach, high volumes and cost synergies, partially offset by higher SG&A as we continue to heavily invest in sales and marketing and R&D to further support growth opportunities. For example, we're already seeing strong interest in our robotic floor care machines with our recent acquisition of Intellibot and are having many conversation with our customers around our Internet of Clean solutions. As a result, we are accelerating our investment in both equipment and data analytics into year-end. And despite these investments and currency headwinds, we are still on track to deliver EBITDA growth on a constant dollar basis and margin expansion for the full year.
Slide 7 highlights the results from our Product Care division. Net sales were essentially unchanged in constant dollars on a year-over-year basis. We had favorable price/mix of just over 1% on volumes that declined nearly 2%. Favorable price/mix continues to be driven by our pricing efforts across global -- both Global Performance Packaging and General Packaging. Second quarter volume was impacted, in fact, by rationalization efforts in Latin America and, to a lesser extent, also in North America. Our rationalization efforts are focused on our general packaging solutions and should be mostly behind us by mid-2016.
On a regional basis, North America net sales were down 1.6% in constant currency, while EMEA was up 3.6%. It is also worth noting that both China and Japan were up in the mid- to high single digits. Excluding rationalization efforts in North America, net sales would have been slightly up. And as I said earlier, in North America, we experienced market weakness in manufacturing and electronics, but that was -- this was offset by strength in e-commerce and third-party logistics. Our growth in EMEA was due to increased demand in our performing packaging solutions, particularly in Germany and in Spain, which is recovering now. On a global basis, we're seeing strong growth in both e-commerce and third-party logistics and are confident that this growth will continue for the foreseeable future given our global -- our product breadth, global reach and focused investment in performance-based packaging.
And let's now turn to adjusted EBITDA. Product Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $79 million, which is a 10% increase on an as-reported basis and an 18% increase in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.7% expanded 310 basis points compared to last year's results. This increase was a result of an increasing mix of Global Performance Packaging and pricing discipline. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued EBITDA growth and margin expansion as well.
And now let me pass the call to Carol to review our total net sales, adjusted EBITDA, cash flow and outlook. Carol?"

Turning to Slide 8. Let me walk you through our net sales performance on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.8 billion in sales, an increase of 3.3% on an organic basis. Favorable price/mix was 2.4% or $48 million, and volume was up 1% or $18 million. Unfavorable currency translation had an impact on net sales of $199 million or 10%, mostly due to the declines in the euro and Russian ruble. Net sales on an as-reported basis were down 9.6%.
Turning to Slide 9. You can see our adjusted EBITDA performance for the quarter and first half of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8.4%, as reported, to $308 million or 17.2% of net sales. For the total company, the increase in adjusted EBITDA was largely due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of $58 million. Cost synergies also made a positive contribution of $16 million in the quarter. The North America trays and pads divestiture had a $12 million negative comparison for adjusted EBITDA and unfavorable currency translation with $34 million. Despite currency headwinds, we still delivered a 260 basis point improvement in adjusted gross margin and a 280 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to last year. On an organic basis, our adjusted EBITDA increased 25% as compared to the 2014 results for the same period.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.60 as compared to $0.42 in the second quarter last year. Currency negatively impacted EPS by $0.09. The tax rate for the second quarter of 2015 was 29% as compared with 29.5% for the second quarter of 2014. In the first quarter of 2015, the tax rate was 25%, and we are still anticipating a 25% tax rate for the full year of 2015. The sequential increase from the first quarter was primarily due to higher taxable earnings in the U.S., which has one of our highest tax rates. For the full year, we expect to have higher earnings in some of our lower tax jurisdictions. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares for a total value of approximately $86 million. In the first half of 2015, we repurchased 3.2 million shares, and as of July 28, we have repurchased an additional 2.7 million shares, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to a total of 5.9 million shares.
Now turning to Slide 10. We outline our price/mix, volume trends and sales growth on a constant dollar basis by division and by region. As you can see from the slide, we had favorable price/mix in every division and in every region. Volume was up in Food Care and Diversey Care, and excluding rationalization efforts in Product Care, volume would have been up slightly. We delivered volume growth in all regions, except Latin America, which was impacted by the economic environment in Brazil, as Jerome previously referenced, and our rationalization efforts in Product Care. For the total company, we delivered 3.3% organic growth.
Turning to Slide 11. You can see free cash flow was a source of $171 million for the first 6 months of the year, excluding the $235 million tax refund received related to the Grace settlement. This compares favorably to a source of $119 million for the 6 months ending 2014 due to higher earnings and an improvement in operating working capital management. As many of you know, the company focuses its management of operating working capital on a 13-month average target. For the 13-month period ending June 30, 2015, the average for operating working capital as a percent of net sales was 16%. This represents a 250-basis-point improvement compared to June 30, 2014. CapEx was $58 million and cash restructuring costs were $45 million for the 6 months ending June 30, 2015.
Our updated outlook for 2015 is presented on Slide 12. We continue to expect net sales to be approximately $7.1 billion. Unfavorable currency is expected to be approximately 9% or $700 million. Also, as a reminder, the trays and pads business generated approximately $200 million in sales in 2014. This disposition did not qualify under the accounting rules for treatment as discontinued operations. Therefore, prior years in the first quarter of 2015 include the North America trays and pads business, but there is no benefit from this business going forward nor was there any in the second quarter of this year. Excluding the impact of the divestiture and currency headwinds, we continue to anticipate an organic growth rate of approximately 3%.
Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.16 billion to $1.17 billion, which compares to our previous guidance of $1.14 billion to $1.16 billion. This reflects our strong performance in the first half of the year. We will continue to face currency challenges as compared to last year. We are now estimating FX to have a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $110 million. 
We'd like you to keep in mind that in the third quarter of 2014, the euro was at $1.34; and in Q4 2014, the euro was at $1.26. Our forecast for the second half of the year assumes the euro at $1.10. Other currencies where we have exposure the include Russian ruble, the Brazilian real and Australian dollar.
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.24 to $2.28 as compared to 2014 adjusted earnings per share of $1.86. As a reminder, at our Analyst Day in June, we increased our EPS range by $0.03 to $2.11 to $2.18 to account for the interest savings related to our senior note refinancing. Our interest expense for 2015 will be $235 million, a $10 million reduction from the forecast we had provided earlier in the year. On an annualized basis, the senior note refinancing transaction will reduce our interest expense by $20 million. Constant currency earnings per share would be approximately $2.54 to $2.58 without the impact of currency. As I highlighted earlier, we repurchased a total of 5.9 million shares as of July 28, and we will continue to be active in our share repurchase program. Our earnings per share outlook for 2015 is based on 209 million shares outstanding for the balance of the year, which reflects the weighted average full year effect of all the share repurchase completed as of July 28.
We are revising our free cash flow guidance to $585 million from the previous $575 million to reflect the higher adjusted EBITDA forecast. Our free cash flow outlook also excludes the $235 million refund related to the Grace settlement, which I previously referenced. Cash interest payments are expected to be $230 million as compared to our previous forecast of $240 million; and cash tax payments are now estimated at $115 million. We are on track to invest $210 million in capital expenditures and are still anticipating $120 million in restructuring activity. We also continue to estimate approximately $50 million in cost synergies for 2015 from these restructuring efforts.
This concludes my prepared remarks, but before we open the call to questions, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday (sic) [ Tuesday ], October 27, at 10:00 a.m. Operator, can you please open the call for questions?"

We have had nice volume growth in an environment which is not necessarily very favorable. When you look at the overall market, you see that the red fresh meat market in the U.S. has been very depressed in the second quarter. I think I remember 8% reduction, which is one of the biggest negative percentages. We believe that the percentages of reduction are going to slowly taper down, but we haven't seen that yet. In Brazil, the situation is really bad. There are many slaughterhouses which have been closing. I think the number is 15. JBS has recently published that they have closed 5. And this is the result of drought, high prices of red meat at the cattle level, reducing purchasing Power. And you know that red meat is an expensive meat, and as a result, there's been transfers into poultry. So we have had negative volume in Brazil. For the rest of the year, we're going to see -- we're carefully optimistic, but the poultry market has been good for us and we expect that this is going to continue being good. Our EMEA business is actually pulled by new products. And Optidur, Darfresh On Tray are doing absolutely wonderful, and we're expecting those new products to continue pulling our business there. So we had positive growth not as much in the second quarter as we had in the first quarter and -- but we believe that it's going to be okay. Diversey has been improving its volume, and we had flat volume in Q1. We had definitely growth in Q2, and we're happy with what we're seeing here. So having said that, in Diversey, the comp in the third quarter is not going to be very favorable because we had strong TASKI sales in Q3 of last year."

The interesting thing is that we've got positive pricing. And we've got positive pricing in every single of our divisions, not as much as we got in the first quarter but we've got positive pricing. And that is important. That leads me to the second half and the resin prices. There have been attempts in North America to raise resin prices in July. It's not going through. And we'll see what August gives, but the volume overall is -- and the business is fairly weak in the polyethylene arena -- olefins arena globally. And we just don't believe at this point in time that there is going to be major price increases.

It happens that the export markets for Brazil, as an example, is fairly weak. And you have some major companies out of Brazil which have made comments recently, saying that not only the local market is very weak -- their local market is extremely weak for fresh red meat, but also the export market is fairly weak for them also. And yes, you're right that normally, a lower real should help, but it seems that the export markets are fairly weak. We look out to Australia. The slaughter rate of the herd has been double digit in the first quarter and is slightly coming down, and the reason is very normal. Those levels are completely unsustainable, completely unsustainable. And as a result of that, we are seeing a little bit less growth, very strong growth actually in Australia on our business, but a little bit less growth, not -- the first quarter was, if I remember well, double digit. And here, we are talking about a high single digit. With regards to currency in general, we had $57 million of negative EBITDA as a result of currency translation when you take first and second quarter combined. And we have said that we are seeing -- that we are forecasting $110 million. My view is that it's likely to be slightly higher than that because with all being very low with commodities, ag commodities, minerals being very low, countries like Brazil and so are going to be -- have seen the real and their local currency devalue compared to the dollar versus the dollar. And we might see further devaluations. I'm not going to anticipate too much, but this is why we need to be a little bit cautious because the real is -- was yesterday. I didn't check today, but it was at BRL 3.36. Well, BRL 3.36 versus a forecast of -- or versus what it was a year ago exactly at this time at about BRL 2.22, BRL 2.23 and versus the first -- second quarter this year at BRL 3.10. So we have to be careful there."

Could you provide a bit more color in terms of what initiatives are working? Are you getting any actual traction in terms of volumes from things like Internet of Clean and robotics? Or is that just increasing the interest?"

The Product Care in North America would have been up if we would exclude voluntary rationalization of our portfolio. You know that I am keen in margin expansion and the quality of business. And as a result of that, we are leading there and being very forceful. The other thing that we have done is that in Latin American countries, starting with Mexico, we had a commodity business which was really unprofitable. And therefore, we just weeded that out. Having said that, we would have seen higher growth in volume in North America should the electronic business be more positive. And actually, it's been fairly negative when you look at the computers consumption, when you look at the -- those kind of devices consumption. It's been fairly weak. On the positive, we're seeing a lot of momentum on 3PL and e-commerce. And we're introducing some very, very interesting solutions here, which make me very positive for the next 12 months. On Diversey, I'm pretty happy of what I'm seeing because the trend is a positive trend and we are having nice volume in every single region. So volume growth is accelerating. We're seeing -- we had a bad quarter for all kind of reasons. At the beginning of the year in Canada, we're seeing a strong volume growth there. We're seeing very nice in the U.S. EMEA is doing much better, and we're seeing volume growth there. And when I compare quarter 1 and quarter 2, I'm just seeing a trend. So it's -- these are not businesses which turn around very quickly because customer wins and the share at -- of wallet at the customer is coming -- is just a long-term process, but I'm positive. So coming to the Internet of Clean, et cetera, Internet of Clean was a Change the Game initiative that we talked to you during our Analyst Day. It's not -- these are not big products today. We are starting. We're having very interesting pilots with customers and things are moving favorably, but you're not going to see a huge swing all of a sudden out of it. Intellibot, I can't tell you how happy I am. I really am. We have seen a pickup in our machine ordering, a pickup in our sales, and we are investing a lot. We're going to lose money in 2015 out of these Intellibot operations because in fact, we are accelerating our R&D and our commitment to that. So actually, this is going to impact the second half of the year, but I just -- I'm very happy with that."

So we're just being very prudent in how we have structured the program so they can operate automatically when we have our blackout period and things like that. And we'll just continue to operate that way. So the market will determine whether that $1.5 billion in shares is used quicker or if it takes more time. That's really going to largely depend on a lot of the market dynamics. And with respect to the amortization, we are -- obviously, what you see with Diversey Care is the amortization of the intangibles. That was acquired through the Diversey acquisition. And we will see a decrease in that as we go forward. But, for example, if we look at amortization of intangibles for 2014, it was approximately $120 million. And for 2015, it's approximately $95 million. So we will continue to see that come down around that scale."

Our comments today will focus on the second quarter and our outlook. But before I get started, I want to briefly highlight significant events that have taken place in June and July.
First, let me highlight our Analyst Day that took place on June 18. For those of you who couldn't make it, if you haven't done so already, I would encourage you to visit our IR website, download the presentation and listen to the replay. To quickly recap, we outlined our financial and operational objectives for 2018 and our key targets for 2020. We discussed in detail how those objectives and targets will be achieved as we continue executing on our Get Fit and Change the Game strategy. We have executed on many Get Fit programs to date, but as we discussed at our Analyst Day, we still have more to be done. And we will stay focused on driving profitable growth and margin expansion opportunities. We clearly defined our Change the Game strategy and outlined the investments that we're making in new markets, new business models and disruptive innovation. You have all heard me say this before, but let me remind you that our Get Fit and Change the Game strategy is not a destination, it is a journey. And that journey is already transforming us into a knowledge-based company with unique know-how resolutely dedicated to making our customers win and sharing in the value being created.
Second, earlier in June, we completed the refinancing of our 2021 senior notes and issued new U.S. and euro senior notes as extended -- that extended maturities, increased covenant flexibility and reduced our annualized interest expense. With the completion of this transaction, we announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program on July 15, which reflects our commitment to return value to shareholders.
And with that, let me now turn to what I would qualify a very strong second quarter. At this point, I'm sure that you have had a chance to review our press release and earnings result for the second quarter. Net sales of $1.8 billion increased 3.3% on an organic basis, which excludes both currency headwinds and the results from North America tray and pads business, which was sold at the beginning of April in 2015. Adjusted gross margins were up 260 basis points compared to last year as a result of favorable price/mix, lower input costs and manufacturing improvements. Our adjusted EBITDA was a record of $308 million or 17.2% of net sales, an organic increase of 25%. Our adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 280 basis points with both Food Care and Product Care delivering 20%-plus margins for the second consecutive quarter. And while Diversey Care was hit the hardest by currency, it delivered 12% adjusted EBITDA growth on a constant dollar basis.
Let me now turn to Slide 4, where we present our performance by region for the second quarter. On an organic basis, North America sales were up over 2% compared to last year. Food Care and Diversey Care were up approximately 4%. And in Product Care, North America declined approximately 2% as a result of rationalization efforts and weakness in the manufacturing and electronic sectors.
Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, was up 3% in constant dollars and down 15% on an as-reported basis as a result of currency devaluations. In constant dollars, Russia was our fastest-growing country with growth of 26%. Turkey was up 7%, Italy was up 6%, both Germany and Spain were up 4%, and France and Holland were flat to slightly up. Growth in these countries was offset by a slight decline in the U.K. and in Switzerland. The 9 countries I just referenced accounting for approximately 24% of the second quarter consolidated sales.
In APAC, we delivered constant currency growth of 4% and a decline on 5% on an as-reported basis. And in constant dollars, Australia was up 6%, led by Food Care. India and Southeast Asia were up 8%, and New Zealand was up 2%. Constant dollar growth in Latin America was up 9 -- was 9%, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Mexico and Argentina, offset by a 3% decline in Brazil.
Let's now turn to Slide 5, and this highlights the results of our Food Care division. In the second quarter, Food Care sales increased 4.2% on an organic basis with growth across all the regions. Favorable price/mix was 2.7% and volume was up 1.5%. We had favorable price/mix and positive volume trends in every region except Latin America, where volume was negatively impacted by the market conditions in Brazil. Net sales in constant dollars in Latin America were up 11%. APAC increased 5%. EMEA was up 2%. And on an organic basis, North America increased 4%. We delivered strong double-digit constant dollar sales growth in Russia, Argentina, Mexico; and mid- to high single-digit growth in Italy, Australia and New Zealand. We experienced constant dollar declines in France and Brazil, 2 countries that each account for 3% to 4% of our global Food Care sales. China, which is approximately 2% of our Food Care sales, was down 7% primarily due to weakness in our hygiene business.
In North America, cattle production was down 8%, which was offset by mid-single-digit growth in smoked and processed food and poultry. Fresh red meat is our largest market, and yet despite declines in the cattle market, we still delivered 4% organic growth in North America. Our fresh red meat business was up slightly, and we experienced strong growth in the poultry market. This performance was a result of continued adoption of our advanced product offering, and overall in North America, we had favorable price/mix and volume growth. For the remainder of the year, we expect continuous decline in the beef market but at the decelerating rate than that we have been experiencing over the last 9 to 12 months.
In Europe, we have seen a slight improvement in the protein market. The improved market conditions, coupled with the adoption of our new very successful products, resulted in a 4.5% constant dollar growth rate in our European food packaging business. We are experiencing increased demand for Darfresh On Tray and Optidur and have also been successful in our value-added selling approach.
Turning to Food Care's adjusted EBITDA performance. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $174 million, which is a 10% increase on an as-reported basis and a 27% increase on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.5% were up 410 basis points. This increase was largely a result of an improved mix of premium products, portfolio management, global pricing initiatives and cost synergies.
Within our European hygiene business, it is worth noting that we have seen a meaningful increase in our EBITDA margins as a result of our portfolio management efforts and pricing initiatives. As we head into the back half of the year, we expect further adoptions of our new products on a global basis and continue to focus on value-added selling. However, this will be partially offset by formula pricing in North America, currency headwinds and other external factors, including, for example, the fact that the slaughter rates in Australia are starting to decline and will further do that. Some of this external focus also include economic challenges in Brazil and Venezuela and a slowdown in Australia, as I just mentioned. We anticipate EBITDA growth in the second half of the year, but not at the same rate experienced in the first half. And for the full year 2015, we are on track to deliver strong annual EBITDA growth and margin expansion.
Slide 6 highlights the result from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant currency basis were up 3.8% in the second quarter. Favorable price/mix was up 2.2% and volume increased 1.6%. We delivered favorable price/mix and positive volume trends in all the regions. Our fastest-growing regions in the quarter were Latin America and North America, with constant daily sales growth of 9% and 5%, respectively. Asia Pacific was up 3.5%; and EMEA, over 2%. 
From an end-market perspective, we experienced increased demand in food service, hospitality and health care, and we also increased demand in our distribution channels. EMEA accounts for approximately 50% of our net sales, as you know. And among our largest markets throughout this region, we experienced high single-digit growth in Turkey; positive sales in France, Italy, Holland and Germany. Challenging economic condition and instability are slowing down Russian and local tourism in Turkey and Dubai. In addition, the ongoing economic crisis in Greece is also negatively impacting tourism, and this decline in tourism, which we are currently experiencing, will have an impact in the second half of the year in our hospitality market, especially in the third quarter. North American accounts for 30% of our net sales and delivered 5% constant dollar sales growth, with increasing demand from our hospitality and health care segments. In Asia Pacific, double-digit growth in India and Australia was partially offset by softness in China. Performance in Latin America was driven by growth in Argentina and Chile, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in Brazil.
Diversey Care delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of $69 million or 12.9% of net sales in the quarter. And as we anticipate, currency translation negatively impacted our performance in the quarter. And on a reported basis, adjusted EBITDA declined 5%. In constant dollars, however, adjusted EBITDA was up 12% compared to last year. This growth was driven by our success in our value-added selling approach, high volumes and cost synergies, partially offset by higher SG&A as we continue to heavily invest in sales and marketing and R&D to further support growth opportunities. For example, we're already seeing strong interest in our robotic floor care machines with our recent acquisition of Intellibot and are having many conversation with our customers around our Internet of Clean solutions. As a result, we are accelerating our investment in both equipment and data analytics into year-end. And despite these investments and currency headwinds, we’re still on track to deliver EBITDA growth on a constant dollar basis and margin expansion for the full year.
Slide 7 highlights the results from our Product Care division. Net sales were essentially unchanged in constant dollars on a year-over-year basis. We had favorable price/mix of just over 1% on volumes that declined nearly 2%. Favorable price/mix continues to be driven by our pricing efforts across global -- both Global Performance Packaging and General Packaging. Second quarter volume was impacted, in fact, by rationalization efforts in Latin America and, to a lesser extent, also in North America. Our rationalization efforts are focused on our general packaging solutions and should be mostly behind us by mid-2016.
On a regional basis, North America net sales were down 1.6% in constant currency, while EMEA was up 3.6%. It is also worth noting that both China and Japan were up in the mid- to high single digits. Excluding rationalization efforts in North America, net sales would have been slightly up. And as I said earlier, in North America, we experienced market weakness in manufacturing and electronics, but that was -- this was offset by strength in e-commerce and third-party logistics. Our growth in EMEA was due to increased demand in our performing packaging solutions, particularly in Germany and in Spain, which is recovering now. On a global basis, we're seeing strong growth in both e-commerce and third-party logistics and are confident that this growth will continue for the foreseeable future given our global -- our product breadth, global reach and focused investment in performance-based packaging.
And let's now turn to adjusted EBITDA. Product Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $79 million, which is a 10% increase on an as-reported basis and an 18% increase in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.7% expanded 310 basis points compared to last year's results. This increase was a result of an increasing mix of Global Performance Packaging and pricing discipline. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued EBITDA growth and margin expansion as well.
And now let me pass the call to Carol to review our total net sales, adjusted EBITDA, cash flow and outlook. Carol?"

Let me walk you through our net sales performance on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.8 billion in sales, an increase of 3.3% on an organic basis.

We delivered $1.8 billion in sales, an increase of 3.3% on an organic basis. Favorable price/mix was 2.4% or $48 million, and volume was up 1% or $18 million. Unfavorable currency translation had an impact on net sales of $199 million or 10%, mostly due to the declines in the euro and Russian ruble. Net sales on an as-reported basis were down 9.6%.
Turning to Slide 9. You can see our adjusted EBITDA performance for the quarter and first half of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8.4%, as reported, to $308 million or 17.2% of net sales. For the total company, the increase in adjusted EBITDA was largely due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of $58 million. Cost synergies also made a positive contribution of $16 million in the quarter. The North America trays and pads divestiture had a $12 million negative comparison for adjusted EBITDA and unfavorable currency translation was $34 million. Despite currency headwind, we still delivered a 260 basis point improvement in adjusted gross margin and a 280 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to last year. On an organic basis, our adjusted EBITDA increased 25% as compared to the 2014 results for the same period. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.60 as compared to $0.42 in the second quarter last year. 
Currency negatively impacted EPS by $0.09. The tax rate for the second quarter of 2015 was 29% as compared with 29.5% for the second quarter 2014. In the first quarter 2015, the tax rate was 25%, and we are still anticipating a 25% tax rate for the full year of 2015. The sequential increase from the first quarter was primarily due to higher taxable earnings in the U.S., which has one of our highest tax rates. For the full year, we expect to have higher earnings in some of our lower tax jurisdictions. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares for a total value of approximately $86 million. In the first half of 2015, we repurchased 3.2 million shares. And as of July 28, we have repurchased an additional 2.7 million shares, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to a total of 5.9 million shares.
Now turning to Slide 10. We outline our price/mix, volume trends and sales growth on a constant dollar basis by division and by region. As you can see from the slide, we had favorable price/mix in every division and in every region. Volume was up in Food Care and Diversey Care and, excluding rationalization effort in Product Care, volume would have been up slightly. We delivered volume growth in all regions, except Latin America, which was impacted by the economic environment in Brazil, as Jerome previously referenced, and our rationalization effort in Product Care. For the total company, we delivered 3.3% organic growth.
Turning to Slide 11. You can see free cash flow was a source of $171 million for the first 6 months of the year, excluding the $235 million tax refund received related to the Grace settlement. This compares favorably to a source of $119 million for the 6 months ending 2014 due to higher earnings and an improvement in operating working capital management. As many of you know, the company focuses its management of operating working capital on a 13-month average target. For the 13-month period ending June 30, 2015, the average for operating working capital as a percent of net sales was 16%. This represents a 250 basis point improvement compared to June 30, 2014. CapEx was $58 million and cash restructuring costs were $45 million for the 6 months ending June 30, 2015.
Our updated outlook for 2015 is presented on Slide 12. We continue to expect net sales to be approximately $7.1 billion. Unfavorable currency is expected to be approximately 9% or $700 million. Also, as a reminder, the trays and pads business generated approximately $200 million in sales in 2014. This disposition did not qualify under the accounting rules for treatment as discontinued operations. Therefore, prior years and the first quarter of 2015 include the North America trays and pads business, but there is no benefit from this business going forward nor was there any in the second quarter of this year. Excluding the impact of the divestiture and currency headwinds, we continue to anticipate an organic growth rate of approximately 3%.
Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.16 billion to $1.17 billion, which compares to our previous guidance of $1.14 billion to $1.16 billion. This reflects our strong performance in the first half of the year. We will continue to face currency challenges as compared to last year. We are now estimating FX to have a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $110 million. We want you to keep in mind that in the third quarter of 2014, the euro was at $1.34 and in Q4 2014, the euro was at $1.26. Our forecast for the second half of the year assumes the euro at $1.10. Other currencies where we have exposure includes Russian ruble, the Brazilian real and Australian dollar.
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.24 to $2.28 as compared to 2014 adjusted earnings per share of $1.86. As a reminder, at our Analyst Day in June, we increased our EPS range by $0.03 to $2.11 to $2.18 to account for the interest savings related to our senior note refinancing. Our interest expense for 2015 will be $235 million, a $10 million reduction from the forecast we had provided earlier in the year. On an annualized basis, the senior note refinancing transaction will reduce our interest expense by $20 million. Constant currency earnings per share would be approximately $2.54 to $2.58 without the impact of currency. As I highlighted earlier, we repurchased a total of 5.9 million shares as of July 28, and we will continue to be active in our share repurchase program. Our earnings per share outlook for 2015 is based on 209 million shares outstanding for the balance of the year, which reflects the weighted average full year effect of all the share repurchase completed as of July 28.
We are revising our free cash flow guidance to $585 million from the previous $575 million to reflect the higher adjusted EBITDA forecast. Our free cash flow outlook also excludes the $235 million refund related to the Grace settlement, which I previously referenced. Cash interest payments are expected to be $230 million as compared to our previous forecast of $240 million and cash tax payments are now estimated at $115 million. We are on track to invest $210 million in capital expenditures and are still anticipating $120 million in restructuring activity. We also continue to estimate approximately $50 million in cost synergies for 2015 from these restructuring efforts.
This concludes my prepared remarks. But before we open the call to questions, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday (sic) [ Tuesday ], October 27, at 10 a.m. Operator, can you please open the call for questions?"

We have had nice volume growth in an environment which is not necessarily very favorable. When you look at the overall market, you see that the red fresh meat market in the U.S. has been very depressed in the second quarter. I think I remember 8% reduction, which is one of the biggest negative percentages. We believe that the percentages of reduction are going to slowly taper down, but we haven't seen that yet. In Brazil, the situation is really bad. There are many slaughterhouses which have been closing. I think the number is 15. JBS has recently published that they have closed 5. And this is the result of drought, high prices of red meat at the cattle level, reducing purchasing power. And you know that red meat is an expensive meat, and as a result, there's been transfers into poultry. So we have had negative volume in Brazil. For the rest of the year, we’re going to see -- we're carefully optimistic, but the poultry market has been good for us and we expect that it is going to continue being good. Our EMEA business is actually pulled by new products. And Optidur, Darfresh On Tray are doing absolutely wonderful, and we're expecting those new products to continue pulling our business there. So we had positive growth not as much in the second quarter as we had in the first quarter and -- but we believe that it's going to be okay. Diversey has been improving its volume, and we had flat volume in Q1. We had definitely growth in Q2, and we're happy with what we're seeing here. So having said that, in Diversey, the comp in third quarter is not going to be very favorable because we had strong TASKI sales in Q3 of last year."

The interesting thing is that we've got positive pricing. And we've got positive pricing in every single of our divisions, not as much as we got in the first quarter, but we've got positive pricing. And that is important. That leads me to the second half and the resin prices. There have been attempts in North America to raise resin prices in July. It's not going through. And we'll see what August gives. But the volume overall is -- and the business is fairly weak in the polyethylene arena -- olefins arena globally. And we just don't believe at this point in time that there’s going to be major price increases.

It happens that the export markets for Brazil, as an example, is fairly weak. And you have some major companies out of Brazil, which I have made comments recently saying that not only the local market is very weak -- their local market is extremely weak for fresh red meat, but also the export market is fairly weak for them also. And yes, you're right that normally a lower real should help, but it seems that the export markets are fairly weak. With regards to Australia, the slaughter rates of the herd has been double digit in the first quarter and is slightly coming down, and the reason is very normal. Those levels are completely unsustainable, completely unsustainable. And as a result of that, we are seeing a little bit less growth, very strong growth actually in Australia on our business, but a little bit less growth, not -- the first quarter was, if I remember well, double digit. And here, we are talking about a high single digit. With regards to currency in general, we had $57 million of negative EBITDA as a result of currency translation when you take first and second quarter combined. And we have said that we are seeing -- that we are forecasting $110 million. My view is that it's likely to be slightly higher than that because with oil being very low with commodities, ag commodities, minerals being very low, countries like Brazil and so are going to be -- have seen the real and their local currency devalue compared to the dollar -- versus the dollar. And we might see further devaluations. I'm not going to anticipate too much, but this is why we need to be a little bit cautious because the real is -- was yesterday, I didn't check today, but it was at BRL 3.36. Well, BRL 3.36 versus a forecast of -- or versus what it was a year ago exactly at this time at about BRL 2.22, BRL 2.23 and versus the first -- second quarter this year at BRL 3.10.

You know that I am keen in margin expansion and the quality of business.",444,"Okay. Good to hear from you, George. The -- good question again. The Product Care in North America would have been up if we would exclude voluntary rationalization of our portfolio. You know that I am keen in margin expansion and the quality of business. And as a result of that, we are leading there and being very forceful. The other thing that we have done is that in Latin American countries, starting with Mexico, we had a commodity business which was really unprofitable. And therefore, we just weeded that out. Having said that, we would have seen higher growth in volume in North America should the electronic business be more positive. And actually, it's been fairly negative when you look at the computers consumption, when you look at the -- those kinds of devices consumption. It's been fairly weak. On the positive, we're seeing a lot of momentum in 3PL and e-commerce, and we're introducing some very, very interesting solutions here, which make me very positive for the next 12 months. On Diversey, I'm pretty happy of what I'm seeing because the trend is a positive trend and we having nice volume in every single region. So volume growth is accelerating. We're seeing -- we had a bad quarter for all kind of reasons. At the beginning of the year in Canada, we're seeing a strong volume growth there. We're seeing very nice in the U.S. EMEA is doing much better, and we're seeing volume growth there. And when I compare quarter 1 and quarter 2, I'm just seeing a trend. So it's -- these are not businesses which turn around very quickly because customer wins and the share at -- of wallet at the customer is coming -- is just a long-term process, but I'm positive. So coming to the Internet of Clean, et cetera, Internet of Clean was a Change the Game initiative that we talked to you during our Analyst Day. It's not -- these are not big products today. We are starting, we having very interesting pilots with customers and things are moving favorably, but you're not going to see a huge swing all of a sudden out of this. Intellibot, I can't tell you how happy I am. I really am. We have seen a pickup in our machine ordering, a pickup in our sales, and we are investing a lot. We're going to lose money in 2015 out of these Intellibot operations because in fact we are accelerating our R&D and our commitment to that. So actually, this is going to impact the second half of the year, but I just -- I'm very happy with that."

And we'll just continue to operate that way. So the market will determine whether that $1.5 billion in shares is used quicker or if it takes more time. That's really going to largely depend on a lot of the market dynamics. And with respect to the amortization, we are -- obviously, what you see with Diversey Care is the amortization of the intangibles that was acquired through the Diversey acquisition. And we will see a decrease in that as we go forward. But for example, if we look at the amortization of intangibles for 2014, it was approximately $120 million. And for 2015, it's approximately $95 million. So we will continue to see that come down around that scale."

I'm sure that you have had the chance to review our press release and earnings results for the third quarter, and I'm very pleased with our performance across all divisions, despite the significant currency headwinds and slowdown in emerging markets. 
Net sales of $1.75 billion increased 2.7% on an organic basis, which excludes both FX and the impacts from the North American trade impact divestiture. We experienced organic or constant dollar sales growth in each of our regions in both Food Care and Diversey Care. Adjusted EBITDA was $300 million or 72 -- 17.2% of net sales, essentially unchanged on an as reported dollar basis and an increase of approximately 16% in an organic basis. We delivered 190 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, with improvements across each of our 3 divisions, and free cash flow for the first 9 months of the year was $331 million and as we head into year-end, we will continue to focus on growth opportunities within our divisions and regions, while at the same time, stay very disciplined on our pricing strategies and cost management to offset currency headwinds. 
Before I pass the call on to Carol and Karl Deily, President of Food Care, for more details on the quarter and outlook, I want to briefly highlight a few items. 
As we have communicated many times, we are very committed to a disciplined approach to portfolio management with a focus on innovation and becoming the knowledge-based company. To further solidify our position in the growing e-commerce market, we acquired B+ Equipment in early August, a startup company headquartered in France that designs, manufactures and services revolutionary automated packaging systems for order fulfillment operations. With this acquisition, we will add B+ flagship I-Pack system and its recently introduced e-cube system to our industry-leading portfolio of packaging solutions focused on cube optimization and fulfillment velocity. 
More recently, we completed the sale of our European trades business, a noncore asset within our Food Care division. Similar to our comments around the North American trade and parts business, the European trades business have commoditized and was also facing competitive pricing pressure. This business generated $71 million in sales in 2014 and $44 million in the first 9 months of 2015. 
With that, let's get started with an overview of our financial results. Carol?"

On Slide 4, we present our performance by region for the third quarter. Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, was our fastest growing region with 4% constant dollar growth. Latin America and Asia-Pacific both delivered 3% growth and on an organic basis, North America was up just over 1%. In EMEA, we continue to see strong constant dollar growth in Russia and Turkey with 39% and 10% growth, respectively. In Western Europe, we delivered 7% growth in Spain and approximately 3% to 4% growth in Italy and Holland. France, Germany and the U.K. were flat compared to last year. These 8 countries in our EMEA region account for approximately 23% of our total net sales. In Latin America, we had strong constant dollar performance in Mexico and Argentina with 17% growth and nearly 30% growth, respectively. These growth trends were offset by expected weakness in Brazil, which declined 7%, as well as the region being impacted by the collapse of Venezuela. Asia-Pacific was led by 6% growth in Australia and 3% growth in New Zealand. As we anticipated, China, which accounts for approximately 3% of net total sales, was soft and declined by 1%. In North America, Diversey Care delivered 8% growth, followed by 2% growth in Food Care and a decline of 4% in Product Care. In Diversey Care, more than 4% of the growth in the quarter was due to increased demand, while the remaining growth came from sales into our distribution channel, which we believe to be a partial pull forward from the fourth quarter. In Product Care, sales were impacted primarily from our rationalization efforts and pockets of weakness throughout the industrial sectors. 
Turning to Slide 5, let me walk you through our net sales bridge for the quarter. Favorable price/mix was 2.1% or $42 million on volumes that were up $11 million. Unfavorable currency translation had an impact on net sales of $230 million or 12%, mostly due to year-over-year decline in the euro, Australian dollar, Brazilian reais, Russian ruble and the Canadian dollar. Net sales on an organic basis were up 2.7% and on an as-reported basis, net sales declined 11.6%. 
On Slide 6, we outline our price/mix, volume and sales trends on a constant dollar and organic basis. As you can see from the slide, we have favorable price/mix in every division and in every region. Volume trends were up nicely in Diversey Care and essentially flat in Food Care. Excluding rationalization efforts in Product Care, volumes would have also been flat as compared to last year's performance. By region, volume was up in EMEA and Asia-Pacific, flat in North America and down nearly 9% in Latin America. 
On Slide 7, you can see our adjusted EBITDA performance for the quarter and first 9 months of the year. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $300 million or 17.2% of net sales was essentially unchanged on an as-reported basis compared to our performance in the third quarter of 2014. However, excluding $39 million in unfavorable currency and the impact from the divestiture, adjusted EBITDA increased 15.6%. This increase was largely due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of $36 million and cost synergies of $11 million. We are pleased to have delivered 190 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to last year, despite unfavorable currency and the impact of the divestiture. Karl will highlight the adjusted EBITDA performance by division, but I want to mention that our medical business had a strong performance in the quarter and was the primary driver behind the year-over-year improvement in the net expense of medical and corporate, which is categorized as other in our adjusted EBITDA financial table. For the full year, we now expect medical and corporate to be a net expense of approximately $70 million. Adjusted net earnings of $143 million or $0.70 per share compares to adjusted net earnings of $112 million or $0.53 in the third quarter last year. Currency negatively impacted adjusted EPS in the third quarter 2015 by $0.12. Unfavorable FX was offset by higher earnings from operations, lower interest expense, a lower core tax rates and share repurchases. The core tax rate for Q3 2015 was 18.8% as compared with 28% for Q3 2014, which, on a year-over-year basis, positively impacted 2015 adjusted EPS in the third quarter by $0.08. The lower core tax rate in the quarter was related to the recording of net foreign tax credit. Year-to-date, our core tax rate was 24.3% and we still anticipate our full year tax rate to be approximately 25%. On an as-reported basis, net earnings in the third quarter were $87 million or $0.42 per share. Net earnings include $57 million of special items, primarily consisting of restructuring and other associated costs, as well as a tax reserve recorded in relation to the $235 million tax refund we received earlier in the year. The net tax reserve recorded in the quarter was $16 million, which reflects the tax reserve on the refund, offset by the release of certain tax reserves recorded at the time of the Diversey Care acquisition. In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 11.3 million shares for a total value of approximately $576 million using a combination of open market and ASR.

So let's turn our attention to Slide 8, which highlights results from our Food Care division. In the third quarter, Food Care sales increased 3.1% on an organic basis with growth across all regions. Favorable price/mix was 2.8% on essentially flat volumes. We had favorable price/mix trends and more importantly, positive volume trends in every region, except Latin America, where volume was negatively impacted by general political and economic conditions in Brazil and Venezuela. Excluding Latin America, volume would have been up approximately 2% to 3% globally. Our results in price/mix demonstrate our global pricing disciplines, as well as our success managing pricing in countries where currency devaluations have occurred. Europe, Middle East, Africa, or EMEA, delivered 5% constant dollar growth. Russia continues to be our fastest growing country due to the strength of penetration of the protein markets, as well as adoption of our advanced packaging solutions. Our business in Western Europe is benefiting from a slowly recovering economy where demand for beef is increasing. In addition, we are experiencing strong acceptance of our new products, particularly our Darfresh On Tray and some of our new advanced ready meal solutions. In Latin America, sales were up 3.4% in constant dollars. Double-digit constant dollar growth in Mexico and Argentina more than offset expected weaknesses in Brazil and Venezuela. In Brazil, our business is being negatively impacted by the decline in local beef consumption due to the economic environment, the decline in the export market and the fact that cattle producers have recently started to rebuild their herds in light of the current market conditions. Also, the sociopolitical factors in Venezuela are having a very significant impact on our business. Despite these short-term challenges, we strongly believe that over the long term, Latin America and specifically, Brazil, where the herd sizes double the size of North America, is a solid growth opportunity for Food Care. Asia-Pacific was up 4% in constant dollars as a result of 6% growth in Australia and 5% growth in New Zealand. Since the second quarter of 2014, on average, we have been experiencing high single-digit growth in Australia where slaughter rates have been at unsustainably high levels. As we previously indicated, we are now seeing the Australian cattle producers start to rebuild their herds after nearly 3 years of drought induced liquidation. Consequently, we're planning for weaker sales trends in Australia in the upcoming quarters. In New Zealand, we have been experiencing above market growth. However, we believe this growth is not sustainable due to the impact of the depressed global dairy markets. In North America, despite continued mid-single digit declines in the cattle market, we delivered 2% organic sales growth, with nearly 1% volume growth in favorable price/mix. This quarter, our growth in North America was predominantly driven by strength in poultry, smoked and processed meats and fluid-based packaging as a result of a very strong tomato season in California. Fresh red meat was relatively flat due to continued adoptions of our advanced product portfolio. It's worth noting that the broad [indiscernible] to these new products is driving our above market growth in North America. I also want to mention that cattle producers continue to rebuild their herds as evidenced by the continued [indiscernible] retention. While we continue to anticipate the cattle market to both be weak in quarter 4 and the first half of 2016, there is a strong indication that the cycle is on track to turn positive in mid-2016. Our global hygiene business delivered solid growth in APAC and EMEA with improved profitability. This growth was partially offset by weaknesses in Latin American market. 
Turning to Food Care's adjusted EBITDA performance. Food Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $168 million, a 7% increase on an as-reported basis and a 10% increase on an organic basis. Currency and the divestiture had a $30 million unfavorable impact on adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Margins of 20.1% were up 170 basis points, largely due to improved mix of our premium products, global pricing disciplines and lower input costs. These were partially offset by transactional let backs and the divestiture. As we head into year-end, we expect further adoption of our new products on a global basis and we will continue on focusing on adding value added selling to our customers. However, this will be partially offset by negative formula pricing, particularly in North America, currency headwinds and other external factors. Some of these external factors include ongoing economic challenges in Brazil, Venezuela and the slowdown in Australia, where slaughter rates have been at unsustainable levels. In quarter 4, as reported, adjusted EBITDA in absolute dollars will be down on a year-over-year basis. However, adjusted EBITDA on an organic basis, which excludes FX and the divestiture, is expected to increase in the high single digits. Given our performance year-to-date and the outlook for quarter 4, we are clearly on track to deliver a strong EBITDA growth and margin expansion for the full year 2015. 
So I'd like to turn our attention now to Slide 9, which highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were up approximately 4% in the third quarter. Volume increased 2.5%, with favorable trends in every region, except for Latin America, where volume was negatively impacted by weakness in Brazil. Price/mix was favorable 1.4%, primarily driven by pricing initiatives. As Carol indicated earlier, our strongest region in Diversey Care was North America. Our recent customer wins are ramping up nicely and we're continuing to see solid growth in our infection, prevention solutions. We also had a strong performance in EMEA and APAC, with constant dollar sales growth of 3% in the quarter. EMEA accounts for approximately 50% of our net sales. We have made significant progress and are seeing stabilizing trends throughout our largest markets in Western Europe. Among our largest customers in EMEA, we are experiencing double-digit growth in Turkey and positive sales in France, Italy, Holland, Germany and Spain. In APAC, we experienced high single-digit growth in India and a slight uptick in China, while all other emerging markets declined. Latin America sales on a constant dollar basis were essentially unchanged compared to last year's performance. For the second consecutive quarter, performance in Latin America was driven by growth in Argentina and Chile, partially offset by a high single-digit decline in Brazil. Strength in Argentina and Chile is a result of recent customer wins, growth and equipment sales and increased volume from our distribution partners. 
On the new product front and solutions front, we launched the sure product line, which is a vegetable-based formula, which is 100% biodegradable and requires no classifications from a regulatory standpoint. We highlighted this at our Analyst Day and we are excited to have it commercially available in the market. Diversey Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $66 million or 13.2% of net sales in the quarter. Currency translation negatively impacted our performance in the quarter and on a reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA declined 5%. In constant dollars, however, adjusted EBITDA was up 12% compared to last year. This growth was driven by higher volumes, cost synergies, lower SG&A, partially offset by the impact of transactional FX, the Intellibot acquisition and the significant deterioration of the economic conditions in Venezuela and Brazil. In quarter 4, we expect continued organic growth in sales and adjusted EBITDA, but to a lesser extent as compared to quarter 3. 
Now let's look at Slide 10, which highlights the results of our Product Care division. Net sales were down 1.7% on a constant dollar basis, with volume declines of 2.5%, more than offsetting favorable price/mix of 0.8%. Third quarter volume was impacted by rationalization efforts in Latin America and to a lesser extent, North America. Our rationalization efforts are focused on our global packaging solutions and should be mostly behind us by mid-2016. As Carol highlighted earlier, volume was also impacted by weakness in the industrial sectors in North America. Favorable price/mix continues to be driven by our pricing disciplines across both the global packaging, performance packaging and general packaging sectors. On a regional basis, North America net sales were down nearly 4% in constant dollars, of which half of the decline is attributable to rationalization. Unfavorable trends in the industrial sector, particularly manufacturing and transportation, were partially offset by double-digit growth in e-commerce and third-party logistics. We expect strength in e-commerce and 3PLs to continue into year-end, which will help offset rationalization and the softer trends in the industrial market. EMEA was up approximately 3% due to increased demand in France and Italy and it's worth noting that China was up 4%. Performance in China reflects our new leadership in APAC and our renewed targeted efforts to increase market penetration. We are seeing strong interest across the globe in our newly-acquired B+ portfolio, and we are excited to have the team on board. Both B+ and our recently introduced automatic mailer, or flow wrap, are designed to deliver cube optimization and efficiency savings for the rapidly growing e-commerce and fulfillment markets. The flow wrap solution, which is specifically designed for the e-commerce apparel market, is further evidenced of our robust development pipeline of automated solutions. 
Let's turn to adjusted EBITDA. Product Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $81 million, a 9% increase on an as-reported basis and a 16% in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margin of [indiscernible] expanded 340 basis points compared to last year's results. This increase was a result of pricing disciplines associated with our value selling initiatives and increase of our mix of our global performance packaging solutions and lower input costs. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued EBITDA growth and margin expansion. 
Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our cash flow and our outlook. Carol?"

Turning to Slide 11, free cash flow was a source of $331 million for the first 9 months of the year, excluding the $235 million tax refund. This compares to a source of $371 million for the 9 months ending 2014. The year-over-year decline was primarily attributable to less cash generated from working capital, the payment of 2014 bonuses and unfavorable currency. CapEx was $112 million and cash restructuring costs were $72 million for the 9 months ending September 30, 2015. 
Our updated outlook for 2015 is presented on Slide 12. We now expect net sales to be approximately $7 billion. Unfavorable currency is expected to be approximately 10% or $800 million. Excluding the impact of the North America trades and past divestiture and currency, we anticipate an organic growth rate of approximately 3%. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2015 is now expected to be approximately $1.165 billion, which is in the midpoint of our previously provided guidance. This reflects our strong performance in the first 9 months of 2015 and our outlook into year-end. We will continue to face currency challenges and are estimating FX to how more negative impact on full year adjusted EBITDA of approximately $125 million. Keep in mind that in Q3 2014, the euro was at 1.34 and in Q4 2014, the euro was at 1.26. Our year-end forecast assumes that in Q4 2015, the euro remains in line with the Q3 rate of approximately 1.10. Other currencies that have experienced devaluation in recent months and as compared to last year, last year's rates, includes the Russian ruble, the Brazilian reais, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our interest expense for 2015 is estimated at $235 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $290 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.32. The adjusted EPS impact from currency is expected to be approximately $0.36. Our previous guidance for adjusted EPS in 2015 was in the range of $2.24 to $2.28. In 2014, we reported adjusted EPS of $1.86. As I highlighted earlier, we have repurchased a total of 14.5 million shares year-to-date. Our adjusted EPS outlook for 2015 is based on 207 million shares, which reflects the weighted average fully year effect of the share repurchases completed year-to-date. Please note that the divestiture of the European trays business is expected to close in early November. For now, the full year financial estimate for this business are included in our 2015 outlook. Full year 2015 sales from the European trays are expected to be approximately $55 million. Similar to the North America trays and pads business, this disposition does not qualify for discontinued operations. Therefore, prior year in the first 10 months of 2015 financials will include results from our European trays business. We are revising our free cash flow guidance to $560 million from $585 million. Our free cash flow outlook excludes the $235 million tax refund. Cash interest payments are expected to be $230 million and cash tax payments are estimated at $110 million. We are lowering our capital expenditures from $210 million to $190 million, and our cash restructuring payments from $120 million to $110 million. Working capital will still be a source of cash, but not at the level we had originally anticipated, largely due to proactive inventory management. We are maintaining higher then originally anticipated inventory levels into year-end to support on-time delivery for our customers in order to meet their service requirements. 
In closing, we have made significant progress in 2015 and we will continue to focus on operational improvements into [indiscernible] to mitigate FX and pockets of economic weakness. When we look beyond 2015, our focus is on new product introductions and investing in innovative technologies that will drive sustainable and profitable growth.

As we noted -- and we have broken out the EBITDA for the North America trays and pads business that was sold at the beginning of Q2 2015, that's broken out in our bridge. You can see that within the Food Care EBITDA bridge. The European business had a similar margin, but what's important to note, as we highlighted and Karl's commented as well, that business have been -- was deteriorating, becoming commoditized by North America and Europe and Europe, even more so, so the margins were quickly headed below 10%, as well as the product not meeting some of our sustainability requirements.

I guess it's not really that we have been too aggressive in reducing inventory. An important piece of the build that we think we need to do or really not build, but maintaining into Q4, is because we do have a go live for SAP within our Diversey Care business in North America. And the anyone who has been through an SAP implementation and go live will know that it's very prudent to make sure you maintain appropriate inventory levels. It's a great enterprise platform that we'll get a lot of benefit out of that we want to make sure we're cautious and conservative and can meet all of our customer expectations. So that's one of the key drivers and we've just taken that decision as we head towards the end of the year, with that early Q1 go live. In terms of thinking about color for 2016, we do expect to have a positive impact from working capital and to be a source of cash in 2016. However, it's important to note, when Jerome and I and the rest of the management team really started focusing on working capital beginning in 2013, there were some obvious things we could do that would accrue to our benefit from a cash flow standpoint quicker. As we're moving forward, there's less of those obvious steps to take and the move towards the day in, day out proper management of working capital to sustain the business. We anticipate growth going forward into 2016, and as such, that will impact working capital. But again, that bottom line, we will expect to see positive source of cash for working capital. If we think about EBITDA for 2016, we're still focusing extremely on profitable growth, driving towards our 2018 target of 18% margin that we shared at the Analyst Day in June. Our CapEx for 2016 is still estimated at $275 million. Restructuring, excluding the CapEx restructuring, which is included in the $275 million I shared, is still estimated $110 million to $120 million for 2016."

With respect to the Diversey Care, I guess, for that, when we look at the cost synergies, I mean, that's the $5 million positive that's ongoing benefit that has helped the business in the quarter. With respect to mix and price/cost spreads, we do have a meaningful impact from transactional FX that hits Diversey because of different imports of products based on where the demands at. We have a particularly negative impact in the U.K. for their business and all driven largely because of transactional FX. So we're not seeing anything that's concerning from a deterioration and margin driven by mix.

We raised that guidance in July. We then in September, at Jones Crédit Suisse conference. We said, watch it. There's an additional headwind of $15 million of currency and it's going to be really hard to mitigate it. And what are we doing today? We're confirming the July guidance. So I take this as a third time we're increasing -- as the second time we're increasing our guidance, and I'm very pleased with what's going on in an environment, which, in emerging countries, because of commodity pricing, at commodities or mineral pricing, and because of oil and gas prices, et cetera, certainly, in all -- in many emerging countries, but including Australia, Canada, et cetera, are countries where the environment is not easy. And remember that in that environment, we have -- we are increasing our EBITDA and at the very same time, we are suffering, in Q3 only, $236 million of transactions in sales and $39 million of EBITDA. So that context is making things good. Your point is very good, which is, we haven't gotten very much volume growth, but we had given a guidance for the next 3 years at having a 4% to 5% growth. And I firmly believe we're going to have that. And it's going to be less on pricing, more on volume. And yes, mix is helping. Thanks to our innovation products, every single division has -- is extremely excited about all of it. You should have gone, I don't know if you have, but you should have gone to Pack Expo where we were having a huge booth which was packed like no tomorrow in Las Vegas a few weeks ago. You should have gone to the ISSA where we got lots of awards for our innovation, et cetera. And you should -- and Karl, maybe you might want to make some comments with regards to our innovation on our best new products, which are making pretty good inroads in Europe and the thing. So yes, more volume in 2016, and a little bit of less price.

And basically, around the world, we're excited with the introduction of a variety of new products. We're showing significant above market growth in Europe, especially Western Europe, heavily being driven by introduction of things like our Darfresh On Tray, as I mentioned, some of our new solutions in the ready meals market. And so, those, coupled with some of the adjacent markets we've had, starting to gain traction and acceptance of our new aseptic technologies with the sale of a couple of a new systems in 3 different regions of the world. So a lot of positive things going on in light of all the negative economic impacts as well."

We're getting very nice flow. We're getting net very nice growth in very mature markets, like the U.K., and we're getting significant penetration of growth, near doubling of the business in countries like Russia. So I think while we manage some of the downturns, we have a lot of exciting things going on in a variety of mature markets, as well as emerging markets as well.

And we have been -- we have growth. And in Brazil, we don't believe that it's going to go further down. We want to be careful because things are fairly unstable overall in the world, in emerging countries, et cetera. Having said that, I'm not pessimistic whatsoever. And if we're talking about a quarter versus another one, that's one thing, but look at what we have delivered in the third quarter in fairly adverse conditions at this point in time and look at what we're delivering in the year despite -- so we're delivering EBITDA growth despite the overall situation, which is pretty difficult altogether, in the global market.

We don't think that we have to maintain higher inventories as a percent of sales on a permanent go-forward basis. But we do think, as we move in to Q4, it's prudent for us to have a higher level to be able to support our customers at the right service-level they've come to expect for on-time delivery. In addition to that, some of our restructuring costs is to support addressing the supply chain footprint. Our Senior Vice President for Supply Chain, Emile Chammas, and his team are very focused on making sure we have proper alignment of where we produce, where we have our distribution centers and how they support the organization. And there are some moving parts in there that are part of that restructuring. So we also take that into consideration when we think about our -- the inventory levels that we will help us have the business operate at the optimal level through Q4 and into the first quarter of 2016. I also will take this opportunity to remind everyone that our 2018 free cash flow guidance is $775 million, as we shared at Analyst Day. And we feel very good about that.

And Brazil's primary export customers are Russia, Venezuela, China, all of which have depressed buying due to their social economic issues, as well as Russia becoming more focused on self manufacture. In addition Russia has also banned imports from 10 different Brazilian plants. So a lot of that is politically driven, but it still is what it is. And so those have truncated export sales. What Brazil continues to do is look at developing in export markets to North America, to Asia, all of those support long-term trends for them.

So very frankly, we are -- we're not done with what we want to achieve in terms of quality of our business with our existing portfolio. We have clearly segregated this business into commodities and specialties in every single of the divisions. It's not that I don't like commodities, because you can make very nice money with commodities, provided you have best-in-class manufacturing costs, which was not the case in trays, by the way, and provided your investment and your cost to serve is highly competitive. When they're not, when you don't have those two conditions, you need to be very careful because you are going to spend a disproportionate amount of time on those commodities compared to serving the markets with our specialty products or specialty solutions. So that's why we're very focused. Our medical business, by the way, is doing wonderful, absolutely wonderful. It is small, but it was not performing at the levels we needed to see it performing and it really is now doing extremely well. 
So all in all, I want to thank you, all. This has been what I call a very strong quarter. This is an outstanding year for us. And remember where we started, we had a guidance originally on EPS at $2.18, if I remember well. We have now an estimate of $2.32, including $0.36 of negative currency. I just call that fabulous. We are improving our EBITDA despite year-to-date $96 million of negative EBITDA compared to last year. I just call that extraordinary. And we are doing this because we're very firmly believing that we have room to grow, that there is time for being very firm on our strategy with regards to Get Fit and we are making great progress. For those of you who were in our Investor Day in June, you have seen what we have in our Change the Game. And I -- we will update you in time as to how we're doing in each of those major solutions and products, but we're making very good inroads in each of the 3 divisions. So thank you, again."

I'm sure that you have had the chance to review our press release and earnings results for the third quarter, and I'm very pleased with our performance across all divisions, despite the significant currency headwinds and slowdown in emerging markets. 
Net sales of $1.75 billion increased 2.7% on an organic basis, which excludes both FX and the impact from the North American trays and pads divestiture. We experienced organic or constant-dollar sales growth in each of our regions, in both Food Care and Diversey Care. Adjusted EBITDA was $300 million or 72 -- 17.2% of net sales, essentially unchanged on an as-reported dollar basis and an increase of approximately 16% in an organic basis. We delivered 190 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, with improvements across each of our 3 divisions. And free cash flow for the first 9 months of the year was $331 million, and as we head into year-end, we will continue to focus on growth opportunities within our divisions and regions while, at the same time, stay very disciplined on our pricing strategies and cost management to offset currency headwinds. 
Before I pass the call on to Carol and Karl Deily, President of Food Care, for more details on the quarter and outlook, I want to briefly highlight a few items. As we have communicated many times, we are very committed to a disciplined approach to portfolio management with a focus on innovation and becoming a knowledge-based company. To further solidify our position in the growing e-commerce market, we acquired B+ Equipment in early August, a startup company headquartered in France that designs, manufactures and services revolutionary automated packaging systems in -- for order fulfillment operations. With this acquisition, we will add B+ flagship I-Pack system and its recently introduced e-Cube system to our industry-leading portfolio of packaging solutions focused on cube optimization and fulfillment velocity. 
More recently, we completed the sale of our European trays business, a noncore asset within our Food Care division. Similar to our comments around the North American trays and pads business, the European trays business has commoditized and was also facing competitive pricing pressure. This business generated $71 million in sales in 2014 and $44 million in the first 9 months of 2015. 
With that, let's get started with an overview of our financial results. Carol?"

Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA was our fastest-growing region with 4% constant-dollar growth. Latin America and Asia Pacific both delivered 3% growth, and on an organic basis, North America was up just over 1%. 
In EMEA, we continue to see strong constant-dollar growth in Russia and Turkey with 39% and 10% growth, respectively. In Western Europe, we delivered 7% growth in Spain and approximately 3% to 4% growth in Italy and Holland. France, Germany and the U.K. were flat compared to last year. These 8 countries in our EMEA region account for approximately 23% of our total net sales. 
In Latin America, we had strong constant-dollar performance in Mexico and Argentina with 17% growth and nearly 30% growth, respectively. These growth trends were offset by expected weakness in Brazil, which declined 7% as well as the region being impacted by the collapse of Venezuela. Asia Pacific was led by 6% growth in Australia and 3% growth in New Zealand. As we anticipated, China, which accounts for approximately 3% of net total sales, was soft and declined by 1%. In North America, Diversey Care delivered 8% growth, followed by 2% growth in Food Care and a decline of 4% in Product Care. 
In Diversey Care, more than 4% of the growth in the quarter was due to increased demand while the remaining growth came from sales into our distribution channel, which we believe to be a partial pull forward from the fourth quarter. In Product Care, sales were impacted primarily from our rationalization efforts and pockets of weakness throughout the industrial sectors. 
Turning to Slide 5. Let me walk you through our net sales bridge for the quarter. Favorable price/mix was 2.1% or $42 million on volumes that were up $11 million. Unfavorable currency translation had an impact on net sales of $230 million or 12%, mostly due to year-over-year declines in the euro, Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Russian ruble and the Canadian dollar. Net sales on an organic basis were up 2.7%, and on an as-reported basis, net sales declined 11.6%. 
On Slide 6, we outline our price/mix, volume and sales trends on a constant-dollar and organic basis. As you can see from the slide, we had favorable price/mix in every division and in every region. Volume trends were up nicely in Diversey Care and essentially flat in Food Care. Excluding rationalization efforts in Product Care, volumes would have also been flat as compared to last year's performance. By region, volume was up in EMEA and Asia Pacific, flat in North America and down nearly 9% in Latin America. 
On Slide 7, you can see our adjusted EBITDA performance for the quarter and first 9 months of the year. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $300 million or 17.2% of net sales was essentially unchanged on an as-reported basis compared to our performance in the third quarter of 2014. However, excluding $39 million in unfavorable currency and the impact from the divestiture, adjusted EBITDA increased 15.6%. This increase was largely due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of $36 million and cost synergies of $11 million. We are pleased to have delivered 190 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to last year, despite unfavorable currency and the impact of the divestiture. 
Karl will highlight the adjusted EBITDA performance by division, but I want to mention that our medical business had a strong performance in the quarter and was the primary driver behind the year-over-year improvement in the net expense of medical and corporate, which is categorized as other in our adjusted EBITDA financial table. For the full year, we now expect medical and corporate to be a net expense of approximately $70 million. 
Adjusted net earnings of $143 million or $0.70 per share compares to adjusted net earnings of $112 million or $0.53 in the third quarter last year. Currency negatively impacted adjusted EPS in the third quarter 2015 by $0.12. Unfavorable FX was offset by higher earnings from operations, lower interest expense, a lower core tax rate and share repurchases. 
The core tax rate for Q3 2015 was 18.8% as compared with 28% for Q3 2014, which, on a year-over-year basis, positively impacted 2015 adjusted EPS in the third quarter by $0.08. The lower core tax rate in the quarter was related to the recording of net foreign tax credits. Year-to-date, our core tax rate was 24.3%, and we still anticipate our full year tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
On an as-reported basis, net earnings in the third quarter were $87 million or $0.42 per share. Net earnings include $57 million of special items, primarily consisting of restructuring and other associated costs as well as a tax reserve recorded in relation to the $235 million tax refund we received earlier in the year. The net tax reserve recorded in the quarter was $16 million, which reflects the tax reserve on the refund, offset by the release of certain tax reserves recorded at the time of the Diversey Care acquisition. 
In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 11.3 million shares for a total value of approximately $576 million, using a combination of open market and ASR. Share repurchases had a year-over-year favorable impact on adjusted EPS of $0.03. Year-to-date, we repurchased a total of 14.5 million shares for a total value of $726 million. 
I will now turn the call over to Karl, who will provide you with a more detailed review of Food Care as well as highlight the performance of Diversey Care and Product Care."

In the third quarter, Food Care sales increased 3.1% on an organic basis, with growth across all regions. Favorable price/mix was 2.8% on essentially flat volumes. We had favorable price/mix trends and, more importantly, positive volume trends in every region except Latin America, where volume was negatively impacted by general political and economic conditions in Brazil and Venezuela. Excluding Latin America, volume would have been up approximately 2% to 3% globally. Our results in price/mix demonstrate our global pricing disciplines as well as our success managing pricing in countries where currency devaluations have occurred. 
Europe, Middle East, Africa or EMEA delivered 5% constant-dollar growth. Russia continues to be our fastest-growing country due to the strength of penetration of the protein markets as well as adoption of our advanced packaging solutions. Our business in Western Europe is benefiting from a slowly recovering economy where demand for beef is increasing. In addition, we are experiencing strong acceptance of our new products, particularly our Darfresh On Tray and some of our new advanced ready-meal solutions. 
In Latin America, sales were up 3.4% in constant dollars. Double-digit constant-dollar growth in Mexico and Argentina more than offset expected weaknesses in Brazil and Venezuela. In Brazil, our business is being negatively impacted by the decline in local beef consumption due to the economic environment, the decline in the export market and the fact that cattle producers have recently started to rebuild their herds in light of the current market conditions. Also, the sociopolitical factors in Venezuela are having a very significant impact on our business. Despite these short-term challenges, we strongly believe that over the long term, Latin America and specifically Brazil, where the herd size is double the size of North America, is a solid growth opportunity for Food Care. 
Asia Pacific was up 4% in constant dollars as a result of 6% growth in Australia and 5% growth in New Zealand. Since the second quarter of 2014, on average, we have been experiencing high single-digit growth in Australia, where slaughter rates have been at unsustainably high levels. As we previously indicated, we are now seeing the Australian cattle producers start to rebuild their herds after nearly 3 years of drought-induced liquidation. Consequently, we're planning for weaker sales trends in Australia in the upcoming quarters. In New Zealand, we have been experiencing above-market growth. However, we believe this growth is not sustainable due to the impact of the depressed global dairy markets. 
In North America, despite continued mid-single digit declines in the cattle market, we delivered 2% organic sales growth, with nearly 1% volume growth and favorable price/mix. This quarter, our growth in North America was predominantly driven by strength in poultry, smoked and processed meats and fluid-based packaging as a result of a very strong tomato season in California. Fresh red meat was relatively flat due to continued adoptions of our advanced product portfolio. 
It's worth noting that the broad acceptance of these new products is driving our above-market growth in North America. I also want to mention that cattle producers continue to rebuild their herds as evidenced by the continued heifer retention. While we continue to anticipate the cattle market to both be weak in quarter 4 and the first half of 2016, there is a strong indication that the cycle is on track to turn positive in mid-2016. 
Our global hygiene business delivered solid growth in APAC and EMEA with improved profitability. This growth was partially offset by weaknesses in Latin American market. 
Turning to Food Care's adjusted EBITDA performance. Food Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $168 million, a 7% increase on an as-reported basis and a 10% increase on an organic basis. Currency and the divestiture had a $30 million unfavorable impact on adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Margins of 20.1% were up 170 basis points, largely due to improved mix of our premium products, global pricing disciplines and lower input costs. These were partially offset by transactional FX and the divestiture. 
As we head into year-end, we expect further adoption of our new products on a global basis, and we will continue on focusing on adding value-added selling to our customers. However, this will be partially offset by negative formula pricing, particularly in North America, currency headwinds and other external factors. Some of these external factors include ongoing economic challenges in Brazil, Venezuela and the slowdown in Australia, where slaughter rates have been at unsustainable levels. 
In quarter 4, as reported, adjusted EBITDA in absolute dollars will be down on a year-over-year basis. However, adjusted EBITDA on an organic basis, which excludes FX and the divestiture, is expected to increase in the high single digits. Given our performance year-to-date and the outlook for quarter 4, we are clearly on track to deliver a strong EBITDA growth and margin expansion for the full year 2015. 
So I'd like to turn our attention now to Slide 9,  which highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant-dollar basis were up approximately 4% in the third quarter. Volume increased 2.5%, with favorable trends in every region except for Latin America, where volume was negatively impacted by weakness in Brazil. Price/mix was favorable 1.4%, primarily driven by pricing initiatives. 
As Carol indicated earlier, our strongest region in Diversey Care was North America. Our recent customer wins are ramping up nicely, and we are continuing to see solid growth in our infection prevention solutions. We also had a strong performance in EMEA and APAC, with constant-dollar sales growth of 3% in the quarter. EMEA accounts for approximately 50% of our net sales. We have made significant progress and are seeing stabilizing trends throughout our largest markets in Western Europe. Among our largest customers in EMEA, we are experiencing double-digit growth in Turkey and positive sales in France, Italy, Holland, Germany and Spain. 
In APAC, we experienced high single-digit growth in India and a slight uptick in China while all other emerging markets declined. Latin America sales on a constant-dollar basis were essentially unchanged compared to last year's performance. For the second consecutive quarter, performance in Latin America was driven by growth in Argentina and Chile, partially offset by high single-digit decline in Brazil. Strength in Argentina and Chile is a result of recent customer wins, growth on equipment sales and increased volume from our distribution partners. 
On the new product front and solutions front, we launched the SURE product line, which is a vegetable-based formula, which is 100% biodegradable and requires no classifications from a regulatory standpoint. We highlighted this at our Analyst Day, and we are excited to have it commercially available in the market. 
Diversey Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $66 million or 13.2% of net sales in the quarter. Currency translation negatively impacted our performance in the quarter and on a reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA declined 5%. In constant dollars, however, adjusted EBITDA was up 12% compared to last year. This growth was driven by higher volumes, cost synergies, lower SG&A, partially offset by the impact of transactional FX, the Intellibot acquisition and the significant deterioration of the economic conditions in Venezuela and Brazil. In quarter 4, we expect continued organic growth in sales and adjusted EBITDA, but to a lesser extent as compared to quarter 3. 
Now let's look at Slide 10, which highlights the results of our Product Care division. Net sales were down 1.7% on a constant-dollar basis, with volume declines of 2.5% more than offsetting favorable price/mix of 0.8%. Third quarter volume was impacted by rationalization efforts in Latin America and, to a lesser extent, North America. Our rationalization efforts are focused on our global packaging solutions and should be mostly behind us by mid-2016. As Carol highlighted earlier, volume was also impacted by weakness in the industrial sectors in North America. Favorable price/mix continues to be driven by our pricing disciplines across both the global packaging -- performance packaging and general packaging sectors. 
On a regional basis, North America net sales were down nearly 4% in constant dollars, of which half of the decline is attributable to rationalization. Unfavorable trends in the industrial sector, particularly manufacturing and transportation, were partially offset by double-digit growth in e-commerce and third-party logistics. We expect strength in e-commerce and 3PLs to continue into year-end, which will help offset rationalization and the softer trends in the industrial markets. 
EMEA was up approximately 3% due to increased demand in France and Italy, and it's worth noting that China was up 4%. Performance in China reflects our new leadership in APAC and our renewed targeted efforts to increase market penetration. We are seeing strong interest across the globe in our newly acquired B+ portfolio, and we are excited to have the team onboard. Both B+ and our recently introduced automatic mailer or flow wrap are designed to deliver cube optimization and efficiency savings for the rapidly growing e-commerce and fulfillment markets. The flow wrap solution, which is specifically designed for the e-commerce apparel market, is further evidence of our robust development pipeline of automated solutions. 
Let's turn to adjusted EBITDA. Product Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $81 million, a 9% increase on an as-reported basis and 16% in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.1% expanded 340 basis points compared to last year's results. This increase was a result of pricing disciplines associated with our value selling initiatives and increase of mix of our Global Performance Packaging solutions and lower input cost. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued EBITDA growth and margin expansion. 
Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our cash flow and our outlook. Carol?"

Free cash flow was a source of $331 million for the first 9 months of the year, excluding the $235 million tax refund. This compares to a source of $371 million for the 9 months ending 2014. The year-over-year decline",675,"Thank you, Karl. Turning to Slide 11. Free cash flow was a source of $331 million for the first 9 months of the year, excluding the $235 million tax refund. This compares to a source of $371 million for the 9 months ending 2014. The year-over-year decline was primarily attributable to less cash generated from working capital, the payment of 2014 bonuses and unfavorable currency. CapEx was $112 million and cash restructuring costs were $72 million for the 9 months ending September 30, 2015. 
Our updated outlook for 2015 is presented on Slide 12. We now expect net sales to be approximately $7 billion. Unfavorable currency is expected to be approximately 10% or $800 million. Excluding the impact of the North America trays and pads divestiture and currency, we anticipate an organic growth rate of approximately 3%. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2015 is now expected to be approximately $1.165 billion, which is in the midpoint of our previously provided guidance. This reflects our strong performance in the first 9 months of 2015 and our outlook into year-end. We will continue to face currency challenges and are estimating FX to have a negative impact on full year adjusted EBITDA of approximately $125 million. 
Keep in mind that in Q3 2014, the euro was at $1.34, and in Q4 2014, the euro was at $1.26. Our year-end forecast assumes that in Q4 2015, the euro remains in line with the Q3 rate of approximately $1.10. Other currencies that have experienced devaluation in recent months and as compared to last year -- last year's rates includes the Russian ruble, the Brazilian real, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. 
Our interest expense for 2015 is estimated at $235 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $290 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.32. The adjusted EPS impact from currency is expected to be approximately $0.36. Our previous guidance for adjusted EPS in 2015 was in the range of $2.24 to $2.28. In 2014, we reported adjusted EPS of $1.86. As I highlighted earlier, we have repurchased a total of 14.5 million shares year-to-date. Our adjusted EPS outlook for 2015 is based on 207 million shares, which reflects the weighted average full year effect of the share repurchases completed year-to-date. 
Please note that the divestiture of the European trays business is expected to close in early November. For now, the full year financial estimates for this business are included in our 2015 outlook. Full year 2015 sales from the European trays are expected to be approximately $55 million. Similar to the North America trays and pads business, this disposition does not qualify for discontinued operations. Therefore, prior year and the first 10 months of 2015 financials will include results from our European trays business. 
We are revising our free cash flow guidance to $560 million from $585 million. Our free cash flow outlook excludes the $235 million tax refund. Cash interest payments are expected to be $230 million, and cash tax payments are estimated at $110 million. We are lowering our capital expenditures from $210 million to $190 million and our cash restructuring payments from $120 million to $110 million. Working capital will still be a source of cash, but not at the level we had originally anticipated, largely due to proactive inventory management. We are maintaining higher-than-originally-anticipated inventory levels into year-end to support on-time delivery for our customers in order to meet their service requirements. 
In closing, we have made significant progress in 2015, and we will continue to focus on operational improvements and [indiscernible] to mitigate FX and pockets of economic weakness. When we look beyond 2015, our focus is on new product introductions and investing in innovative technologies that will drive sustainable and profitable growth. Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter and full year earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, February 10, at 10:00 a.m.

That's broken out in our bridge. You can see that within the Food Care EBITDA bridge. The European business had a similar margin. But what's important to note, as we've highlighted and Karl's commented as well, that business have been -- was deteriorating, becoming commoditized, both North America and Europe, and Europe even more so, so the margins were quickly headed below 10% as well as the product not meeting some of our sustainability requirements.

I guess it's not really that we have been too aggressive in reducing inventory. An important piece of the build that we think we need to do -- or really not build, but maintaining into Q4 is because we do have a go-live for SAP within our Diversey Care business in North America. And anyone who has been through an SAP implementation and go-live will know that it's very prudent to make sure you maintain appropriate inventory levels. It's a great enterprise platform that we'll get a lot of benefit out of that we want to make sure we're cautious and conservative and can meet all of our customer expectations. So that's one of the key drivers, and we've just taken that decision as we head towards the end of the year with an early Q1 go-live. In terms of thinking about color for 2016, we do expect to have a positive impact from working capital and it to be a source of cash in 2016. However, it's important to note, when we came -- when Jerome and I and the rest of the management team really started focusing on working capital beginning in 2013, there were some obvious things we could do that would accrue to our benefit from a cash flow standpoint quicker. As we're moving forward, there's less of those obvious steps to take in the move towards the day in, day out proper management of working capital to sustain the business. We anticipate growth going forward into 2016, and as such, that will impact working capital. But again, that bottom line, we will expect to see positive source of cash for working capital. If we think about EBITDA for 2016, we're still focusing extremely on profitable growth, driving towards our 2018 target of 18% margin that we shared at the Analyst Day in June. Our CapEx for 2016 is still estimated at $275 million. Restructuring, excluding the CapEx restructuring, which is included in this $275 million I shared, is still estimated $110 million to $120 million for 2016."

To get to the $560 million would imply a favorable impact from working capital and other of $55 million, and we have previously estimated that to be somewhere between $100 million and $110 million. With respect to the Diversey Care, I guess, for that, when we look at the cost synergies, I mean, that's the $5 million positive that's ongoing benefit that has helped the business in the quarter. With respect to mix and price/cost spread, we do have a meaningful impact from transactional FX that hits Diversey because of different imports of products based on where the demand's at. We had a particularly negative impact in the U.K. for their business and all driven largely because of transactional FX. So we're not seeing anything that's concerning from a deterioration in margin driven by mix.

I'm very proud of it. And I'm very proud of it because remember the guidance. We gave you a guidance at the beginning of the year in terms of EBITDA and EPS. We raised it in July. We raised that guidance in July. We -- then in September, at John's Crédit Suisse conference, we said watch it, there's an additional headwind of $15 million of currency, and it's going to be really hard to mitigate it. And what are we doing today? We're confirming the July guidance. So I take this as the third time we're increasing -- as the second time we're increasing our guidance. And I'm very pleased with what's going on in an environment, which, in emerging countries, because of commodity pricing, ag commodities or mineral pricing and because of oil and gas prices, et cetera, certainly in all -- in many emerging countries, which -- but including Australia, Canada, et cetera, are countries where the environment is not easy. And remember that in that environment, we have -- we are increasing our EBITDA and, at the very same time, we are suffering in Q3 only $236 million of transactions in sales and $39 million of EBITDA. So that context is making things good. Your point is very good, which is we haven't gotten very much volume growth, but we had given a guidance for the next 3 years of having a 4% to 5% growth. And I firmly believe we're going to have that, and it's going to be less on pricing, more on volume. And yes, mix is helping, thanks to our innovation products. Every single division has -- is extremely excited about all of this. You should have gone -- I don't know if you have, but you should have gone to PACK EXPO, where we were having a huge booth which was packed like no tomorrow in Las Vegas a few weeks ago. You should have gone to the ISSA, where we got lots of awards for our innovation, et cetera. And you should -- and Karl, maybe you might want to make some comments with regards to our innovation on our best new products, which are making pretty good inroads in Europe, and the things. So yes, more volume in 2016 and a little bit less price. But if we have had 3% or if we're under -- or about 3% growth year-to-date or so, I have really zero problem with the 4% to 5% over the midterm."

And so those, coupled with some of the adjacent markets we've had starting to gain traction and acceptance of our new aseptic technologies, with the sale of a couple of a new systems in 3 different regions of the world.

So I think while we manage some of the downturns, we have a lot of exciting things going on in a variety of mature markets as well as emerging markets as well.

We don't think that we have to maintain higher inventories as a percent of sales on a permanent go-forward basis. But we do think, as we move into Q4, it's prudent for us to have a higher level to be able to support our customers at the right service level they've come to expect for on-time delivery. In addition to that, some of our restructuring costs is to support addressing the supply chain footprint. Our Senior Vice President for Supply Chain, Emile Chammas, and his team are very focused on making sure we have proper alignment of where we produce, where we have our distribution centers and how they support the organization. And there are some moving parts in there that are part of that restructuring, so we also take that into consideration when we think about our -- the inventory levels that we will help us have the business operate at the optimal level through Q4 and into the first quarter of 2016.

But unless you want to add something, Carol, but she's telling me no. So very frankly, we are -- we're not done with what we want to achieve in terms of quality of our business with our existing portfolio. We have clearly segregated this business into commodities and specialties in every single of the divisions. It's not that I don't like commodities because you can make very nice money with commodities, provided you have best-in-class manufacturing costs, which was not the case in trays, by the way, and provided your investment and your cost to serve is highly competitive. When they're not, when you don't have those 2 conditions, you need to be very careful because you are going to spend a disproportionate amount of time on those commodities compared to serving the markets with our specialty products or specialty solutions. So that's why we're very focused. Our medical business, by the way, is doing wonderful, absolutely wonderful. It is small, but it was not performing at the levels we needed to see it performing, and it really is now doing extremely well. 
So all in all, I want to thank you all. This has been what I call a very strong quarter. This is an outstanding year for us. And remember where we started, we had a guidance originally on EPS at $2.18, if I remember well. We have now an estimate of $2.32, including $0.36 of negative currency. I just call that fabulous. We are improving our EBITDA despite year-to-date $96 million of negative EBITDA compared to last year. I just call that extraordinary. 
And we are doing this because we're very firmly believing that we have room to grow, that there is time for being very firm on our strategy with regards to Get Fit, and we are making great progress. For those of you who were in our Investor Day in June, you have seen what we have in our Change the Game. And I -- we will update you in time as to how we're doing in each of those major solutions and products, but we're making very good inroads in each of the 3 divisions. So thank you again."

I'm sure that you have had the chance to review our press release and earnings results for the third quarter, and I'm very pleased with our performance across all divisions, despite the significant currency headwinds and slowdown in emerging markets. 
Net sales of $1.75 billion increased 2.7% on an organic basis, which excludes both FX and the impact from the North American trays and pads divestiture. We experienced organic or constant-dollar sales growth in each of our regions, in both Food Care and Diversey Care. Adjusted EBITDA was $300 million or 72 -- 17.2% of net sales, essentially unchanged on an as-reported dollar basis and an increase of approximately 16% in an organic basis. We delivered 190 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, with improvements across each of our 3 divisions. And free cash flow for the first 9 months of the year was $331 million, and as we head into year-end, we will continue to focus on growth opportunities within our divisions and regions while, at the same time, stay very disciplined on our pricing strategies and cost management to offset currency headwinds. 
Before I pass the call on to Carol and Karl Deily, President of Food Care, for more details on the quarter and outlook, I want to briefly highlight a few items. As we have communicated many times, we are very committed to a disciplined approach to portfolio management with a focus on innovation and becoming a knowledge-based company. To further solidify our position in the growing e-commerce market, we acquired B+ Equipment in early August, a startup company headquartered in France that designs, manufactures and services revolutionary automated packaging systems in -- for order fulfillment operations. With this acquisition, we will add B+ flagship I-Pack system and its recently introduced e-Cube system to our industry-leading portfolio of packaging solutions focused on cube optimization and fulfillment velocity. 
More recently, we completed the sale of our European trays business, a noncore asset within our Food Care division. Similar to our comments around the North American trays and pads business, the European trays business has commoditized and was also facing competitive pricing pressure. This business generated $71 million in sales in 2014 and $44 million in the first 9 months of 2015. 
With that, let's get started with an overview of our financial results. Carol?"

Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA was our fastest-growing region with 4% constant-dollar growth. Latin America and Asia Pacific both delivered 3% growth, and on an organic basis, North America was up just over 1%. 
In EMEA, we continue to see strong constant-dollar growth in Russia and Turkey with 39% and 10% growth, respectively. In Western Europe, we delivered 7% growth in Spain and approximately 3% to 4% growth in Italy and Holland. France, Germany and the U.K. were flat compared to last year. These 8 countries in our EMEA region account for approximately 23% of our total net sales. 
In Latin America, we had strong constant-dollar performance in Mexico and Argentina with 17% growth and nearly 30% growth, respectively. These growth trends were offset by expected weakness in Brazil, which declined 7% as well as the region being impacted by the collapse of Venezuela. Asia Pacific was led by 6% growth in Australia and 3% growth in New Zealand. As we anticipated, China, which accounts for approximately 3% of net total sales, was soft and declined by 1%. In North America, Diversey Care delivered 8% growth, followed by 2% growth in Food Care and a decline of 4% in Product Care. 
In Diversey Care, more than 4% of the growth in the quarter was due to increased demand while the remaining growth came from sales into our distribution channel, which we believe to be a partial pull-forward from the fourth quarter. In Product Care, sales were impacted primarily from our rationalization efforts and pockets of weakness throughout the industrial sectors. 
Turning to Slide 5. Let me walk you through our net sales bridge for the quarter. Favorable price/mix was 2.1% or $42 million on volumes that were up $11 million. Unfavorable currency translation had an impact on net sales of $230 million or 12%, mostly due to year-over-year declines in the euro, Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Russian ruble and the Canadian dollar. Net sales on an organic basis were up 2.7%, and on an as-reported basis, net sales declined 11.6%. 
On Slide 6, we outline our price/mix, volume and sales trends on a constant-dollar and organic basis. As you can see from the slide, we had favorable price/mix in every division and in every region. Volume trends were up nicely in Diversey Care and essentially flat in Food Care. Excluding rationalization efforts in Product Care, volumes would have also been flat as compared to last year's performance. By region, volume was up in EMEA and Asia Pacific, flat in North America and down nearly 9% in Latin America. 
On Slide 7, you can see our adjusted EBITDA performance for the quarter and first 9 months of the year. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $300 million or 17.2% of net sales was essentially unchanged on an as-reported basis compared to our performance in the third quarter of 2014. However, excluding $39 million in unfavorable currency and the impact from the divestiture, adjusted EBITDA increased 15.6%. This increase was largely due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of $36 million and cost synergies of $11 million. We are pleased to have delivered 190 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to last year, despite unfavorable currency and the impact of the divestiture. 
Karl will highlight the adjusted EBITDA performance by division, but I want to mention that our medical business had a strong performance in the quarter and was the primary driver behind the year-over-year improvement in the net expense of medical and corporate, which is categorized as other in our adjusted EBITDA financial tables. For the full year, we now expect medical and corporate to be a net expense of approximately $70 million. 
Adjusted net earnings of $143 million or $0.70 per share compares to adjusted net earnings of $112 million or $0.53 in the third quarter last year. Currency negatively impacted adjusted EPS in the third quarter 2015 by $0.12. Unfavorable FX was offset by higher earnings from operations, lower interest expense, a lower core tax rate and share repurchases. 
The core tax rate for Q3 2015 was 18.8% as compared with 28% for Q3 2014, which, on a year-over-year basis, positively impacted 2015 adjusted EPS in the third quarter by $0.08. The lower core tax rate in the quarter was related to the recording of net foreign tax credits. Year-to-date, our core tax rate was 24.3%, and we still anticipate our full year tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
On an as-reported basis, net earnings in the third quarter were $87 million or $0.42 per share. Net earnings include $57 million of special items, primarily consisting of restructuring and other associated costs as well as a tax reserve recorded in relation to the $235 million tax refund we received earlier in the year. The net tax reserve recorded in the quarter was $16 million, which reflects the tax reserve on the refund, offset by the release of certain tax reserves recorded at the time of the Diversey Care acquisition. 
In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 11.3 million shares for a total value of approximately $576 million, using a combination of open market and ASR. Share repurchases had a year-over-year favorable impact on adjusted EPS of $0.03. Year-to-date, we repurchased a total of 14.5 million shares for a total value of $726 million. 
I will now turn the call over to Karl, who will provide you with a more detailed review of Food Care as well as highlight the performance of Diversey Care and Product Care."

In the third quarter, Food Care sales increased 3.1% on an organic basis, with growth across all regions. Favorable price/mix was 2.8% on essentially flat volumes. We had favorable price/mix trends and, more importantly, positive volume trends in every region except Latin America, where volume was negatively impacted by general political and economic conditions in Brazil and Venezuela. Excluding Latin America, volume would have been up approximately 2% to 3% globally. Our results in price/mix demonstrate our global pricing disciplines as well as our success managing pricing in countries where currency devaluations have occurred. 
Europe, Middle East, Africa or EMEA delivered 5% constant-dollar growth. Russia continues to be our fastest-growing country due to the strength of penetration of the protein markets as well as adoption of our advanced packaging solutions. Our business in Western Europe is benefiting from a slowly recovering economy where demand for beef is increasing. In addition, we are experiencing strong acceptance of our new products, particularly our Darfresh On Tray and some of our new advanced ready-meal solutions. 
In Latin America, sales were up 3.4% in constant dollars. Double-digit constant-dollar growth in Mexico and Argentina more than offset expected weaknesses in Brazil and Venezuela. In Brazil, our business is being negatively impacted by the decline in local beef consumption due to the economic environment, the decline in the export market and the fact that cattle producers have recently started to rebuild their herds in light of the current market conditions. Also, the sociopolitical factors in Venezuela are having a very significant impact on our business. Despite these short-term challenges, we strongly believe that over the long term, Latin America and specifically Brazil, where the herd size is double the size of North America, is a solid growth opportunity for Food Care. 
Asia Pacific was up 4% in constant dollars as a result of 6% growth in Australia and 5% growth in New Zealand. Since the second quarter of 2014, on average, we have been experiencing high single-digit growth in Australia, where slaughter rates have been at unsustainably high levels. As we previously indicated, we are now seeing the Australian cattle producers start to rebuild their herds after nearly 3 years of drought-induced liquidation. Consequently, we're planning for weaker sales trends in Australia in the upcoming quarters. In New Zealand, we have been experiencing above-market growth. However, we believe this growth is not sustainable due to the impact of the depressed global dairy markets. 
In North America, despite continued mid-single digit declines in the cattle market, we delivered 2% organic sales growth, with nearly 1% volume growth and favorable price/mix. This quarter, our growth in North America was predominantly driven by strength in poultry, smoked and processed meats and fluid-based packaging as a result of a very strong tomato season in California. Fresh red meat was relatively flat due to continued adoption of our advanced product portfolio. 
It's worth noting that the broad acceptance of these new products is driving our above-market growth in North America. I also want to mention that cattle producers continue to rebuild their herds as evidenced by the continued heifer retention. While we continue to anticipate the cattle market to both be weak in quarter 4 and the first half of 2016, there is a strong indication that the cycle is on track to turn positive in mid-2016. 
Our global hygiene business delivered solid growth in APAC and EMEA with improved profitability. This growth was partially offset by weaknesses in Latin American markets. 
Turning to Food Care's adjusted EBITDA performance. Food Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $168 million, a 7% increase on an as-reported basis and a 10% increase on an organic basis. Currency and the divestiture had a $30 million unfavorable impact on adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Margins of 20.1% were up 170 basis points, largely due to improved mix of our premium products, global pricing disciplines and lower input costs. These were partially offset by transactional FX and the divestiture. 
As we head into year-end, we expect further adoption of our new products on a global basis, and we will continue on focusing on adding value-added selling to our customers. However, this will be partially offset by negative formula pricing, particularly in North America, currency headwinds and other external factors. Some of these external factors include ongoing economic challenges in Brazil, Venezuela and the slowdown in Australia, where slaughter rates have been at unsustainable levels. 
In quarter 4, as reported, adjusted EBITDA in absolute dollars will be down on a year-over-year basis. However, adjusted EBITDA on an organic basis, which excludes FX and the divestiture, is expected to increase in the high single digits. Given our performance year-to-date and the outlook for quarter 4, we are clearly on track to deliver a strong EBITDA growth and margin expansion for the full year 2015. 
So I'd like to turn our attention now to Slide 9,  which highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant-dollar basis were up approximately 4% in the third quarter. Volume increased 2.5%, with favorable trends in every region except for Latin America, where volume was negatively impacted by weakness in Brazil. Price/mix was favorable 1.4%, primarily driven by pricing initiatives. 
As Carol indicated earlier, our strongest region in Diversey Care was North America. Our recent customer wins are ramping up nicely, and we are continuing to see solid growth in our infection prevention solutions. We also had a strong performance in EMEA and APAC, with constant-dollar sales growth of 3% in the quarter. EMEA accounts for approximately 50% of our net sales. We have made significant progress and are seeing stabilizing trends throughout our largest markets in Western Europe. Among our largest customers in EMEA, we are experiencing double-digit growth in Turkey and positive sales in France, Italy, Holland, Germany and Spain. 
In APAC, we experienced high single-digit growth in India and a slight uptick in China while all other emerging markets declined. Latin America sales on a constant-dollar basis were essentially unchanged compared to last year's performance. For the second consecutive quarter, performance in Latin America was driven by growth in Argentina and Chile, partially offset by high single-digit decline in Brazil. Strength in Argentina and Chile is a result of recent customer wins, growth on equipment sales and increased volume from our distribution partners. 
On the new product front and solutions front, we launched the SURE product line, which is a vegetable-based formula, which is 100% biodegradable and requires no classifications from a regulatory standpoint. We highlighted this at our Analyst Day, and we are excited to have it commercially available in the market. 
Diversey Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $66 million or 13.2% of net sales in the quarter. Currency translation negatively impacted our performance in the quarter and on a reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA declined 5%. In constant dollars, however, adjusted EBITDA was up 12% compared to last year. This growth was driven by higher volumes, cost synergies, lower SG&A, partially offset by the impact of transactional FX, the Intellibot acquisition and the significant deterioration of the economic conditions in Venezuela and Brazil. In quarter 4, we expect continued organic growth in sales and adjusted EBITDA, but to a lesser extent as compared to quarter 3. 
Now let's look at Slide 10, which highlights the results of our Product Care division. Net sales were down 1.7% on a constant-dollar basis, with volume declines of 2.5% more than offsetting favorable price/mix of 0.8%. Third quarter volume was impacted by rationalization efforts in Latin America and, to a lesser extent, North America. Our rationalization efforts are focused on our global packaging solutions and should be mostly behind us by mid-2016. As Carol highlighted earlier, volume was also impacted by weakness in the industrial sectors in North America. Favorable price/mix continues to be driven by our pricing disciplines across both the global packaging -- performance packaging and general packaging sectors. 
On a regional basis, North America net sales were down nearly 4% in constant dollars, of which half of the decline is attributable to rationalization. Unfavorable trends in the industrial sector, particularly manufacturing and transportation, were partially offset by double-digit growth in e-commerce and third-party logistics. We expect strength in e-commerce and 3PLs to continue into year-end, which will help offset rationalization and the softer trends in the industrial market. 
EMEA was up approximately 3% due to increased demand in France and Italy, and it's worth noting that China was up 4%. Performance in China reflects our new leadership in APAC and our renewed targeted efforts to increase market penetration. We are seeing strong interest across the globe in our newly-acquired B+ portfolio, and we are excited to have the team onboard. Both B+ and our recently introduced automatic mailer or flow wrap are designed to deliver cube optimization and efficiency savings for the rapidly-growing e-commerce and fulfillment markets. The flow wrap solution, which is specifically designed for the e-commerce apparel market, is further evidence of our robust development pipeline of automated solutions. 
Let's turn to adjusted EBITDA. Product Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $81 million, a 9% increase on an as-reported basis and 16% in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.1% expanded 340 basis points compared to last year's results. This increase was a result of pricing disciplines associated with our value selling initiatives, an increase of mix of our Global Performance Packaging solutions and lower input cost. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued EBITDA growth and margin expansion. 
Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our cash flow and our outlook. Carol?"

The year-over-year decline",673,"Thank you, Karl. Turning to Slide 11. Free cash flow was a source of $331 million for the first 9 months of the year, excluding the $235 million tax refund. This compares to a source of $371 million for the 9 months ending 2014. The year-over-year decline was primarily attributable to less cash generated from working capital, the payment of 2014 bonuses and unfavorable currency. CapEx was $112 million and cash restructuring costs were $72 million for the 9 months ending September 30, 2015. 
Our updated outlook for 2015 is presented on Slide 12. We now expect net sales to be approximately $7 billion. Unfavorable currency is expected to be approximately 10% or $800 million. Excluding the impact of the North America trays and pads divestiture and currency, we anticipate an organic growth rate of approximately 3%. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2015 is now expected to be approximately $1.165 billion, which is in the midpoint of our previously-provided guidance. This reflects our strong performance in the first 9 months of 2015 and our outlook into year-end. We will continue to face currency challenges and are estimating FX to have a negative impact on full year adjusted EBITDA of approximately $125 million. 
Keep in mind that in Q3 2014, the euro was at $1.34, and in Q4 2014, the euro was at $1.26. Our year-end forecast assumes that in Q4 2015, the euro remains in line with the Q3 rate of approximately $1.10. Other currencies that have experienced devaluation in recent months and as compared to last year's rate, includes the Russian ruble, the Brazilian real, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. 
Our interest expense for 2015 is estimated at $235 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $290 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.32. The adjusted EPS impact from currency is expected to be approximately $0.36. Our previous guidance for adjusted EPS in 2015 was in the range of $2.24 to $2.28. In 2014, we reported adjusted EPS of $1.86. As I highlighted earlier, we have repurchased a total of 14.5 million shares year-to-date. Our adjusted EPS outlook for 2015 is based on 207 million shares, which reflects the weighted average full year effect of the share repurchases completed year-to-date. 
Please note that the divestiture of the European trays business is expected to close in early November. For now, the full year financial estimates for this business are included in our 2015 outlook. Full year 2015 sales from the European trays are expected to be approximately $55 million. Similar to the North America trays and pads business, this disposition does not qualify for discontinued operations. Therefore, prior year and the first 10 months of 2015 financials will include results from our European trays business. 
We are revising our free cash flow guidance to $560 million from $585 million. Our free cash flow outlook excludes the $235 million tax refund. Cash interest payments are expected to be $230 million, and cash tax payments are estimated at $110 million. We are lowering our capital expenditures from $210 million to $190 million and our cash restructuring payments from $120 million to $110 million. Working capital will still be a source of cash, but not at the level we had originally anticipated, largely due to proactive inventory management. We are maintaining higher-than-originally-anticipated inventory levels into year-end to support on-time delivery for our customers in order to meet their service requirements. 
In closing, we have made significant progress in 2015, and we will continue to focus on operational improvements and business trends [ph] to mitigate FX and pockets of economic weakness. When we look beyond 2015, our focus is on new product introductions and investing in innovative technologies that will drive sustainable and profitable growth.

An important piece of the build that we think we need to do -- or really not build, but maintaining into Q4 is because we do have a go-live for SAP within our Diversey Care business in North America. And anyone who has been through an SAP implementation and go-live will know that it's very prudent to make sure you maintain appropriate inventory levels. It's a great enterprise platform that we'll get a lot of benefit out of that we want to make sure we're cautious and conservative and can meet all of our customer expectations. So that's one of the key drivers, and we've just taken that decision as we head towards the end of the year with an early Q1 go-live. In terms of thinking about color for 2016, we do expect to have a positive impact from working capital and it to be a source of cash in 2016. However, it's important to note, when we came -- when Jerome and I and the rest of the management team really started focusing on working capital beginning in 2013, there were some obvious things we could do that would accrue to our benefit from a cash flow standpoint quicker. As we're moving forward, there's less of those obvious steps to take in the move towards the day in, day out proper management of working capital to sustain the business. We anticipate growth going forward into 2016, and as such, that will impact working capital. But again, that bottom line, we will expect to see positive source of cash for working capital. If we think about EBITDA for 2016, we're still focusing extremely on profitable growth, driving towards our 2018 target of 18% margin that we shared at the Analyst Day in June. Our CapEx for 2016 is still estimated at $275 million. Restructuring, excluding the CapEx restructuring, which is included in the $275 million I shared, is still estimated $110 million to $120 million for 2016."

We've shared previously that SARs are $20 million and the CapEx of $190 million. To get to the $560 million would imply a favorable impact from working capital and other of $55 million, and we have previously estimated that to be somewhere between $100 million and $110 million. With respect to the Diversey Care, I guess, for that, when we look at the cost synergies, I mean, that's the $5 million positive that's ongoing benefit that has helped the business in the quarter. With respect to mix and price/cost spread, we do have a meaningful impact from transactional FX that hits Diversey because of different imports of products based on where the demand's at. We had a particularly negative impact in the U.K. for their business and all driven largely because of transactional FX. So we're not seeing anything that's concerning from a deterioration in margin driven by mix. And actually, as I highlighted and Karl commented, for North America, we're seeing very positive performance relative to mix as we drive expansion of our North America business, add new customers and especially with our product as it supports health care."

I'm very proud of it. And I'm very proud of it because remember the guidance. We gave you a guidance at the beginning of the year in terms of EBITDA and EPS. We raised it in July. We raised that guidance in July. We -- then in September, at John's Crédit Suisse conference, we said watch it, there's an additional headwind of $15 million of currency, and it's going to be really hard to mitigate it. And what are we doing today? We're confirming the July guidance. So I take this as the third time we're increasing -- as the second time we're increasing our guidance. And I'm very pleased with what's going on in an environment, which, in emerging countries, because of commodity pricing, ag commodities or mineral pricing and because of oil and gas prices, et cetera, there in all -- in many emerging countries, which -- but including Australia, Canada, et cetera, are countries where the environment is not easy. And remember that in that environment, we have -- we are increasing our EBITDA and, at the very same time, we are suffering in Q3 only $236 million of transactions in sales and $39 million of EBITDA. So that context is making things good. Your point is very good, which is we haven't gotten very much volume growth, but we had given a guidance for the next 3 years of having a 4% to 5% growth. And I firmly believe we're going to have that, and it's going to be less on pricing, more on volume. And yes, mix is helping, thanks to our innovation products. Every single division has -- is extremely excited about all of this. You should have gone -- I don't know if you have, but you should have gone to PACK EXPO, where we were having a huge booth which was packed like no tomorrow in Las Vegas a few weeks ago. You should have gone to the ISSA, where we got lots of awards for our innovation, et cetera. And you should -- and Karl, maybe you might want to make some comments with regards to our innovation on our best new products, which are making pretty good inroads in Europe, into things. So yes, more volume in 2016 and a little bit less price. But if we have had 3% or if we're under -- or about 3% growth year-to-date or so, I have really zero problem with the 4% to 5% over the midterm."

In addition to that, some of our restructuring cost is to support addressing the supply chain footprint. Our Senior Vice President for Supply Chain, Emile Chammas, and his team are very focused on making sure we have proper alignment of where we produce, where we have our distribution centers and how they support the organization.

And for your information, we pack valves, pumps and fitting in that sector, and that has gone seriously down. The second sector which has suffered is the electronics market. You have noted that there are less negative sales growth in tablets, in laptops, in desktops. That has affected our market also. And a little bit in the transportation sector, transportation for us being aviation and automobiles. The spare parts market, specifically for exports, has been going slightly down. All of these -- all of those negative trends have been compensated by a very strong e-commerce business, where we have very, very good value-add solutions. China is up, and it is not up because of industrial GDP, which is fairly muted, but it is up because of our solutions. And we're focused on value-add type of products there. We have had this negative growth as a result of heavy rationalization in Latin America and a little bit in North America also. Europe is doing okay, and we are expecting, definitely, volume growth into next year."

But unless you want to add something, Carol, but she's telling me no. So very frankly, we are -- we're not done with what we want to achieve in terms of quality of our business with our existing portfolio. We have clearly segregated this business into commodities and specialties in every single of the divisions. It's not that I don't like commodities because you can make very nice money with commodities, provided you have best-in-class manufacturing costs, which was not the case in trays, by the way, and provided your investment and your cost to serve is highly competitive. When they're not, when you don't have those 2 conditions, you need to be very careful because you are going to spend a disproportionate amount of time on those commodities compared to serving the markets with our specialty products or specialty solutions. So that's why we're very focused. Our medical business, by the way, is doing wonderful, absolutely wonderful. It is small, but it was not performing at the levels we needed to see it performing, and it really is now doing extremely well. 
So all in all, I want to thank you all. This has been what I call a very strong quarter. This is an outstanding year for us. And remember where we started, we had a guidance originally on EPS at $2.18, if I remember well. We have now an estimate at $2.32, including $0.36 of negative currency. I just call that fabulous. We are improving our EBITDA despite year-to-date $96 million of negative EBITDA compared to last year. I just call that extraordinary. 
And we are doing this because we're very firmly believing that we have room to grow, that there is time for being very firm on our strategy with regards to Get Fit, and we are making great progress. For those of you who were in our Investor Day in June, you have seen what we have in our Change the Game. And I -- we will update you in time as to how we're doing in each of those major solutions and products, but we're making very good inroads in each of the 3 divisions. So thank you again."

I'm sure that you have had the chance to review our press release and earnings results for the third quarter, and I'm very pleased with our performance across all divisions, despite the significant currency headwinds and slowdown in emerging markets. 
Net sales of $1.75 billion increased 2.7% on an organic basis, which excludes both FX and the impact from the North American trays and pads divestiture. We experienced organic or constant-dollar sales growth in each of our regions, in both Food Care and Diversey Care. Adjusted EBITDA was $300 million or 72 -- 17.2% of net sales, essentially unchanged on an as-reported dollar basis and an increase of approximately 16% in an organic basis. We delivered 190 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, with improvements across each of our 3 divisions. And free cash flow for the first 9 months of the year was $331 million, and as we head into year-end, we will continue to focus on growth opportunities within our divisions and regions while, at the same time, stay very disciplined on our pricing strategies and cost management to offset currency headwinds. 
Before I pass the call on to Carol and Karl Deily, President of Food Care, for more details on the quarter and outlook, I want to briefly highlight a few items. As we have communicated many times, we are very committed to a disciplined approach to portfolio management with a focus on innovation and becoming a knowledge-based company. To further solidify our position in the growing e-commerce market, we acquired B+ Equipment in early August, a startup company headquartered in France that designs, manufactures and services revolutionary automated packaging systems in -- for order fulfillment operations. With this acquisition, we will add B+ flagship I-Pack system and its recently introduced e-Cube system to our industry-leading portfolio of packaging solutions focused on cube optimization and fulfillment velocity. 
More recently, we completed the sale of our European trays business, a noncore asset within our Food Care division. Similar to our comments around the North American trays and pads business, the European trays business has commoditized and was also facing competitive pricing pressure. This business generated $71 million in sales in 2014 and $44 million in the first 9 months of 2015. 
With that, let's get started with an overview of our financial results. Carol?"

Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA was our fastest-growing region with 4% constant-dollar growth. Latin America and Asia Pacific both delivered 3% growth, and on an organic basis, North America was up just over 1%. 
In EMEA, we continue to see strong constant-dollar growth in Russia and Turkey with 39% and 10% growth, respectively. In Western Europe, we delivered 7% growth in Spain and approximately 3% to 4% growth in Italy and Holland. France, Germany and the U.K. were flat compared to last year. These 8 countries in our EMEA region account for approximately 23% of our total net sales. 
In Latin America, we had strong constant-dollar performance in Mexico and Argentina with 17% growth and nearly 30% growth, respectively. These growth trends were offset by expected weakness in Brazil, which declined 7% as well as the region being impacted by the collapse of Venezuela. Asia Pacific was led by 6% growth in Australia and 3% growth in New Zealand. As we anticipated, China, which accounts for approximately 3% of net total sales, was soft and declined by 1%. In North America, Diversey Care delivered 8% growth, followed by 2% growth in Food Care and a decline of 4% in Product Care. 
In Diversey Care, more than 4% of the growth in the quarter was due to increased demand while the remaining growth came from sales into our distribution channel, which we believe to be a partial pull-forward from the fourth quarter. In Product Care, sales were impacted primarily from our rationalization efforts and pockets of weakness throughout the industrial sectors. 
Turning to Slide 5. Let me walk you through our net sales bridge for the quarter. Favorable price/mix was 2.1% or $42 million on volumes that were up $11 million. Unfavorable currency translation had an impact on net sales of $230 million or 12%, mostly due to year-over-year declines in the euro, Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Russian ruble and the Canadian dollar. Net sales on an organic basis were up 2.7%, and on an as-reported basis, net sales declined 11.6%. 
On Slide 6, we outline our price/mix, volume and sales trends on a constant-dollar and organic basis. As you can see from the slide, we had favorable price/mix in every division and in every region. Volume trends were up nicely in Diversey Care and essentially flat in Food Care. Excluding rationalization efforts in Product Care, volumes would have also been flat as compared to last year's performance. By region, volume was up in EMEA and Asia Pacific, flat in North America and down nearly 9% in Latin America. 
On Slide 7, you can see our adjusted EBITDA performance for the quarter and first 9 months of the year. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $300 million or 17.2% of net sales was essentially unchanged on an as-reported basis compared to our performance in the third quarter of 2014. However, excluding $39 million in unfavorable currency and the impact from the divestiture, adjusted EBITDA increased 15.6%. This increase was largely due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of $36 million and cost synergies of $11 million. We are pleased to have delivered 190 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to last year, despite unfavorable currency and the impact of the divestiture. 
Karl will highlight the adjusted EBITDA performance by division, but I want to mention that our medical business had a strong performance in the quarter and was the primary driver behind the year-over-year improvement in the net expense of medical and corporate, which is categorized as other in our adjusted EBITDA financial tables. For the full year, we now expect medical and corporate to be a net expense of approximately $70 million. 
Adjusted net earnings of $143 million or $0.70 per share compares to adjusted net earnings of $112 million or $0.53 in the third quarter last year. Currency negatively impacted adjusted EPS in the third quarter 2015 by $0.12. Unfavorable FX was offset by higher earnings from operations, lower interest expense, a lower core tax rate and share repurchases. 
The core tax rate for Q3 2015 was 18.8% as compared with 28% for Q3 2014, which, on a year-over-year basis, positively impacted 2015 adjusted EPS in the third quarter by $0.08. The lower core tax rate in the quarter was related to the recording of net foreign tax credits. Year-to-date, our core tax rate was 24.3%, and we still anticipate our full year tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
On an as-reported basis, net earnings in the third quarter were $87 million or $0.42 per share. Net earnings include $57 million of special items, primarily consisting of restructuring and other associated costs as well as a tax reserve recorded in relation to the $235 million tax refund we received earlier in the year. The net tax reserve recorded in the quarter was $16 million, which reflects the tax reserve on the refund, offset by the release of certain tax reserves recorded at the time of the Diversey Care acquisition. 
In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 11.3 million shares for a total value of approximately $576 million, using a combination of open market and ASR. Share repurchases had a year-over-year favorable impact on adjusted EPS of $0.03. Year-to-date, we repurchased a total of 14.5 million shares for a total value of $726 million. 
I will now turn the call over to Karl, who will provide you with a more detailed review of Food Care as well as highlight the performance of Diversey Care and Product Care."

In the third quarter, Food Care sales increased 3.1% on an organic basis, with growth across all regions. Favorable price/mix was 2.8% on essentially flat volumes. We had favorable price/mix trends and, more importantly, positive volume trends in every region except Latin America, where volume was negatively impacted by general political and economic conditions in Brazil and Venezuela. Excluding Latin America, volume would have been up approximately 2% to 3% globally. Our results in price/mix demonstrate our global pricing disciplines as well as our success managing pricing in countries where currency devaluations have occurred. 
Europe, Middle East, Africa or EMEA delivered 5% constant-dollar growth. Russia continues to be our fastest-growing country due to the strength of penetration of the protein markets as well as adoption of our advanced packaging solutions. Our business in Western Europe is benefiting from a slowly recovering economy where demand for beef is increasing. In addition, we are experiencing strong acceptance of our new products, particularly our Darfresh On Tray and some of our new advanced ready-meal solutions. 
In Latin America, sales were up 3.4% in constant dollars. Double-digit constant-dollar growth in Mexico and Argentina more than offset expected weaknesses in Brazil and Venezuela. In Brazil, our business is being negatively impacted by the decline in local beef consumption due to the economic environment, the decline in the export market and the fact that cattle producers have recently started to rebuild their herds in light of the current market conditions. Also, the sociopolitical factors in Venezuela are having a very significant impact on our business. Despite these short-term challenges, we strongly believe that over the long term, Latin America and specifically Brazil, where the herd size is double the size of North America, is a solid growth opportunity for Food Care. 
Asia Pacific was up 4% in constant dollars as a result of 6% growth in Australia and 5% growth in New Zealand. Since the second quarter of 2014, on average, we have been experiencing high single-digit growth in Australia, where slaughter rates have been at unsustainably high levels. As we previously indicated, we are now seeing the Australian cattle producers start to rebuild their herds after nearly 3 years of drought-induced liquidation. Consequently, we're planning for weaker sales trends in Australia in the upcoming quarters. In New Zealand, we have been experiencing above-market growth. However, we believe this growth is not sustainable due to the impact of the depressed global dairy markets. 
In North America, despite continued mid-single digit declines in the cattle market, we delivered 2% organic sales growth, with nearly 1% volume growth and favorable price/mix. This quarter, our growth in North America was predominantly driven by strength in poultry, smoked and processed meats and fluid-based packaging as a result of a very strong tomato season in California. Fresh red meat was relatively flat due to continued adoption of our advanced product portfolio. 
It's worth noting that the broad acceptance of these new products is driving our above-market growth in North America. I also want to mention that cattle producers continue to rebuild their herds as evidenced by the continued heifer retention. While we continue to anticipate the cattle market to both be weak in quarter 4 and the first half of 2016, there is a strong indication that the cycle is on track to turn positive in mid-2016. 
Our global hygiene business delivered solid growth in APAC and EMEA with improved profitability. This growth was partially offset by weaknesses in Latin American markets. 
Turning to Food Care's adjusted EBITDA performance. Food Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $168 million, a 7% increase on an as-reported basis and a 10% increase on an organic basis. Currency and the divestiture had a $30 million unfavorable impact on adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Margins of 20.1% were up 170 basis points, largely due to improved mix of our premium products, global pricing disciplines and lower input costs. These were partially offset by transactional FX and the divestiture. 
As we head into year-end, we expect further adoption of our new products on a global basis, and we will continue on focusing on adding value-added selling to our customers. However, this will be partially offset by negative formula pricing, particularly in North America, currency headwinds and other external factors. Some of these external factors include ongoing economic challenges in Brazil, Venezuela and the slowdown in Australia, where slaughter rates have been at unsustainable levels. 
In quarter 4, as reported, adjusted EBITDA in absolute dollars will be down on a year-over-year basis. However, adjusted EBITDA on an organic basis, which excludes FX and the divestiture, is expected to increase in the high single digits. Given our performance year-to-date and the outlook for quarter 4, we are clearly on track to deliver a strong EBITDA growth and margin expansion for the full year 2015. 
So I'd like to turn our attention now to Slide 9,  which highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant-dollar basis were up approximately 4% in the third quarter. Volume increased 2.5%, with favorable trends in every region except for Latin America, where volume was negatively impacted by weakness in Brazil. Price/mix was favorable 1.4%, primarily driven by pricing initiatives. 
As Carol indicated earlier, our strongest region in Diversey Care was North America. Our recent customer wins are ramping up nicely, and we are continuing to see solid growth in our infection prevention solutions. We also had a strong performance in EMEA and APAC, with constant-dollar sales growth of 3% in the quarter. EMEA accounts for approximately 50% of our net sales. We have made significant progress and are seeing stabilizing trends throughout our largest markets in Western Europe. Among our largest customers in EMEA, we are experiencing double-digit growth in Turkey and positive sales in France, Italy, Holland, Germany and Spain. 
In APAC, we experienced high single-digit growth in India and a slight uptick in China while all other emerging markets declined. Latin America sales on a constant-dollar basis were essentially unchanged compared to last year's performance. For the second consecutive quarter, performance in Latin America was driven by growth in Argentina and Chile, partially offset by high single-digit decline in Brazil. Strength in Argentina and Chile is a result of recent customer wins, growth on equipment sales and increased volume from our distribution partners. 
On the new product front and solutions front, we launched the SURE product line, which is a vegetable-based formula, which is 100% biodegradable and requires no classifications from a regulatory standpoint. We highlighted this at our Analyst Day, and we are excited to have it commercially available in the market. 
Diversey Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $66 million or 13.2% of net sales in the quarter. Currency translation negatively impacted our performance in the quarter and on a reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA declined 5%. In constant dollars, however, adjusted EBITDA was up 12% compared to last year. This growth was driven by higher volumes, cost synergies, lower SG&A, partially offset by the impact of transactional FX, the Intellibot acquisition and the significant deterioration of the economic conditions in Venezuela and Brazil. In quarter 4, we expect continued organic growth in sales and adjusted EBITDA, but to a lesser extent as compared to quarter 3. 
Now let's look at Slide 10, which highlights the results of our Product Care division. Net sales were down 1.7% on a constant-dollar basis, with volume declines of 2.5% more than offsetting favorable price/mix of 0.8%. Third quarter volume was impacted by rationalization efforts in Latin America and, to a lesser extent, North America. Our rationalization efforts are focused on our global packaging solutions and should be mostly behind us by mid-2016. As Carol highlighted earlier, volume was also impacted by weakness in the industrial sectors in North America. Favorable price/mix continues to be driven by our pricing disciplines across both the global packaging -- performance packaging and general packaging sectors. 
On a regional basis, North America net sales were down nearly 4% in constant dollars, of which half of the decline is attributable to rationalization. Unfavorable trends in the industrial sector, particularly manufacturing and transportation, were partially offset by double-digit growth in e-commerce and third-party logistics. We expect strength in e-commerce and 3PLs to continue into year-end, which will help offset rationalization and the softer trends in the industrial market. 
EMEA was up approximately 3% due to increased demand in France and Italy, and it's worth noting that China was up 4%. Performance in China reflects our new leadership in APAC and our renewed targeted efforts to increase market penetration. We are seeing strong interest across the globe in our newly-acquired B+ portfolio, and we are excited to have the team onboard. Both B+ and our recently introduced automatic mailer or flow wrap are designed to deliver cube optimization and efficiency savings for the rapidly-growing e-commerce and fulfillment markets. The flow wrap solution, which is specifically designed for the e-commerce apparel market, is further evidence of our robust development pipeline of automated solutions. 
Let's turn to adjusted EBITDA. Product Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $81 million, a 9% increase on an as-reported basis and 16% in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.1% expanded 340 basis points compared to last year's results. This increase was a result of pricing disciplines associated with our value selling initiatives, an increase of mix of our Global Performance Packaging solutions and lower input cost. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued EBITDA growth and margin expansion. 
Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our cash flow and our outlook. Carol?"

The year-over-year decline",673,"Thank you, Karl. Turning to Slide 11. Free cash flow was a source of $331 million for the first 9 months of the year, excluding the $235 million tax refund. This compares to a source of $371 million for the 9 months ending 2014. The year-over-year decline was primarily attributable to less cash generated from working capital, the payment of 2014 bonuses and unfavorable currency. CapEx was $112 million and cash restructuring costs were $72 million for the 9 months ending September 30, 2015. 
Our updated outlook for 2015 is presented on Slide 12. We now expect net sales to be approximately $7 billion. Unfavorable currency is expected to be approximately 10% or $800 million. Excluding the impact of the North America trays and pads divestiture and currency, we anticipate an organic growth rate of approximately 3%. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2015 is now expected to be approximately $1.165 billion, which is in the midpoint of our previously-provided guidance. This reflects our strong performance in the first 9 months of 2015 and our outlook into year-end. We will continue to face currency challenges and are estimating FX to have a negative impact on full year adjusted EBITDA of approximately $125 million. 
Keep in mind that in Q3 2014, the euro was at $1.34, and in Q4 2014, the euro was at $1.26. Our year-end forecast assumes that in Q4 2015, the euro remains in line with the Q3 rate of approximately $1.10. Other currencies that have experienced devaluation in recent months and as compared to last year's rate, includes the Russian ruble, the Brazilian real, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. 
Our interest expense for 2015 is estimated at $235 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $290 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.32. The adjusted EPS impact from currency is expected to be approximately $0.36. Our previous guidance for adjusted EPS in 2015 was in the range of $2.24 to $2.28. In 2014, we reported adjusted EPS of $1.86. As I highlighted earlier, we have repurchased a total of 14.5 million shares year-to-date. Our adjusted EPS outlook for 2015 is based on 207 million shares, which reflects the weighted average full year effect of the share repurchases completed year-to-date. 
Please note that the divestiture of the European trays business is expected to close in early November. For now, the full year financial estimates for this business are included in our 2015 outlook. Full year 2015 sales from the European trays are expected to be approximately $55 million. Similar to the North America trays and pads business, this disposition does not qualify for discontinued operations. Therefore, prior year and the first 10 months of 2015 financials will include results from our European trays business. 
We are revising our free cash flow guidance to $560 million from $585 million. Our free cash flow outlook excludes the $235 million tax refund. Cash interest payments are expected to be $230 million, and cash tax payments are estimated at $110 million. We are lowering our capital expenditures from $210 million to $190 million and our cash restructuring payments from $120 million to $110 million. Working capital will still be a source of cash, but not at the level we had originally anticipated, largely due to proactive inventory management. We are maintaining higher-than-originally-anticipated inventory levels into year-end to support on-time delivery for our customers in order to meet their service requirements. 
In closing, we have made significant progress in 2015, and we will continue to focus on operational improvements and business trends [ph] to mitigate FX and pockets of economic weakness. When we look beyond 2015, our focus is on new product introductions and investing in innovative technologies that will drive sustainable and profitable growth.

Just could you give us any kind of trajectory on the ability for EBITDA to grow in food in the first half of the year? Obviously, second half, you'll get the benefit from the cattle cycle turning, but how do you feel about your ability to grow given tougher comparisons on pricing? You've obviously had a lot of benefit beginning of the year -- in 2015."

That's broken out in our bridge. You can see that within the Food Care EBITDA bridge. The European business had a similar margin. But what's important to note, as we've highlighted and Karl's commented as well, that business had been -- was deteriorating, becoming commoditized, both North America and Europe, and Europe even more so, so the margins were quickly headed below 10% as well as the product not meeting some of our sustainability requirements.

I guess it's not really that we have been too aggressive in reducing inventory. An important piece of the build that we think we need to do -- or really not build, but maintaining into Q4 is because we do have a go-live for SAP within our Diversey Care business in North America. And anyone who has been through an SAP implementation and go-live will know that it's very prudent to make sure you maintain appropriate inventory levels. It's a great enterprise platform that we'll get a lot of benefit out of that we want to make sure we're cautious and conservative and can meet all of our customer expectations. So that's one of the key drivers, and we've just taken that decision as we head towards the end of the year with an early Q1 go-live. In terms of thinking about color for 2016, we do expect to have a positive impact from working capital and it to be a source of cash in 2016. However, it's important to note, when we came -- when Jerome and I and the rest of the management team really started focusing on working capital beginning in 2013, there were some obvious things we could do that would accrue to our benefit from a cash flow standpoint quicker. As we're moving forward, there's less of those obvious steps to take in the move towards the day in, day out proper management of working capital to sustain the business. We anticipate growth going forward into 2016, and as such, that will impact working capital. But again, that bottom line, we will expect to see positive source of cash for working capital. If we think about EBITDA for 2016, we're still focusing extremely on profitable growth, driving towards our 2018 target of 18% margin that we shared at the Analyst Day in June. Our CapEx for 2016 is still estimated at $275 million. Restructuring, excluding the CapEx restructuring, which is included in the $275 million I shared, is still estimated $110 million to $120 million for 2016."

We've shared previously that SARs are $20 million and the CapEx of $190 million. To get to the $560 million would imply a favorable impact from working capital and other of $55 million, and we have previously estimated that to be somewhere between $100 million and $110 million. With respect to the Diversey Care, I guess, for that, when we look at the cost synergies, I mean, that's the $5 million positive that's ongoing benefit that has helped the business in the quarter. With respect to mix and price/cost spread, we do have a meaningful impact from transactional FX that hits Diversey because of different imports of products based on where the demand's at. We had a particularly negative impact in the U.K. for their business and all driven largely because of transactional FX. So we're not seeing anything that's concerning from a deterioration in margin driven by mix. And actually, as I highlighted and Karl commented, for North America, we're seeing very positive performance relative to mix as we drive expansion of our North America business, add new customers and especially with our product as it supports health care."

I'm very proud of it. And I'm very proud of it because remember the guidance. We gave you a guidance at the beginning of the year in terms of EBITDA and EPS. We raised it in July. We raised that guidance in July. We -- then in September, at John's Crédit Suisse conference, we said watch it, there's an additional headwind of $15 million of currency, and it's going to be really hard to mitigate it. And what are we doing today? We're confirming the July guidance. So I take this as the third time we're increasing -- as the second time we're increasing our guidance. And I'm very pleased with what's going on in an environment, which, in emerging countries, because of commodity pricing, ag commodities or mineral pricing and because of oil and gas prices, et cetera, there in all -- in many emerging countries, which -- but including Australia, Canada, et cetera, are countries where the environment is not easy. And remember that in that environment, we have -- we are increasing our EBITDA and, at the very same time, we are suffering in Q3 only $236 million of transactions in sales and $39 million of EBITDA. So that context is making things good. Your point is very good, which is we haven't gotten very much volume growth, but we had given a guidance for the next 3 years of having a 4% to 5% growth. And I firmly believe we're going to have that, and it's going to be less on pricing, more on volume. And yes, mix is helping, thanks to our innovation products. Every single division has -- is extremely excited about all of this. You should have gone -- I don't know if you have, but you should have gone to PACK EXPO, where we were having a huge booth which was packed like no tomorrow in Las Vegas a few weeks ago. You should have gone to the ISSA, where we got lots of awards for our innovation, et cetera. And you should -- and Karl, maybe you might want to make some comments with regards to our innovation on our best new products, which are making pretty good inroads in Europe, into things. So yes, more volume in 2016 and a little bit less price.

Because logically, you'd expect that the weaker real would start to push up meat exports out of Brazil, and as I've always understood, you make it more on the packaging that goes into the export markets rather than the domestic market. And then as a follow-on, I wondered if you could just also comment on the signs that some of your competitors in the meat packaging business are expanding capacity here in North America."

And it would be intuitive that with the drop of the real, the export market should be increasing. However, there are multiple inputs on those type of issues. And Brazil's primary export customers are Russia, Venezuela, China, all of which have depressed buying due to their social economic issues, as well as Russia becoming more focused on self-manufacture. In addition, Russia has also banned imports from 10 different Brazilian plants. So a lot of that is politically driven, but it still is what it is. And so those have truncated export sales. What Brazil continues to do is look at developing an export market to North America, to Asia. All of those support long-term trends for them. In regards -- I can't really comment on our competitors adding capacity. We obviously believe we have proprietary position, proprietary products and continue to look at evolving our business as well."

We are now looking very deep and organized by business sectors. And general manufacturing has gone down in the mid- to high single digits because of softening of exports and a dramatic slowdown in the oil and gas market, where we have some specialty products there. And for your information, we pack valves, pumps and fitting in that sector, and that has gone seriously down. The second sector which has suffered is the electronics market. You have noted that there are less negative sales growth in tablets, in laptops, in desktops. That has affected our market also. And a little bit in the transportation sector, transportation for us being aviation and automobiles. The spare parts market, specifically for exports, has been going slightly down. All of these -- all of those negative trends have been compensated by a very strong e-commerce business, where we have very, very good value-add solutions. China is up, and it is not up because of industrial GDP, which is fairly muted, but it is up because of our solutions. And we're focused on value-add type of products there. We have had this negative growth as a result of heavy rationalization in Latin America and a little bit in North America also. Europe is doing okay, and we are expecting, definitely, volume growth into next year."

But unless you want to add something, Carol, but she's telling me no. So very frankly, we are -- we're not done with what we want to achieve in terms of quality of our business with our existing portfolio. We have clearly segregated this business into commodities and specialties in every single of the divisions. It's not that I don't like commodities because you can make very nice money with commodities, provided you have best-in-class manufacturing costs, which was not the case in trays, by the way, and provided your investment and your cost to serve is highly competitive. When they're not, when you don't have those 2 conditions, you need to be very careful because you are going to spend a disproportionate amount of time on those commodities compared to serving the markets with our specialty products or specialty solutions. So that's why we're very focused. Our medical business, by the way, is doing wonderful, absolutely wonderful. It is small, but it was not performing at the levels we needed to see it performing, and it really is now doing extremely well. 
So all in all, I want to thank you all. This has been what I call a very strong quarter. This is an outstanding year for us. And remember where we started, we had a guidance originally on EPS at $2.18, if I remember well. We have now an estimate at $2.32, including $0.36 of negative currency. I just call that fabulous. We are improving our EBITDA despite year-to-date $96 million of negative EBITDA compared to last year. I just call that extraordinary. 
And we are doing this because we're very firmly believing that we have room to grow, that there is time for being very firm on our strategy with regards to Get Fit, and we are making great progress. For those of you who were in our Investor Day in June, you have seen what we have in our Change the Game. And I -- we will update you in time as to how we're doing in each of those major solutions and products, but we're making very good inroads in each of the 3 divisions. So thank you again."
