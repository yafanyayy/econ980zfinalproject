We reported Tiffany's fourth quarter and full year results this morning, and I presume you've already had a chance to review the news release. On today's call, Ralph and I will comment on those resu",2734,"Thank you. Greetings from New York, and hello, everyone. We reported Tiffany's fourth quarter and full year results this morning, and I presume you've already had a chance to review the news release. On today's call, Ralph and I will comment on those results and Tiffany's 2015 plans and outlook, and we're pleased to have Frederic join us to wrap up the call with some strategic observations. 
Before I continue, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
Okay, let's begin with an overview of fourth quarter results. Sales performance by region was mostly in line with the holiday sales results we have reported on January 12. Net worldwide sales in the fourth quarter declined 1% but rose 3% on a constant-exchange-rate basis that excludes the translation effect of the stronger U.S. dollar. We expect to see a continuation of that substantial headwind from the strong dollar in 2015. In local currencies, we were pleased that Tiffany performed well in Europe and Asia-Pacific and not surprised that we experienced softness in Japan. However, we were disappointed with the underperformance in the Americas. 
Also in the fourth quarter, the operating margin was down slightly from last year's margin excluding the charge. While gross margin increased in the quarter, the improvement was offset by higher marketing spending and deleveraging of SG&A fixed costs. Interest and other expenses net were above last year but the prior year included a one-time foreign currency transaction gain. The effective tax rate was below last year. So in total net earnings of $1.51 per diluted share in the fourth quarter was up slightly from last year's $1.47 excluding charges and at the high end of the forecast we've provided in January. 
For all of 2014, worldwide net sales rose to $4.25 billion. That represented a 5% increase in dollars or a 7% increase on a constant-exchange-rate basis, which was on top of the 10% increase in 2013 on that same basis. Net earnings for the full year rose 167% to $484 million or $3.73 per diluted share. However, on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding charges in both years, net earnings rose 13% and EPS of $4.20 was slightly better than the original guidance of $4.05 to $4.15 that we published at this time a year ago. And that 13% earnings increase in 2014 was on top of the non-GAAP 15% increase in net earnings that we achieved in 2013. 
Let's now look at the details of our regional sales performance. First, there were minimal changes in our regional sales mix in 2014. The Americas represented 48% of worldwide net sales in 2014, unchanged from 2013. Asia-Pacific was 24% of worldwide sales, up slightly from 23% a year ago. Japan was 13%, down slightly from 14% in 2013 and that was largely due to currency translation, and Europe at 12% of worldwide sales was unchanged. 
Let's look at the Americas which had a good year albeit finished on a soft note. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, both total sales and comp store sales were unchanged in the fourth quarter versus the 7% comp increase last year. However, for the full year, on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales and comps rose 6% on top of a 3% comp increase in 2013. In dollars, total sales in the Americas declined 1% in the quarter due to lower units sold offsetting favorable average price and mix. A 6% sales increase in the full year reflected favorable average price and mix partly offset by jewelry unit declines in silver jewelry under $500. 
The strong U.S. dollar had a minimal negative translation effect on the Americas sales but is having an adverse affect on foreign tourist spending in the U.S. especially in New York, and this effect certainly worsened in the latter part of 2014. Foreign tourist spending had historically represented about 1/4 of annual U.S. sales, although we no longer can precisely measure it due to privacy loss in some large markets. But we can safely say it is a meaningful portion of the region's sales and, in fact, continue to represent more than 40% of sales in the New York flagship store in 2014. We attribute the Americas comp decline in the fourth quarter to softness that was broad-based geographically across the U.S. and in most product categories except fashion jewelry. On a related note, while the TIFFANY T collection performed very well, it is possible that the concentrated advertising focus on that collection may not have benefited other collections as we had expected. We attribute the softness in the under $500 silver jewelry category to a lack of product newness and marketing focus and, perhaps, also the competitive and macro pressures on the jewelry purchaser at those price points. So we do have some opportunity to fine-tune our approaches to those issues within our control. Elsewhere in the Americas, we were pleased with solid total sales growth in Canada and Latin America on a constant-exchange-rate basis in both the fourth quarter and the full year. 
We finished the year operating 122 Tiffany stores in the Americas versus 121 at the end of 2013. During the year, we opened 3 stores in the region on Boston's Newbury Street, in Florida's Aventura Mall and in Cancun, Mexico; and we closed 2 small stores in East Hampton New York and then a whole [indiscernible] department store in Ottawa, Canada. Already in early February, we've opened a stunning store in the new Miami design district. 
Let's now turn to the Asia-Pacific region. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 7% in the quarter and comps rose 3% on top of a 4% comp increase in last year's quarter, while for the full year total sales rose 10% and comps rose 4% on top of an 11% comp increase in 2013. Translated into U.S. dollars, Asia-Pacific sales increased 4% in the fourth quarter due to favorable average price and mix partly offset by some unit declines. Sales in the full year rose 9% due to favorable average jewelry price and mix as well as higher jewelry units sold. Quarterly sales performance in Asia-Pacific on a constant-exchange-rate basis was led by strong growth in China, Australia and Singapore, partly offset by softness in Hong Kong, while for the full the full year we were pleased to achieve broad-based growth in most countries. Sales in Greater China, with a total of 45 stores in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau, continue to represent more than half of Asia-Pacific region sales in 2014. Starting in the third quarter, Tiffany has seen a marked softening of sales results in Hong Kong, and we're also experiencing weakness in Macau. We believe that some tourists may be diverting their travel to other markets or perhaps increasing their spending locally. 
So we concluded 2014 operating 73 Tiffany stores in the Asia-Pacific region versus 72 at the end of 2013. Opening only 1 store in this region during the year in Adelaide, Australia is not indicative of our planned rate of annual expansion. However, 3 stores that we had planned to open in the region last year were temporarily delayed, two of those stores in China in the Mixi [ph] Mall in Hangzhou and in the New World Daimru [ph] department store in Shanghai have already opened this year. 
It was certainly a volatile year for us in Japan, dealing with the effect of an increase in the consumption tax on April 1 followed by the effect of the weakening yen and then an economic recession. When measured in yen, total sales in Japan increased 1% in the fourth quarter due to favorability in average price and mix, mostly offset by a decline in jewelry units sold. For the full year, a 4% total sales increase in yen was due to favorable price and mix also partly offset by a decline in jewelry units sold. Comp store sales declined 5% in yen in the quarter versus an 8% increase in last year's fourth quarter and comps increased 1% for the full year versus a 10% increase in 2013. So while we definitely had our challenges in Japan in 2014, we believe our 2-year run rate is respectable. 
The yen weakened 8% on average against the U.S. dollar in 2014, and that's after weakening about 20% on average in 2013. Therefore, when translated into dollars, total sales in Japan declined 13% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year. Such a substantial movement in the yen has clearly caused softness in spending by Japanese tourists when they travel but might be supporting some local spending in Japan. In addition, although we have seen a gradual increase in spending by Chinese tourists in Japan, overall spending by foreign tourists visiting Japan is still not yet meaningful for us. During 2014 we opened 2 stores in Japan in Kobei [ph] and in the Shinjuku center of Tokyo and finished the year operating 56 Tiffany stores. 
Now turning to Europe. We also faced some macroeconomic challenges but nonetheless performed well. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 9% in the fourth quarter led by growth in our 3 major continental European markets of Germany, Italy and France, and comp store sales rose 4%. On a net basis, for the full year, total sales rose 6% but comp store sales declined 1%. Sales in the U.K. represented about 40% of total Europe in 2014 and its performance was relatively softer than Continental Europe in both the quarter and full year. 
The euro and the pound weakened against the U.S. dollar in 2014. Therefore, when translated into US dollars, total European sales in the fourth quarter were flat with the prior year with no significant changes in jewelry units sold price or mix, while conversely, for the full year, total sales rose 6% due to similar favorability in jewelry units sold average price and mix. Those weaker currencies have likely contributed to the attractiveness of shopping in Europe and foreign tourist spending represents approximately 1/4 of our European sales. 
During 2014, we expanded Tiffany's presence in Paris with the opening of a major store on the important Champs Elysees. The prominent corner location is enjoying a successful first year serving foreign tourists as well as Parisians and is an important complement to Tiffany's other stores on Rue de la Paix and in the Galeries Lafayette and [indiscernible] department stores. We finished the year operating 38 stores in Europe. 
Rounding out the geographies is our other segment, which primarily consist of retail store sales in the United Arab Emirates and Russia as well as wholesale diamond sales and some licensing revenues. In the fourth quarter, other sales increased 12% due to incremental sales from our store that we opened in Moscow in February 2014, while comp store sales declined 8% due to soft demand in the 5 stores we operate in the UAE, although I should add that this compared with a strong 23% comp increase in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, other sales rose 26%, partly due to the Moscow store sales as well as an 8% increase in comp store sales. 
So in total we opened 8 company-operated Tiffany and stores in 2014 and closed 2. That net addition of 6 stores was a 2% increase in our store base and a 3% increase in worldwide square footage. You should also keep in mind that beyond opening new stores, we are equally focused on enhancing the quality of our existing store base, and as such, we will be pursuing a number of relocations and some major renovations in 2015. We are currently planning to increase our company-operated stores by a net of approximately 12 to 15 stores during 2015. A majority of that net addition is planned in Asia-Pacific with the balance in the Americas and Europe. In total, this will represent a 4% to 5% net increase in our company-operated store base and in worldwide square footage. 
Looking at regional sales productivity in 2014. Total sales in dollars for gross square foot for company-operated stores was unchanged at approximately $3,100. By region, the ranking remained unchanged from the prior year with Asia-Pacific continuing to rank highest with $5,000 productivity versus $4,800 in 2013 followed by Japan at $3,400 versus $3,800 in 2013, then Europe at $3,200 down from $3,300 in 2013 to the Americas at $2,500 per square foot, up from $2,400 in 2013. 
At this point, it's also worth mentioning the effectiveness of Tiffany's omni-channel platform. Our company-operated store base is complemented by e-commerce-enabled websites in 13 countries and informational sites in several others. We have a dual objective of generating e-commerce sales growth in each region but importantly also communicating Tiffany's brand and product message to consumers in order to drive store traffic as well. The total e-commerce sales continued to represent 6% of net worldwide sales in 2014. 
There were some noteworthy merchandising highlights in 2014. First, we were pleased to experience growth in all major categories for the year led by growth in our fashion jewelry category and specifically in gold jewelry. We also saw healthy growth in engagement jewelry in 2014 but only modest growth in the statement fine an solitaire category. From a worldwide price stratification perspective, there was sales growth in every price strata above $500 up to statement jewelry above $50,000. 
Following on the successful launch in 2013 and the exciting reinterpretation of our ATLAS collection, our design team created another success with their modern innovative new TIFFANY T collection. Ranging in price from a few hundred dollars to $20,000, the TIFFANY T collection is targeted towards stylish female self-purchase customers as well as attracting gift purchasers, and as intended, its appeal is global. Consistent with our brand strategy, it's worth noting that TIFFANY T continues our evolution toward introducing compelling designs at higher price points and in its first few months is generating the highest ever average transactions size for a new fashion jewelry collection at Tiffany. On a related note, while those ATLAS and TIFFANY T incorporate the use of various precious metals, we have seen a clear preference for the gold designs. In fact, that trend is evident throughout the fashion jewelry category with considerable strength in gold jewelry sales being partly offset by the softness in silver jewelry sales especially in that price strata under $500. 
I should also call out the resurgence of our Keys collection, originally introduced in 2009 but expanded over the past 2 years with beautiful new designs incorporating colored gemstones as well as rose gold. I mentioned sales growth in the engagement jewelry category, which is led of course by the popularity of our iconic 6 prong setting. A strong addition to the engagement category has been the Harmony engagement ring, which, in just over 2 years, has become our second-best selling style in our bridal assortment. And sales of wedding band rings in the engagement category were strong in the year. Overall, sales growth in the engagement category was led by strength in the Asia-Pacific and Americas regions. 
The more modest sales increase in fine and solitaire jewelry in 2014 was spread among various collections and designs, with noteworthy [indiscernible] being the classic Victoria collection with new styles added in 2014 and the beautiful Celeste collection, which is diamond-focused and was expanded in 2014 to incorporate a greater use of colored stones. As on a side and a possible explanation for some of the softness in fine solitaire jewelry sales, especially in the fourth quarter, we've heard anecdotal speculation that strong demand for the TIFFANY T collection may have pulled some demand from the fine jewelry category. 
Lastly, while there was some plenty of activity in high-end statement jewelry in 2014, worldwide sales of that category were about equal to the prior year's level. I hope you now have a better understanding of Tiffany's top line performance in 2014, and I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Ralph."
35576,286316205,784950,"Tiffany & Co., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Mar 20, 2015",2015-03-20,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thank you, Mark, for that comprehensive sales review. Reflecting on 2014, I'd like to highlight a few important points before getting into the specifics. We're effectively executing our strategies to continue to strengthen and elevate the Tiffany brand. I",1942,"Thank you, Mark, for that comprehensive sales review. Reflecting on 2014, I'd like to highlight a few important points before getting into the specifics. We're effectively executing our strategies to continue to strengthen and elevate the Tiffany brand. In 2014, we expanded our global footprint in key locations. We strengthened our position in the important fashion jewelry category with the introduction of the TIFFANY T collection and we advanced key product development initiatives for introduction in 2015 and beyond. We improved gross margin and operating margin while increasing our investment in marketing, and we strengthened our balance sheet by keeping inventory growth to a lower rate than sales growth, and we lowered our cost of debt significantly while extending maturities and generating strong free cash flow. 
As we exited 2014, we were clearly facing challenges in 2015 from the strong U.S. dollar. Tourist purchases are expected to continue to be pressured in the Americas. Gross margin is expected to improve in 2015 but at a lesser rate than in 2014 and negative translation is expected to continue to mute sales and earnings growth. However, we have the ability to continue to invest in the Tiffany brand and improve our capabilities to continue to deliver value for our shareholders over time. 
Now that I bring that overall message, let's take a look at the rest of the components in the earnings statement that, excluding charges in 2014 and 2013, contributed to deliver -- contributed to our delivering the 13% increase in net earnings for the full year. Gross margin in the year rose 1.6 points to 59.7%, benefiting from favorable product input cost, price increases taken earlier in the year and a sales mix that move favorably toward our higher-margin fashion jewelry category later in the year. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 0.3 points higher than the prior year. We're continuing to experience some benefit from favorable product input costs, which we believe will help gross margin in 2015. 
From a pricing perspective, the substantial weakening of the yen, euro and pound would normally result in our taking price increases in those regions to fully offset the negative impacts. However, in light of the magnitude of those currency swings and considering local conditions, we are taking only measured price increases in this first quarter. As a result, we expect a modest increase in gross margin in 2015. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6% in the full year partly due to a combination of higher label, higher labor and other store-related costs as well as a substantial increase as expected in marketing spending. In fact, for the full year, we increased marketing spending to 6.7% of net sales from 6.3% in 2013. SG&A expenses rose only 1% in the fourth quarter as higher marketing spending was mostly offset by the translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar. I think most of you know that about 80% of our SG&A expenses are fixed in nature, and we have said that we require a mid-single-digit comp store sales increase to gain leverage on those costs. Therefore, our sales growth in 2014 was not sufficient to achieve the leverage on those costs. Based on our current sales outlook, we expect SG&A expenses will increase at a greater rate than sales growth in 2015. This expected increase in the expense ratio partially reflects our store expansion and marketing plans but also reflects a meaningful increase of approximately $30 million of noncash expense resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions principally reflecting lower interest rates for our U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans. In fact, that $30 million increase alone restrains EPS growth in 2015 by $0.15 per diluted share. 
Operating earnings on a non-GAAP basis declined 3% in the fourth quarter and rose 12% in the full year when excluding the arbitration charge in 2013 as well as the smaller expense growth that year related to staffing and occupancy reductions. The operating margin rose to 21% in the full year 2014 versus an adjusted 19.7% in 2013 and a margin of 18.4% in 2012. Our expectation calls for operating earnings in 2015 to be about equal to the prior year. 
As you probably know, we had redeemed $400 million of long-term debt in the third quarter and issued $550 million of debt. This was a significant step in lowering our interest cost and extending maturities. The net effect of these debt transactions was a $15 million reduction in interest expense or $3 million to $4 million per quarter, which we began to experience in the fourth quarter and is incorporated in our full year projection of approximately $50 million of interest and other expense in 2015. 
The effective tax rate was 32.9% in the fourth quarter and 34.4% in the full year. The effective tax rates in 2013 were 36.1% in the fourth quarter and 34.8% in the full year when excluding the charge for the inverse arbitration ruling. We expect the effective tax rate in 2015 to be about equivalent to the rate in 2014. 
So adding it all up, net earnings were $196 million in the fourth quarter and were 3% higher than net earnings of $190 million in last year's fourth quarter excluding the arbitration-related charge. For the full year, net earnings were $484 million or $3.73 per share compared with $181 million or $1.41 per diluted share in the prior year. However, excluding those charges in both years, net earnings rose 13% to $545 million or $4.20 per share, up from $481 million or $3.73 per share in 2013. 
Our balance sheet was strong at January 31, 2015. Net inventory rose 2% in 2014 to finish the year at $2.4 billion. The overall increase supported new stores, product introductions and expanded offerings, and we were pleased with the level of inventory availability in our stores. The 2% increase included a 4% increase in finished goods and a 2% decrease in combined raw materials and work in process inventories. Inventories would've grown 6% and still below the rate of sales growth excluding the effect of foreign currency translation. In addition, I believe you all understand that the year-end inventory level was impacted by the unanticipated sales office in the fourth quarter. So whether measured in dollars or on a constant-exchange-rate basis, both the 2% and 6% increases, respectively, met our long-term objective to keep growth and inventories below sales growth. Our 2015 plan calls for minimal inventory growth in dollars in the full year. Accounts receivable rose 3% in 2014 to $195 million in line with sales growth. Receivables are turning at 21x per year. 
Capital expenditures were $247 million in 2014. That was an increase from $221 million in 2013 due to increased spending on systems and internal manufacturing capacity. CapEx was 6% of worldwide net sales versus 5% in the prior year. Approximately half of our capital spending goes toward store openings, renovation and relocations. We are forecasting CapEx at around $260 million for 2015. 
We spent $500 million in the fourth quarter to repurchase 53,000 shares. In the full year, we spent $27 million and bought 301,000 shares at an average cost just under $90 per share. At year-end, we had $273 million available for future repurchases under the current authorization that runs through March of 2017. We believe that share repurchases and dividend growth are appropriate long-term measures to return excess cash to shareholders. Putting it all together, we generated free cash flow of $368 million, which included the effect of $61 million after-tax debt extinguishment charge and expect to generate free cash flow exceeding $400 million in 2015. 
We finished 2014 with a solid balance sheet and liquidity. Total short-term and long-term debt was $1.1 billion or 39% of stockholders' equity versus $1 billion and 37% a year ago. Tiffany's return on assets and stockholders' equity were 10% and 17%, respectively in 2014 and clearly meeting our long-term objectives for at least 10% ROA and a 15% ROE. 
Turning to our financial forecast for 2015, I've already highlighted our assumptions for the operating margin, interest and other expenses and the effective tax rate. In terms of our sales forecast, we believe that taking a cautious view in certain markets is appropriate in light of what we saw in the fourth quarter, specifically the strength of the U.S. dollar as well as challenging conditions in certain markets. In total, we are planning a mid-single digit percent increase in worldwide net sales in local currencies, which will translate into low single-digit increase in dollars for the full year. 
While we don't typically talk about quarterly forecast, we think you should be aware that we have a very difficult comparison in Japan to a 30% comp increase in last year's first quarter, but we've also continued to experience softness in the Americas, both of which will contribute to a forecasted 10% sales decline in the first quarter on a reported basis in U.S. dollars. Combined with our assumptions for operating margin, interest expense and the effective tax rate, we are forecasting minimal growth in the full year EPS over the $4.20 per share excluding charges that Tiffany earned in 2014. This is not indicative in any way of Tiffany's long-term earnings power but is a reflection of the various macro challenges currently affecting us. As I mentioned, the expected minimal EPS growth in 2015 incorporates the noncash increase in employee benefit related expenses costing $0.15 per share or about 4% of earnings growth. And of course, it's safe to add that the strong U.S. dollar is costing us a few percentage points of earnings growth. So without those 2 factors, we would've been looking at high single-digit increase in EPS. 
The change between our original preliminary 2015 guidance that we provided in January calling for mid to single digit increase in net earnings for the year and our current forecast of minimal earnings growth in 2015 is essentially the result of the added noncash pension expense and the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar since then. 
I'd now like to highlight the pacing of our expected sales and earnings in 2015, which will be affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Japan's volatility in 2014 and the timing of marketing spending. From a quarterly perspective, based on the top line challenges in this first quarter, we expect that first quarter EPS could be 3% lower than the $0.97 we earned last year, which had represented a 49% increase over the prior year. We expect that the second quarter will also show a net earnings decline but at a more modest rate pressured by the continuation of the strong dollar and substantial marketing spending tied to the watch launch, and then we expect net earnings to grow by double-digit percentages in both the third and fourth quarters. So just to make it clear, our sales and earnings plans assume progressively improving performance as we move through the year. 
In conclusion, I joined Tiffany just about a year ago. Since then, we've been focusing on a number of fronts including, but not limited to, effectively allocating resources for growth, driving improvements in cost and inventory management and doing all of this in a tax-efficient manner. I'm very excited about our opportunities to grow Tiffany's business in an increasingly profitable and productive way. 
I presume you all are aware that Tiffany's Chief Executive Officer, Mike Kowalski, will be retiring from Tiffany on March 31 and remain as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. On April, 1 Frederic Cumenal, currently Tiffany's President, will become CEO. I am now very pleased to turn the call over to Frederic."

Thanks, Ralph and Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'm glad to have this opportunity to briefly share with you my thoughts about Tiffany's business and our exciting brand. First, I believe we achieved good financial [indiscernible] in 2014",590,"Thanks, Ralph. Thanks, Ralph and Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'm glad to have this opportunity to briefly share with you my thoughts about Tiffany's business and our exciting brand. First, I believe we achieved good financial [indiscernible] in 2014 but certainly finished the year on a disappointing note primarily in the Americas. While we know about the inevitable challenges arising from the strong U.S. dollar, we can and we'll be nimble in fine-tuning product developments and marketing communications. Most important, we have a clear road map for the future focused on the store experience, products, marketing, logistics and margin improvement. I'm pleased with the progress that our company made in 2014 in these areas that I believe will drive our longer-term success. 
That strategic direction focuses on continued elevation as a global luxury brand in our stores while striving to better engage customers through a more consultative approach and with enhanced visual merchandising presentations. Over the next couple of years, we will strengthen our ability when we finish developing a global CRM system in order to better analyze our customer base and shopping patterns. We have [indiscernible] some major stores in key markets in 2014 and I'm partially speaking of the new ones in Paris and Moscow. Our strategy includes further investing in our distribution base with new stores likely at the rate of 10 to 15 stores per year when we find the right opportunities but also enhancing the impressions we create with customers through renovations, relocations and even some select closings. 
In 2014, we increased our focus on the stylish female self purchase consumer when we introduced the dramatic and innovative TIFFANY T collection following the successful debut in 2013 of our reinterpreted ATLAS collection. Our strategy includes launching additional collections in the coming years, but our design group will also be refreshing our product assortment with important new interpretations of our iconic collections. And in April, we will probably introduce to the world CT60 [ph] a major new collection of watches as the first step in a long-term investment to build a meaningful watch business. To enhance our growth potential last year, our talented marketing team further developed impactful messages of customer relevance. Operationally, we've continued to expand our capabilities in manufacturing and sourcing while focused on maximizing the efficiencies of that supply chain which should enable us to further improve our gross margin in the coming years. From an IT perspective, we are continuing to invest in new systems to support our long-term objectives. 
So we entered 2015 with many exciting plans but also with a cautious short-term review regarding the external challenges and uncertainties affecting our business. We believe that planning for modest sales growth and minimal earnings growth is both prudent and justifiable. However, we remain competently focused on that strategic road map I referred to by investing in various facets of our business to achieve healthy results over the long term. We have made key additions to our management team in the past couple of years both in New York and in our regions, which reinforces my confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term growth. Tiffany has accumulating amazing heritage since its founding 178 years ago.

Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Okay, let's begin with an overview of fourth quarter results. Sales performance by region was mostly in line with the holiday sales results we have reported on January 12. Net worldwide sales in the fourth quarter declined 1% but rose 3% on a constant-exchange-rate basis that excludes the translation effect of the stronger U.S. dollar. We expect to see a continuation of that substantial headwind from the strong dollar in 2015. 
In local currencies, we were pleased that Tiffany performed well in Europe and Asia-Pacific and not surprised that we experienced softness in Japan. However, we were disappointed with the underperformance in the Americas. 
Also in the fourth quarter, the operating margin was down slightly from last year's margin excluding the charge. While gross margin increased in the quarter, the improvement was offset by higher marketing spending and deleveraging of SG&A fixed costs. Interest and other expenses net were above last year but the prior year included a onetime foreign currency transaction gain. The effective tax rate was below last year. So in total net earnings of $1.51 per diluted share in the fourth quarter was up slightly from last year's $1.47, excluding charges, and at the high end of the forecast we've provided in January. 
For all of 2014, worldwide net sales rose to $4.25 billion. That represented a 5% increase in dollars or a 7% increase on a constant-exchange-rate basis, which was on top of the 10% increase in 2013 on that same basis. 
Net earnings for the full year rose 167% to $484 million or $3.73 per diluted share. However, on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding charges in both years, net earnings rose 13%, and EPS of $4.20 was slightly better than the original guidance of $4.05 to $4.15 that we published at this time a year ago. And that 13% earnings increase in 2014 was on top of the non-GAAP 15% increase in net earnings that we achieved in 2013. 
Let's now look at the details of our regional sales performance. First, there were minimal changes in our regional sales mix in 2014. The Americas represented 48% of worldwide net sales in 2014, unchanged from 2013. Asia-Pacific was 24% of worldwide sales, up slightly from 23% a year ago. Japan was 13%, down slightly from 14% in 2013 and that was largely due to currency translation, and Europe at 12% of worldwide sales was unchanged. 
Let's look at the Americas, which had a good year but finished on a soft note. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, both total sales and comp store sales were unchanged in the fourth quarter versus the 7% comp increase last year. However, for the full year, on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales and comps rose 6% on top of a 3% comp increase in 2013. In dollars, total sales in the Americas declined 1% in the quarter due to lower units sold offsetting favorable average price and mix. A 6% sales increase in the full year reflected favorable average price and mix partly offset by jewelry unit declines in silver jewelry under $500. 
The strong U.S. dollar had a minimal negative translation effect on the Americas sales but is having an adverse affect on foreign tourist spending in the U.S., especially in New York, and this effect certainly worsened in the latter part of 2014. Foreign tourist spending has historically represented about 1/4 of annual U.S. sales, although we no longer can precisely measure it due to privacy laws in some large markets. But we can safely say it is a meaningful portion of the region's sales and, in fact, continue to represent more than 40% of sales in the New York flagship store in 2014. We attribute the Americas comp decline in the fourth quarter to softness that was broad-based geographically across the U.S. and in most product categories except fashion jewelry. 
On a related note, while the Tiffany T collection performed very well, it is possible that the concentrated advertising focus on that collection may not have benefited other collections as we had expected. We attribute the softness in the under $500 silver jewelry category to a lack of product newness and marketing focus and perhaps, also, the competitive and macro pressures on the jewelry purchaser at those price points. So we do have some opportunity to fine-tune our approaches to those issues within our control. Elsewhere in the Americas, we were pleased with solid total sales growth in Canada and Latin America on a constant-exchange-rate basis in both the fourth quarter and the full year. 
We finished the year operating 122 Tiffany stores in the Americas versus 121 at the end of 2013. During the year, we opened 3 stores in the region on Boston's Newbury Street, in Florida's Aventura Mall and in Cancun, Mexico; and we closed 2 small stores in East Hampton, New York and in the Holt Renfrew department store in Ottawa, Canada. Already in early February, we've opened a stunning store in the new Miami Design District. 
Let's now turn to the Asia-Pacific region. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 7% in the quarter and comps rose 3% on top of a 4% comp increase in last year's quarter. While for the full year, total sales rose 10% and comps rose 4% on top of an 11% comp increase in 2013. Translated into U.S. dollars, Asia-Pacific sales increased 4% in the fourth quarter due to favorable average price and mix partly offset by some unit declines. Sales in the full year rose 9% due to favorable average jewelry price and mix as well as higher jewelry units sold. Quarterly sales performance in Asia-Pacific on a constant-exchange-rate basis was led by strong growth in China, Australia and Singapore, partly offset by softness in Hong Kong, while for the full the full year we were pleased to achieve broad-based growth in most countries. Sales in Greater China, with a total of 45 stores in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau, continue to represent more than half of Asia-Pacific region sales in 2014. Starting in the third quarter, Tiffany has seen a marked softening of sales results in Hong Kong, and we're also experiencing weakness in Macau. We believe that some tourists may be diverting their travel to other markets or perhaps increasing their spending locally. 
So we concluded 2014 operating 73 Tiffany stores in the Asia-Pacific region versus 72 at the end of 2013. Opening only 1 store in this region during the year in Adelaide, Australia is not indicative of our planned rate of annual expansion. However, 3 stores that we had planned to open in the region last year were temporarily delayed, 2 of those stores in China, in the MixC mall in Hangzhou and in the New World Daimaru department store in Shanghai, have already opened in this year. 
It was certainly a volatile year for us in Japan, dealing with the effect of an increase in the consumption tax on April 1 followed by the effect of a weakening yen and then an economic recession. When measured in yen, total sales in Japan increased 1% in the fourth quarter due to favorability in average price and mix, mostly offset by a decline in jewelry units sold. For the full year, a 4% total sales increase in yen was due to favorable price and mix also partly offset by a decline in jewelry units sold. Comp store sales declined 5% in yen in the quarter versus an 8% increase in last year's fourth quarter, and comps increased 1% for the full year versus a 10% increase in 2013. So while we definitely had our challenges in Japan in 2014, we believe our 2-year run rate is respectable. 
The yen weakened 8% on average against the U.S. dollar in 2014, and that's after weakening about 20% on average in 2013. Therefore, when translated into dollars, total sales in Japan declined 13% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year. Such a substantial movement in the yen has clearly caused softness in spending by Japanese tourists when they travel but might be supporting some local spending in Japan. In addition, although we have seen a gradual increase in spending by Chinese tourists in Japan, overall spending by foreign tourists visiting Japan is still not yet meaningful for us. During 2014 we opened 2 stores in Japan in Kobe and in the Shinjuku section of Tokyo and finished the year operating 56 Tiffany stores. 
Now turning to Europe. We also faced some macroeconomic challenges, but nonetheless, performed well. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 9% in the fourth quarter led by growth in our 3 major continental European markets of Germany, Italy and France, and comp store sales rose 4%. On net basis for the full year, total sales rose 6% but comp store sales declined 1%. Sales in the U.K. represented about 40% of total Europe in 2014, and its performance was relatively softer than continental Europe in both the quarter and full year. 
The euro and the pound weakened against the U.S. dollar in 2014. Therefore, when translated into US dollars, total European sales in the fourth quarter were flat with the prior year with no significant changes in jewelry units sold, price or mix. While conversely for the full year, total sales rose 6% due to similar favorability in jewelry units sold, average price and mix. Those weaker currencies have likely contributed to the attractiveness of shopping in Europe, and foreign tourist spending represents approximately 1/4 of our European sales. 
During 2014, we expanded Tiffany's presence in Paris with the opening of a major store on the important Champs Elysées. The prominent corner location is enjoying a successful first year serving foreign tourists as well as Parisians and is an important complement to Tiffany's other stores on rue de la Paix and in the Galeries Lafayette and Printemps department stores. We finished the year operating 38 stores in Europe. 
Rounding out the geographies is our other segment, which primarily consist of retail store sales in the United Arab Emirates and Russia as well as wholesale diamond sales and some licensing revenues. In the fourth quarter, other sales increased 12% due to incremental sales from our store that we opened in Moscow in February 2014, while comp store sales declined 8% due to soft demand in the 5 stores we operate in the UAE, although I should add that this compared with a strong 23% comp increase in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, other sales rose 26%, partly due to the Moscow store sales as well as an 8% increase in comp store sales. 
So in total, we opened 8 company-operated Tiffany & Co. stores in 2014 and closed 2. That net addition of 6 stores was a 2% increase in our store base and a 3% increase in worldwide square footage. You should also keep in mind that beyond opening new stores, we are equally focused on enhancing the quality of our existing store base, and as such, we will be pursuing a number of relocations and some major renovations in 2015. We're currently planning to increase our company-operated stores by a net of approximately 12 to 15 stores during 2015. A majority of that net addition is planned in Asia-Pacific with the balance in the Americas and Europe. In total, this will represent a 4% to 5% net increase in our company-operated store base and in worldwide square footage. 
Looking at regional sales productivity in 2014. Total sales in dollars per gross square foot for company-operated stores was unchanged at approximately $3,100. By region, the ranking remained unchanged from the prior year with Asia-Pacific continuing to rank highest with $5,000 productivity versus $4,800 in 2013; followed by Japan at $3,400 versus $3,800 in 2013; then Europe, at $3,200 down from $3,300 in 2013; to the Americas at $2,500 per square foot, up from $2,400 in 2013. 
At this point, it's also worth mentioning the effectiveness of Tiffany's omni-channel platform. Our company-operated store base is complemented by e-commerce-enabled websites in 13 countries and informational sites in several others. We have a dual objective of generating e-commerce sales growth in each region but importantly, also communicating Tiffany's brand and product message to consumers in order to drive store traffic as well. The total e-commerce sales continued to represent 6% of net worldwide sales in 2014. 
There were some noteworthy merchandising highlights in 2014. First, we were pleased to experience growth in all major categories for the year led by growth in our fashion jewelry category and specifically, in gold jewelry. We also saw healthy growth in engagement jewelry in 2014 but only modest growth in the statement, fine and solitaire category. From a worldwide price stratification perspective, there was sales growth in every price strata above $500, up to statement jewelry above $50,000. 
Following on the successful launch in 2013 and the exciting reinterpretation of our Atlas Collection, our design team created another success with their modern, innovative, new Tiffany T collection. Ranging in price from a few hundred dollars to $20,000, the Tiffany T collection is targeted towards stylish, female, self-purchase customers as well as attracting gift purchasers. And as intended, its appeal is global. Consistent with our brand strategy, it's worth noting that Tiffany T continues our evolution toward introducing compelling designs at higher price points, and in its first few months, is generating the highest-ever average transaction size for a new fashion jewelry collection at Tiffany. 
On a related note, while both Atlas and Tiffany T incorporate the use of various precious metals, we have seen a clear preference for the gold designs. In fact, that trend is evident throughout the fashion jewelry category with considerable strength in gold jewelry sales being partly offset by the softness in silver jewelry sales especially in that price strata, under $500. 
I should also call out the resurgence of our Keys collection, originally introduced in 2009 but expanded over the past 2 years with beautiful new designs incorporating colored gemstones as well as rose gold. I mentioned sales growth in the engagement jewelry category, which is led, of course, by the popularity of our iconic 6-prong setting. A strong addition to the engagement category has been the Harmony engagement ring, which, in just over 2 years, has become our second-best selling style in our bridal assortment. And sales of wedding band rings in the engagement category were strong in the year. Overall, sales growth in the engagement category was led by strength in the Asia-Pacific and Americas regions. 
The more modest sales increase in fine and solitaire jewelry in 2014 was spread among various collections and designs, with noteworthy callouts being the classic Victoria collection, with new styles added in 2014, and the beautiful Soleste collection, which is diamond-focused and was expanded in 2014 to incorporate a greater use of colored stones. As an aside and a possible explanation for some of the softness in fine and solitaire jewelry sales, especially in the fourth quarter, we've heard anecdotal speculation that strong demand for the Tiffany T collection may have pulled some demand from the fine jewelry category. Lastly, while there was some plenty of activity in high-end statement jewelry in 2014, worldwide sales of that category were about equal to the prior year's level. 
I hope you now have a better understanding of Tiffany's top line performance in 2014, and I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Ralph."
35576,286316205,784983,"Tiffany & Co., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Mar 20, 2015",2015-03-20,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thank you, Mark, for that comprehensive sales review. Reflecting on 2014, I'd like to highlight a few important points before getting into the specifics. We're effectively executing our strategies to continue to strengthen and elevate the Tiffany brand. I",1939,"Thank you, Mark, for that comprehensive sales review. Reflecting on 2014, I'd like to highlight a few important points before getting into the specifics. We're effectively executing our strategies to continue to strengthen and elevate the Tiffany brand. In 2014, we expanded our global footprint in key locations. We strengthened our position in the important fashion jewelry category with the introduction of the Tiffany T collection, and we advanced key product development initiatives for introduction in 2015 and beyond. We improved gross margin and operating margin while increasing our investment in marketing. And we strengthened our balance sheet by keeping inventory growth to a lower rate than sales growth, and we lowered our cost of debt significantly while extending maturities and generating strong free cash flow. 
As we exited 2014, we were clearly facing challenges in 2015 from the strong U.S. dollar. Tourist purchases are expected to continue to be pressured in the Americas. Gross margin is expected to improve in 2015 but at a lesser rate than in 2014, and negative translation is expected to continue to mute sales and earnings growth. However, we have the ability to continue to invest in the Tiffany brand and improve our capabilities to continue to deliver value for our shareholders over time. 
Now that I've framed that overall message, let's take a look at the rest of the components in the earnings statement that, excluding charges in 2014 and 2013, contributed to deliver our -- contributed to our delivering the 13% increase in net earnings for the full year. Gross margin in the year rose 1.6 points to 59.7%, benefiting from favorable product input costs, price increases taken earlier in the year and a sales mix that moved favorably toward our higher-margin fashion jewelry category later in the year. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 0.3 points higher than the prior year. We're continuing to experience some benefit from favorable product input costs, which we believe will help gross margin in 2015. 
From a pricing perspective, the substantial weakening of the yen, euro and pound would normally result in our taking price increases in those regions to fully offset the negative impacts. However, in light of the magnitude of those currency swings and considering local conditions, we're taking only measured price increases in this first quarter. As a result, we expect a modest increase in gross margin in 2015. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6% in the full year partly due to a combination of higher label -- higher labor and other store-related costs as well as a substantial increase as expected in marketing spending. In fact, for the full year, we increased marketing spending to 6.7% of net sales from 6.3% in 2013. SG&A expenses rose only 1% in the fourth quarter as higher marketing spending was mostly offset by the translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar. I think most of you know that about 80% of our SG&A expenses are fixed in nature, and we have said that we require a mid-single-digit comp store sales increase to gain leverage on those costs. Therefore, our sales growth in 2014 was not sufficient to achieve the leverage on those costs. 
Based on our current sales outlook, we expect SG&A expenses will increase at a greater rate than sales growth in 2015. This expected increase in the expense ratio partially reflects our store expansion and marketing plans, but also reflects a meaningful increase of approximately $30 million of noncash expense resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions, principally reflecting lower interest rates for our U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans. In fact, that $30 million increase alone restrains EPS growth in 2015 by $0.15 per diluted share.
Operating earnings on a non-GAAP basis declined 3% in the fourth quarter and rose 12% in the full year when excluding the arbitration charge in 2013 as well as the smaller expense that year related to staffing and occupancy reductions. The operating margin rose to 21% in the full year 2014 versus an adjusted 19.7% in 2013 and a margin of 18.4% in 2012. Our expectation calls for operating earnings in 2015 to be about equal to the prior year.
As you probably know, we had redeemed $400 million of long-term debt in the third quarter and issued $550 million of debt. This was a significant step in lowering our interest cost and extending maturities. The net effect of these debt transactions was a $15 million reduction in interest expense or $3 million to $4 million per quarter, which we began to experience in the fourth quarter and is incorporated in our full year projection of approximately $50 million of interest and other expense in 2015.
The effective tax rate was 32.9% in the fourth quarter and 34.4% in the full year. The effective tax rates in 2013 were 36.1% in the fourth quarter and 34.8% in the full year when excluding the charge for the inverse arbitration ruling. We expect the effective tax rate in 2015 to be about equivalent to the rate in 2014.
So adding it all up, net earnings were $196 million in the fourth quarter and were 3% higher than net earnings of $190 million in last year's fourth quarter, excluding the arbitration-related charge. For the full year, net earnings were $484 million or $3.73 per share compared with $181 million or $1.41 per diluted share in the prior year. However, excluding those charges in both years, net earnings rose 13% to $545 million or $4.20 per share, up from $481 million or $3.73 per share in 2013. 
Our balance sheet was strong at January 31, 2015. Net inventories rose 2% in 2014 to finish the year at $2.4 billion. The overall increase supported new stores, product introductions and expanded offerings, and we were pleased with the level of inventory availability in our stores. The 2% increase included a 4% increase in finished goods and a 2% decrease in combined raw materials and work-in-process inventories. Inventories would've grown 6% and still below the rate of sales growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency translation. In addition, I believe you all understand that the year-end inventory level was impacted by the unanticipated sales softness in the fourth quarter. So whether measured in dollars or on a constant-exchange-rate basis, both the 2% and 6% increases, respectively, met our long-term objective to keep growth and inventories below sales growth. Our 2015 plan calls for minimal inventory growth in dollars in the full year. 
Accounts receivable rose 3% in 2014 to $195 million in line with sales growth. Receivables are turning at 21x per year. 
Capital expenditures were $247 million in 2014. That was an increase from $221 million in 2013 due to increased spending on systems and internal manufacturing capacity. CapEx was 6% of worldwide net sales versus 5% in the prior year. Approximately half of our capital spending goes toward store openings, renovation and relocations. We're forecasting CapEx at around $260 million for 2015. 
We spent $500 million in the fourth quarter to repurchase 53,000 shares. In the full year, we spent $27 million and bought 301,000 shares at an average cost, just under $90 per share. At year-end, we had $273 million available for future repurchases under the current authorization that runs through March of 2017. We believe that share repurchases and dividend growth are appropriate long-term measures to return excess cash to shareholders. Putting it all together, we generated free cash flow of $368 million, which included the effect of $61 million after-tax debt extinguishment charge and expect to generate free cash flow exceeding $400 million in 2015. 
We finished 2014 with a solid balance sheet and liquidity. Total short-term and long-term debt was $1.1 billion or 39% of stockholders' equity versus $1 billion and 37% a year ago. Tiffany's return on assets and stockholders' equity were 10% and 17%, respectively, in 2014 and clearly meeting our long-term objectives for at least 10% ROA and a 15% ROE. 
Turning to our financial forecast for 2015. I've already highlighted our assumptions for the operating margin, interest and other expenses and the effective tax rate. In terms of our sales forecast, we believe that taking a cautious view in certain markets is appropriate in light of what we saw in the fourth quarter, specifically the strength of the U.S. dollar as well as challenging conditions in certain markets. In total, we are planning a mid-single-digit percent increase in worldwide net sales in local currencies, which will translate into low single-digit increase in dollars for the full year. 
While we don't typically talk about quarterly forecast, we think you should be aware that we have a very difficult comparison in Japan to a 30% comp increase in last year's first quarter and we've also continued to experience softness in the Americas, both of which will contribute to a forecasted 10% sales decline in the first quarter on a reported basis in U.S. dollars. Combined with our assumptions for operating margin, interest expense and the effective tax rate, we are forecasting minimal growth in the full year EPS over the $4.20 per share, excluding charges that Tiffany earned in 2014. This is not indicative in any way of Tiffany's long-term earnings power but is a reflection of the various near and macro challenges currently affecting us. 
As I mentioned, the expected minimal EPS growth in 2015 incorporates the noncash increase in employee benefit-related expenses, costing $0.15 per share or about 4% of earnings growth. And of course, it's safe to add that the strong U.S. dollar is costing us a few percentage points of earnings growth. So without those 2 factors, we would have been looking at high single-digit increase in EPS. The change between our original preliminary 2015 guidance that we provided in January calling for low to mid-single-digit increase in net earnings for the year and our current forecast of minimal earnings growth in 2015, is essentially the result of the added noncash pension expense and the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar since then. 
I'd now like to highlight the pacing of our expected sales and earnings in 2015, which will be affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Japan's volatility in 2014 and the timing of marketing spending. From a quarterly perspective, based on the top line challenges in this first quarter, we expect that first quarter EPS could be 3% lower than the $0.97 we earned last year, which had represented a 49% increase over the prior year. We expect that the second quarter will also show a net earnings decline but at a more modest rate pressured by the continuation of the strong dollar and substantial marketing spending tied to the watch launch. And then, we expect net earnings to grow by double-digit percentages in both the third and fourth quarters. So just to make it clear, our sales and earnings plans assume progressively improving performance as we move through the year. 
In conclusion, I joined Tiffany just about 1 year ago. Since then, we've been focusing on a number of fronts including, but not limited to, effectively allocating resources for growth, driving improvements in cost and inventory management and doing all of this in a tax-efficient manner. I'm very excited about our opportunities to grow Tiffany's business in an increasingly profitable and productive way. 
I presume you all are aware that Tiffany's Chief Executive Officer, Mike Kowalski, will be retiring from Tiffany on March 31 and remain as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. On April 1, Frederic Cumenal, currently Tiffany's President, will become CEO. I am now very pleased to turn the call over to Frederic."

I'm glad to have this opportunity to briefly share with you my thoughts about Tiffany's business and our exciting plans. First, I believe we achieved good financial results in 2014 but certainly finished the year on a disappointing note primarily in the Americas. While we know about the unavoidable challenges arising from the strong U.S. dollar, we can and we'll be nimble in fine-tuning product developments and marketing communications. Most important, we have a clear road map for the future focused on the store experience, products, marketing, logistics and margin improvement. I'm pleased with the progress that our company made in 2014 in these areas that I believe will drive our longer-term success. 
That strategic direction focuses on continued elevation as a global luxury brand in our stores while striving to better engage customers through a more consultative approach and with enhanced visual merchandising presentations. Over the next couple of years, we will strengthen our abilities when we finish developing a global CRM system and able to better analyze our customer base and shopping patterns. 
We opened some major stores in key markets in 2014, and I'm partially speaking of the new ones in Paris and Moscow. Our strategy includes further investing in our distribution base with new stores, likely at the rate of 10 to 15 stores per year, when we find the right opportunities but also enhancing the impressions we create with customers through renovations, relocations and even some select closings. 
In 2014, we increased our focus on the stylish, female, self-purchase customer when we introduced the dramatic and innovative Tiffany T collection following the successful debut in 2013 of our reinterpreted Atlas collection. Our strategy includes launching additional collections in the coming years, but our design group will also be refreshing our product assortment with important new interpretations of our iconic collections. And in April, we will probably introduce to the world CT60, a major new collection of watches, as the first step in a long-term investment to build a meaningful watch business. 
To enhance our growth potential, last year, our talented marketing team further developed impactful messages of customer relevance. Operationally, we've continued to expand our capabilities in manufacturing and sourcing while focused on maximizing the efficiencies of that supply chain, which should enable us to further improve our gross margins in the coming years. From an IT perspective, we are continuing to invest in new systems to support our long-term objectives. 
So we entered 2015 with many exciting plans, but also, with a cautious short-term review regarding the external challenges and uncertainties affecting our business. We believe that planning for modest sales growth and minimal earning growth is both prudent and justifiable. However, we remain completely focused on that strategic road map I referred to by investing in various facets of our business to achieve healthy results over the long term. We have made key additions to our management team in the past couple of years, both in New York and in our regions, which reinforces my confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term goals. 
Tiffany has accumulating an amazing heritage since its founding 178 years ago. Our roots are here in New York, and now we have the opportunity to be relevant and prosper in a world where a growing number of affluent customers are seeking finely crafted products and extraordinary experiences. 
That concludes my comments. I appreciate your interest in Tiffany, and we'll now turn the call back to Mark."

Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Okay, let's begin with an overview of fourth quarter results. Sales performance by region was mostly in line with the holiday sales results we have reported on January 12. Net worldwide sales in the fourth quarter declined 1% but rose 3% on a constant-exchange-rate basis that excludes the translation effect of the stronger U.S. dollar. We expect to see a continuation of that substantial headwind from the strong dollar in 2015. 
In local currencies, we were pleased that Tiffany performed well in Europe and Asia-Pacific and not surprised that we experienced softness in Japan. However, we were disappointed with the underperformance in the Americas. 
Also in the fourth quarter, the operating margin was down slightly from last year's margin excluding the charge. While gross margin increased in the quarter, the improvement was offset by higher marketing spending and deleveraging of SG&A fixed costs. Interest and other expenses net were above last year but the prior year included a onetime foreign currency transaction gain. The effective tax rate was below last year. So in total net earnings of $1.51 per diluted share in the fourth quarter was up slightly from last year's $1.47, excluding charges, and at the high end of the forecast we've provided in January. 
For all of 2014, worldwide net sales rose to $4.25 billion. That represented a 5% increase in dollars or a 7% increase on a constant-exchange-rate basis, which was on top of the 10% increase in 2013 on that same basis. 
Net earnings for the full year rose 167% to $484 million or $3.73 per diluted share. However, on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding charges in both years, net earnings rose 13%, and EPS of $4.20 was slightly better than the original guidance of $4.05 to $4.15 that we published at this time a year ago. And that 13% earnings increase in 2014 was on top of the non-GAAP 15% increase in net earnings that we achieved in 2013. 
Let's now look at the details of our regional sales performance. First, there were minimal changes in our regional sales mix in 2014. The Americas represented 48% of worldwide net sales in 2014, unchanged from 2013. Asia-Pacific was 24% of worldwide sales, up slightly from 23% a year ago. Japan was 13%, down slightly from 14% in 2013 and that was largely due to currency translation, and Europe at 12% of worldwide sales was unchanged. 
Let's look at the Americas, which had a good year but finished on a soft note. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, both total sales and comp store sales were unchanged in the fourth quarter versus the 7% comp increase last year. However, for the full year, on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales and comps rose 6% on top of a 3% comp increase in 2013. In dollars, total sales in the Americas declined 1% in the quarter due to lower units sold offsetting favorable average price and mix. A 6% sales increase in the full year reflected favorable average price and mix partly offset by jewelry unit declines in silver jewelry under $500. 
The strong U.S. dollar had a minimal negative translation effect on the Americas sales but is having an adverse effect on foreign tourist spending in the U.S., especially in New York, and this effect certainly worsened in the latter part of 2014. Foreign tourist spending has historically represented about 1/4 of annual U.S. sales, although we no longer can precisely measure it due to privacy laws in some large markets. But we can safely say it is a meaningful portion of the region's sales and, in fact, continued to represent more than 40% of sales in the New York flagship store in 2014. We attribute the Americas comp decline in the fourth quarter to softness that was broad-based geographically across the U.S. and in most product categories except fashion jewelry. 
On a related note, while the Tiffany T collection performed very well, it is possible that the concentrated advertising focus on that collection may not have benefited other collections as we had expected. We attribute the softness in the under $500 silver jewelry category to a lack of product newness and marketing focus and perhaps, also, the competitive and macro pressures on the jewelry purchaser at those price points, though we do have some opportunity to fine-tune our approaches to those issues within our control. Elsewhere in the Americas, we were pleased with solid total sales growth in Canada and Latin America on a constant-exchange-rate basis in both the fourth quarter and the full year. 
We finished the year operating 122 Tiffany stores in the Americas versus 121 at the end of 2013. During the year, we opened 3 stores in the region on Boston's Newbury Street, in Florida's Aventura Mall and in Cancun, Mexico; and we closed 2 small stores in East Hampton, New York and in the Holt Renfrew department store in Ottawa, Canada. Already in early February, we've opened a stunning store in the new Miami Design District. 
Let's now turn to the Asia-Pacific region. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 7% in the quarter and comps rose 3% on top of a 4% comp increase in last year's quarter. While for the full year, total sales rose 10% and comps rose 4% on top of an 11% comp increase in 2013. Translated into U.S. dollars, Asia-Pacific sales increased 4% in the fourth quarter due to favorable average price and mix partly offset by some unit declines. Sales in the full year rose 9% due to favorable average jewelry price and mix as well as higher jewelry units sold. Quarterly sales performance in Asia-Pacific on a constant-exchange-rate basis was led by strong growth in China, Australia and Singapore, partly offset by softness in Hong Kong, while for the full the full year we were pleased to achieve broad-based growth in most countries. 
Sales in Greater China, with a total of 45 stores in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau, continue to represent more than half of Asia-Pacific region sales in 2014. Starting in the third quarter, Tiffany has seen a marked softening of sales results in Hong Kong, and we're also experiencing weakness in Macau. We believe that some tourists may be diverting their travel to other markets or perhaps increasing their spending locally. 
So we concluded 2014 operating 73 Tiffany stores in the Asia-Pacific region versus 72 at the end of 2013. Opening only 1 store in this region during the year in Adelaide, Australia is not indicative of our planned rate of annual expansion. However, 3 stores that we had planned to open in the region last year were temporarily delayed, 2 of those stores in China, in the MixC mall in Hangzhou and in the New World Daimaru department store in Shanghai, have already opened in this year. 
It was certainly a volatile year for us in Japan, dealing with the effect of an increase in the consumption tax on April 1 followed by the effect of a weakening yen and then an economic recession. When measured in yen, total sales in Japan increased 1% in the fourth quarter due to favorability in average price and mix, mostly offset by a decline in jewelry units sold. For the full year, a 4% total sales increase in yen was due to favorable price and mix also partly offset by a decline in jewelry units sold. Comp store sales declined 5% in yen in the quarter versus an 8% increase in last year's fourth quarter, and comps increased 1% for the full year versus a 10% increase in 2013. So while we definitely had our challenges in Japan in 2014, we believe our 2-year run rate is respectable. 
The yen weakened 8% on average against the U.S. dollar in 2014, and that's after weakening about 20% on average in 2013. Therefore, when translated into dollars, total sales in Japan declined 13% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year. Such a substantial move in the yen has clearly caused softness in spending by Japanese tourists when they travel but might be supporting some local spending in Japan. In addition, although we have seen a gradual increase in spending by Chinese tourists in Japan, overall spending by foreign tourists visiting Japan is still not yet meaningful for us. During 2014 we opened 2 stores in Japan in Kobe and in the Shinjuku section of Tokyo and finished the year operating 56 Tiffany stores. 
Now turning to Europe. We also faced some macroeconomic challenges, but nonetheless, performed well. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 9% in the fourth quarter led by growth in our 3 major continental European markets of Germany, Italy and France, and comp store sales rose 4%. On net basis for the full year, total sales rose 6% but comp store sales declined 1%. Sales in the U.K. represented about 40% of total Europe in 2014, and its performance was relatively softer than Continental Europe in both the quarter and full year. 
The euro and the pound weakened against the U.S. dollar in 2014. Therefore, when translated into US dollars, total European sales in the fourth quarter were flat with the prior year with no significant changes in jewelry units sold, price or mix. While conversely for the full year, total sales rose 6% due to similar favorability in jewelry units sold, average price and mix. Those weaker currencies have likely contributed to the attractiveness of shopping in Europe, and foreign tourist spending represents approximately 1/4 of our European sales. 
During 2014, we expanded Tiffany's presence in Paris with the opening of a major store on the important Champs Elysées. The prominent corner location is enjoying a successful first year serving foreign tourists as well as Parisians and is an important complement to Tiffany's other stores on rue de la Paix and in the Galeries Lafayette and Printemps department stores. We finished the year operating 38 stores in Europe. 
Rounding out the geographies is our other segment, which primarily consist of retail store sales in the United Arab Emirates and Russia as well as wholesale diamond sales and some licensing revenues. In the fourth quarter, other sales increased 12% due to incremental sales from our store that we opened in Moscow in February 2014, while comp store sales declined 8% due to soft demand in the 5 stores we operate in the UAE, although I should add that this compared with a strong 23% comp increase in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, other sales rose 26%, partly due to the Moscow store sales as well as an 8% increase in comp store sales. 
So in total, we opened 8 company-operated Tiffany & Co. stores in 2014 and closed 2. That net addition of 6 stores was a 2% increase in our store base and a 3% increase in worldwide square footage. You should also keep in mind that beyond opening new stores, we are equally focused on enhancing the quality of our existing store base, and as such, we'll be pursuing a number of relocations and some major renovations in 2015. We're currently planning to increase our company-operated stores by a net of approximately 12 to 15 stores during 2015. A majority of that net addition is planned in Asia-Pacific with the balance in the Americas and Europe. In total, this will represent a 4% to 5% net increase in our company-operated store base and in worldwide square footage. 
Looking at regional sales productivity in 2014. Total sales in dollars per gross square foot for company-operated stores was unchanged at approximately $3,100. By region, the ranking remained unchanged from the prior year with Asia-Pacific continuing to rank highest with $5,000 productivity versus $4,800 in 2013; followed by Japan at $3,400 versus $3,800 in 2013; then Europe, at $3,200 down from $3,300 in 2013; to the Americas at $2,500 per square foot, up from $2,400 in 2013. 
At this point, it's also worth mentioning the effectiveness of Tiffany's omni-channel platform. Our company-operated store base is complemented by e-commerce-enabled websites in 13 countries and informational sites in several others. We have a dual objective of generating e-commerce sales growth in each region but importantly, also communicating Tiffany's brand and product message to consumers in order to drive store traffic as well. Total e-commerce sales continued to represent 6% of net worldwide sales in 2014. 
There were some noteworthy merchandising highlights in 2014. First, we were pleased to experience growth in all major categories for the year led by growth in our fashion jewelry category and specifically, in gold jewelry. We also saw healthy growth in engagement jewelry in 2014 but only modest growth in the statement, fine and solitaire category. From a worldwide price stratification perspective, there was sales growth in every price strata above $500, up to statement jewelry above $50,000. 
Following on the successful launch in 2013 and the exciting reinterpretation of our Atlas Collection, our design team created another success with their modern, innovative, new Tiffany T collection. Ranging in price from a few hundred dollars to $20,000, the Tiffany T collection is targeted towards stylish, female, self-purchase customers as well as attracting gift purchasers. And as intended, its appeal is global. Consistent with our brand strategy, it's worth noting that Tiffany T continues our evolution toward introducing compelling designs at higher price points, and in its first few months, is generating the highest-ever average transaction size for a new fashion jewelry collection at Tiffany. 
On a related note, while both Atlas and Tiffany T incorporate the use of various precious metals, we have seen a clearer preference for the gold designs. In fact, that trend is evident throughout the fashion jewelry category with considerable strength in gold jewelry sales being partly offset by the softness in silver jewelry sales especially in that price strata, under $500. 
I should also call out the resurgence of our Keys collection, originally introduced in 2009 but expanded over the past 2 years with beautiful new designs incorporating colored gemstones as well as rose gold. I mentioned sales growth in the engagement jewelry category, which is led, of course, by the popularity of our iconic 6-prong setting. A strong addition to the engagement category has been the Harmony engagement ring, which, in just over 2 years, has become our second-best selling style in our bridal assortment. And sales of wedding band rings in the engagement category were strong in the year. Overall, sales growth in the engagement category was led by strength in the Asia-Pacific and Americas regions. 
The more modest sales increase in fine and solitaire jewelry in 2014 was spread among various collections and designs, with noteworthy callouts being the classic Victoria collection, with new styles added in 2014, and the beautiful Soleste collection, which is diamond-focused and was expanded in 2014 to incorporate a greater use of colored stones. As an aside and a possible explanation for some of the softness in fine and solitaire jewelry sales, especially in the fourth quarter, we've heard anecdotal speculation that strong demand for the Tiffany T collection may have pulled some demand from the fine jewelry category. Lastly, while there was some plenty of activity in high-end statement jewelry in 2014, worldwide sales of that category were about equal to the prior year's level. 
I hope you now have a better understanding of Tiffany's top line performance in 2014, and I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Ralph."
35576,286316205,785058,"Tiffany & Co., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Mar 20, 2015",2015-03-20,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thank you, Mark, for that comprehensive sales review. Reflecting on 2014, I'd like to highlight a few important points before getting into the specifics. We're effectively executing our strategies to continue to strengthen and elevate the Tiffany brand. I",1939,"Thank you, Mark, for that comprehensive sales review. Reflecting on 2014, I'd like to highlight a few important points before getting into the specifics. We're effectively executing our strategies to continue to strengthen and elevate the Tiffany brand. In 2014, we expanded our global footprint in key locations. We strengthened our position in the important fashion jewelry category with the introduction of the Tiffany T collection, and we advanced key product development initiatives for introduction in 2015 and beyond. We improved gross margin and operating margin while increasing our investment in marketing. And we strengthened our balance sheet by keeping inventory growth to a lower rate than sales growth, and we lowered our cost of debt significantly while extending maturities and generating strong free cash flow. 
As we exited 2014, we were clearly facing challenges in 2015 from the strong U.S. dollar. Tourist purchases are expected to continue to be pressured in the Americas; gross margin is expected to improve in 2015 but at a lesser rate than in 2014 and negative translation is expected to continue to mute sales and earnings growth. However, we have the ability to continue to invest in the Tiffany brand and improve our capabilities to continue to deliver value for our shareholders over time. 
Now that I've framed that overall message, let's take a look at the rest of the components in the earnings statement that, excluding charges in 2014 and 2013, contributed to deliver our -- contributed to our delivering the 13% increase in net earnings for the full year. Gross margin in the year rose 1.6 points to 59.7%, benefiting from favorable product input costs, price increases taken earlier in the year and a sales mix that moved favorably toward our higher-margin fashion jewelry category later in the year. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 0.3 points higher than the prior year. We're continuing to experience some benefit from favorable product input costs, which we believe will help gross margin in 2015. 
From a pricing perspective, the substantial weakening of the yen, euro and pound would normally result in our taking price increases in those regions to fully offset the negative impacts. However, in light of the magnitude of those currency swings and considering local conditions, we're taking only measured price increases in this first quarter. As a result, we expect a modest increase in gross margin in 2015. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6% in the full year partly due to a combination of higher label -- higher labor and other store-related costs as well as a substantial increase as expected in marketing spending. In fact, for the full year, we increased marketing spending to 6.7% of net sales from 6.3% in 2013. SG&A expenses rose only 1% in the fourth quarter as higher marketing spending was mostly offset by the translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar. I think most of you know that about 80% of our SG&A expenses are fixed in nature, and we have said that we require a mid-single-digit comp store sales increase to gain leverage on those costs. Therefore, our sales growth in 2014 was not sufficient to achieve the leverage on those costs. 
Based on our current sales outlook, we expect SG&A expenses will increase at a greater rate than sales growth in 2015. This expected increase in the expense ratio partially reflects our store expansion and marketing plans, but also reflects a meaningful increase of approximately $30 million of noncash expense resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions, principally reflecting lower interest rates for our U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans. In fact, that $30 million increase alone restrains EPS growth in 2015 by $0.15 per diluted share.
Operating earnings on a non-GAAP basis declined 3% in the fourth quarter and rose 12% in the full year when excluding the arbitration charge in 2013 as well as the smaller expense that year related to staffing and occupancy reductions. The operating margin rose to 21% in the full year 2014 versus an adjusted 19.7% in 2013 and a margin of 18.4% in 2012. Our expectation calls for operating earnings in 2015 to be about equal to the prior year.
As you probably know, we had redeemed $400 million of long-term debt in the third quarter and issued $550 million of debt. This was a significant step in lowering our interest cost and extending maturities. The net effect of these debt transactions was a $15 million reduction in interest expense or $3 million to $4 million per quarter, which we began to experience in the fourth quarter and is incorporated in our full year projection of approximately $50 million of interest and other expense in 2015.
The effective tax rate was 32.9% in the fourth quarter and 34.4% in the full year. The effective tax rates in 2013 were 36.1% in the fourth quarter and 34.8% in the full year when excluding the charge for the inverse arbitration ruling. We expect the effective tax rate in 2015 to be about equivalent to the rate in 2014.
So adding it all up, net earnings were $196 million in the fourth quarter and were 3% higher than net earnings of $190 million in last year's fourth quarter, excluding the arbitration-related charge. For the full year, net earnings were $484 million or $3.73 per share compared with $181 million or $1.41 per diluted share in the prior year. However, excluding those charges in both years, net earnings rose 13% to $545 million or $4.20 per share, up from $481 million or $3.73 per share in 2013. 
Our balance sheet was strong at January 31, 2015. Net inventories rose 2% in 2014 to finish the year at $2.4 billion. The overall increase supported new stores, product introductions and expanded offerings, and we were pleased with the level of inventory availability in our stores. The 2% increase included a 4% increase in finished goods and a 2% decrease in combined raw materials and work-in-process inventories. Inventories would've grown 6% and still below the rate of sales growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency translation. In addition, I believe you all understand that the year-end inventory level was impacted by the unanticipated sales softness in the fourth quarter. So whether measured in dollars or on a constant-exchange-rate basis, both the 2% and 6% increases, respectively, met our long-term objective to keep growth and inventories below sales growth. Our 2015 plan calls for minimal inventory growth in dollars in the full year. 
Accounts receivable rose 3% in 2014 to $195 million in line with sales growth. Receivables are turning at 21x per year. 
Capital expenditures were $247 million in 2014. That was an increase from $221 million in 2013 due to increased spending on systems and internal manufacturing capacity. CapEx was 6% of worldwide net sales versus 5% in the prior year. Approximately half of our capital spending goes toward store openings, renovation and relocations. We're forecasting CapEx at around $260 million for 2015. 
We spent $5 million in the fourth quarter to repurchase 53,000 shares. In the full year, we spent $27 million and bought 301,000 shares at an average cost, just under $90 per share. At year-end, we had $273 million available for future repurchases under the current authorization that runs through March of 2017. We believe that share repurchases and dividend growth are appropriate long-term measures to return excess cash to shareholders. Putting it all together, we generated free cash flow of $368 million, which included the effect of $61 million after-tax debt extinguishment charge and expect to generate free cash flow exceeding $400 million in 2015. 
We finished 2014 with a solid balance sheet and liquidity. Total short-term and long-term debt was $1.1 billion or 39% of stockholders' equity versus $1 billion and 37% a year ago. Tiffany's return on assets and stockholders' equity were 10% and 17%, respectively, in 2014 and clearly meeting our long-term objectives for at least 10% ROA and a 15% ROE. 
Turning to our financial forecast for 2015. I've already highlighted our assumptions for the operating margin, interest and other expenses and the effective tax rate. In terms of our sales forecast, we believe that taking a cautious view in certain markets is appropriate in light of what we saw in the fourth quarter, specifically the strength of the U.S. dollar as well as challenging conditions in certain markets. In total, we are planning a mid-single-digit percent increase in worldwide net sales in local currencies, which will translate into low single-digit increase in dollars for the full year. 
While we don't typically talk about quarterly forecast, we think you should be aware that we have a very difficult comparison in Japan to a 30% comp increase in last year's first quarter and we've also continued to experience softness in the Americas, both of which will contribute to a forecasted 10% sales decline in the first quarter on a reported basis in U.S. dollars. Combined with our assumptions for operating margin, interest expense and the effective tax rate, we are forecasting minimal growth in the full year EPS over the $4.20 per share, excluding charges that Tiffany earned in 2014. This is not indicative in any way of Tiffany's long-term earnings power but is a reflection of the various near and macro challenges currently affecting us. 
As I mentioned, the expected minimal EPS growth in 2015 incorporates the noncash increase in employee benefit-related expenses, costing $0.15 per share or about 4% of earnings growth. And of course, it's safe to add that the strong U.S. dollar is costing us a few percentage points of earnings growth. So without those 2 factors, we would have been looking at high single-digit increase in EPS. The change between our original preliminary 2015 guidance that we provided in January calling for low to mid-single-digit increase in net earnings for the year and our current forecast of minimal earnings growth in 2015, is essentially the result of the added noncash pension expense and the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar since then. 
I'd now like to highlight the pacing of our expected sales and earnings in 2015, which will be affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Japan's volatility in 2014 and the timing of marketing spending. From a quarterly perspective, based on the top line challenges in this first quarter, we expect that first quarter EPS could be 30% lower than the $0.97 we earned last year, which had represented a 49% increase over the prior year. We expect that the second quarter will also show a net earnings decline but at a more modest rate pressured by the continuation of the strong dollar and substantial marketing spending tied to the watch launch. And then, we expect net earnings to grow by double-digit percentages in both the third and fourth quarters. So just to make it clear, our sales and earnings plans assume progressively improving performance as we move through the year. 
In conclusion, I joined Tiffany just about 1 year ago. Since then, we've been focusing on a number of fronts including, but not limited to, effectively allocating resources for growth, driving improvements in cost and inventory management and doing all of this in a tax-efficient manner. I'm very excited about our opportunities to grow Tiffany's business in an increasingly profitable and productive way. 
I presume you all are aware that Tiffany's Chief Executive Officer, Mike Kowalski, will be retiring from Tiffany on March 31 and remain as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. On April 1, Frederic Cumenal, currently Tiffany's President, will become CEO. I am now very pleased to turn the call over to Frederic."

Thanks, Ralph and Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'm glad to have this opportunity to briefly share with you my thoughts about Tiffany's business and our exciting plans. First, I believe we achieved good financial results in 2014 but cer",589,"Thanks, Ralph. Thanks, Ralph and Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'm glad to have this opportunity to briefly share with you my thoughts about Tiffany's business and our exciting plans. First, I believe we achieved good financial results in 2014 but certainly finished the year on a disappointing note primarily in the Americas. While we know about the unavoidable challenges arising from the strong U.S. dollar, we can and we'll be nimble in fine-tuning product developments and marketing communications. Most important, we have a clear road map for the future focused on the store experience, products, marketing, logistics and margin improvement. I'm pleased with the progress that our company made in 2014 in these areas that I believe will drive our longer-term success. 
That strategic direction focuses on continued elevation as a global luxury brand in our stores while striving to better engage customers through a more consultative approach and with enhanced visual merchandising presentations. Over the next couple of years, we will strengthen our abilities when we finish developing a global CRM system and are able to better analyze our customer base and shopping patterns. 
We opened some major stores in key markets in 2014, and I'm partially speaking of the new ones in Paris and Moscow. Our strategy includes further investing in our distribution base with new stores, likely at the rate of 10 to 15 stores per year, when we find the right opportunities but also enhancing the impressions we create with customers through renovations, relocations and even some select closings. 
In 2014, we increased our focus on the stylish, female, self-purchase customer when we introduced the dramatic and innovative Tiffany T collection following the successful debut in 2013 of our reinterpreted Atlas collection. Our strategy includes launching additional collections in the coming years, but our design group will also be refreshing our product assortment with important new interpretations of our iconic collections. And in April, we will proudly introduce to the world CT60, a major new collection of watches, as the first step in a long-term investment to build a meaningful watch business. 
To enhance our growth potential, last year, our talented marketing team further developed impactful messages of customer relevance. Operationally, we've continued to expand our capabilities in manufacturing and sourcing while focused on maximizing the efficiencies of that supply chain, which should enable us to further improve our gross margins in the coming years. From an IT perspective, we are continuing to invest in new systems to support our long-term objectives. 
So we entered 2015 with many exciting plans, but also, with a cautious short-term view regarding the external challenges and uncertainties affecting our business. We believe that planning for modest sales growth and minimal earning growth is both prudent and justifiable. However, we remain completely focused on that strategic road map I referred to by investing in various facets of our business to achieve healthy results over the long term. We have made key additions to our management team in the past couple of years, both in New York and in our regions, which reinforces my confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term goals. 
Tiffany has accumulating an amazing heritage since its founding 178 years ago. Our roots are here in New York, and now we have the opportunity to be relevant and prosper in a world where a growing number of affluent customers are seeking finely crafted products and extraordinary experiences. 
That concludes my comments. I appreciate your interest in Tiffany, and will now turn the call back to Mark."

On today's call, Ralph and I will comment on those results and how they are linked to our growth strategies and then wrap up the call with a few comments on the outlook for the rest of the year. 
Before continuing, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth from Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
Okay, starting with the first quarter overview. While results were admittedly far from robust, they did exceed our expectations, and we were pleased with continued progress in executing our key store, product and marketing-related initiatives. Net worldwide sales declined 5% in the first quarter, which was better than the 10% decline we had expected due to strong performance in Europe and a smaller-than-anticipated year-over-year decline in Japan. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, excluding the translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar, worldwide net sales increased 1%. Going from a 5% sales decline as reported to a 1% sales increase on a constant-exchange-rate basis shows just how much of a headwind we're feeling from the stronger U.S. dollar in translation alone. We expect that to continue to one degree or another for the remainder of the year. 
Regional total sales performance, again on a constant-exchange-rate basis, range from a 21% increase in Europe, benefiting from strong foreign tourists and local customers spending there, to an 18% decline in Japan after a surge in spending there in last year's first quarter. In addition, we continued to experience solid growth in fashion jewelry sales highlighted by the TIFFANY T collection. We enjoyed growth in statement jewelry sales and we began the rollout of our new CT60 watch collection. The operating margin declined as the higher gross margin was a more than offset by higher fixed SG&A expenses, specifically higher marketing spending in support of our bridal category and the introduction of our new watches. In total, the better-than-expected sales performance resulted in net earnings declining 17% to $0.81 per diluted share, which again was better than our guidance that have called for an approximate 30% decline. 
Let's now look at regional sales performance. In the Americas, on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 3% and comp store sales rose 1% on top of an 8% comp increase in last year's first quarter. This minimal sales growth in the Americas reflected an increase in domestic spending, which was mostly offset by lower foreign tourist spending in the U.S., especially in New York, which we attribute to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Elsewhere in the Americas, we achieved healthy sales growth in Canada and Latin America on a constant-exchange-rate basis. In dollars, the 1% increase in [indiscernible] Americas sales resulted from favorable average price and mix being largely offset by lower jewelry unit volume tied to weakness at entry-level silver jewelry price points. We opened 1 store in the Americas during the quarter, in the new Miami design district. We now operate 123 stores in the region with additional openings planned this year, including Tiffany's first store in Chile in Santiago this summer as well as another store in Canada in Ottawa. 
Performance in the Asia-Pacific region was mixed in the quarter. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 4% and comp store sales increased 2% compared with a 10% comp increase in last year's first quarter. We continue to see strong sales growth in China as well as in Australia and Singapore, but we continue to experience a softness in Hong Kong and Macau as we believe some Chinese tourists have been traveling to and shopping in other regions. Measured in U.S. dollars, Asia-Pacific sales declined 1% in the quarter. We experienced higher average price and mix, which was outweighed by a decline in jewelry units sold in the region, reflecting the meaningful sales weaknesses in Hong Kong and in entry-level silver jewelry. During the first quarter, we opened 2 stores in China and Hangzhou and in Shanghai and finished the quarter operating 75 Tiffany stores in the Asia-Pacific region. So far in the second quarter, we've opened a store in Changzhou, China, and just today we opened in a newly expanded galaxy, Macau. We have additional openings planned for the rest of the year, including our first store in Thailand in Bangkok. 
Now let's turn to Japan where the focus in the quarter was, frankly, all about getting past very difficult year-over-year comparison. In last year's first quarter, we achieved 30% comp store sales growth in yen when customer demand surged in anticipation of a consumption tax increase on April 1. So it was not surprising, the comp store sales in this year's first quarter declined 24% in yen. We now face easier year-over-year comparisons in Japan for the rest of the year. That 24% comp decline in yen in the quarter or 18% on a total sales basis was due to a substantial decline in jewelry units sold. The yen was 12% weaker than average than in the first quarter of last year. So when translated into dollars, total sales in Japan declined 30% in the first quarter. We believe such a substantial weakening of the yen has affected spending by Japanese tourists when they travel but might be supporting some local spending in Japan. In addition, we are benefiting in Japan from increasing spending by foreign tourists especially from China. The store count in Japan was unchanged at 56 company-operated locations. All in all, our business in Japan has experienced substantial volatility over the past year, and we definitely look forward to some stabilization going forward. 
In Europe, strong foreign tourist spending, as well as higher local customer demand, drove a substantial 21% increase in total sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis with double-digit growth across most of Continental Europe. Comp store sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis rose 17% compared with a 3% comp decline in last year's first quarter. The euro and the pound have weakened considerably against the U.S. dollar over the past year, and when translated into U.S. dollars, total sales in Europe rose 2% in the quarter, reflecting favorable price and mix with total unit volume unchanged from last year but varying by category. Those weaker currencies have certainly made it increasingly attractive at the moment for foreign tourists to shop in Europe, and Tiffany is benefiting from it. 
It was almost a year ago when we opened a major store in Paris on the Champs-Élysées, which is serving considerable numbers of foreign tourists and local customers too. We see significant long-term opportunities to further expand our company-operated store base in major European markets. As examples, last year week, we opened our first store in Geneva. The 550 square meter, 2-level store is located on the Rue du Rhone, marking our third store in Switzerland and 39th store in Europe. And later this year, we plan to open on the fashionable Via Condotti in Rome, representing Tiffany's third store in that important city. 
Lastly, sales in our other segment, which is a small component of our overall sales, rose 1% in the quarter on a constant-exchange-rate basis with flat comps and declined 6% in dollars. This segment includes retail stores sales in the United Arab Emirates and Russia as well as wholesale diamond sales and some third-party licensing revenues. 
From a store expansion perspective, we remain on track to increase our company-operated stores by a net of approximately 12 to 15 stores this year. More than half of the openings are planned in Asia-Pacific with the balance in the Americas and Europe. This represents the 4% to 5% net increase in our company-operated store base and in worldwide square footage. Beyond opening new stores, however, we are also pursuing a strategy to enhance the existing store base through renovations as well as by relocating some stores to more favorable locations. In fact, we're scheduled for approximately 10 relocations this year, and we are always focused on adding interesting and relevant content to our websites that can also help to drive store traffic. We intend to be active in all of these areas in 2015, supporting our broader strategy to elevate the in-store and online experience and, ultimately, better engage and strengthen relationships with existing and new customers. 
In terms of noteworthy highlights within our product categories and collections, fashion jewelry was a strong performer in the quarter. The strength in fashion continued to be led by gold jewelry designs. A significant contributor to fashion jewelry sales is the TIFFANY T collection that we launched last fall. The collection continues to be well received by customers globally and is an important part of our strategy to expand our reach among style-seeking self-purchasers. And as we mentioned on our last call, TIFFANY T has been posting our highest ever transaction size for a new fashion collection. 
Also in fashion jewelry, our keys collection continues to perform quite well especially benefiting from its expanded assortment. However, we continue to experience weakness in silver jewelry sales below $500. We're focused on addressing this issue over the balance of the year through product development and advertising targeted at what we call our little luxuries. 
Sales in the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category were soft year-over-year with Japan accounting for most of the sales decline tied to the surge in spending in last year's first quarter. So going forward, we hope to see better performance in that category. And we continue to be pleased with sales in the Harmony collection and its recently expanded assortment. 
Fanning the engagement and the statement finance solitaire jewelry categories is the beautiful Celeste collection, which performed well in the quarter. In addition, we're planning to introduce some compelling additions to existing fine jewelry collection later this year to address softness in the fine jewelry category. In contrast to that softness in fine jewelry performance, we were very pleased with strong growth in statement jewelry sales in the quarter. In April, we hosted our annual Blue Book event in New York with select customers in fashion media attending from around the world to see our new couture collection of magnificent jewelry with the theme The Art of the Sea. It was a truly memorable and successful event. 
Rounding out the product review. In April, we launched our CT60 collection of watches, inspired by designs in Tiffany's archives. This brilliant collection is now being rolled out globally to Tiffany stores, and consistent with our strategy, we are supporting the launch with extensive marketing to strengthen credibility and success in that category. While it's way too early to talk about results, we can say that initial reaction from customers in the media has been very good. 
So in summary, we remain keenly focused on our key strategies surrounding stores, customer engagement, products and marketing. I'll now turn the call over to Ralph to continue the financial and strategic review."

First, I'd like to point out a few overall highlights of the quarter. The strong U.S. dollar was a significant headwind on the translation of results transacted outside the U.S., having a 6% negative effect on worldwide sales as well as impacting foreign tourist spending in the U.S. Gross margin continued to improve as expected. We've broadened our marketing focus beyond the TIFFANY T collection with new engagement and watch campaigns. Our sales results contributed to a smaller-than-expected decline in net earnings. However, as it is early in the year, and in light of continuing macro challenges and our assumptions about the direction of currency movements, we think it is prudent to maintain and not increase our earnings outlook for the year. 
Let's now take a look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 59.9% in the quarter was 0.9% higher than last year, reflecting many factors. We continue to benefit to some degree from lower product input costs while also taking some single-digit price increases globally in the first quarter that partly offset the effect of the weaker foreign currencies. Part of the gross margin increase also came from the absence of a one-time charge that we incurred in last year's first quarter for the closing of a diamond polishing facility. In addition, the favorable effect from higher margin fashion jewelry sales was offset by solid growth in much lower margin statement jewelry sales as well as the sales decline in Japan, which had a negative effect on gross margin. We continue to expect a modest increase in gross margin in 2015 as those favorable product input cost diminished over the remainder of the year. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 5% in the quarter largely due, as expected, to marketing spending, partly tied to our new Will You engagement campaign and the launch of the CT60 watch collection. In addition, incremental U.S. pension and postretirement benefit cost affected the SG&A expense increase. We continue to expect that SG&A expenses will grow at a rate exceeding sales growth for the full year, reflecting the items that I just mentioned. The increased expense for our U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans will total approximately $30 million for the full year. However, we do expect some improvement in the ratio of SG&A expenses to sales in the second half of the year. 
Our forecast continues to reflect operating earnings for the full year approximately equal to the prior year. Interest and other expenses net declined in the quarter as expected from our debt refinancing in 2014. In addition, to a lesser extent, we benefited from some year-over-year changes in foreign currency transaction gains. We continue to assume interest and other expenses net at approximately $50 million in 2015. The effective tax rate of 34.7% in the first quarter was slightly lower than the 35.1% rate in the first quarter of last year. We also continued to base our earnings forecast on an effective tax rate in 2015 virtually unchanged from last year's 34.4%. In total, we were projecting net earnings to decline 30% in the first quarter due to the pressures from the strong dollar, the difficult comparison in Japan and softness in the U.S however, the smaller sales decline led to a smaller-than-expected 17% decline in net earnings, although let's keep in mind that the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year. 
We're also pleased with the strength of Tiffany's balance sheet, which is consistent with our financial strategy. Cash and short-term investments totaled $715 million at April 30. Short and long-term debt totaled almost $1.1 billion or 37% of stockholders' equity versus 35% a year ago. We have more than adequate resources to support the growth of our business and to provide for potential opportunities to return some excess cash to shareholders. 
Net inventories of $2.4 billion at April 30 were 2% lower than a year ago. That overall decrease included a small increase in finished goods that was more than offset by a decline in combined raw material and work in process inventories. On a constant-exchange basis, inventories would've increased 2% due to new stores and product introductions. Our strategy for this year and over the long term is to keep inventory growth below the rate of sales growth through better productivity in our stores as well as in our overall supply chain. 
Accounts receivable of $192 million at April 30 was virtually unchanged from a year ago with receivable turnover staying at 21x per year. Capital expenditures were $37 million in the first quarter versus $35 million a year ago. Our forecast continues to be based on CapEx at about $260 million for 2015 with considerable spending devoted to stores and for new IT systems such as global CRM and inventory management among others. 
In terms of share repurchases, we spent $33 million in the first quarter to buy approximately 380,000 shares. At April 30, we had approximately $240 million available for future repurchases under the current authorization that runs through March of 2017. On a trailing basis at April 30, Tiffany's return on assets was 9% and the return on stockholders' equity was 16%, both of which are close to our long-term objectives to achieve a minimum of 10% ROA and a 15% ROE. 
Before concluding my remarks, I want to comment on our full year financial forecast. As I noted at the beginning of my remarks, we were pleased that the sales and earnings came in somewhat better than our expectations for the first quarter, but because it's still early in the year, we believe we should maintain our existing forecast in light of the strong dollar and lingering macro and market conditions and uncertainties. Our full year assumption of mid-single-digit percentage worldwide sales increased on a constant-exchange basis, assumes varying degrees of growth across all regions. However, we expect continued pressures from the strong dollar. They may possibly only begin to abate much later in the year, if at all, resulting in a low single-digit full year worldwide sales increase when translated into dollars. Our unchanged forecast of minimal earnings growth versus the $4.20 per share we earned last year on a non-GAAP basis continues to incorporate an expected earnings decline in the second quarter at a more moderate rate than in the first quarter as well as our assumptions of minimal sales growth but higher growth in SG&A expense again tied to marketing spending. We then continued to expect double-digit earnings growth in the second half of the year. So it's a plan built on progressively improving sales and earnings performance as we move through the year. And as we said on our last conference call, that minimal expected growth in earnings for the year would be more like a high single-digit increase if we excluded the estimated negative translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar and the cost from the incremental $30 million of pension expense. 
In conclusion, we believe that Tiffany is increasingly well positioned as one of the world's most important luxury brands and has the potential to be more productive and profitable over the long term. We have the growth opportunities, very sound strategies, a talented management team, and we're investing in important systems and capabilities and have financial resources to pursue those strategies. We believe we've had a decent start to the year all things considered, and appreciate your interest in Tiffany. I'll now turn the call back to Mark."

Performance in the Asia Pacific region was mixed in the quarter. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales increased 4%, and comp store sales increased 2% compared with a 10% comp increase in last year's first quarter. We continue to see strong sales growth in China as well as in Australia and Singapore, but we continued to experience softness in Hong Kong and Macau as we believe some Chinese tourists have been traveling to and shopping in other regions.

So it's not surprising to us that comp store sales in this year's first quarter declined 24% in yen. We now face easier year-over-year comparisons in Japan for the rest of the year. 
That 24% comp decline in yen in the quarter or 18% on a total sales basis was due to a substantial decline in jewelry units sold. The yen was 12% weaker on average than in the first quarter of last year, so when translated into dollars, total sales in Japan declined 30% in the first quarter. We believe such a substantial weakening of the yen has affected spending by Japanese tourists when they travel but might be supporting some local spending in Japan. 
In addition, we are benefiting in Japan from increasing spending by foreign tourists especially from China. The store count in Japan was unchanged at 56 company-operated locations. All in all, our business in Japan has experienced substantial volatility over the past year, and we definitely look forward to some stabilization going forward. 
In Europe, strong foreign tourist spending as well as higher local customer demand drove a substantial 21% increase in total sales on a constant exchange rate basis, with double-digit growth across most of continental Europe. Comp store sales on a constant exchange rate basis rose 17% compared with a 3% comp decline in last year's first quarter. 
The euro and the pound have weakened considerably against the U.S. dollar over the past year. And when translated into U.S. dollars, total sales in Europe rose 2% in the quarter, reflecting favorable price and mix, with total unit volume unchanged from last year but varying by category. Those weaker currencies have certainly made it increasingly attractive at the moment for foreign tourists to shop in Europe, and Tiffany is benefiting from it. 
It was almost a year ago when we opened a major store in Paris on the Champs Elysées, which is serving considerable numbers of foreign tourists and local customers, too. We see significant long-term opportunities to further expand our company-operated store base in major European markets. 
As examples, last year week, we opened our first store in Geneva. The 550-square-meter, 2-level store is located on the Rue du Rhône, marking our third store in Switzerland and 39th store in Europe. And later this year, we plan to open on the fashionable Via Condotti in Rome, representing Tiffany's third store in that important city. 
Lastly, sales in our other segment, which is a small component of our overall sales, rose 1% in the quarter on a constant exchange rate basis with flat comps and declined 6% in dollars. This segment includes retail store sales in the United Arab Emirates and Russia as well as wholesale diamond sales and some third-party licensing revenues. 
From a store expansion perspective, we remain on track to increase our company-operated stores by a net of approximately 12 to 15 stores this year. More than half of the openings are planned in Asia Pacific with the balance in the Americas and Europe. This represents a 4% to 5% net increase in our company-operated store base and in worldwide square footage. 
Beyond opening new stores, however, we are also pursuing a strategy to enhance the existing store base through renovations as well as by relocating some stores to more favorable locations. In fact, we're scheduled for approximately 10 relocations this year, and we are always focused on adding interesting and relevant content to our websites that can also help to drive store traffic. 
We intend to be active in all of these areas in 2015, supporting our broader strategy to elevate the in-store and online experience and ultimately better engage and strengthen relationships with existing and new customers. 
In terms of noteworthy highlights within our product categories and collections, fashion jewelry was a strong performer in the quarter. The strength in fashion continued to be led by gold jewelry designs. 
A significant contributor to fashion jewelry sales is the TIFFANY T collection that we launched last fall. The collection continues to be well received by customers globally and is an important part of our strategy to expand our reach among style-seeking self-purchasers. And as we mentioned on our last call, TIFFANY T has been posting our highest-ever transaction size for a new fashion collection. 
Also, in fashion jewelry, our Keys collection continues to perform quite well, especially benefiting from its expanded assortment. However, we continued to experience weakness in silver jewelry sales below $500. We're focused on addressing this issue over the balance of the year through product development and advertising targeted at what we call our Little Luxuries. 
Sales in the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category were soft year-over-year, with Japan accounting for most of the sales decline tied to the surge in spending in last year's first quarter. So going forward, we hope to see better performance in that category. And we continue to be pleased with sales in the Harmony collection and its recently expanded assortment. 
Fanning the engagement and the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry categories is our beautiful Soleste collection, which performed well in the quarter. In addition, we're planning to introduce some compelling additions to existing fine jewelry collections later this year to address softness in the fine jewelry category. 
In contrast to that softness in fine jewelry performance, we were very pleased with strong growth in statement jewelry sales in the quarter. In April, we hosted our annual Blue Book event in New York with select customers and fashion media attending from around the world to see our new couture collection of magnificent jewelry with the theme The Art of the Sea. It was a truly memorable and successful event. 
Rounding out the product review. In April, we launched our CT60 collection of watches, inspired by designs in Tiffany's archives. This brilliant collection is now being rolled out globally to Tiffany stores, and consistent with our strategy, we are supporting the launch with extensive marketing to strengthen credibility and success in that category. While it's way too early to talk about results, we can say that initial reaction from customers and the media has been very good. 
So in summary, we remain keenly focused on our key strategies surrounding stores, customer engagement, products and marketing. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ralph to continue the financial and strategic review."

First, I'd like to point out a few overall highlights of the quarter. The strong U.S. dollar was a significant headwind on the translation of results transacted outside the U.S., having a 6% negative effect on worldwide sales as well as impacting foreign tourist spending in the U.S. 
Gross margin continued to improve as expected. We've broadened our marketing focus beyond the TIFFANY T collection with new engagement and watch campaigns. Our sales results contributed to a smaller-than-expected decline in net earnings. However, as it is early in the year and in light of continuing macro challenges and our assumptions about the direction of currency movements, we think it is prudent to maintain and not increase our earnings outlook for the year. 
Let's now take a look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 59.1% in the quarter was 0.9% higher than last year, reflecting many factors. We continue to benefit to some degree from lower product input costs while also taking some single-digit price increases globally in the first quarter that partly offset the effect of the weaker foreign currencies. Part of the gross margin increase also came from the absence of a onetime charge that we incurred in last year's first quarter for the closing of a diamond polishing facility. 
In addition, the favorable effect from higher-margin fashion jewelry sales was offset by solid growth in much lower-margin statement jewelry sales as well as the sales decline in Japan, which had a negative effect on gross margin. We continue to expect a modest increase in gross margin in 2015 as those favorable product input costs diminished over the remainder of the year. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 5% in the quarter, largely due as expected to marketing spending, partly tied to our new Will You engagement campaign and the launch of the CT60 watch collection. In addition, incremental U.S. pension and postretirement benefit costs affected the SG&A expense increase. 
We continue to expect that SG&A expenses will grow at a rate exceeding sales growth for the full year, reflecting the items that I just mentioned. The increased expense for our U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans will total approximately $30 million for the full year. However, we do expect some improvement in the ratio of SG&A expenses to sales in the second half of the year. 
Our forecast continues to reflect operating earnings for the full year approximately equal to the prior year. Interest and other expenses net declined in the quarter as expected from our debt refinancing in 2014. 
In addition, to a lesser extent, we benefited from some year-over-year changes in foreign currency transaction gains. We continue to assume interest and other expenses net at approximately $50 million in 2015. 
The effective tax rate of 34.7% in the first quarter was slightly lower than the 35.1% rate in the first quarter of last year. We also continue to base our earnings forecast on an effective tax rate in 2015 virtually unchanged from last year's 34.4%. 
In total, we were projecting net earnings to decline 30% in the first quarter due to the pressures from the strong dollar, the difficult comparison in Japan and softness in the U.S. However, the smaller sales decline led to a smaller-than-expected 17% decline in net earnings, although let's keep in mind that the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year. 
We're also pleased with the strength of Tiffany's balance sheet, which is consistent with our financial strategy. Cash and short-term investments totaled $715 million at April 30. Short- and long-term debt totaled almost $1.1 billion or 37% of stockholders' equity versus 35% a year ago. We have more than adequate resources to support the growth of our business and to provide for potential opportunities to return some excess cash to shareholders. 
Net inventories of $2.4 billion at April 30 were 2% lower than a year ago. That overall decrease included a small increase in finished goods that was more than offset by a decline in combined raw material and work-in-process inventories. On a constant exchange basis, inventories would have increased 2% due to new stores and product introductions. 
Our strategy for this year and over the long term is to keep inventory growth below the rate of sales growth through better productivity in our stores as well as in our overall supply chain. 
Accounts receivable of $192 million at April 30 was virtually unchanged from a year ago, with receivable turnover staying at 21x per year. Capital expenditures were $37 million in the first quarter versus $35 million a year ago. Our forecast continues to be based on CapEx at about $260 million for 2015, with considerable spending devoted to stores and for new IT systems such as global CRM and inventory management, among others. 
In terms of share repurchases, we spent $33 million in the first quarter to buy approximately 380,000 shares. At April 30, we had approximately $240 million available for future repurchases under the current authorization that runs through March of 2017. On a trailing basis, at April 30, Tiffany's return on assets was 9%, and the return on stockholders' equity was 16%, both of which are close to our long-term objectives to achieve at minimum a 10% ROA and a 15% ROE. 
Before concluding my remarks, I want to comment on our full year financial forecast. As I noted at the beginning of my remarks, we were pleased that the sales and earnings came in somewhat better than our expectations for the first quarter. But because it's still early in the year, we believe we should maintain our existing forecast in light of the strong dollar and lingering macro and market conditions and uncertainties. 
Our full year assumption of mid single-digit percentage worldwide sales increase on a constant exchange basis assumes varying degrees of growth across all regions. However, we expect continued pressures from the strong dollar that may possibly only begin to abate much later in the year, if at all, resulting in a low single-digit full year worldwide sales increase when translated into dollars. 
Our unchanged forecast of minimal earnings growth versus the $4.20 per share we earned last year on a non-GAAP basis continues to incorporate an expected earnings decline in the second quarter at a more moderate rate than in the first quarter as well as our assumptions of minimal sales growth but higher growth in SG&A expense again tied to marketing spending. We then continue to expect double-digit earnings growth in the second half of the year. 
So it's a plan built on progressively improving sales and earnings performance as we move through the year. And as we said on our last conference call, that minimal expected growth in earnings for the year would be more like a high single-digit increase if we excluded the estimated negative translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar and the cost from the incremental $30 million of pension expense. 
In conclusion, we believe that Tiffany is increasingly well positioned as one of the world's most important luxury brands and has the potential to be more productive and profitable over the long term. We have the growth opportunities, very sound strategies, a talent management -- a talented management team. And we're investing in important systems and capabilities and have financial resources to pursue those strategies. We believe we've had a decent start to the year, all things considered, and appreciate your interest in Tiffany. 
I'll now turn the call back to Mark."

On today's call, Ralph and I will comment on those results and how they are linked to our growth strategies and then wrap up the call with a few comments on the outlook for the rest of the year. 
Before continuing, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
Okay, starting with a first quarter overview. While results were admittedly far from robust, they did exceed our expectations, and we were pleased with continued progress in executing our key store, product and marketing-related initiatives. 
Net worldwide sales declined 5% in the first quarter, which was better than the 10% decline we had expected due to strong performance in Europe and a smaller-than-anticipated year-over-year decline in Japan. On a constant exchange rate basis, excluding the translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar, worldwide net sales increased 1%. 
Going from a 5% sales decline as reported to a 1% sales increase on a constant exchange rate basis shows just how much of a headwind we're feeling from the strong U.S. dollar in translation alone. We expect that to continue to one degree or another for the remainder of the year. 
Regional total sales performance, again, on a constant exchange rate basis ranged from a 21% increase in Europe, benefiting from strong foreign tourist and local customer spending there, to an 18% decline in Japan after a surge in spending there in last year's first quarter. 
In addition, we continued to experience solid growth in fashion jewelry sales highlighted by the TIFFANY T collection. We enjoyed growth in statement jewelry sales, and we began the rollout of our new CT60 watch collection. The operating margin declined as a higher gross margin was more than offset by higher fixed SG&A expenses, specifically higher marketing spending in support of our bridal category and the introduction of our new watches. 
In total, the better-than-expected sales performance resulted in net earnings declining 17% to $0.81 per diluted share, which, again, was better than our guidance that had called for an approximate 30% decline. 
Let's now look at regional sales performance. In the Americas, on a constant exchange rate basis, total sales increased 3%, and comp store sales rose 1% on top of an 8% comp increase in last year's first quarter. This minimal sales growth in the Americas reflected an increase in domestic spending, which was mostly offset by lower foreign tourist spending in the U.S., especially in New York, which we attribute to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Elsewhere in the Americas, we achieved healthy sales growth in Canada and Latin America on a constant exchange rate basis. 
In dollars, the 1% increase in total Americas sales resulted from favorable average price and mix being largely offset by lower jewelry unit volume tied to weakness at entry-level silver jewelry price points. We opened one store in the Americas during the quarter in the new Miami Design District. We now operate 123 stores in the region with additional openings planned this year, including Tiffany's first store in Chile in Santiago this summer as well as another store in Canada in Ottawa. 
Performance in the Asia Pacific region was mixed in the quarter. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales increased 4%, and comp store sales increased 2% compared with a 10% comp increase in last year's first quarter. We continued to see strong sales growth in China as well as in Australia and Singapore, but we continued to experience softness in Hong Kong and Macau as we believe some Chinese tourists have been traveling to and shopping in other regions. 
Measured in U.S. dollars, Asia Pacific sales declined 1% in the quarter. We experienced higher average price and mix, which was outweighed by a decline in jewelry units sold in the region, reflecting the meaningful sales weaknesses in Hong Kong and in entry-level silver jewelry. 
During the first quarter, we opened 2 stores in China, in Hangzhou and in Shanghai, and finished the quarter operating 75 Tiffany stores in the Asia Pacific region. So far in the second quarter, we've opened a store in Changzhou, China, and just today, we opened in the newly expanded Galaxy Macau. We have additional openings planned for the rest of the year, including our first store in Thailand in Bangkok. 
Now let's turn to Japan where the focus in the quarter was, frankly, all about getting past a very difficult year-over-year comparison. In last year's first quarter, we achieved 30% comp store sales growth in yen when customer demand surged in anticipation of a consumption tax increase on April 1. So it was not surprising to us that comp store sales in this year's first quarter declined 24% in yen. We now face easier year-over-year comparisons in Japan for the rest of the year. 
That 24% comp decline in yen in the quarter or 18% on a total sales basis was due to a substantial decline in jewelry units sold. The yen was 12% weaker on average than in the first quarter of last year, so when translated into dollars, total sales in Japan declined 30% in the first quarter. We believe such a substantial weakening of the yen has affected spending by Japanese tourists when they travel, but might be supporting some local spending in Japan. 
In addition, we are benefiting in Japan from increasing spending by foreign tourists especially from China. The store count in Japan was unchanged at 56 company-operated locations. All in all, our business in Japan has experienced substantial volatility over the past year, and we definitely look forward to some stabilization going forward. 
In Europe, strong foreign tourist spending as well as higher local customer demand drove a substantial 21% increase in total sales on a constant exchange rate basis, with double-digit growth across most of continental Europe. Comp store sales on a constant exchange rate basis rose 17% compared with a 3% comp decline in last year's first quarter.

However, we expect continued pressures from the strong dollar that may possibly only begin to abate much later in the year, if at all, resulting in a low single-digit full year worldwide sales increase when translated into dollars. 
Our unchanged forecast of minimal earnings growth versus the $4.20 per share we earned last year on a non-GAAP basis continues to incorporate an expected earnings decline in the second quarter at a more moderate rate than in the first quarter as well as our assumptions of minimal sales growth, but higher growth in SG&A expense, again, tied to marketing spending. We then continue to expect double-digit earnings growth in the second half of the year. 
So it's a plan built on progressively improving sales and earnings performance as we move through the year. And as we said on our last conference call, that minimal expected growth in earnings for the year would be more like a high single-digit increase if we excluded the estimated negative translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar and the costs from the incremental $30 million of pension expense. 
In conclusion, we believe that Tiffany is increasingly well positioned as one of the world's most important luxury brands and has the potential to be more productive and profitable over the long term. We have the growth opportunities, very sound strategies, a talent management -- a talented management team. And we're investing in important systems and capabilities and have financial resources to pursue those strategies. We believe we've had a decent start to the year, all things considered, and appreciate your interest in Tiffany. 
I'll now turn the call back to Mark."

On today's call, we will review the quarterly results and how they relate to our growth strategies, and then comment on the outlook for the rest of the year. 
Before continuing, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

So from an overall perspective, second quarter financial results from the top line to the bottom line continued to be significantly pressured by the strong U.S. dollar, and worldwide net sales, as reported, were flat to last year. However, excluding the substantial negative translation effect from that strong dollar, second quarter worldwide sales growth rose 7%, ranging from an increase of 27% in Japan, to 19% in Europe, to 9% Asia-Pacific, to the Americas, where sales were unchanged from the prior year, and lastly, to Other Sales, which declined 27%, all of which I'll explain in a moment. The strong dollar has also had meaningful and diverging effects on foreign tourist spending by region. 
We added 6 new stores in the quarter and expanded our product assortment with new jewelry and watch designs. Gross margin was unchanged in the quarter and the SG&A expense ratio rose. We also recorded an impairment charge of approximately $10 million or $0.05 per diluted share for a portion of a loan we made to a diamond mining company. As a result, net earnings declined 16% in the quarter. But excluding the impairment charge, net earnings declined 10% on a non-GAAP basis, which was in line with our expectation.
Let's now look at sales performance by region in the second quarter. 
In the Americas, on a constant-exchange-rate basis, both total and comparable store sales were equal to last year, which compared with an 8% comp increase in last year's second quarter. And looking forward, we are facing another tough comparison to an 11% comp increase in last year's third quarter. 
In this second quarter, once again, higher domestic spending in the Americas largely tied to strength in statement jewelry sales was offset by lower foreign tourist spending in the U.S., especially in New York and Hawaii, which we attribute primarily to the effect from the strong U.S. dollar. 
But generally speaking, our sales results in the Americas in the second quarter and first half, apart from the strength at the highest statement jewelry price points have reflected varying degrees of softness across much of the U.S. Conversely, comp store sales in Canada and Latin America have been strong. 
In dollars, total sales in the Americas declined 2%, as favorable price and mix was offset by lower jewelry unit volume, largely tied to continued weakness at entry-level silver jewelry price points, as well as a unit decline in fine jewelry. We opened 1 store in the Americas during the quarter in Rego Center in Ottawa, replacing an older store that we had closed last year. And we are looking forward to opening Tiffany's first store in Chile in Santiago next month. Also, we recently relocated 1 of our shops in Montréal from Holt Renfrew to the nearby Ogilvy department store. We will soon be relocating our store in Denver's Cherry Creek mall to an enhanced location within the mall. We are in the process of doing a similar relocation of our Century City store in LA. And we are relocating a department store location in Mexico. All of which exemplify our strategy to optimize the quality of our distribution base.
Moving to the Asia-Pacific regions. 
Sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis rose 9% in total, led by fashion gold jewelry and statement jewelry sales, while comp store sales increased 6% on top of a 7% increase in last year's second quarter. 
As we saw in the first quarter, performance in the region was once again mixed and led by double-digit sales growth in China and Australia, as well as varying degrees of growth in most other markets. However, our stores in Hong Kong and Macau continued to experience weakness that began in the second half of last year, as we believe a number of Chinese tourists have shifted their traveling and shopping to other markets, at least for the moment.
In addition, while our sales rose in Korea in the quarter, we believe the rate of growth was constrained by foreign tourists who avoided traveling to Korea during the MERS outbreak. It is possible that an improvement in sales growth may be gradual as foreign tourist bookings take some time to improve. 
With regard to recent news from China, in the same way that it's not possible to quantify the positive wealth effect from a rising stock market on our sales growth there in the past couple of years, it's similarly difficult to predict any potential negative effect on sales in magnitude or duration from their recent stock market correction or currency devaluation. But most important, Tiffany remains focused on the long-term growth opportunity to serve Chinese consumers, both locally and globally, and we have not in any way altered our strategies.
When measured in U.S. dollars, total Asia-Pacific sales increased 4% due to favorable price and mix. 
We expanded Tiffany's presence by adding 4 new stores in the Asia-Pacific region during the second quarter, including our first company-operated store in Thailand, in the Emporium shopping complex in Bangkok, our 29th and 30th stores in China in Hao Zhou and in Chengdu, and our third store in Macau in the newly expanded Galaxy. We are planning 5 additional store openings across the region in the second half of the year, as well as 3 closings, all consistent with our global store strategy.
Now let's look at Japan and its local currency sales performance. 
We think one can only really evaluate our results this year in Japan by reflecting on the dramatic sales volatility we experienced last year when comp store sales had increased 30% in yen in the first quarter due to a pull forward of customer demand in anticipation of a consumption tax increase on April 1, followed by a 13% comp decline in last year's second quarter. So we clearly had an easier comparison in this second quarter, but nonetheless, we were very pleased with the 21% comp increase that we achieved in the second quarter. And year-over-year comparisons in Japan are frankly also relatively easy for the balance of the year.
The 27% total sales growth in yen in the quarter was due in similar degrees to both unit volume increases across all jewelry categories, as well as favorable price and mix. In addition, while our sales in Japan are largely made to Japanese customers, the year-over-year sales growth has been due to increased sales to foreign tourists, particularly Chinese visitors, which are perhaps tied, to some degree, to the attractiveness arising from the weaker yen. And due to the substantially weaker yen versus last year, that 27% total sales growth in yen in the second quarter was reduced to 5% when translated into U.S. dollars. To repeat something we said on our last call, we believe the weaker yen has affected spending by Japanese tourists when they travel, but conversely, might be generating local sales demand in Japan. The store count in Japan was unchanged at 56 company-operated locations, but we are enhancing our store base by relocating 2[ph] department store based locations this year. 
In terms of our business in Europe, we were certainly pleased to the continuation of very strong local currency sales growth in the second quarter. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, both total and comparable store sales rose 19% compared with an 8% comp decline in last year's second quarter when we were seeing broad-based softness across Europe at that time. However, sales growth in this second quarter was geographically broad-based across Continental Europe and in the U.K., reflecting strong sales growth to foreign tourists, as well as, to a lesser extent, an increase to local customers. Engagement jewelry was the strongest category in Europe in the quarter.
To perhaps state the obvious, the euro and pound have weakened against the dollar in the past year. This has attracted foreign tourists to shop in Europe, while potentially discouraging some Europeans from shopping abroad and instead encouraging them to spend locally. Our performance in Europe reflects both phenomena.
When translated into U.S. dollars, total second quarter sales in Europe increased 2% due to favorable price and mix. 
During the second quarter, we opened a 550 square meters 2-level store on the fashionable in Geneva. We also recently relocated our store within Selfridge's in London to a more prominent location within that store, and are relocating our store within Harrods to a new location within that store. We now operate 39 stores in Europe, and believe there are considerable long-term opportunities to further develop our company-operated European store base.
Rounding out the segment review our Other Sales, which represented only 2% of worldwide sales in the quarter and includes retail store sales in the United Arab Emirates and Russia, as well as wholesale diamond sales and some third-party licensing revenue. 
Other Sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis declined 27% in total in the second quarter, largely due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds. On the other hand, comp store sales were up 8%. 
Earlier this year, we were pleased to relocate our store in the Mall of the Emirates in Dubai, taking advantage of the opportunity to update to our current store design and to expand the size of the store.
We mentioned in the regional commentaries that store openings are complemented by store renovations, relocations and several closings this year. Totaling up this activity, both completed and planned, we are on track to increase our company-operated worldwide store base by a net of 12 stores this year, representing a 4% net increase in both our company-operated store base and in worldwide square footage. At the same time, our strategy is to enhance our website with compelling content that builds brand and product awareness and drive store traffic. All of these initiatives support our broader global strategy to more effectively engage customers and enhance their experience and relationship with Tiffany.
In terms of a few merchandising highlights. As measured in dollars, the strongest performer in the quarter was the fashion jewelry category with a continued shift toward gold jewelry. Our statement solitaire category was mixed with substantial growth in high-end statement jewelry, but some softness in fine jewelry. And there was a bit of softness in the engagement jewelry category as well. 
Product innovation is an important strategy at Tiffany, which consists of introducing entirely new design collection, but also periodically expanding, refreshing and reinterpreting existing collections. An excellent example of newness and a strong contributor to growth in fashion jewelry sales is the TIFFANY T collection that we launched about a year ago. The collection continues to successfully attract style-seeking customers, as well as those purchasing gifts, and is one of the reasons we've seen strength in gold jewelry sales. Another successful collection worth mentioning is our diamond-focused Soleste collection, which expands engagement and fine jewelry. 
When we speak about expanding existing collections with new designs, one example is our popular Return to Tiffany collection, with the particular focus on pieces in silver. In addition, our fall ad campaign will also feature new interpretations of other iconic jewelry collection, including Victoria, and Tiffany boe in fine jewelry, and the infinity fashion jewelry collection in gold and silver. So there will be a wide range of newness in our assortment this fall, with freshness intended to improve overall sales growth and to also reinvigorate the silver jewelry category.
Lastly, we recently completed the month-long global rollout of our CT60 collection of watches. As previously discussed, we are supporting the watch category with extensive marketing to strengthen product awareness and brand credibility and heritage. And we are pleased with initial reactions from customers and the media. 
So that covers the sales highlights. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Ralph."

I'm in China this week visiting many of our locations to stay close to the numerous growth opportunities for us to pursue here. 
Now we'll get right into our second quarter results and a few key takeaways. 
The strong U.S. dollar continued to be a significant headwind on the translation of our results transacted outside the United States, having a 7% negative effect on worldwide sales. It also continued to have a significant negative effect on tourist spending in the U.S. A decline in the operating margin reflected a lack of SG&A expense leverage, higher marketing spending and an impairment charge tied to a loan to a diamond mining company. 
Net earnings declined 16% as reported. But excluding the impairment charge, net earnings declined 10% on a non-GAAP basis, which was smaller -- which was a smaller rate of decline than in the first quarter and in line with our expectation. But in light of the strong U.S. dollar and macro uncertainties, we modestly tempered our full year expectations for net earnings. And to be sure it's not overlooked, we are pleased with inventory performance and cash flow year-to-date.
Let's briefly review the rest of the earnings statement. 
Gross margin of 59.9% in the second quarter was unchanged from the prior year due to the favorable effects of product input costs and lower wholesale sales of diamonds, which typically earn minimal of any margin. But also, the negative effect from shifts in product mix, especially contrasting the relatively low gross margins of high-priced point statement jewelry sales, which were strong, with relatively high gross margins of silver jewelry sales, which were weak. In addition, previous price increases taken had been offset by the unfavorable effect of the strengthening U.S. dollar. We are now in the process of further raising prices in new regions that have experienced the most dramatic weakness in their currencies versus the dollar, while also taking some modest increases in other regions. For the full year, we continue to expect a modest increase in gross margin.
On a related note, I should add that the more recent declines we've seen in Precious Metals spot prices this year should eventually result in some benefit to gross margin, but it will take some time based on the rate of inventory turnover. Similarly, you may have seen recent industry reports that softening global demand has resulted in a retreat in diamond costs, albeit less pronounced for high-quality stones. While this has some favorable effect on our acquisition costs now, again, there is a long lead time before we will see any benefit in gross margin.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9% in the quarter, and would have increased 6% if excluding a roughly $10 million impairment charge for a portion of a loan to a diamond mining company. In both of those year-over-year comparisons, SG&A growth was reduced by 5% due to the translation effect of the strong dollar. Similar to the first quarter, the SG&A increase reflected higher marketing spending as expected, partially tied to a bridal campaign and the launch of our watch collection. We also recorded a portion of the $30 million of annual incremental U.S. pension and post-retirement benefit costs. There were also increases in labor and store-related occupancy costs as well. While we expect the SG&A expense ratio to increase in the full year due to the lack of sales leverage, we do expect some improvement in the ratio in the fourth quarter. 
In regard to the impairment charge, for many years, we have occasionally entered into financing arrangements with diamond mining companies as part of a strategy to secure high-quality diamond supply. Based on recent developments associated with the contractual terms of our agreement with the mine in Sierra Leone, we determined that it is probable that a portion of that loan will not be collectible in accordance with the contract terms. Therefore, we recorded a charge. And as you can see in today's 10-Q filing, the situation is still evolving.
In total, our forecast, which excludes the impairment charge and any potential future similar charges, now calls for operating earnings for the full year to be modestly below last year. 
Interest and other expenses net in the quarter was below last year from our refinancing of long-term debt to lower rates in the third quarter of 2014. In addition, the year-over-year delta also included modest foreign currency transaction losses in the second quarter after we benefited from some gains in the first quarter. We continue to project interest and other expense net at approximately $50 million in 2015.
The second quarter's effective tax rate was less than last year's second quarter as we expected. Last year's rate was somewhat inflated by changes in tax legislation, while this year's rate benefited from a reduction in the tax valuation allowance. We continue to forecast an effective tax rate in 2015 similar to last year's rate of 34.4%. 
Tiffany's balance sheet remains strong at the end of the quarter. Total cash and short-term investments were $771 million at January 31. Short-term and long-term debt totaled just over $1 billion, representing 37% of stockholders' equity. 
As we have stated in the past, our financial strategy is to maintain more than adequate resources to support the growth of our business regardless of short-term economic cyclicality. At the same time, we also regularly consider appropriate opportunities to return excess cash to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases.
As examples, we recently increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, which represented the 14th dividend increase in the past 13 years, and we spent approximately $56 million in the first half of the year to repurchase our shares at an average cost of $88 per share. At July 31, we had approximately $217 million available for repurchases under the current authorization that runs through March of 2017.
Our strategy for inventories is to always maintain deep assortments and high availability in our stores. But our goal for this year and beyond is to also keep inventory growth below the rate of sales growth by achieving better productivity in our stores, as well as in our overall supply chain. 
At July 31, net inventories were 7% lower than a year ago. When excluding the effect of translation of the strong U.S. dollar, inventories still declined by 2% compared with the first half 4% increase in worldwide sales on a constant exchange basis. 
Capital expenditures of $98 million in the first half were up slightly from $91 million a year ago. Our forecast continues to call for spending about $260 million this year, with an emphasis on stores and also new IT systems being implemented over several years, such as for global customer relationship management and inventory management. 
Lastly, we think it's prudent to revise modestly downward our full year net earnings forecast in light of the dollar being even stronger than we initially anticipated, as well as ongoing external volatilities. We had previously forecast minimum earnings growth on top of the $4.20 per share, excluding a debt extinguishment charge last year. Now we are forecasting net earnings 2% to 5% below last year when excluding the loan impairment charge taken in the second quarter and any further similar charges that could potentially be recorded later in the year. In addition, this assumes no net earnings growth in the third quarter versus EPS of $0.76 per share in last year's second quarter, which excluded the debt extinguishment charge, and then we expect the resumption of earnings growth in the fourth quarter. 
In conclusion, we met our overall expectations in the first half of the year despite the significant adverse effects from the strong dollar. Looking forward, we are pursuing numerous initiatives tied to further expanding and enhancing our global store base, product development and effective marketing communications in order to strengthen Tiffany's relationship with its customers. So we intend to stay focused on global growth opportunities ahead of us.
I will now turn the call back to Mark."

In addition, while our sales in Japan are largely made to Japanese customers, the year-over-year sales growth has been due to increased sales to foreign tourists, particularly Chinese visitors, which are perhaps tied, to some degree, to the attractiveness arising from the weaker yen. And due to the substantially weaker yen versus last year, that 27% total sales growth in yen in the second quarter was reduced to 5% when translated into U.S. dollars. To repeat something we said on our last call, we believe the weaker yen has affected spending by Japanese tourists when they travel but conversely, might be generating local sales demand in Japan. The store count in Japan was unchanged at 56 company-operated locations, but we are enhancing our store base by relocating 2 department store-based locations this year. 
In terms of our business in Europe, we were certainly pleased with the continuation of very strong local-currency sales growth in the second quarter. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, both total and comparable store sales rose 19% compared with an 8% comp decline in last year's second quarter when we were seeing broad-based softness across Europe at that time. However, sales growth in this second quarter was geographically broad-based across Continental Europe and in the U.K., reflecting strong sales growth to foreign tourists as well as, to a lesser extent, an increase to local customers. Engagement jewelry was the strongest category in Europe in the quarter.
To perhaps state the obvious, the euro and pound have weakened against the dollar in the past year. This has attracted foreign tourists to shop in Europe while potentially discouraging some Europeans from shopping abroad and instead encouraging them to spend locally. Our performance in Europe reflects both phenomena.
When translated into U.S. dollars, total second quarter sales in Europe increased 2% due to favorable price and mix. 
During the second quarter, we opened a 550-square-meter 2-level store on the fashionable Rue du Rhône in Geneva. We also recently relocated our store within Selfridges in London to a more prominent location within that store and are relocating our store within Harrods to a new location within that store. We now operate 39 stores in Europe and believe there are considerable long-term opportunities to further develop our company-operated European store base.
Rounding out the segment review are Other sales, which represented only 2% of worldwide sales in the quarter and includes retail store sales in the United Arab Emirates and Russia as well as wholesale diamond sales and some third-party licensing revenue. Other sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis declined 27% in total in the second quarter, largely due to whole -- lower wholesale sales of diamonds. On the other hand, comp store sales were up 8%. Earlier this year, we were pleased to relocate our store in the Mall of the Emirates in Dubai, taking advantage of the opportunity to update to our current store design and to expand the size of the store.
We mentioned in the regional commentaries that store openings are complemented by store renovations, relocations and several closings this year. Totaling up this activity, both completed and planned, we are on track to increase our company-operated worldwide store base by a net of 12 stores this year, representing a 4% net increase in both our company-operated store base and in worldwide square footage. At the same time, our strategy is to enhance our website with compelling content that builds brand and product awareness and drives store traffic. All of these initiatives support our broader global strategy to more effectively engage customers and enhance their experience and relationship with Tiffany.
In terms of a few merchandising highlights, as measured in dollars, the strongest performer in the quarter was the fashion jewelry category with a continued shift toward gold jewelry. Our statement, fine and solitaire category was mixed, with substantial growth in high-end statement jewelry but some softness in fine jewelry. And there was a bit of softness in the engagement jewelry category as well. 
Product innovation is an important strategy at Tiffany, which consists of introducing entirely new design collections but also periodically expanding, refreshing and reinterpreting existing collections. An excellent example of newness and a strong contributor to growth in fashion jewelry sales is the TIFFANY T collection that we launched about a year ago. The collection continues to successfully attract style-seeking customers as well as those purchasing gifts and is one of the reasons we've seen strength in gold jewelry sales. Another successful collection worth mentioning is our diamond-focused Soleste collection, which spans engagement and fine jewelry. 
When we speak about expanding existing collections with new designs, one example is our popular Return to Tiffany collection, with a particular focus on pieces in silver. In addition, our fall ad campaign will also feature new interpretations of other iconic jewelry collection, including Victoria, and Tiffany Bow in fine jewelry and the Infinity fashion jewelry collection in gold and silver. So there will be a wide range of newness in our assortment this fall, with freshness intended to improve overall sales growth and to also reinvigorate the silver jewelry category.
Lastly, we recently completed the month-long global rollout of our CT60 collection of watches. As previously discussed, we are supporting the watch category with extensive marketing to strengthen product awareness and brand credibility and heritage, and we're pleased with initial reactions from customers and the media. 
So that covers the sales highlights. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Ralph."

I'm in China this week visiting many of our locations to stay close to the numerous growth opportunities for us to pursue here. 
Now I will get right into our second quarter results and a few key takeaways. The strong U.S. dollar continued to be a significant headwind on the translation of our results transacted outside the United States, having a 7% negative effect on worldwide sales. It also continued to have a significant negative effect on tourist spending in the U.S. 
A decline in the operating margin reflected a lack of SG&A expense leverage, higher marketing spending and an impairment charge tied to a loan to a diamond mining company. Net earnings declined 16% as reported. But excluding the impairment charge, net earnings declined 10% on a non-GAAP basis, which was smaller -- which was a smaller rate of decline than in the first quarter and in line with our expectation. But in light of the strong U.S. dollar and macro uncertainties, we modestly tempered our full year expectations for net earnings. And to be sure it's not overlooked, we are pleased with inventory performance and cash flow year-to-date.
Let's briefly review the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 59.9% in the second quarter was unchanged from the prior year due to the favorable effects of product input costs and lower wholesale sales of diamonds, which typically earn minimal of any margin, but also, the negative effect from shifts in product mix, especially contrasting the relatively low gross margins of high-price-point statement jewelry sales, which were strong, with relatively high gross margins of silver jewelry sales, which were weak. In addition, previous price increases taken have been offset by the unfavorable effect of the strengthening U.S. dollar. We are now in the process of further raising prices in regions that have experienced the most dramatic weakness in their currencies versus the dollar while also taking some modest increases in other regions. For the full year, we continue to expect a modest increase in gross margin.
On a related note, I should add that the more recent declines we've seen in precious metals spot prices this year should eventually result in some benefit to gross margin, but it will take some time based on the rate of inventory turnover. Similarly, you may have seen recent industry reports that softening global demand has resulted in a retreat in diamond costs, albeit less pronounced for high-quality stones. While this has some favorable effect on our acquisition costs now, again, there is a long lead time before we will see any benefit in gross margin.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9% in the quarter and would have increased 6% if excluding a roughly $10 million impairment charge for a portion of a loan to a diamond mining company. In both of those year-over-year comparisons, SG&A growth was reduced by 5% due to the translation effect of the strong dollar. Similar to the first quarter, the SG&A increase reflected higher marketing spending as expected, partially tied to our bridal campaign and the launch of our watch collection. We also recorded a portion of the $30 million of annual incremental U.S. pension and post-retirement benefit costs. There were also increases in labor and store-related occupancy costs as well. While we expect the SG&A expense ratio to increase in the full year due to the lack of sales leverage, we do expect some improvement in the ratio in the fourth quarter. 
In regard to the impairment charge, for many years, we have occasionally entered into financing arrangements with diamond mining companies as part of a strategy to secure high-quality diamond supply. Based on recent developments associated with the contractual terms of our agreement with the Koidu mine in Sierra Leone, we determined that it is probable that a portion of that loan will not be collectible in accordance with the contract terms. Therefore, we recorded a charge, and as you could see in today's 10-Q filing, the situation is still evolving. In total, our forecast, which excludes the impairment charge and any potential future similar charges, now calls for operating earnings for the full year to be modestly below last year. 
Interest and other expenses net in the quarter was below last year from our refinancing of long-term debt to lower rates in the third quarter of 2014. In addition, the year-over-year delta also included modest foreign currency transaction losses in the second quarter after we benefited from some gains in the first quarter. We continue to project interest and other expense net at approximately $50 million in 2015.
The second quarter's effective tax rate was less than last year's second quarter as we expected. Last year's rate was somewhat inflated by changes in tax legislation while this year's rate benefited from a reduction in a tax valuation allowance. We continue to forecast an effective tax rate in 2015 similar to last year's rate of 34.4%. 
Tiffany's balance sheet remains strong at the end of the quarter. Total cash and short-term investments were $771 million at January 31. Short-term and long-term debt totaled just over $1 billion, representing 37% of stockholders' equity. As we have stated in the past, our financial strategy is to maintain more-than-adequate resources to support the growth of our business regardless of short-term economic cyclicality. 
At the same time, we also regularly consider appropriate opportunities to return excess cash to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. As examples, we recently increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, which represented the 14th dividend increase in the past 13 years, and we spent approximately $56 million in the first half of the year to repurchase our shares at an average cost of $88 per share. At July 31, we had approximately $217 million available for repurchases under the current authorization that runs through March of 2017.
Our strategy for inventories is to always maintain deep assortments and high availability in our stores. But our goal for this year and beyond is to also keep inventory growth below the rate of sales growth by achieving better productivity in our stores as well as in our overall supply chain. At July 31, net inventories were 7% lower than a year ago. When excluding the effect of translation of the strong U.S. dollar, inventories still declined by 2% compared with the first half 4% increase in worldwide sales on a constant-exchange basis. 
Capital expenditures of $98 million in the first half were up slightly from $91 million a year ago. Our forecast continues to call for spending about $260 million this year, with an emphasis on stores and also new IT systems being implemented over several years, such as for global customer relationship management and inventory management. 
Lastly, we think it's prudent to revise modestly downward our full year net earnings forecast in light of the dollar being even stronger than we initially anticipated as well as ongoing external volatilities. We had previously forecast minimum earnings growth on top of the $4.20 per share, excluding a debt extinguishment charge last year. Now we are forecasting net earnings 2% to 5% below last year when excluding the loan impairment charge taken in the second quarter and any further similar charges that could potentially be recorded later in the year. In addition, this assumes no net earnings growth in the third quarter versus EPS of $0.76 per share in last year's third quarter, which excluded the debt extinguishment charge, and then we expect the resumption of earnings growth in the fourth quarter. 
In conclusion, we met our overall expectations in the first half of the year despite the significant adverse effects from the strong dollar. Looking forward, we are pursuing numerous initiatives tied to further expanding and enhancing our global store base, product development and effective marketing communications in order to strengthen Tiffany's relationship with its customers. So we intend to stay focused on global growth opportunities ahead of us.
I will now turn the call back to Mark."

On today's call, we will review the quarterly results and how they relate to our growth strategies and then comment on the outlook for the rest of the year. 
Before continuing, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical fact are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
So from an overall perspective, second quarter financial results from the top line to the bottom line continued to be significantly pressured by the strong U.S. dollar, and worldwide net sales as reported were flat to last year. However, excluding the substantial negative translation effect from that strong dollar, second quarter worldwide sales rose 7%, ranging from an increase of 27% in Japan; to 19% in Europe; to 9% in Asia-Pacific; to the Americas, where sales were unchanged from the prior year; and lastly, to Other sales, which declined 27%, all of which I'll explain in a moment. The strong dollar has also had meaningful and diverging effects on foreign tourist spending by region. 
We added 6 new stores in the quarter and expanded our product assortment with new jewelry and watch designs. Gross margin was unchanged in the quarter, and the SG&A expense ratio rose. We also recorded an impairment charge of approximately $10 million or $0.05 per diluted share for a portion of a loan we made to a diamond mining company. As a result, net earnings declined 16% in the quarter. But excluding the impairment charge, net earnings declined 10% on a non-GAAP basis, which was in line with our expectation.
Let's now look at sales performance by region in the second quarter. In the Americas, on a constant exchange-rate basis, both total and comparable store sales were equal to last year, which compared with an 8% comp increase in last year's second quarter. And looking forward, we are facing another tough comparison to an 11% comp increase in last year's third quarter. In this second quarter, once again, higher domestic spending in the Americas, largely tied to strength in statement jewelry sales, was offset by lower foreign tourist spending in the U.S., especially in New York and Hawaii, which we attribute primarily to the effect from the strong U.S. dollar. 
But generally speaking, our sales results in the Americas in the second quarter and first half, apart from the strength at the highest statement jewelry price points, have reflected varying degrees of softness across much of the U.S. Conversely, comp store sales in Canada and Latin America have been strong. In dollars, total sales in the Americas declined 2% as favorable price and mix was offset by lower jewelry unit volume, largely tied to continued weakness at entry-level silver jewelry price points as well as a unit decline in fine jewelry. 
We opened 1 store in the Americas during the quarter in Rideau Centre in Ottawa, replacing an older store that we had closed last year, and we are looking forward to opening Tiffany's first store in Chile in Santiago next month. Also, we recently relocated one of our shops in Montréal from Holt Renfrew to the nearby Ogilvy department store. We will soon be relocating our store in Denver's Cherry Creek mall to an enhanced location within the mall. We are in the process of doing a similar relocation of our Century City store in L.A., and we're relocating a department store location in Mexico. All of which exemplify our strategy to optimize the quality of our distribution base.
Moving to the Asia-Pacific region. Sales on a constant exchange-rate basis rose 9% in total, led by fashion gold jewelry and statement jewelry sales, while comp store sales increased 6% on top of a 7% increase in last year's second quarter. As we saw in the first quarter, performance in the region was once again mixed and led by double-digit sales growth in China and Australia as well as varying degrees of growth in most other markets. However, our stores in Hong Kong and Macau continued to experience weakness that began in the second half of last year, as we believe a number of Chinese tourists have shifted their traveling and shopping to other markets, at least for the moment. 
In addition, while our sales rose in Korea in the quarter, we believe the rate of growth was constrained by foreign tourists who avoided traveling to Korea during the MERS outbreak. It is possible that an improvement in sales growth may be gradual as foreign tourist bookings take some time to improve. With regard to recent news from China, in the same way that it's not possible to quantify the positive wealth effect from a rising stock market on our sales growth there in the past couple of years, it's similarly difficult to predict any potential negative effect on sales in magnitude or duration from their recent stock market correction or currency devaluation. But most important, Tiffany remains focused on the long-term growth opportunity to serve Chinese consumers both locally and globally, and we have not in any way altered our strategies. When measured in U.S. dollars, total Asia-Pacific sales increased 4% due to favorable price and mix. 
We expanded Tiffany's presence by adding 4 new stores in the Asia-Pacific region during the second quarter, including our first company-operated store in Thailand in the Emporium shopping complex in Bangkok, our 29th and 30th stores in China in 
Guangzhou and in Chengdu and our third store in Macau in the newly expanded Galaxy. We are planning 5 additional store openings across the region in the second half of the year as well as 3 closings, all consistent with our global store strategy.
Now let's look at Japan and its local currency sales performance. We think one can only really evaluate our results this year in Japan by reflecting on the dramatic sales volatility we experienced last year when comp store sales had increased 30% in yen in the first quarter due to a pull-forward of customer demand in anticipation of a consumption tax increase on April 1, followed by a 13% comp decline in last year's second quarter. So we clearly had an easier comparison in this second quarter, but nonetheless, we were very pleased with the 21% comp increase that we achieved in the second quarter. And year-over-year comparisons in Japan are, frankly, also relatively easy for the balance of the year.
The 27% total sales growth in yen in the quarter was due, in similar degrees, to both unit volume increases across all jewelry categories as well as favorable price and mix. In addition, while our sales in Japan are largely made to Japanese customers, the year-over-year sales growth has been due to increased sales to foreign tourists, particularly Chinese visitors, which are perhaps tied, to some degree, to the attractiveness arising from the weaker yen. And due to the substantially weaker yen versus last year, that 27% total sales growth in yen in the second quarter was reduced to 5% when translated into U.S. dollars. To repeat something we said on our last call, we believe the weaker yen has affected spending by Japanese tourists when they travel, but conversely, might be generating local sales demand in Japan. The store count in Japan was unchanged at 56 company-operated locations, but we are enhancing our store base by relocating 2 department store-based locations this year.

However, sales growth in this second quarter was geographically broad based across Continental Europe and in the U.K., reflecting strong sales growth to foreign tourists as well as, to a lesser extent, an increase to local customers. Engagement jewelry was the strongest category in Europe in the quarter.

At July 31, net inventories were 7% lower than a year ago. When excluding the effect of translation of the strong U.S. dollar, inventories still declined by 2% compared with the first half 4% increase in worldwide sales on a constant-exchange basis. 
Capital expenditures of $98 million in the first half were up slightly from $91 million a year ago. Our forecast continues to call for spending about $260 million this year, with an emphasis on stores and also new IT systems being implemented over several years, such as for global customer relationship management and inventory management. 
Lastly, we think it's prudent to revise modestly downward our full year net earnings forecast in light of the dollar being even stronger than we initially anticipated as well as ongoing external volatilities. We had previously forecast minimum earnings growth on top of the $4.20 per share, excluding a debt extinguishment charge last year. Now we are forecasting net earnings 2% to 5% below last year when excluding the loan impairment charge taken in the second quarter and any further similar charges that could potentially be recorded later in the year. In addition, this assumes no net earnings growth in the third quarter versus EPS of $0.76 per share in last year's third quarter, which excluded the debt extinguishment charge, and then we expect the resumption of earnings growth in the fourth quarter. 
In conclusion, we met our overall expectations in the first half of the year despite the significant adverse effects from the strong dollar. Looking forward, we are pursuing numerous initiatives tied to further expanding and enhancing our global store base, product development and effective marketing communications in order to strengthen Tiffany's relationship with its customers. So we intend to stay focused on global growth opportunities ahead of us.
I will now turn the call back to Mark."

On today's call, we will review the quarterly results and how they relate to our growth strategies and then comment on the outlook for the rest of the year.

Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

So from an overall perspective, second quarter financial results from the top line to the bottom line continued to be significantly pressured by the strong U.S. dollar, and worldwide net sales as reported were flat to last year. However, excluding the substantial negative translation effect from that strong dollar, second quarter worldwide sales rose 7%, ranging from an increase of 27% in Japan; to 19% in Europe; to 9% in Asia-Pacific; to the Americas, where sales were unchanged from the prior year; and lastly, to Other sales, which declined 27%, all of which I'll explain in a moment. The strong dollar has also had meaningful and diverging effects on foreign tourist spending by region. 
We added 6 new stores in the quarter and expanded our product assortment with new jewelry and watch designs. Gross margin was unchanged in the quarter, and the SG&A expense ratio rose. We also recorded an impairment charge of approximately $10 million or $0.05 per diluted share for a portion of a loan we made to a diamond mining company. As a result, net earnings declined 16% in the quarter. But excluding the impairment charge, net earnings declined 10% on a non-GAAP basis, which was in line with our expectation.
Let's now look at sales performance by region in the second quarter. In the Americas, on a constant exchange-rate basis, both total and comparable store sales were equal to last year, which compared with an 8% comp increase in last year's second quarter. And looking forward, we are facing another tough comparison to an 11% comp increase in last year's third quarter. In this second quarter, once again, higher domestic spending in the Americas, largely tied to strength in statement jewelry sales, was offset by lower foreign tourist spending in the U.S., especially in New York and Hawaii, which we attribute primarily to the effect from the strong U.S. dollar. 
But generally speaking, our sales results in the Americas in the second quarter and first half, apart from the strength at the highest statement jewelry price points, have reflected varying degrees of softness across much of the U.S. Conversely, comp store sales in Canada and Latin America have been strong. In dollars, total sales in the Americas declined 2% as favorable price and mix was offset by lower jewelry unit volume, largely tied to continued weakness at entry-level silver jewelry price points as well as a unit decline in fine jewelry. 
We opened 1 store in the Americas during the quarter in Rideau Centre in Ottawa, replacing an older store that we had closed last year, and we are looking forward to opening Tiffany's first store in Chile in Santiago next month. Also, we recently relocated one of our shops in Montréal from Holt Renfrew to the nearby Ogilvy department store. We will soon be relocating our store in Denver's Cherry Creek mall to an enhanced location within the mall. We are in the process of doing a similar relocation of our Century City store in L.A., and we're relocating a department store location in Mexico. All of which exemplify our strategy to optimize the quality of our distribution base.
Moving to the Asia-Pacific region. Sales on a constant exchange-rate basis rose 9% in total, led by fashion gold jewelry and statement jewelry sales, while comp store sales increased 6% on top of a 7% increase in last year's second quarter. As we saw in the first quarter, performance in the region was once again mixed and led by double-digit sales growth in China and Australia as well as varying degrees of growth in most other markets. However, our stores in Hong Kong and Macau continued to experience weakness that began in the second half of last year, as we believe a number of Chinese tourists have shifted their traveling and shopping to other markets, at least for the moment. 
In addition, while our sales rose in Korea in the quarter, we believe the rate of growth was constrained by foreign tourists who avoided traveling to Korea during the MERS outbreak. It is possible that an improvement in sales growth may be gradual as foreign tourist bookings take some time to improve. With regard to recent news from China, in the same way that it's not possible to quantify the positive wealth effect from a rising stock market on our sales growth there in the past couple of years, it's similarly difficult to predict any potential negative effect on sales in magnitude or duration from their recent stock market correction or currency devaluation. But most important, Tiffany remains focused on the long-term growth opportunity to serve Chinese consumers both locally and globally, and we have not in any way altered our strategies. When measured in U.S. dollars, total Asia-Pacific sales increased 4% due to favorable price and mix. 
We expanded Tiffany's presence by adding 4 new stores in the Asia-Pacific region during the second quarter, including our first company-operated store in Thailand in the Emporium shopping complex in Bangkok, our 29th and 30th stores in China in Guangzhou and in Chengdu and our third store in Macau in the newly expanded Galaxy. We are planning 5 additional store openings across the region in the second half of the year as well as 3 closings, all consistent with our global store strategy.
Now let's look at Japan and its local currency sales performance. We think one can only really evaluate our results this year in Japan by reflecting on the dramatic sales volatility we experienced last year when comp store sales had increased 30% in yen in the first quarter due to a pull-forward of customer demand in anticipation of a consumption tax increase on April 1, followed by a 13% comp decline in last year's second quarter. So we clearly had an easier comparison in this second quarter, but nonetheless, we were very pleased with the 21% comp increase that we achieved in the second quarter. And year-over-year comparisons in Japan are, frankly, also relatively easy for the balance of the year.
The 27% total sales growth in yen in the quarter was due, in similar degrees, to both unit volume increases across all jewelry categories as well as favorable price and mix. In addition, while our sales in Japan are largely made to Japanese customers, the year-over-year sales growth has been due to increased sales to foreign tourists, particularly Chinese visitors, which are perhaps tied, to some degree, to the attractiveness arising from the weaker yen. And due to the substantially weaker yen versus last year, that 27% total sales growth in yen in the second quarter was reduced to 5% when translated into U.S. dollars. To repeat something we said on our last call, we believe the weaker yen has affected spending by Japanese tourists when they travel, but conversely, might be generating local sales demand in Japan. The store count in Japan was unchanged at 56 company-operated locations, but we are enhancing our store base by relocating 2 department store-based locations this year. 
In terms of our business in Europe, we were certainly pleased with the continuation of very strong local-currency sales growth in the second quarter. On a constant exchange-rate basis, both total and comparable store sales rose 19% compared with an 8% comp decline in last year's second quarter when we were seeing broad-based softness across Europe at that time. However, sales growth in this second quarter was geographically broad based across Continental Europe and in the U.K., reflecting strong sales growth to foreign tourists as well as, to a lesser extent, an increase to local customers. Engagement jewelry was the strongest category in Europe in the quarter.
To perhaps state the obvious, the euro and pound have weakened against the dollar in the past year. This has attracted foreign tourists to shop in Europe while potentially discouraging some Europeans from shopping abroad and instead encouraging them to spend locally. Our performance in Europe reflects both phenomena. When translated into U.S. dollars, total second quarter sales in Europe increased 2% due to favorable price and mix. 
During the second quarter, we opened a 550-square-meter 2-level store on the fashionable Rue du Rhône in Geneva. We also recently relocated our store within Selfridges in London to a more prominent location within that store and are relocating our store within Harrods to a new location within that store. We now operate 39 stores in Europe and believe there are considerable long-term opportunities to further develop our company-operated European store base.
Rounding out the segment review are Other sales, which represented only 2% of worldwide sales in the quarter and includes retail store sales in the United Arab Emirates and Russia as well as wholesale diamond sales and some third-party licensing revenue. Other sales on a constant exchange-rate basis declined 27% in total in the second quarter, largely due to whole -- lower wholesale sales of diamonds. On the other hand, comp store sales were up 8%. Earlier this year, we were pleased to relocate our store in the Mall of the Emirates in Dubai, taking advantage of the opportunity to update to our current store design and to expand the size of the store.
We mentioned in the regional commentaries that store openings are complemented by store renovations, relocations and several closings this year. Totaling up this activity, both completed and planned, we are on track to increase our company-operated worldwide store base by a net of 12 stores this year, representing a 4% net increase in both our company-operated store base and in worldwide square footage. At the same time, our strategy is to enhance our website with compelling content that builds brand and product awareness and drives store traffic. All of these initiatives support our broader global strategy to more effectively engage customers and enhance their experience and relationship with Tiffany.
In terms of a few merchandising highlights, as measured in dollars, the strongest performer in the quarter was the fashion jewelry category with a continued shift toward gold jewelry. Our statement, fine and solitaire category was mixed, with substantial growth in high-end statement jewelry but some softness in fine jewelry. And there was a bit of softness in the engagement jewelry category as well. 
Product innovation is an important strategy at Tiffany, which consists of introducing entirely new design collections but also periodically expanding, refreshing and reinterpreting existing collections. An excellent example of newness and a strong contributor to growth in fashion jewelry sales is the TIFFANY T collection that we launched about a year ago. The collection continues to successfully attract style-seeking customers as well as those purchasing gifts and is one of the reasons we've seen strength in gold jewelry sales. Another successful collection worth mentioning is our diamond-focused Soleste collection, which spans engagement and fine jewelry. 
When we speak about expanding existing collections with new designs, one example is our popular Return to Tiffany collection, with a particular focus on pieces in silver. In addition, our fall ad campaign will also feature new interpretations of other iconic jewelry collections, including Victoria and Tiffany Bow in fine jewelry and the Infinity fashion jewelry collection in gold and silver. So there will be a wide range of newness in our assortment this fall, with freshness intended to improve overall sales growth and to also reinvigorate the silver jewelry category.
Lastly, we recently completed the month-long global rollout of our CT60 collection of watches. As previously discussed, we are supporting the watch category with extensive marketing to strengthen product awareness and brand credibility and heritage, and we're pleased with initial reactions from customers and the media. 
So that covers the sales highlights. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Ralph."

I'm in China this week visiting many of our locations to stay close to the numerous growth opportunities for us to pursue here. 
Now I will get right into our second quarter results and a few key takeaways. The strong U.S. dollar continued to be a significant headwind on the translation of our results transacted outside the United States, having a 7% negative effect on worldwide sales. It also continued to have a significant negative effect on tourist spending in the U.S. 
A decline in the operating margin reflected a lack of SG&A expense leverage, higher marketing spending and an impairment charge tied to a loan to a diamond mining company. Net earnings declined 16% as reported. But excluding the impairment charge, net earnings declined 10% on a non-GAAP basis, which was smaller -- which was a smaller rate of decline than in the first quarter and in line with our expectation. But in light of the strong U.S. dollar and macro uncertainties, we modestly tempered our full year expectations for net earnings. And to be sure it's not overlooked, we are pleased with inventory performance and cash flow year-to-date.
Let's briefly review the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 59.9% in the second quarter was unchanged from the prior year due to the favorable effects of product input costs and lower wholesale sales of diamonds, which typically earn minimal, if any, margin, but also, the negative effect from shifts in product mix, especially contrasting the relatively low gross margins of high-price-point statement jewelry sales, which were strong, with relatively high gross margins of silver jewelry sales, which were weak. In addition, previous price increases taken have been offset by the unfavorable effect of the strengthening U.S. dollar. We are now in the process of further raising prices in regions that have experienced the most dramatic weakness in their currencies versus the dollar while also taking some modest increases in other regions. For the full year, we continue to expect a modest increase in gross margin.
On a related note, I should add that the more recent declines we've seen in precious metal spot prices this year should eventually result in some benefit to gross margin, but it will take some time based on the rate of inventory turnover. Similarly, you may have seen recent industry reports that softening global demand has resulted in a retreat in diamond costs, albeit less pronounced for high-quality stones. While this has some favorable effect on our acquisition costs now, again, there is a long lead time before we will see any benefit in gross margin.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9% in the quarter, and would have increased 6% excluding a roughly $10 million impairment charge for a portion of a loan to a diamond mining company. In both of those year-over-year comparisons, SG&A growth was reduced by 5% due to the translation effect of the strong dollar. Similar to the first quarter, the SG&A increase reflected higher marketing spending as expected, partially tied to our bridal campaign and the launch of our watch collection. We also recorded a portion of the $30 million of annual incremental U.S. pension and post-retirement benefit costs. There were also increases in labor and store-related occupancy costs as well. While we expect the SG&A expense ratio to increase in the full year due to the lack of sales leverage, we do expect some improvement in the ratio in the fourth quarter. 
In regard to the impairment charge, for many years, we have occasionally entered into financing arrangements with diamond mining companies as part of a strategy to secure high-quality diamond supply. Based on recent developments associated with the contractual terms of our agreement with the Koidu mine in Sierra Leone, we determined that it is probable that a portion of that loan will not be collectible in accordance with the contract terms. Therefore, we recorded a charge, and as you could see in today's 10-Q filing, the situation is still evolving. In total, our forecast, which excludes the impairment charge and any potential future similar charges, now calls for operating earnings for the full year to be modestly below last year. 
Interest and other expenses net in the quarter was below last year from our refinancing of long-term debt to lower rates in the third quarter of 2014. In addition, the year-over-year delta also included modest foreign currency transaction losses in the second quarter after we benefited from some gains in the first quarter. We continue to project interest and other expense net at approximately $50 million in 2015.
The second quarter's effective tax rate was less than last year's second quarter, as we expected. Last year's rate was somewhat inflated by changes in tax legislation, while this year's rate benefited from a reduction in a tax valuation allowance. We continue to forecast an effective tax rate in 2015 similar to last year's rate of 34.4%. 
Tiffany's balance sheet remains strong at the end of the quarter. Total cash and short-term investments were $771 million at January 31. Short-term and long-term debt totaled just over $1 billion, representing 37% of stockholders' equity. As we have stated in the past, our financial strategy is to maintain more-than-adequate resources to support the growth of our business regardless of short-term economic cyclicality. 
At the same time, we also regularly consider appropriate opportunities to return excess cash to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. As examples, we recently increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, which represented the 14th dividend increase in the past 13 years, and we spent approximately $56 million in the first half of the year to repurchase our shares at an average cost of $88 per share. At July 31, we had approximately $217 million available for repurchases under the current authorization that runs through March of 2017.
Our strategy for inventories is to always maintain deep assortments and high availability in our stores. But our goal for this year and beyond is to also keep inventory growth below the rate of sales growth by achieving better productivity in our stores as well as in our overall supply chain. At July 31, net inventories were 7% lower than a year ago. When excluding the effect of translation of the strong U.S. dollar, inventories still declined by 2% compared with the first half 4% increase in worldwide sales on a constant-exchange basis. 
Capital expenditures of $98 million in the first half were up slightly from $91 million a year ago. Our forecast continues to call for spending about $260 million this year, with an emphasis on stores and also new IT systems being implemented over several years, such as for global customer relationship management and inventory management. 
Lastly, we think it's prudent to revise modestly downward our full year net earnings forecast in light of the dollar being even stronger than we initially anticipated as well as ongoing external volatilities. We had previously forecast minimum earnings growth on top of the $4.20 per share, excluding a debt extinguishment charge last year.

In addition, this assumes no net earnings growth in the third quarter versus EPS of $0.76 per share in last year's third quarter, which excluded the debt extinguishment charge, and then we expect the resumption of earnings growth in the fourth quarter. 
In conclusion, we met our overall expectations in the first half of the year despite the significant adverse effects from the strong dollar. Looking forward, we are pursuing numerous initiatives tied to further expanding and enhancing our global store base, product development and effective marketing communications in order to strengthen Tiffany's relationship with its customers. So we intend to stay focused on global growth opportunities ahead of us.

Okay. In general, these third quarter results were mixed. The sales and margins continue to be negatively affected by the strong U.S. dollar, and net earnings came in several cents lower than we expected. However, worldwide net sales increased 4% on a constant-exchange-rate basis despite greater than expected softness in the Americas, reflecting strong growth in Japan and modest growth in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Worldwide net sales declined 2% when reported in dollars on a GAAP basis. In addition to the strong dollar, the set on translation of foreign sales in the US dollar, we continued to experience the negative effect on foreign tourist spending in the U.S. that was only partially offset by higher foreign tourist spending in other regions. 
In addition, we took a price increase in the quarter which moved us closer to restoring our global pricing structure to normal levels given the dollar's continued strength. 
Gross margin rose from the quarter and SG&A expense growth was modest. Adding it all up, EPS is $0.70 -- was down 8% from non-GAAP EPS of $0.76 last year which had excluded a charge for debt extinguishment. In other highlights, we introduced new designs in several existing jewelry collections in a range of materials and price points. We also made good progress with our long term strategy to optimize our store base with openings, renovations, relocations and closings and in light of recent stock price weakness, purchases under our stock repurchase plan were increased, allowing us to use our strong cash position to return value to shareholders.  So let's now look at regional sales performance. 
In the Americas, on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales declined 5%, and comparable-store sales were down 6% on top of an 11% comp increase in last year's third quarter. In the quarter, we once again, saw a substantial decline in sales to foreign tourists in varying degrees by nationality with pronounced weakness in the New York area, as well as in other tourist-related markets on the east and west coasts of the U.S. and in Hawaii. 
Sales to domestic customers were roughly flat to last year which we can probably attribute to a difficult year-over-year comparisons but also perhaps, the continued softness in broader consumer spending trends. It's also worth mentioning that we are in the process of some major U.S. store renovations, having just completed a magnificent upgrade of our important store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago and now focused on major renovations of our stores on Union Square in San Francisco and on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. In contrast to the disappointing sales results in the U.S, we continued to generate solid comp store sales growth in Canada and Latin America in the quarter. 
We entered the new market of Chile when we opened a store in Santiago in September. And just earlier this month, we relocated our Mexico City store within Palanco, which is the largest luxury department store Latin America. In dollars, total sales in the Americas declined 7%. Despite strong sales of statement jewelry, they were varying degrees of softness across most other jewelry categories, in stark contrast to last year's strong third quarter. 
Let's now turn to results in the Asia-Pacific region where on a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales increased 6% in total and comp store sales rose 2%, in contrast to a 3% comp decline in last year's third quarter. Overall, results in this third quarter reflected healthy sales growth in China and Australia, mixed results in other countries, and continued pronounced weakness in Macau and Hong Kong. During the quarter, we expanded our store base in Asia-Pacific by opening our fourth store in Macau in the Studio City Hotel and Resort. Earlier this month, we opened 2 stores, one in China, in Beijing, SKP, which is formally known as the Shin Kong Place, which is a major shopping center in China and the other, in Korea, in the newly built Hongdae Department store. With China and the new so much regarding the economy, stock market and currency, we are pleased and encouraged, that our total sales in China increased by a healthy amount in the third quarter despite volatility and sensitivity to headline macro events. It's also important to note that we continue to benefit from spending by Chinese tourists as they travel to other regions. So to reiterate what we have consistently said. Tiffany remains focused on the long-term growth opportunity to serve Chinese consumers, both locally and globally. And we have not, in any way, altered our strategies. 
When measured in US dollar, total Asia-Pacific sales declined 2% in the quarter, primarily reflecting the negative effect of currency translation. Japan in the third quarter once again posted strong sales growth in yen. Total sales rose 34% in yen driven by strong unit growth and increases in average price across all jewelry categories. A 24% comp increase in yen was on top of the 6% comp declines in last year's third quarter. The vast majority of purchases in Japan are made by local customers and overall growth in the quarter was partly driven by higher local customer spending.  Also contributing to the sales growth were higher sales to foreign tourists, particularly Chinese visitors, as I alluded to a moment ago, which may be related to the attractiveness arising from the weaker yen as well as the Chinese shifting some of their travel this year away from Hong Kong and Macau, at least for the moment. And I should add that a portion of Japan's non-comp sales growth in the quarter was due to the timing of some wholesale sales. 
The yen remains substantially weaker than the dollar but that 34% total sales growth in the quarter in local currency was still a solid 17% when translated into U.S. dollar. The store count in Japan was unchanged at 56 company-operated locations but we are enhancing our store base by relocating to department store-based locations this year. 
Europe also continued to perform well in the quarter on a constant-exchange-rate basis due to a combination of higher sales to foreign tourists and to local customers that was geographically broad-based across Continental Europe and in the U.K. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 9% and comparable-store sales rose 6%, on top of a 2% comp increase in last year's third quarter. Engagement jewelry was the strongest category in Europe in the quarter, but most other categories were up as well in local currencies. And during the quarter, as part of our focus on optimizing the existing store base, we relocated and transitioned our 1 store within Harrods in London to become 2 separate boutiques, one within their fine jewelry hall and the other, within their luxury jewelry hall. Earlier this year, we had also relocated our store within Selfridge's to gain a stronger and expanded presence. And just earlier this month, we were pleased to open our 48th store in Europe, representing our third story in Spain and second in Madrid, in the the department store. 
As we've said throughout this year about the euro and pound this against the dollar, has stimulated foreign tourist spending in Europe while perhaps, also encouraging some Europeans to shop locally rather than abroad. However, when translated into U.S.'s total third quarter sales in Europe decreased 4% due, as a small variations among jewelry categories in unit volume and average price. 
Lastly, other sales rose 8% in the quarter on a constant-exchange-rate basis, with comp store sales down 3%. The smallest of our segments includes comparable-store sales in our 1 store in Russia which has been a strong performer since opening last year, and our 5 stores in the United Arab Emirates. It also includes wholesale diamond sales which rose in the quarter as well as some third-party licensing revenue. 
One element of our long term strategy is to proactively engage customers in our stores through more consultative selling. As I've mentioned, paralleling that is our strategy to optimize our store base through a combination of store openings, renovations, relocations and closings. We are on track to increase our company-operated worldwide store base by a net of 12 stores this year, representing a 4% net increase in both our company-operated store base and in worldwide square footage. The longer-term expectation is to increase worldwide square footage closer to 2% a year. 
And of course, we complement our store presence with a regular enhancements to our websites in order to reinforce brand and product awareness. We were also pleased to see an increase in worldwide e-commerce sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis in the quarter. All of these initiatives in stores and online support our global strategy to further enhance customer's relationships and experiences with Tiffany. 
In terms of a few merchandising highlights as measured in dollars, category trends were pretty similar to recent quarters. While there was some continued softness in the fine jewelry part of our statement find in solitary category, we again, experienced considerable growth in high-end statement jewelry through our VIP customer events. The engagement jewelry category performed well in Japan and Europe, have continued to post soft results on a worldwide basis. The fashion jewelry category continued to have strong growth in gold jewelry, reflecting the success of the Tiffany Tea Collection, although it's worth noting that the year-over-year comparison was negatively affected by strong launch sales in last year's third quarter. While our strategy for product innovation includes the periodic introduction of entirely new design collections, such as Tiffany key, we are equally focused on expanding, refreshing and reinterpreting existing collections in the interim years. For example, in order to improve our performance in silver jewelry sales at price points below $500, we recently introduced new designs in our popular Return to Tiffany collection with more to come next year. We'd seen good initial results, but think we'd be better able to evaluate our success in the silver jewelry category after the holiday season. In other initiatives, Tiffany's infinity jewelry collection, which incorporates a design symbolic of continuous connection, energy and vitality, has been expanded in both silver and gold. At higher price points, we've expend the beautiful Victoria collection, with new designs in platinum and diamonds and the elegant Tiffany Bow collection with designs in gold and diamonds. All of these collections are being supported with broad print and digital advertising, and we've been pleased with initial customer reactions. Lastly, we continue to be pleased with initial sales of our new CT60 and the East-West collections of watches that were launched earlier this year. And we have just added some stunning new jewelry watches to the assortment. As we've previously said, we are supporting the watch category with extensive marketing to strengthen awareness of not only the product, but also our brand and credibility and heritage. 
So that covers the sales highlights, showing a wide range of performance and progress by region and product category. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Ralph."

Before I review the rest of the results, I would like to summarize some of the highlights regarding the third quarter. Once again, the strong U.S. dollar continued to negatively affect the translation of our results transacted outside the U.S. given 6% negative effect on worldwide sales and adversely affected tourist spending in the U.S. The operating margin, while benefiting from a high gross margin, continued to experience a lack of SG&A expense leverage. 
Earnings per share were down 8% from last year's adjusted EPS, and were below our expectation that call for no earnings growth in the quarter. We lowered our full year expectations for net earnings although we significantly increased our free cash flow projection based on effective inventory management. Lastly, in light of recent stock price weakness, purchases made under our stock repurchase program were increased using our strong cash position to return value to shareholders. 
Now let's look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 60.2% in the third quarter was 70 basis points higher than last year, partly reflecting the favorable effect of product input costs but also some negative effect from shifts in product mix, especially contrasting the relatively low gross margins of high priced points statement jewelry sales which were strong, with a relatively high gross margin of silver jewelry sales which were weak. 
Our increase in the wholesale sales of diamonds also had some negative effect on gross margin. In addition, we took some price increases of varying degrees in all regions during the third quarter, partly necessitated by the strong U.S. dollar, moving us closer but not completely, to restoring our worldwide pricing structure to normal levels. For the full year, we continue to expect a modest increase in gross margin. And as we've mentioned 3 months ago on our last call, gross margin should also benefit further from this year's declining precious metal and diamond costs, but that benefit will take some time to be reflecting the gross margin based on the rate of inventory turnover. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses expenses rose only 1% in the quarter, benefiting from the translation effect of the strong dollar and lower variable labor costs that largely offset investments in stores and higher pension costs. SG&A expense growth was reduced by 5% due to the translation effect of the strong dollar. In addition, as previously communicated, we had expected that year-over-year growth in marketing would moderate due to heavy spending in last year's second half, and that's what happened. Interest and other expenses net in the quarter came in about equal to last year. Interest expense itself continued to be lower than the prior year due to our refinancing of long-term debt to lower rates in October of 2014. However, we also recorded some foreign currency transaction losses in the third quarter. We continue to project interest in other expenses net at approximately $50 million in 2015. 
The third quarter's effective tax rate of 35.5% was in line with last year's third quarter, and we continue to forecast the full year effective tax rate in 2015 similar to last year's rate of 34.4%. 
In terms of our balance sheet. We finished the quarter with cash and short term investments of $725 million, while short term and long term debt of just over $1 billion represented 38% of stockholder's equity. 
An important part of our financial strategy is to maintain adequate liquidity to invest in growing our business regardless of short term economic cyclicality. At the same time, we also regularly consider appropriate opportunities to return cash to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. 
During the second quarter, we had increased our quarterly dividend by 5% which represented the 14th dividend increase in the past 13 years. During the quarter, in light of share price weakness, purchases under our stock repurchase program accelerated as we spent approximately $60 million to repurchase our shares at an average cost of $80 per share. We had expect $116 million from share repurchases in this year-to-date. And at October 31, we had approximately $157 million available for repurchases under our current authorization that runs through March of 2017. 
Another one of our financial goals is to keep inventory growth below the rate of sales growth by achieving better productivity in our stores as well as in our overall supply chain, while also maintaining deep assortments and high availability in our stores. I am pleased that our -- that at October 31, net inventories were 8% below last year. When excluding the translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar, inventories still declined by 4% compared with the 4% year-to-date increase in worldwide sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis. 
Rounding out our cash flow, capital expenditures were $159 million in the year-to-date versus $153 million a year-ago. We continue to forecast about $260 million for the full year with the focus on stores and new IT systems being implemented over several years including for global customer relationship management and inventory management. 
In terms of our financial forecast, we believe these the third quarter results, combined with volatile external conditions and negative effects from the strong U.S. dollar, justify a downward adjustment to our earnings expectation. Our company is well positioned for the holiday season with a strong product offering and a holiday advertising campaign that touches on many categories. However, the macro environment in the near-term remains uncertain in the Americas and elsewhere. Therefore, we now believe it's prudent to forecast full year EPS 5% to 10% lower than the $4.20 per share last year, excluding charges for debt extinguishment last year and loan impairment in the second quarter of this year. However, from a cash flow perspective, we are pleased with our progress in managing inventories more efficiently, and we are significantly increasing our free cash flow objective by $100 million to now forecast in excess of $500 million for the full year. 
In summary, despite a number of challenges that have affected our financial results this year, we are progressing in a number of areas that are all intended to strengthen Tiffany's positioning among the world's most important luxury brands while also enhancing profitability and productivity. I would now turn the call back to Mark."

Okay. In general, the third quarter results were mixed. Sales and margins continued to be negatively affected by the strong U.S. dollar and net earnings came in several cents lower than we expected. However, worldwide net sales increased 4% on a constant exchange rate basis despite greater-than-expected softness in the Americas, reflecting strong growth in Japan and modest growth in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. 
Worldwide net sales declined 2% when reported in dollars on a GAAP basis. In addition to the strong dollar's effect on translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars, we continued to experience a negative effect on foreign tourist spending in the U.S. that was only partly offset by higher foreign tourist spending in other regions. In addition, we took a price increase in the quarter which moved us closer to restoring our global pricing structure to normal levels, given the dollar's continued strength. 
Gross margin rose from the quarter and SG&A expense growth was modest. Adding it all up, EPS of $0.70 was down 8% from non-GAAP EPS of $0.76 last year, which had excluded a charge for debt extinguishment. In other highlights, we introduced new designs in several existing jewelry collections and a range of materials and price points. We also made good progress with our long-term strategy to optimize our store base with openings, renovations, relocations and closings. And in light of recent stock price weakness, purchases under our stock repurchase plan were increased, allowing us to use our strong cash position to return value to shareholders. 
So let's now look at regional sales performance. In the Americas, on a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined 5% and comparable store sales were down 6% on top of an 11% comp increase in last year's third quarter. In the quarter, we once again saw a substantial decline in sales to foreign tourists in varying degrees by nationality with pronounced weakness in New York area as well as in other tourist-related markets on the East and West Coasts of the U.S. and in Hawaii. 
Sales to domestic customers were roughly flat to last year, which we can probably attribute to a difficult year-over-year comparison but also perhaps to continued softness in broader consumer spending trends. It's also worth mentioning that we are in the process of some major U.S. store renovations, having just completed a magnificent upgrade of our important store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago and now focused on major renovations of our stores on Union Square in San Francisco and on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. 
In contrast to the disappointing sales results in the U.S., we continued to generate solid comp store sales growth in Canada and Latin America in the quarter. We entered the new market of Chile when we opened a store in Santiago in September. And just earlier this month, we relocated our Mexico City store within the El Palacio de Hierro Polanco, which is the largest luxury department store in Latin America. In dollars, total sales in the Americas declined 7%. Despite strong sales of statement jewelry, there were varying degrees of softness across most other jewelry categories, in stark contrast to last year's strong third quarter. 
Let's now turn to results in the Asia-Pacific region, where on a constant exchange rate basis, sales increased 6% in total and comp store sales rose 2%, in contrast to a 3% comp decline in last year's third quarter. Overall, results in the third quarter reflected healthy sales growth in China and Australia, mixed results in other countries and continued pronounced weakness in Macau and Hong Kong. During the quarter, we expanded our store base in Asia-Pacific by opening our fourth store in Macau in the Studio City hotel and resort. Earlier this month, we opened 2 stores: 1 in China in Beijing SKP, which is formally known as the Shin Kong Place, which is the major shopping center in China; and the other in Korea in the newly built Pangyo Hyundai Department Store. 
With China in the news so much regarding their economy, stock market and currency, we're pleased and encouraged that our total sales in China increased by a healthy amount in the third quarter despite volatility and sensitivity to headline macro events. It's also important to note that we continue to benefit from spending by Chinese tourists as they travel to other regions. So to reiterate what we have consistently said, tiffany remains focused on the long-term growth opportunity to serve Chinese consumers both locally and globally. And we have not in any way altered our strategies. When measured in U.S. dollars, total Asia-Pacific sales declined 2% in the quarter, primarily reflecting the negative effect of currency translation. 
Japan in the third quarter once again posted strong sales growth in yen. Total sales rose 34% in yen, driven by strong unit growth and increases in average price across all jewelry categories. A 24% comp increase in yen was on top of the 6% comp declines in last year's third quarter. The vast majority of purchases in Japan are made by local customers and overall growth in the quarter was partly driven by higher local customer spending. Also contributing to the sales growth were higher sales to foreign tourists, particularly Chinese visitors, as I alluded to a moment ago, which may be related to the attractiveness arising from the weaker yen as well as the Chinese shifting some of their travel this year away from Hong Kong and Macau, at least for the moment. And I should add that a portion of Japan's non-comp sales growth in the quarter was due to the timing of some wholesale sales. The yen remains substantially weaker than the dollar. But that 34% total sales growth in the quarter in local currency was still a solid 17% when translated into U.S. dollars. The store count in Japan was unchanged at 56 company-operated locations, but we are enhancing our store base by relocating to department store-based locations this year. 
Europe also continued to perform well in the quarter on a constant exchange rate basis due to a combination of higher sales to foreign tourists and to local customers that was geographically broad-based across Continental Europe and in the U.K. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales increased 9% and comparable store sales rose 6% on top of a 2% comp increase in last year's third quarter. Engagement jewelry was the strongest category in Europe in the quarter, but most other categories were up as well in local currencies. 
And during the quarter, as part of our focus on optimizing the existing store base, we relocated and transitioned our 1 store within Harrods in London to become 2 separate boutiques, 1 within their Fine Jewellery hall and the other within their Luxury Jewellery hall. Earlier this year, we had also relocated our store within Selfridges to gain a stronger and expanded presence. And just earlier this month, we were pleased to open our 48th store in Europe, representing our third store in Spain and second in Madrid in the El Corte Inglés department store. 
As we've said throughout this year about the euro and pound's weakness against the dollar have stimulated foreign tourist spending in Europe while perhaps also encouraging some Europeans to shop locally rather than abroad. However, when translated into U.S. dollars, total third quarter sales in Europe decreased 2% due to small variations among jewelry categories in unit volume and average price. Lastly, other sales rose 8% in the quarter on a constant exchange rate basis with comp store sales down 3%. This smallest of our segments includes comparable store sales in our 1 store in Russia, which has been a strong performer since opening last year, and our 5 stores in the United Arab Emirates. It also includes wholesale diamond sales which rose in the quarter as well as some third-party licensing revenue.
One element of our long-term strategy is to proactively engage customers in our stores through more consultative selling. As I've mentioned, paralleling that is our strategy to optimize our store base through a combination of store openings, renovations, relocations and closings. We are on track to increase our company-operated worldwide store base by a net of 12 stores this year, representing a 4% net increase in both our company-operated store base and in worldwide square footage. The longer-term expectation is to increase worldwide square footage closer to 2% a year. 
And of course, we complement our store presence with regular enhancements to our websites in order to reinforce brand and product awareness. We were also pleased to see an increase in worldwide e-commerce sales on a constant exchange rate basis in the quarter. All of these initiatives in stores and online support our global strategy to further enhance customers' relationships and experiences with Tiffany. 
In terms of a few merchandising highlights as measured in dollars, category trends were pretty similar to recent quarters. While there was some continued softness in the fine jewelry part of our statement, fine and solitaire category, we again experienced considerable growth in high-end statement jewelry through our VIP customer events. The engagement jewelry category performed well in Japan and Europe but continued to post soft results on a worldwide basis. The fashion jewelry category continued to have strong growth in gold jewelry, reflecting the success of the Tiffany T Collection, although it's worth noting that the year-over-year comparison was negatively affected by strong launch sales in last year's third quarter. While our strategy for product innovation includes the periodic introduction of entirely new design collections, such as Tiffany T, we are equally focused on expanding, refreshing and reinterpreting existing collections in the interim years. For example, in order to improve our performance in silver jewelry sales at price points below $500, we've recently introduced new designs in our popular Return to Tiffany collection with more to come next year. We've seen good initial results, but think we'll be better able to evaluate our success in the silver jewelry category after the holiday season. 
In other initiatives, Tiffany's Infinity jewelry collection, which incorporates a design symbolic of continuous connection, energy and vitality, has been expanded in both silver and gold. At higher price points, we've expend the beautiful Victoria collection with new designs in platinum and diamonds and the elegant Tiffany Bow collection with designs in gold and diamonds. All of these collections are being supported with broad print and digital advertising. And we've been pleased with initial customer reactions. Lastly, we continue to be pleased with initial sales of our new CT60 and the East West collections of watches that were launched earlier this year. And we have just added some stunning new jewelry watches to the assortment. As we previously said, we are supporting the watch category with extensive marketing to strengthen awareness of not only the product but also our brand credibility and heritage. 
So that covers the sales highlights, showing a wide range of performance and progress by region and product category. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Ralph."

Now let's look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 60.2% in the third quarter was 70 basis points higher than last year, partly reflecting the favorable effect of product input costs but also some negative effect from shifts in product mix, especially contrasting the relatively low gross margins of high price point statement jewelry sales, which were strong, with the relatively high gross margins of silver jewelry sales, which were weak. An increase in the wholesale sales of diamonds also had some negative effect on gross margin. In addition, we took some price increases of varying degrees in all regions during the third quarter, partly necessitated by the strong U.S. dollar, moving us closer but not completely to restoring our worldwide pricing structure to normal levels. For the full year, we continue to expect a modest increase in gross margin. And as we've mentioned 3 months ago on our last call, gross margin should also benefit further from this year's declining precious metal and diamond costs. But that benefit will take some time to be reflected in gross margin based on the rate of inventory turnover. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses rose only 1% during the quarter, benefiting from the translation effect of the strong dollar and lower variable labor costs that largely offset investments in stores and higher pension costs. SG&A expense growth was reduced by 5% due to the translation effect of the strong dollar. In addition, as previously communicated, we had expected that year-over-year growth in marketing would moderate due to heavy spending in last year's second half. And that's what happened. 
Interest and other expenses net in the quarter came in about equal to last year. Interest expense itself continued to be lower than the prior year due to our refinancing of long-term debt to lower rates in October of 2014. However, we also recorded some foreign currency transaction losses in the third quarter. We continue to project interest and other expenses net at approximately $50 million in 2015. The third quarter's effective tax rate of 35.5% was in line with last year's third quarter, and we continue to forecast the full year effective tax rate in 2015 similar to last year's rate of 34.4%. In terms of our balance sheet, we finished the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $725 million while short-term and long-term debt of just over $1 billion represented 38% of stockholders' equity. 
An important part of our financial strategy is to maintain adequate liquidity to invest in growing our business regardless of short-term economic cyclicality. At the same time, we also regularly consider appropriate opportunities to return cash to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. During the second quarter, we had increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, which represented the 14th dividend increase in the past 13 years. During the quarter, in light of share price weakness, purchases under our stock repurchase program accelerated as we spent approximately $60 million to repurchase our shares at an average cost of $80 per share. We expect $116 million for share repurchases in this year-to-date. And at October 31, we had approximately $157 million available for repurchases under our current authorization that runs through March of 2017. 
Another one of our financial goals is to keep inventory growth below the rate of sales growth by achieving better productivity in our stores as well as in our overall supply chain while also maintaining deep assortments and high availability in our stores. I am pleased that at October 31, net inventories were 8% below last year. When excluding the translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar, inventories still declined by 4% compared with the 4% year-to-date increase in worldwide sales on a constant exchange rate basis. Rounding out our cash flow, capital expenditures were $159 million in the year-to-date versus $153 million a year ago. We continue to forecast about $260 million for the full year with the focus on stores and new IT systems being implemented over several years, including for global customer relationship management and inventory management.

By now, I hope you've seen the news release we issued earlier today announcing our third quarter results. On today's call, Ralph and I will review the quarterly results and how they are tied to our growth strategies, and then we'll address the outlook for the rest of the year.

Okay. In general, the third quarter results were mixed. Sales and margins continued to be negatively affected by the strong U.S. dollar and net earnings came in several cents lower than we expected. However, worldwide net sales increased 4% on a constant exchange rate basis despite greater-than-expected softness in the Americas, reflecting strong growth in Japan and modest growth in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Worldwide net sales declined 2% when reported in dollars on a GAAP basis. 
In addition to the strong dollar's effect on translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars, we continued to experience a negative effect on foreign tourist spending in the U.S. that was only partly offset by higher foreign tourist spending in other regions. In addition, we took a price increase in the quarter which moved us closer to restoring our global pricing structure to normal levels, given the dollar's continued strength. 
Gross margin rose in the quarter and SG&A expense growth was modest. Adding it all up, EPS of $0.70 was down 8% from non-GAAP EPS of $0.76 last year, which had excluded a charge for debt extinguishment. 
In other highlights, we introduced new designs in several existing jewelry collections in a range of materials and price points. We also made good progress with our long-term strategy to optimize our store base with openings, renovations, relocations and closings. And in light of recent stock price weakness, purchases under our stock repurchase plan were increased, allowing us to use our strong cash position to return value to shareholders. 
So let's now look at regional sales performance. In the Americas, on a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined 5% and comparable store sales were down 6% on top of an 11% comp increase in last year's third quarter. In the quarter, we once again saw a substantial decline in sales to foreign tourists in varying degrees by nationality, with pronounced weakness in the New York area, as well as in other tourist-related markets on the East and West Coasts of the U.S. and in Hawaii. 
Sales to domestic customers were roughly flat to last year, which we can probably attribute to a difficult year-over-year comparison but also perhaps to continued softness in broader consumer spending trends. It's also worth mentioning that we are in the process of some major U.S. store renovations, having just completed a magnificent upgrade of our important store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago and now focused on major renovations of our stores on Union Square in San Francisco and on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. 
In contrast to the disappointing sales results in the U.S., we continued to generate solid comp store sales growth in Canada and Latin America in the quarter. We entered the new market of Chile when we opened a store in Santiago in September. And just earlier this month, we relocated our Mexico City store within the El Palacio de Hierro Polanco, which is the largest luxury department store in Latin America. In dollars, total sales in the Americas declined 7%. Despite strong sales of statement jewelry, there were varying degrees of softness across most other jewelry categories, in stark contrast to last year's strong third quarter. 
Let's now turn to results in the Asia-Pacific region, where on a constant exchange rate basis, sales increased 6% in total and comp store sales rose 2%, in contrast to a 3% comp decline in last year's third quarter. Overall, results in the third quarter reflected healthy sales growth in China and Australia, mixed results in other countries and continued pronounced weakness in Macau and Hong Kong. During the quarter, we expanded our store base in Asia-Pacific by opening our fourth store in Macau in the Studio City hotel and resort. Earlier this month, we opened 2 stores: 1 in China in Beijing SKP, which is formally known as the Shin Kong Place, which is the major shopping center in China; and the other in Korea in the newly built Pangyo Hyundai Department Store. 
With China in the news so much regarding their economy, stock market and currency, we're pleased and encouraged that our total sales in China increased by a healthy amount in the third quarter despite volatility and sensitivity to headline macro events. It's also important to note that we continue to benefit from spending by Chinese tourists as they travel to other regions. So to reiterate what we have consistently said, Tiffany remains focused on the long-term growth opportunity to serve Chinese consumers, both locally and globally. And we have not in any way altered our strategies. When measured in U.S. dollars, total Asia-Pacific sales declined 2% in the quarter, primarily reflecting the negative effect of currency translation. 
Japan in the third quarter once again posted strong sales growth in yen. Total sales rose 34% in yen, driven by strong unit growth and increases in average price across all jewelry categories. A 24% comp increase in yen was on top of the 6% comp decline in last year's third quarter. The vast majority of purchases in Japan are made by local customers and overall growth in the quarter was partly driven by higher local customer spending. Also contributing to the sales growth were higher sales to foreign tourists, particularly Chinese visitors, as I alluded to a moment ago, which may be related to the attractiveness arising from the weaker yen, as well as the Chinese shifting some of their travel this year away from Hong Kong and Macau, at least for the moment. And I should add that a portion of Japan's non-comp sales growth in the quarter was due to the timing of some wholesale sales. 
The yen remains substantially weaker than the dollar. But that 34% total sales growth in the quarter in local currency was still a solid 17% when translated into U.S. dollars. The store count in Japan was unchanged at 56 company-operated locations, but we are enhancing our store base by relocating to department store-based locations this year. 
Europe also continued to perform well in the quarter on a constant exchange rate basis due to a combination of higher sales to foreign tourists and to local customers that was geographically broad-based across Continental Europe and in the U.K. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales increased 9% and comparable store sales rose 6% on top of a 2% comp increase in last year's third quarter. Engagement jewelry was the strongest category in Europe in the quarter, but most other categories were up as well in local currencies. 
And during the quarter, as part of our focus on optimizing the existing store base, we relocated and transitioned our 1 store within Harrods in London to become 2 separate boutiques, 1 within their Fine Jewellery hall and the other within their Luxury Jewellery hall. Earlier this year, we had also relocated our store within Selfridges to gain a stronger and expanded presence. And just earlier this month, we were pleased to open our 40th store in Europe, representing our third store in Spain and second in Madrid in the El Corte Inglés department store. 
As we've said throughout this year about the euro and pound's weakness against the dollar have stimulated foreign tourist spending in Europe while perhaps also encouraging some Europeans to shop locally rather than abroad. However, when translated into U.S. dollars, total third quarter sales in Europe decreased 2% due to small variations among jewelry categories in unit volume and average price. 
Lastly, other sales rose 8% in the quarter on a constant exchange rate basis, with comp store sales down 3%. This smallest of our segments includes comparable store sales in our 1 store in Russia, which has been a strong performer since opening last year, and our 5 stores in the United Arab Emirates. It also includes wholesale diamond sales which rose in the quarter, as well as some third-party licensing revenue.
One element of our long-term strategy is to proactively engage customers in our stores through more consultative selling. As I've mentioned, paralleling that is our strategy to optimize our store base through a combination of store openings, renovations, relocations and closings. We are on track to increase our company-operated worldwide store base by a net of 12 stores this year, representing a 4% net increase in both our company-operated store base and in worldwide square footage. The longer-term expectation is to increase worldwide square footage closer to 2% a year. 
And of course, we complement our store presence with regular enhancements to our websites in order to reinforce brand and product awareness. We were also pleased to see an increase in worldwide e-commerce sales on a constant exchange rate basis in the quarter. All of these initiatives in stores and online support our global strategy to further enhance customers' relationships and experiences with Tiffany. 
In terms of a few merchandising highlights as measured in dollars, category trends were pretty similar to recent quarters. While there was some continued softness in the fine jewelry part of our statement, fine and solitaire category, we again experienced considerable growth in high-end statement jewelry through our VIP customer events. The engagement jewelry category performed well in Japan and Europe, but continued to post soft results on a worldwide basis. The fashion jewelry category continued to have strong growth in gold jewelry, reflecting the success of the Tiffany T Collection, although it's worth noting that the year-over-year comparison was negatively affected by strong launch sales in last year's third quarter. 
While our strategy for product innovation includes the periodic introduction of entirely new design collections, such as Tiffany T, we are equally focused on expanding, refreshing and reinterpreting existing collections in the interim years. For example, in order to improve our performance in silver jewelry sales at price points below $500, we've recently introduced new designs in our popular Return to Tiffany collection with more to come next year. We've seen good initial results, but think we'll be better able to evaluate our success in the silver jewelry category after the holiday season. 
In other initiatives, Tiffany's Infinity jewelry collection, which incorporates a design symbolic of continuous connection, energy and vitality, has been expanded in both silver and gold. At higher price points, we've expend the beautiful Victoria collection with new designs in platinum and diamonds and the elegant Tiffany Bow collection with designs in gold and diamonds. All of these collections are being supported with broad print and digital advertising. And we've been pleased with initial customer reactions. 
Lastly, we continue to be pleased with initial sales of our new CT60 and the East West collections of watches that were launched earlier this year. And we have just added some stunning new jewelry watches to the assortment. As we've previously said, we are supporting the watch category with extensive marketing to strengthen awareness of not only the product but also our brand credibility and heritage. 
So that covers the sales highlights, showing a wide range of performance and progress by region and product category. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Ralph."

Before I review the rest of the results, I would like to summarize some of the highlights regarding the third quarter. Once again, the strong U.S. dollar continued to negatively affect the translation of our results transacted outside the U.S., with a 6% negative effect on worldwide sales and adversely affected tourist spending in the U.S. The operating margin, while benefiting from a high gross margin, continued to experience a lack of SG&A expense leverage. 
Earnings per share were down 8% from last year's adjusted EPS and were below our expectation that called for no earnings growth in the quarter. We lowered our full year expectation for net earnings, although we significantly increased our free cash flow projection based on effective inventory management. 
Lastly, in light of recent stock price weakness, purchases made under our stock repurchase program were increased using our strong cash position to return value to shareholders. 
Now let's look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 60.2% in the third quarter was 70 basis points higher than last year, partly reflecting the favorable effect of product input costs but also some negative effect from shifts in product mix, especially contrasting the relatively low gross margins of high price point statement jewelry sales, which were strong, with the relatively high gross margins of silver jewelry sales, which were weak. An increase in the wholesale sales of diamonds also had some negative effect on gross margin. In addition, we took some price increases of varying degrees in all regions during the third quarter, partly necessitated by the strong U.S. dollar, moving us closer but not completely to restoring our worldwide pricing structure to normal levels. For the full year, we continue to expect a modest increase in gross margin. And as we've mentioned 3 months ago on our last call, gross margin should also benefit further from this year's declining precious metal and diamond costs. But that benefit will take some time to be reflected in gross margin based on the rate of inventory turnover. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses rose only 1% in the quarter, benefiting from the translation effect of the strong dollar and lower variable labor costs that largely offset investments in stores and higher pension costs. SG&A expense growth was reduced by 5% due to the translation effect of the strong dollar. In addition, as previously communicated, we had expected that year-over-year growth in marketing would moderate due to heavy spending in last year's second half. And that's what happened. 
Interest and other expenses net in the quarter came in about equal to last year. Interest expense itself continued to be lower than the prior year due to our refinancing of long-term debt to lower rates in October of 2014. However, we also recorded some foreign currency transaction losses in the third quarter. We continue to project interest and other expenses net at approximately $50 million in 2015. 
The third quarter's effective tax rate of 35.5% was in line with last year's third quarter, and we continue to forecast the full year effective tax rate in 2015 similar to last year's rate of 34.4%. 
In terms of our balance sheet, we finished the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $725 million while short-term and long-term debt of just over $1 billion represented 38% of stockholders' equity. 
An important part of our financial strategy is to maintain adequate liquidity to invest in growing our business regardless of short-term economic cyclicality. At the same time, we also regularly consider appropriate opportunities to return cash to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. 
During the second quarter, we had increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, which represented the 14th dividend increase in the past 13 years. During the quarter, in light of share price weakness, purchases under our stock repurchase program accelerated as we spent approximately $60 million to repurchase our shares at an average cost of $80 per share. We have spent $116 million for share repurchases in this year-to-date. And at October 31, we had approximately $157 million available for repurchases under our current authorization that runs through March of 2017. 
Another one of our financial goals is to keep inventory growth below the rate of sales growth by achieving better productivity in our stores, as well as in our overall supply chain, while also maintaining deep assortments and high availability in our stores. I am pleased that at October 31, net inventories were 8% below last year. When excluding the translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar, inventories still declined by 4% compared with the 4% year-to-date increase in worldwide sales on a constant exchange rate basis. 
Rounding out our cash flow, capital expenditures were $159 million in the year-to-date versus $153 million a year ago. We continue to forecast about $260 million for the full year, with the focus on stores and new IT systems being implemented over several years, including for global customer relationship management and inventory management. 
In terms of our financial forecast, we believe these third quarter results, combined with volatile external conditions and negative effects from the strong U.S. dollar, justify a downward adjustment to our earnings expectation. Our company is well positioned for the holiday season with a strong product offering and a holiday advertising campaign that touches on many categories. However, the macro environment in the near term remains uncertain in the Americas and elsewhere. Therefore, we now believe it's prudent to forecast full year EPS 5% to 10% lower than the $4.20 per share last year, excluding charges for debt extinguishment last year and loan impairment in the second quarter of this year. However, from a cash flow perspective, we are pleased with our progress in managing inventories more efficiently and we are significantly increasing our free cash flow objective by $100 million to now forecast in excess of $500 million for the full year. 
In summary, despite a number of challenges that have affected our financial results this year, we are progressing in a number of areas that are all intended to strengthen Tiffany's positioning among the world's most important luxury brands, while also enhancing profitability and productivity. 
I will now turn the call back to Mark."
