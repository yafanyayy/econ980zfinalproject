Good morning, everyone. Looking forward to seeing all or most of you in a few weeks in the Citi conference in Florida, so it's more about our company and the industry, and thanks for joining us on the call this morning. While 2014 is i",2346,"Thanks, Brittany. Good morning, everyone. Looking forward to seeing all or most of you in a few weeks in the Citi conference in Florida, so it's more about our company and the industry, and thanks for joining us on the call this morning. 
While 2014 is in the books, it was the best year we've ever had. I'll start by putting some context around the $4.94 per share or 7.2% year-over-year FFO growth that we just reported. As follows, 7% year-over-year growth a year ago, 2013 [ph] and 7.7%, 2 years ago in 2012, and keeps us right on track to double our income in 10 years. That you'll remember was the plan we laid out at our Investor Day at Assembly Row in 2013. 
The consistency of this performance continues for me to be one of the things I'm most proud of. It seems to me that over the years, more and more investors every day have come the value of that consistency and sustainability in the business that seems to be changing more and more every day. 
It's particularly noteworthy in 2014 because of the way in which it was accomplished. Research and development investments for the future usually detracts from current earnings, take drug R&D and the pharmaceutical business or technology R&D and Amazon, but the objective is to ensure competitive advantage long into the future. In our business, that R&D is the development, the marketing and the investment in top human capital that is focused on creating new state-of-the-art retail product that we believe will keep us on the forefront of our industry for decades not just quarters. 
Whether that takes the form of the first of its kind large-scale outlet, entertainment, restaurant, mixed use community like Assembly Row, or whether it takes the form of the transformation of a pedestrian strip center, like Mid-Pike Plaza into a multifaced mixed-use place to be, like Pike & Rose, like whether it takes the form of a niche 48-unit active living residential building that we researched that are now building at the back of Congressional Plaza. 
We couldn't be more proud of our R&D, if you will, even though the initial design, construction, lease up and marketing did dilute earnings in 2014 and will again in 2015. In fact, our FFO per share growth would've been double digits without them. Of course, our future wouldn't be nearly as bright and our 10-year plan would be far less assured too. I hope we always have as active an R&D pipeline as we do today. I know we will for the next few years. I think it sets us apart in the retail real estate business that is looking more and more generic and struggling for ways to grow. 
Let me now go through some of the major accomplishments of the fourth quarter and the year. First on the operating side. In addition of 7.2% FFO per share growth for the year, we grew at an 8.5% for the fourth quarter when excluding the early extinguishment of debt in both quarters. Same-store growth was strong in the quarter and the year, 4.5 plus [ph] percent in the quarter, 4.1% for the year including redevelopment, which by the way is what the business plan is all about. 
A portfolio that was 95.6% leased and 94.7% occupied at the end of 2014 right where it was at the end of the third quarter. Leasing was exceptionally strong, 83 deals were signed covering 340,000 square feet, 70 of those deals were for comparable space as is its existing space where there was previous tenant and those deals were signed at 33 27 a foot, 20% better than the 27 76 the previous tenant was paying in the final year of the lease. The 13 9 [ph] comparable deals related primarily to the lease up of the Point at Plaza El Segundo in California. 
One of the drivers of the quarters leasing results included the repositioning of Crow Canyon shopping center in San Ramon California where an underperforming lucky food store was replaced with a new sprout specialty grocer and a supply of hardware store. Those deals followed on a new sports authority deal replacing a bankrupt loan earlier in the year and the buyout of an owner's ground lease to give us full control of the shopping center. 
You can certainly figure that these shopping centers were $35 million more net of the capital that was invested than it was before these actions. The other driver of those leasing results was the renewal of a couple of bank pads at significantly more rent than they had been paying. With all the talk and worry about changes that consumer banking practices and the real estate needs, myself included among the worriers, this part of our business has remained remarkably strong. It's a testament to the continuing importance to banks of attracting customer deposits in important real estate locations. 
Okay, so more things I'd like to talk about before turning it over to Jim. Development updates on Assembly, Pike & Rose, the Point in Santana Row and some organizational shifts and new hires that give us the best chance of maximizing our potential. Jim will cover acquisitions and dispositions. 
So on the development, let's start with Assembly. The greater Boston community has clearly embraced the first phase of Assembly Row even if it is burried in snow at the moment. The retailer is 97% leased with 53 tenants open and operating, most doing better than either they or we have planned, and that includes the anchor system comprised of LEGOLAND Discovery Center, the AMC theater, Saks OFF 5th, and the restaurants who are all outperforming. 
In the office buildings, software developer, SmartBear, moved into their space a couple of weeks ago. We have a signed LOI with the digital media software company and lots of action on the remaining 4.5. We've seen dramatic improvements in the sales of the adjacent power center that we call Assembly Square marketplace and we fully expect to improve its merchandising and profitability in the next 12 to 18 months, a direct result of success of the Row. 
We're also happy to report that the Partners Healthcare construction is on pace for occupancy that will begin in late 2016. Concrete is being poured and the is operating as expected. The impact of this first 6 or 8 months strong opening in Assembly is a faster ramp to a 6% on levered and then beyond than we had anticipated just a year ago. It's very gratifying. 
We're just about done with design and planning for the next phase of Assembly, which will include a continuation of the retail street, residential bump, a partnership with a boutique hotel operator and a street connection with the partner site. Costs need to be finalized, a GMP contract negotiated and nother deal terms agreed to, we hope to be able to announce the required approvals to move ahead on our next call. Last word on Assembly is to recognize the passing of our General Manager, last month. Truly on of the great guys in our business. The successful launch of this community was in no small part due to Russe's commitment. Will miss him. 
At Pike & Rose, lots and lots of on-site construction these days, as we broken ground in the next $250 million that we announced on this call last fall. While at the same time, we complete construction on that last building in Phase 1 over the next few months. That means that 2 years from now, we'll have over $510 million deployed before selling 100 condos that is, on this site in 9 buildings, 360,000 feet of retail space, 750 residential apartments, 100 condos, 80,000 feet of Marilyn Jacquard office, 175-room Canopy hotel and nearly 2,000 parker spaces. 
On stabilization, that investment should yield between a 7% and 8% unlevered return and we'll still have much, much more to do on the site. Let me bring you up to speed on where we are right now. As I mentioned earlier, construction is a few months from completion on a high-rise residential tower we call Pallas and we expect to begin leasing as planned next quarter. The timing is great because our first residential building called PerSei is now 95% leased. 
A big disappointment for us in the short term on the average rents we filled the building up with the first time around. They're about 9% less than we had underwritten in part due to heavy construction during the entire lease-up period on the site and also due to losses in supply coming on the market one-time. As a result, we decided to lower our underwritten rent expectations on the high-rise a bit and when combined with some additional scope on the sitewide infrastructure that we now plan, we thought it prudent to reduce unlevered yield expectations on the first phase to the 7% to 8% range. 
The nice thing about residential leases is that they are generally 12 months long and so we get lots of opportunities to reprice as Pike & Rose matures and construction becomes more isolated. If Santana Row is any guide, we'll more than make up for that over time. Every bit of feedback that we get on this project improves our confidence about the region's need for a destination like Pike & Rose. And as particularly evident in the retail environment we're creating. The Phase 1 retail is fully leased and has led by the extremely successful opening of iPic, the luxury theater experience that is soundly beating it and our expectations, no other iPic location have seen this level of success in its first 100 days of operation. 
Out west, construction and leasing on our addition to the Plaza Segundo shopping node with 115,000 [ph] square-foot lifestyle center called the Point continues on-budget and on-schedule with tenants beginning to open this summer. Check it out when you're in L.A., it's only 3 miles south of LAX on.
In Santana, construction is underway on our $115 million, 225,000 square-foot office building with nearly 700 parking spaces on Winchester Boulevard at Alton avenue. It's being marketed as 500 Santana Row and will follow on the 125,000 square feet of office space that already exists elsewhere in Santana Row. That office space is fully leased and had some very strong rents. 
The continued explosion of the Silicon Valley economy, the strong job growth and the growing reputation of Santana Row as a very desirable office address has us very bullish about doing deals in this state-of-the-art building over its 18-month construction period. All of which leads me to the last topic for my prepared remarks and that's our team and organizational setup. 
We are clearly playing more aggressive offense these days and growing our overall real estate holdings pretty meaningful -- meaningfully, giving us very substantial development platform. Accordingly, we're consolidating our development efforts on the newly promoted Executive Vice President, Don Briggs. Many of you know Don as the guy primarily responsible for the design and execution of Assembly. We're doing this to assure that we prioritize and allocate our formidable development talent across all opportunities at the company, based on the best risk-adjusted termination of likely value creation. 
Don has been with us for over 15 years and represents one of the country's most experienced and most respected mixed-use developers. He'll report directly to me as well as a new position that we just announced in maximizing our residential profitability. You may have seen our press release last month about Mike Gennis [ph], who comes to us from Hilton worldwide and will join the team next month as Vice President of Residential Operations and Branding. We learned a lot and made a lot of money from the residential product that we've been offering at Santana Row over the last decade. 
Bethesda Row, Congressional Pike & Rose and soon Assembly need to benefit similarly. We've simply come to believe that higher end residential product in the successful mix-use environment requires a quarterback, one that can oversee our third-party residential managers while at the same time, understanding, capitalizing on and integrating the different uses to provide a better residential service and profit model. That's developing. 
We're taking a different approach to operations. While we're consolidating and centralizing our development group and residential oversight, we're decentralizing our East Coast operating group and breaking it up a little differently. The West Coast already operates on decentralized basis under Executive Vice President, Jeff Berkes, and now, we'll be dividing up our East Coast portfolio between our mixed-use division and our foundational core shopping center division. 
Our mixed-use division will be run by newly promoted Senior Vice President, John Hendrickson, who has been running our Northeast region for the last 7 years, out of our suburban Philadelphia office. John will relocate to federal headquarters in Maryland in the next several months. In terms of the leadership in the core shopping center division, we feel like this is a great opportunity to add a senior level shopping center operator to our executive team. There's a lot going on in the company these days, more than ever before and the creation of a new position to lead and grow the core shopping center division, gives us the chance to expand our senior team. 
Accordingly, we've instituted a search that Dawn Becker and I will be leading for a new senior VP at the core shopping center division. That division will include over 60 properties, spanning from Boston to Florida and oversee nearly $300 million of property level income. We would expect to identify the executives in the next several months. These changes and the organizations below them recognize the changing real estate landscape and better align our company and take advantage on it in the most productive way. Frankly, I couldn't be more excited. 
That's all I've got for our prepared remarks. Let me now turn it over to Jim, I look forward to taking your questions after that."

As Don highlighted, our final line results for both the quarter and the year represented another record for the trough.

As Don highlighted, our final line results for both the quarter and the year represented another record for the trough. As usual, large driver with growth in the quarter, which grew over 4% including redevelopment while occupancy remained. Our results also reflected the successful integration of the growth in Brook 35 acquisitions made earlier in the year, both of which outperformed our initial underwritings, a true testament to our partner Chris Cole and the team he has brought on board. 
This year, as Don also highlighted, we overcame several offensive drags from the openings of Assembly and Pike & Rose, initial phases of which have now successfully delivered as Don has discussed in depth. 
Our balanced business plan continues to deliver bottom line results while we invest in future growth. Value that we are delivering today that we'll continue to deliver in the future. In addition to the larger multi-face, multi-year projects at Pike & Rose and Assembly, we should also highlight that we delivered over 90 million of redevelopments during the year at assets like Ellisburg, Santana Row, Barracks Road and Hollywood at very attractive returns. 
In addition to these projects, we continue to expand and execute upon the redevelopment pipeline of over 290 million of redevelopments like the Point at Plaza El Segundo, Westgate and even a new 48-unit apartment building that's being built as we speak right behind us this conference room. In addition to successfully integrating the growth in Brook 35 acquisitions, we also closed last month on the acquisition of San Antonio Center in Mountain View, California, which we announced on last quarter's call. 
We couldn't be more excited about the potential for additional value creation at this phenomenal location, which comprises 33 acres and 1 of the dense and affluent areas in Silicon Valley. This transaction, which was sourced off market and structured on a tax-deferred basis, truly simplifies the type of acquisitions we remain focused on executing. While asset pricing remains very high against the backdrop of record low interest rates, we continue to actively pursue a few opportunities like San Antonio Center where importantly, we believe there is value to be added over time. We hope that further updates on our next call, but you can expect us to remain disciplined and focused on nursing the right opportunities to fit our business plan.
Turning to the balance sheet, we successfully raised $250 million of 4.5% 30-year notes in November and used about $200 million of those proceeds to pay off our 5 65 [ph] senior notes and our $61 million mortgage on East Bay Bridge. In so doing, we brought down the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt and importantly, increased our weighted average maturity by a little over 3 years. 
We ended the year with $47 million of cash and nothing drawn under our $600 million revolver. This provides us with more than adequate capacity to fund our remaining development activity without having access to capital markets. Of course, with rates recently testing all-time lows, we remain well positioned to opportunistically access these market to further turnout our near-term maturities and fund our development pipeline. Stay tuned.
Turning to guidance, we have maintained our range given last quarter of 5 26 to 5 34. For those of you who have accused us of being sand baggers and automatically moved to the top of the range, allow me to offer some insights on why we gave a larger than usual range and the factors that will influence where we end up in that range. 
First, the potential sale of Houston Street assets in Texas, which were closed to having under contract. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, the sale is not included in our guidance, but will be approximately $0.02 to $0.03 diluted depending on the timing of the closing and how quickly we can redeploy the proceeds from this sale of this slower growing asset. We will update you as that situation progresses. 
Second, given the timing of the San Antonio Center closing occurring this past January versus December, we incurred an additional $0.015 of transaction cost this year. While we typically have cushion for such cost in any given year, we do hope to incur additional transaction costs in other opportunities that we are pursuing. Some of which may be incurred prior to closing any time. 
Third, we've made a strategic decision to continue to invest in our R&D as Don put it, investing in our people and our platform so that we can responsibly scale under this massive pipeline of value creation that we have underway. As you would expect from us, we will not sacrifice the long-term for a few pennies in the short-term. I believe that we have most of this investment covered in our numbers, the transitional cost and other one-time expenses could also impact our numbers by up to a penny [ph] or 2. 
Finally on the investment side, we will always aggressively pursue near-term rollover and the related temporary decline in occupancy to create long-term value. It is always been a core tenet of our business plan and always will be. It's not a new initiative for us. However, with recent announcements like the potential Staples office, merger and the recent Chapter 11 filing of RadioShack, in addition 2 opportunities that Assemblies Power Center that had become more real in light of Assemblies amazing opening performance, we may get the chance to generate some long-term retenanting [ph] opportunities. Too early to tell what the extent of the impact will be in 2015, but again, we'll keep you posted.
Turning again to the larger timing assumptions factored into our guidance, we expect to deliver approximately $375 million of development and redevelopment this year. Some of the more significant deliveries include, approximately $80 million of office space at Pike & Rose and Assembly, which is being delivered in the first [ph] -- in the second quarter of this year. We conservatively underwritten 2016 rent start and hope to keep those with the final lease up. 
Approximately 77% of the retail at Pike & Rose is delivered is this occupied, which includes the iPic theater Del Frisco's summerhouse, city sport and sport and health among others. The balance of the retail space, which is 95% leased will continue to open as planned through the middle of this year. 
Pallas, the 319-unit luxury high-rise at Pike & Rose, which represents approximately $110 million of investments is slated to open this summer and is expected to lease up over the following 18 months. Finally, we expect the Point redevelopment at Plaza Segundo, which represents approximately $80 million of investment is also to open mid-summer and stabilize in early 2016. 
Given this timing, we expect our quarterly FFO to start lower in the first quarter and ramp significantly during the course of the year versus being flat. From a capital standpoint again, we expect to fund approximately $300 million of development and redevelopment expenditures through long-term debt, our ATM and our line of credit. As mentioned earlier, we will remain opportunistic as it relates to rates and while we look for ways in this environment to term out our maturities and reduce our weighted average debt cost.
In closing, we had a lot of great opportunities delivering now for the long-term, and could be more excited about how we continue to execute upon that business plan that we laid out for you in 2013. We look forward to seeing many of you at the Wells Fargo and Citi conferences in the coming weeks. And with that, operator, we'd like to turn it over for questions."

What we've been doing for the last 5 years really since the recession hit is really doing some very, very good blocking and tackling, and we divided the portfolio up between Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. The problem with that, as you get into a more aggressive offensive posture is that what we're delivering on the mixed-use stuff takes a lot of time. It's hard and the skill set in the leasing side is a different skill set than it is on the core shopping center side. So being able to align that leasing with specific management for those properties, we see is as a real positive on both mixed-use and what it should do to the core because it allows a lot more -- it doesn't allow distractions between properties that do take more time, that do -- that have different skill sets associated with them and the core, which is the horse and the thing that allows us to keep going. So this is an alignment of leasing with the management of each of those divisions that I doubt it will have a significant impact in 2015, but we're resetting this up for the long-term and where we're going over the next 10 years. So better alignment is what it's all about. It will not change the leasing process. It will focus the leasing personnel more with their operating counterpoint -- part."

We have put in an interim plan in case anything happens quickly with me in terms of how the board would -- what people would take over things, et cetera, which is really important to have as an interim plan. But more importantly, in terms of a long-range plan, I can tell you that I personally take it as my responsibility and the board holds me accountable to this, to develop people within this company that do have the ability to take over at some point. And I can tell you, we do have people that I know that I'm working with to try to make sure there's more than 1 or 2 that have the ability at some point in the future. Outside of that, listen, it's a big world and there would certainly be a vigorous external process to the extent that was -- when the time came because you never want to only rely on 1 spot, but whether there are great people out there or not, I don't know. I certainly would expect there to be, but I wouldn't rely on solely, that's for sure."

For me, that -- we're trying to anticipate that into the Pallas building also in about the same amount, the same thoughts but I don't want to say this, I don't want to sound cavalier, but big deal because the nice thing about this 12-month lease process as you go forward and we've seen it at Santana, in fact, just before the meeting, I wanted to -- I asked Dawn is can we pull together do you think, what are our growth rate has been over 10 years at Santana and our various different products, and we don't have it here, but we will in time for Citi. I think you'll see what I'm saying by being able to create this kind of a mixed-use environment, which other people do not have to this level. We can see and the people who are coming in, the ability to push rents going forward is clearly better than in other type of more generic products through and through. So always trying to be out front with what your expectations are. I really didn't feel comfortable. We didn't fall comfortable of keeping it at 8 to 9, given what has happened with the first building being 9% off, and so to appropriately lay out where we think we'll be upon that first complete phase, including Pallas, leased up, we brought it to 7 and 8, and 7 and 8. But I don't want you to think about as a masse on this project long-term because I do believe this, like Assembly, like Santana has a great growth profile associated with it."

I think that aggregate NOI growth also included acquisitions, which what I would tell you is we remained disciplined and what you can take from acquisitions like San Antonio Center is that we're still able to find in a low cap rate environment opportunities that we think will be accretive to our growth in the long-term and that's the disappointment that we've retained. We certainly could go out and drive a bunch of near-term accretion, but diminish our long-term growth and we're just not going to do that. But in terms of how the core is performing and what we laid out, I think we're right on track. I think as I've said before, our rollover growth right now at this point in recovery is very strong. The other thing I'd point out is that we've been producing this really on an occupancy-neutral basis, which is important to highlight because I think that on a comparative basis, it can look less robust, but when you're able to generate this type of growth on a portfolio that was 95.6% leased at the beginning of the year and 95.6% leased at the end of the year, I think it speaks volumes to the job that our leasing team is doing led by Chris and the assets themselves."

There is -- new supply is not a surprise. It takes time to build and it was clear as to what was going to be there, but it's never clear in a particular environment or at a particular leasing meeting or strategy or when you have a person on the other side of you, what it is that those competitors are doing with their rents was is that they're doing with our concessions and you do business in a marketplace. So it's not about lessons learned in this case at all, frankly, in terms of the product that was coming on, I think we're right on, but to the extent we are going to have competitors drop prices significantly or significantly increase our concessions, we're going to follow suit because we want the bodies in the building. I do think where we did underestimate it was the impact of the construction on the site and it's not like it's a single building. It is a building within the middle of lots of stuff happening on it and I don't remember the last time that you were at the site specifically. But you know when we do these phased projects, we are going to lay, if we're confident with what we're seeing in terms of demand in the first phase and we are, despite the fact that it's 9% lower on the actual rent by the way, the rent is still a big number. It's not like we're -- it's not like this is a 9% off, this are not $1,500 a month apartment. This is expensive stuff, so it's still a big number. We are going to try to start the next phase as long as we're comfortable on top of the first phase to be able to create the critical math. So if you're going to have -- if really, let's say, what it is that we've learned, it would be that first set of lease up, we've got to fill the building and the construction impact of that first phase in a mixed-use project where you got lots of other construction directly adjacent to where you're asking somebody to live, it's going to be more than we thought."

It's an excellent question and frankly, I love to use the word balance in there because it is a balance, the entire thing all the way through. It is the notion that there is not demand for the residential product, it's just wrong. The residential product -- I mean that first building is done, it is leased up, it is leased up in exactly the time frame that we expected it to. So when you're sitting and talking about rents that are at $2.40 a foot versus $2.58 a foot or something like that, that on the balance equation is certainly not going to lead you to, well not building. In fact, in answer that Alex's question earlier, if we had thought harder about the construction impact and had laid out 7% to 8% at the on-site set here, I think you would've said wow, that's fantastic that you're getting those kind of numbers. That's how I feel. And so you're right that there is that balanced question on these projects. Assembly, frankly, has made it extremely easy for us because on the retail side in particular, it just -- it really has been accepted by the community much more than we have even hoped it to say, and as far as I understand, I'm not talking about grave on, because I don't know their numbers inside, but I have a feeling you'd hear the same from them, so going to the next phase of Assembly, again assuming we can get the numbers where we need them to be and I hope we will. We expect that we will, that one's easy. At Pike & Rose, when you talk about it the way I just pointed it out, there's no doubt we should be moving forward, in my mind at least with this second phase to create the critical mass. But also because there is sufficient demand for the residential product, there definitely demand for those sell products. We think the condo product is going to fly off with. Who knows, it will be what it will be, but we are very conscious in the balance that you talk about, and in both of those situations, I don't think it's close with respect to not moving forward."

But the funny comment is whenever you talk pricing pressure, and I look across the table and I see the head of leasing, Chris Weilminster, he puts his head down and start smiling, because I appreciate you doing that, for putting pressure on him, with respect to that. And I'm going to answer for him on that. It depends. That is a one-off negotiation by negotiating dynamic. We do the best we can, so I think that by being a more lease rather than less lease, that is over all a good thing for us, yes, I do. There's no question about it I mean in terms of that. Can I quantify it? For you, no. No, I don't. Most of the space that's left and not leased is not obviously the best space in the portfolio, so where I would rather go is actually not emphasized the lease rollovers as much and push hard on that other 6% or 7% that is not leased up there to be able to get it done at any rates. And often we hold -- not hold off, but effectively work hard to get full rent and some of that stuff you can't. So you may actually see lease rollovers come down a little a bit as occupancy goes a little bit further, again that's the balance, that's the overall mix between rate and volume.

I want to thank you for joining us on the call this morning. While",2361,"Thanks, Brittany. Good morning, everyone. Looking forward to seeing all or most of you in a few weeks in the Citi conference in Florida, so it's more about our company and our industry. I want to thank you for joining us on the call this morning. 
While 2014 is in the books, it was the best year we've ever had -- and by a wide margin. I want to start by putting some context around the $4.94 per share or 7.2% year-over-year FFO growth that we just reported. As follows, 7% year-over-year growth a year ago in 2013, and 7.7%, 2 years ago in 2012, and keeps us right on track to double our income in 10 years. That you'll remember was the plan we laid out at our Investor Day at Assembly Row in 2013. 
The consistency of this performance continues for me to be one of the things I'm most proud of. It seems to me that over the years, more and more investors every day have come to value that consistency and sustainability in the business that seems to be changing more and more every day. 
It's particularly noteworthy in 2014 because of the way in which it was accomplished. Research and development investments for the future usually detracts from current earnings, take drug R&D and the pharmaceutical business or technology R&D and Amazon, but the objective is to ensure competitive advantage long into the future. In our business, that R&D is the development, the marketing and the investment in top human capital that is focused on creating new state-of-the-art retail product that we believe will keep us on the forefront of our industry for decades not just quarters. 
Whether that takes the form of the first of its kind large-scale outlet, entertainment, restaurant, mixed use community like Assembly Row, or whether it takes the form of the transformation of a pedestrian strip center, like Mid-Pike Plaza into a multifaced mixed-use place to be, like Pike & Rose, like whether it takes the form of a niche 48-unit active living residential building that we researched that are now building in the back of Congressional Plaza. 
We couldn't be more proud of our R&D, if you will, even though the initial design, construction, lease up and marketing did dilute earnings in 2014 and will again in 2015. In fact, our FFO per share growth would've been double digits without them. Of course, our future wouldn't be nearly as bright and our 10-year plan would be far less assured too. I hope we always have as active in R&D pipeline as we do today. I know we will for the next few years. I think it sets us apart in the retail real estate business that is looking more and more generic and struggling for ways to grow. 
Let me now go through some of the major accomplishments of the fourth quarter and the year. First on the operating side. In addition to 7.2% FFO per share growth for the year, we grew at an 8.5% for the fourth quarter, when excluding the early extinguishment of debt in both quarters. Same-store growth was strong in the quarter and the year, 4.5% percent in the quarter, 4.1% for the year including redevelopment, which by the way is what this business plan is all about. 
A portfolio that was 95.6% leased and 94.7% occupied at the end of 2014, right where it was at the end of the third quarter. Leasing was exceptionally strong, 83 deals were signed covering 340,000 square feet, 70 of those deals were for comparable space, as is its existing space where there was previous tenant and those deals were signed at $33.27 a foot, 20% better than the $27.76 the previous tenant was paying in their final year of the lease. The $13.9 comparable deals related primarily to the lease up of the Point at Plaza El Segundo in California. 
One of the drivers of the quarter are leasing results, included the repositioning of Crow Canyon shopping center in San Ramon, California, where an underperforming lucky food store was replaced with a new sprout specialty grocer and in order to supply of hardware store. Those deals followed on a new sports authority deal replacing a bankrupt Loehmann's earlier in the year, and the buyout of an owner's ground lease to give us full control of the shopping center. 
You can certainly figure that these shopping centers were $35 million more net of the capital that was invested than it was before these actions. The other driver of those leasing results was the renewal of a couple of bank pads at significantly more rent than they had been paying. With all the talk and worry about changes that consumer banking practices and the real estate needs, myself included among the worriers, this part of our business has remained remarkably strong. It's a testament to the continuing importance to banks of attracting customer deposits in important real estate locations. 
Okay. Some more things I'd like to talk about before turning it over to Jim. Development updates on Assembly, Pike & Rose, the Point in Santana Row and some organizational shifts and new hires that give us the best chance of maximizing our potential. Jim will cover acquisitions and dispositions. 
So on the development, let's start with Assembly. The greater Boston community has clearly embraced the first phase of Assembly Row even if it is buried in snow at the moment. The retailer is 97% leased with 53 tenants open and operating, most doing better than either they or we have planned, and that includes the anchor system, comprised of LEGOLAND Discovery Center, the AMC theater, Saks OFF 5th, and the restaurants, who are all outperforming. 
In the office buildings, software developer, SmartBear, moved into their space a couple of weeks ago. We have a signed LOI with a digital media software company and lots of action on the remaining 4.5. We've seen dramatic improvements in the sales of the adjacent power center that we call Assembly Square marketplace and we fully expect to improve its merchandising and profitability in the next 12 to 18 months, a direct result of success of the Row. 
We're also happy to report that the Partners Healthcare construction is on pace for occupancy that will begin in late 2016. Concrete is being poured and the T-stop is operating as expected. The impact of this first 6 or 8 months strong opening at Assembly is a faster ramp to a 6% on levered deal and then beyond than we had anticipated just a year ago. It's very gratifying. 
We're just about done with design and planning for the next phase of Assembly, which will include a continuation of the retail street, residential bump, a partnership with a boutique hotel operator and a street connection with the partner site. Costs need to be finalized, a GMP contract negotiated and other deal terms agreed to, we hope to be able to announce the required approvals to move ahead on our next call. Last word on Assembly is to recognize the passing of our General Manager, Russ Joyner last month. Truly one of the great guys in our business. The successful launch of this community was in no small part due to Russ' commitment. We'll miss him. 
At Pike & Rose, lots and lots of on-site construction these days, as we broken ground on the next $250 million that we announced on this call last fall. While at the same time, we complete construction on that last building in Phase 1 over the next few months. That means that 2 years from now, we'll have over $510 million deployed before selling 100 condos that is, on this site in 9 buildings, 360,000 feet of retail space, 750 residential apartments, 100 condos, 80,000 feet of Merrill Lynch anchored office,  a 175-room Canopy hotel and nearly 2,000 parking spaces. 
On stabilization, that investment should yield between a 7% and 8% unlevered return and we'll still have much, much more to do on the site. Let me bring you up to speed on where we are right now. As I mentioned earlier, construction is a few months from completion on a high-rise residential tower we call Pallas, and we expect to begin leasing as planned next quarter. The timing is great because our first residential building called PerSei is now 95% leased. 
A big disappointment to us in the short term on the average rents we filled the building up with the first time around. They're about 9% less than we had underwritten in part due to heavy construction during the entire lease-up period on the site and also due to losses in supply coming on the market at one-time. As a result, we decided to lower our underwritten rent expectations on the high-rise a bit and when combined with some additional scope on the sitewide infrastructure that we now plan, we thought it prudent to reduce unlevered yield expectations on the first phase to the 7% to 8% range. 
The nice thing about residential leases is that they are generally 12 months long and so we get lots of opportunities to reprice as Pike & Rose matures and construction becomes more isolated. If Santana Row is any guide, we'll more than make up for that over time. Every bit of feedback that we get on this project improves our confidence about the region's need for a destination like Pike & Rose, and that's particularly evident in the retail environment we're creating. The Phase 1 retail is fully leased and has led by the extremely successful opening of iPic, the luxury theater experience that is soundly beating it and our expectations, no other iPic location has seen this level of success in its first 100 days of operation. 
Out west, construction and leasing on our addition to the Plaza Segundo shopping node with 115,000 square-foot lifestyle center called the Point continues on-budget and on-schedule with tenants beginning to open this summer. Check it out when you're in L.A., it's only 3 miles south of LAX, on Sepulveda at Rosecrans. 
And at Santana, construction is underway on our $115 million, 225,000 square-foot office building, with nearly 700 parking spaces on Winchester Boulevard at Alton avenue. It's being marketed as 500 Santana Row and will follow on the 125,000 square feet of office space that already exists elsewhere in Santana Row. That office space is fully leased and had some very strong rents. 
The continued explosion of the Silicon Valley economy, the strong job growth and the growing reputation of Santana Row as a very desirable office address, it has us very bullish about doing deals in this state-of-the-art building over its 18-month construction period. All of which leads me to the last topic for my prepared remarks and that's our team and organizational setup. 
We are clearly playing more aggressive offense these days and growing our overall real estate holdings pretty meaningful -- meaningfully, giving us very substantial development platform. Accordingly, we're consolidating our development efforts under newly promoted Executive Vice President, Don Briggs. Many of you know Don as the guy primarily responsible for the design and execution of Assembly. We're doing this to assure that we prioritize and allocate our formidable development talent across all opportunities at the company, based on the best risk-adjusted termination of likely value creation. 
Don has been with us for over 15 years and represents one of the country's most experienced and most respected mixed-use developers. He'll report directly to me, as well a new position that we've just announced aimed at maximizing our residential profitability. You may have seen our press release last month about Mike Ennes, who comes to us from Hilton worldwide and will join the team next month as Vice President of Residential Operations and Branding. We've learned a lot and made a lot of money from the residential product that we've been offering at Santana Row over the last decade. 
Bethesda Row, Congressional, Pike & Rose and soon Assembly need to benefit similarly. We've simply come to believe that higher-end residential product in the successful mix-use environment requires a quarterback, one that can oversee our third-party residential managers, while at the same time, understanding, capitalizing on and integrating the different uses to provide a better residential service and profit model. That's developing. 
We're taking a different approach to operations. While we're consolidating and centralizing our development group and residential oversight, we're decentralizing our East Coast operating group and breaking it up a little differently. The West Coast already operates on decentralized basis under Executive Vice President, Jeff Berkes, and now, we'll be dividing up our East Coast portfolio between our mixed-use division and our foundational core shopping center division. 
Our mixed-use division will be run by newly promoted Senior Vice President, John Hendrickson, who has been running our Northeast region for the last 7 years, out of our suburban Philadelphia office. John will relocate to federal headquarters in Maryland in the next several months. In terms of the leadership of the core shopping center division, we feel like this is a great opportunity to add a senior level shopping center operator to our executive team. There's a lot going on at the company these days, more than ever before and the creation of a new position to lead and grow the core shopping center division, gives us the chance to expand our senior team. 
Accordingly, we've instituted a search that Dawn Becker, and I will be leading for a new senior VP at the core shopping center division. That division will include over 60 properties, spanning from Boston to Florida and oversee nearly $300 million of property level income. We would expect to identify the executives in the next several months. These changes and the organizations below them recognize a changing real estate landscape and better align our company and take advantage of it in the most productive way. Frankly, I couldn't be more excited. 
That's all I've got for our prepared remarks. Let me now turn it over to Jim, and look forward to taking your questions after that."

As Don highlighted, our bottom line results for both the quarter and the year represented yet another record for the Trust. As usual, the large driver was growth in the quarter, which grew over 4%, including redevelopment while occupancy remained flat. Our results also reflected the successful integration of the growth in Brook 35 acquisitions made earlier in the year, both of which outperformed our initial underwritings, a true testament to our partner Chris Cole and the team he has brought on board. 
This year, as Don also highlighted, we overcame several cents of drags from the openings of Assembly and Pike & Rose, initial phases of which have now successfully delivered as Don has discussed in depth. 
Our balanced business plan continues to deliver bottom line results while we invest in future growth. Value that we are delivering today that we'll continue to deliver in the future. In addition to the larger multi-face, multi-year projects at Pike & Rose and Assembly, we should also highlight that we delivered over 90 million of redevelopments during the year at assets like Ellisburg, Santana Row, Barracks Road and Hollywood at very attractive returns. 
In addition to these projects, we continue to expand and execute upon redevelopment pipeline of over 290 million of redevelopments like the Point at Plaza El Segundo, Westgate and even a new 48-unit apartment building that's being built as we speak right behind this conference room. In addition to successfully integrating the growth in Brook 35 acquisitions, we also closed last month on the acquisition of San Antonio Center in Mountain View, California, which we announced on last quarter's call. 
We couldn't be more excited about the potential for additional value creation at this phenomenal location, which comprises 33 acres in one of the dense and affluent areas of Silicon Valley. This transaction, which was sourced off market and structured on a tax-deferred basis, truly simplifies the type of acquisitions we remain focused on executing. While asset pricing remains very high against the backdrop of record low interest rates, we continue to actively pursue a few opportunities like San Antonio Center, where importantly, we believe that there is value to be added over time. We hope that further updates on our next call, but you can expect us to remain disciplined and focused on nursing the right opportunities to fit our business plan.
Turning to the balance sheet, we successfully raised $250 million of 4.5% 30-year notes in November, and used about $200 million of those proceeds to pay off our 5.65% senior notes and our $61 million mortgage on East Bay Bridge. In so doing, we brought down the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt and importantly, increased our weighted average maturity by a little over 3 years. 
We ended the year with $47 million of cash and nothing drawn under our $600 million revolver. This provides us with more than adequate capacity to fund our remaining development activity without having to access the capital markets. Of course, with rates recently testing all-time lows, we remain well positioned to opportunistically access these markets to further term out our near-term maturities and fund our development pipeline. Stay tuned.
Turning to guidance, we have maintained our range given last quarter of $5.26 to $5.34. For those of you, who have accused us of being sandbaggers and automatically moved to the top of the range, allow me to offer some insights on why we gave a larger than usual range and the factors that will influence where we end up in that range. 
First, the potential sale of Houston Street assets in Texas, which were in close to having under contract. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, the sale is not included in our guidance, but will be approximately $0.02 to $0.03 diluted depending on the timing of the closing and how quickly we can redeploy the proceeds from this sale of this slower growing asset. We will update you as that situation progresses. 
Second, given the timing of the San Antonio Center closing occurring this past January versus December, we incurred an additional $0.015 of transaction costs this year. While we typically have cushion for such costs in any given year, we do hope to incur additional transaction costs in other opportunities that we are pursuing. Some of which may be incurred prior to closing any time. 
Third, we've made a strategic decision to continue to invest in our R&D as Don put it, investing in our people and our platform, so that we can responsibly scale under this massive pipeline of value creation that we have underway. As you would expect from us, we will not sacrifice the long-term for a few pennies in the short-term. I believe that we have most of this investment covered in our numbers, the transitional costs and other one-time expenses could also impact our numbers by up to a $0.01 or $0.02. 
Finally on the investment side, we will always aggressively pursue near-term rollover and the related temporary decline in occupancy to create long-term value. It is always been a core tenet of our business plan and always will be. It's not a new initiative for us. However, with recent announcements like the potential Staples--Office Depot merger and the recent Chapter 11 filing of RadioShack, in addition 2 opportunities that Assemblies Power Center that had become more real in light of Assemblies amazing opening performance, we may get the chance to generate some long-term retenanting opportunities. Too early to tell what the extent of the impact will be in 2015, but again, we'll keep you posted.
Turning again to the larger timing assumptions factored into our guidance, we expect to deliver approximately $375 million of development and redevelopment this year. Some of the more significant deliveries include, approximately $80 million of office space at Pike & Rose and Assembly, which is being delivered in the first  -- in the second quarter of this year. We conservatively underwritten 2016 rent starts and hope to keep those with the final lease up. 
Approximately 77% of the retail at Pike & Rose is delivered and is occupied, which includes the iPic theater Del Frisco's Summer House, City Sports and Sport & Health among others. The balance of the retail space, which is 95% leased will continue to open as planned through the middle of this year. 
Pallas, the 319-unit luxury high-rise at Pike & Rose, which represents approximately $110 million of investments is slated to open this summer and is expected to lease up over the following 18 months. Finally, we expect the Point redevelopment at Plaza Segundo, which represents approximately $80 million of investments, to also open mid-summer and stabilize in early 2016. 
Given this timing, we expect our quarterly FFO to start lower in the first quarter and ramp significantly during the course of the year versus being flat. From a capital standpoint again, we expect to fund approximately $300 million of development and redevelopment expenditures through long-term debt, our ATM and our line of credit. As mentioned earlier, we will remain opportunistic as it relates to rates and will always look for ways in this environment to term out our maturities and reduce our weighted average debt cost.
In closing, we had a lot of great opportunities delivering now for the long-term, and could be more excited about how we continue to execute upon that business plan that we've laid out for you in 2013. We look forward to seeing many of you at the Wells Fargo and Citi conferences in the coming weeks. 
And with that, operator, we'd like to turn it over for questions."

What we've been doing for the last 5 years really since the recession hit is really doing some very, very good blocking and tackling, and we divided the portfolio up between Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. The problem with that, as you get into a more aggressive -- offensive posture is that what we're delivering on the mixed-use stuff, it takes a lot of time. It's hard and the skill set on the leasing side is a different skill set than it is on the core shopping center side. So being able to align that leasing with specific management for those properties, we see as a real positive on both mixed-use and what it should do to the core, because it allows a lot more -- it doesn't allow distractions between properties that do take more time, that do -- have different skill sets associated with them, and the core, which is the horse and the thing that allows it to keep going. So this is an alignment of leasing with the management of each of those divisions that I doubt it will have a significant impact in 2015, but we're resetting this up for the long term and where we're going over the next 10 years. So better alignment is what it's all about. It will not change the leasing process. It will focus the leasing personnel more with their operating counterpoint -- part."

For me, that -- we're trying to anticipate that into the Pallas building also in about the same amount, the same thoughts, but I don't want to say this, I don't want to sound cavalier, but big deal because this -- that nice thing about this 12-month lease process as you go forward and we've seen it at Santana, in fact, just before the meeting, I wanted to -- I asked Dawn, can we pull together? Do you think, what our growth rate has been over 10 years at Santana and our various different products, and we don't have it here, but we will in time for City. I think you'll see what I'm saying by being able to create this kind of a mixed-use environment, which other people do not have to this level. We can see and the people who're coming in, the ability to push rents going forward is clearly better than in other type of more generic products through and through. So always trying to be upfront with what your expectations are. I really didn't feel comfortable. We didn't feel comfortable keeping it at 8% to 9%, given what has happened with the first building being 9% off, and so to appropriately lay out where we think we'll be upon that first complete phase, including Pallas, leased up, we brought it to 7% and 8%.

We certainly could go out and drive a bunch of near-term accretion, but diminish our long-term growth and we're just not going to do that. But in terms of how the core is performing and what we laid out, I think we're right on track. I think as I've said before, our rollover growth right now at this point in recovery is very strong. The other thing I'd point out is that we've been producing this really on an occupancy-neutral basis, which is important to highlight because I think that on a comparative basis, it can look less robust, but when you're able to generate this type of growth on a portfolio that was 95.6% leased at the beginning of the year and 95.6% leased at the end of the year, I think it speaks volumes to the job that our leasing team is doing led by Chris and the assets themselves."

There is -- new supply is not a surprise. It takes time to build and it was clear as to what was going to be there, but it's never clear in a particular environment or at a particular leasing meeting or strategy or when you have a person on the other side of you, what it is that those competitors are doing with their rents, what is that they're doing with our concessions and you do business in a marketplace. So it's not about lessons learned in this case at all, frankly, in terms of the product that was coming on, I think we're right on, but to the extent we are going to have competitors drop prices significantly or significantly increase our concessions, we're going to follow suit because we want the bodies in the building. I do think where we did underestimate was the impact of the construction on the site and it's not like it's a single building, it is a building within the middle of lots of stuff happening on it and I don't remember the last time that you were at the site specifically. But you know when we do these phased projects, we are going to lay, if we're confident with what we're seeing in terms of demand in the first phase and we are, despite the fact that it's 9% lower on the actual rent by the way, the rent is still a big number. It's not like we're -- it's not like this is a 9% off, this are not $1,500 a month apartment. This is expensive stuff, so it's still a big number. We are going to try to start the next phase as long as we're comfortable on top of the first phase to be able to create the critical math. So if you're going to ask -- if really, let's say, what it is that we've learned, it would be that first set of lease up, we've got to fill the building and the construction impact of that first phase in a mixed-use project where you got lots of other construction directly adjacent to where you're asking somebody to live, it's going to be more than we thought."

But for the last 17 years, whenever there was a new concept that was being talked about or whether -- whenever there was somebody that was going bankrupt and going out, the question was -- oh my god, what's that going to do? The one thing I love about this business, I mean I'm sitting here in front of me with 7 of our 20 RadioShack stores that will be given back, I'm sitting here looking at 13 Staples and Office Depot stores that who knows what their future are. This is the opportunity and whether  it's Amazon, you would certainly think that new retailers, whoever they might be, who want to be in brick-and-mortar will look hard at the locations that we have. It's just hard to imagine if they wouldn't, and so I view that as an extreme positive in terms of brick-and-mortar retailing. I look at RadioShack going away as a positive in terms of brick-and-mortar retailing and so from my perspective at least, this is what we do and the ability to be able to negotiate and create value has to happen with opportunities like this where I need supply and demand, that's why the locations are so important."

It's an excellent question and frankly, I love to use the word balance in there because it is a balance, the entire thing all the way through. It is the notion that there is not demand for the residential product, it's just wrong. The residential product -- I mean, this -- that first building is done, it is leased up, and it is leased up in exactly the time frame that we expected it to. So when you're sitting and talking about rents that are at $2.40 a foot versus $2.58 a foot or something like that, that on the balance equation is certainly not going to lead you to, well not building. In fact, in answer to Alex's question earlier, if we had thought harder about the construction impact and had laid out 7% to 8% at the on-site set here, I think you would've said wow, that's fantastic that you're getting those kind of numbers. That's how I feel. And so you're right that there is that balanced question on these projects. Assembly, frankly, has made it extremely easy for us because on the retail side in particular, it's just -- it really has been accepted by the community much more than we have even hoped it to say, and as far as I understand, I'm not talking for AvalonBay, because I don't know their numbers inside, but I have a feeling you'd hear the same from them, so going to the next phase of Assembly, again assuming we can get the numbers where we need them to be and I hope we will. We expect that we will, that one's easy. On Pike & Rose, when you talk about it the way I just pointed it out, there's no doubt we should be moving forward, in my mind at least with this second phase to create the critical mass. But also because there is sufficient demand for the residential product, there's definitely demand for those sell products. We think the condo product is going to fly off, we'll see. Who knows, it will be -- what it will be, but we are very conscious of the balance that you talk about, and in both of those situations, I don't think it's close with respect to not moving forward."

But the funny comment is whenever you talk pricing pressure, and I look across the table and I see the head of leasing, Chris Weilminster, he puts his head down and start smiling, because I appreciate you doing that, for putting pressure on him, with respect to that. And I'm going to answer for him on that. It depends. That is a one-off negotiation by negotiating dynamic. We do the best we can, so I think that by being a more leased rather than less leased, that is over all a good thing for us, yes, I do. There's no question about it, I mean in terms of that. Can I quantify it? For you, no. No, I don't. Most of the space that's left and not leased is not obviously the best space in the portfolio, so where I would rather go is actually not emphasized the lease rollovers as much and push hard on that other 6% or 7% that is not leased up there to be able to get it done at any rates. And often we hold -- not hold off, but effectively work hard to get full rent and some of that stuff you can't. So you may actually see lease rollovers come down a little a bit as occupancy goes a little bit further, again that's the balance, that's the overall mix between rate and volume.

Looking forward to seeing all or most of you in a few weeks in the Citi conference in Florida, so it's more about our company and our industry. I want to thank you for joining us on the call this morning. 
While 2014 is in the books, it was the best year we've ever had -- and by a wide margin. I want to start by putting some context around the $4.94 per share or 7.2% year-over-year FFO growth that we just reported. It follows 7% year-over-year growth a year ago in 2013, and 7.7%, 2 years ago in 2012, and keeps us right on track to double our income in 10 years. That you'll remember was the plan we laid out at our Investor Day at Assembly Row in 2013. 
The consistency of this performance continues for me to be one of the things I'm most proud of. It seems to me that over the years, more and more investors every day have come to value that consistency and sustainability in the business that seems to be changing more and more every day. 
It's particularly noteworthy in 2014 because of the way in which it was accomplished. Research and development investments for the future usually detracts from current earnings, think drug R&D and the pharmaceutical business or technology R&D and Amazon, but the objective is to ensure competitive advantage long into the future. In our business, that R&D is the development, the marketing and the investment in top human capital that is focused on creating new state-of-the-art retail product that we believe will keep us on the forefront of our industry for decades not just quarters. 
Whether that takes the form of the first of its kind large-scale outlet, entertainment, restaurant, mixed use community like Assembly Row, or whether it takes the form of the transformation of a pedestrian strip center, like Mid-Pike Plaza into a multifaced mixed-use place to be, like Pike & Rose, like whether it takes the form of a niche 48-unit active living residential building that we researched that are now building in the back of Congressional Plaza. 
We couldn't be more proud of our R&D, if you will, even though the initial design, construction, lease up and marketing did dilute earnings in 2014 and will again in 2015. In fact, our FFO per share growth would've been double digits without them. Of course, our future wouldn't be nearly as bright and our 10-year plan would be far less assured too. I hope we always have as active in R&D pipeline as we do today. I know we will for the next few years. I think it sets us apart in the retail real estate business that is looking more and more generic and struggling for ways to grow. 
Let me now go through some of the major accomplishments of the fourth quarter and the year. First on the operating side. In addition to 7.2% FFO per share growth for the year, we grew at an 8.5% for the fourth quarter, when excluding the early extinguishment of debt in both quarters. Same-store growth was strong in the quarter and the year, 4.5% percent in the quarter, 4.1% for the year including redevelopment, which by the way is what this business plan is all about. 
A portfolio that was 95.6% leased and 94.7% occupied at the end of 2014, right where it was at the end of the third quarter. Leasing was exceptionally strong, 83 deals were signed covering 340,000 square feet, 70 of those deals were for comparable space, that is existing space where there was previous tenant and those deals were signed at $33.27 a foot, 20% better than the $27.76 the previous tenant was paying in their final year of the lease. The 13 noncomparable deals related primarily to the lease up of the Point at Plaza El Segundo in California. 
One of the drivers of the quarter are leasing results, included the repositioning of Crow Canyon shopping center in San Ramon, California, where an underperforming Lucky food store was replaced with a new Sprout specialty grocer and in order to supply of hardware store. Those deals followed on a new Sports Authority deal replacing a bankrupt Loehmann's earlier in the year, and the buyout of an onerous ground lease to give us full control of the shopping center. 
You can certainly figure that these shopping centers were $35 million more net of the capital that was invested than it was before these actions. The other driver of those leasing results was the renewal of a couple of bank pads at significantly more rent than they had been paying. With all the talk and worry about changes to consumer banking practices and the real estate needs, myself included among the worriers, this part of our business has remained remarkably strong. It's a testament to the continuing importance to banks of attracting customer deposits in important real estate locations. 
Okay. Two more things I'd like to talk about before turning it over to Jim. Development updates on Assembly, Pike & Rose, the Point in Santana Row and some organizational shifts and new hires that give us the best chance of maximizing our potential. Jim will cover acquisitions and dispositions. 
So on the development, let's start with Assembly. The greater Boston community has clearly embraced the first phase of Assembly Row even if it is buried in snow at the moment. The retailer is 97% leased with 53 tenants open and operating, most doing better than either they or we have planned, and that includes the anchor system, comprised of LEGOLAND Discovery Center, the AMC theater, Saks OFF 5th, and the restaurants, who are all outperforming. 
In the office buildings, software developer, SmartBear, moved into their space a couple of weeks ago. We have a signed LOI with a digital media software company and lots of action on the remaining 4.5. We've seen dramatic improvements in the sales of the adjacent power center that we call Assembly Square marketplace and we fully expect to improve its merchandising and profitability in the next 12 to 18 months, a direct result of success of the Row. 
We're also happy to report that the Partners Healthcare construction is on pace for occupancy that will begin in late 2016. Concrete is being poured and the T-stop is operating as expected. The impact of this first 6 or 8 months strong opening at Assembly is a faster ramp to a 6%  unlevered deal and then beyond than we had anticipated just a year ago. It's very gratifying. 
We're just about done with design and planning for the next phase of Assembly, which will include a continuation of the retail street, residential above, a partnership with a boutique hotel operator and a street connection with the partner site. Costs need to be finalized, a GMP contract negotiated and other deal terms agreed to, we hope to be able to announce the required approvals to move ahead on our next call. Last word on Assembly is to recognize the passing of our General Manager, Russ Joyner last month. Truly one of the great guys in our business. The successful launch of this community was in no small part due to Russ' commitment. We'll miss him. 
At Pike & Rose, lots and lots of on-site construction these days, as we broken ground on the next $250 million that we announced on this call last fall. While at the same time, we complete construction on that last building in Phase 1 over the next few months. That means that 2 years from now, we'll have over $510 million deployed before selling 100 condos that is, on this site in 9 buildings, 360,000 feet of retail space, 750 residential apartments, 100 condos, 80,000 feet of Merrill Lynch anchored office,  a 175-room Canopy hotel and nearly 2,000 parking spaces. 
On stabilization, that investment should yield between a 7% and 8% unlevered return and we'll still have much, much more to do on the site. Let me bring you up to speed on where we are right now. As I mentioned earlier, construction is a few months from completion on a high-rise residential tower we call Pallas, and we expect to begin leasing as planned next quarter. The timing is great because our first residential building called PerSei is now 95% leased. 
A big disappointment to us in the short term on the average rents we filled the building up with the first time around. They're about 9% less than we had underwritten in part due to heavy construction during the entire lease-up period on the site and also due to lots of supply coming on the market at one-time. As a result, we decided to lower our underwritten rent expectations on the high-rise a bit and when combined with some additional scope on the site-wide infrastructure that we now plan, we thought it prudent to reduce unlevered yield expectations on the first phase to the 7% to 8% range. 
The nice thing about residential leases is that they are generally 12 months long and so we get lots of opportunities to reprice as Pike & Rose matures and construction becomes more isolated. If Santana Row is any guide, we'll more than make up for that over time. Every bit of feedback that we get on this project improves our confidence about the region's need for a destination like Pike & Rose, and that's particularly evident in the retail environment we're creating. The Phase 1 retail is fully leased and has led by the extremely successful opening of iPic, the luxury theater experience that is soundly beating it and our expectations, no other iPic location has seen this level of success in its first 100 days of operation. 
Out west, construction and leasing on our addition to the Plaza Segundo shopping node with 115,000 square-foot lifestyle center called the Point continues on-budget and on-schedule with tenants beginning to open this summer. Check it out when you're in L.A., it's only 3 miles south of LAX, on Sepulveda at Rosecrans. 
And at Santana, construction is underway on our $115 million, 225,000 square-foot office building, with nearly 700 parking spaces on Winchester Boulevard at Alton avenue. It's being marketed as 500 Santana Row and will follow on the 125,000 square feet of office space that already exists elsewhere in Santana Row. That office space is fully leased and had some very strong rents. 
The continued explosion of the Silicon Valley economy, the strong job growth and the growing reputation of Santana Row as a very desirable office address, has us very bullish about doing deals in this state-of-the-art building over its 18-month construction period. All of which leads me to the last topic for my prepared remarks and that's our team and organizational setup. 
We are clearly playing more aggressive offense these days and growing our overall real estate holdings pretty meaningful -- meaningfully, giving us very substantial development platform. Accordingly, we're consolidating our development efforts under newly promoted Executive Vice President, Don Briggs. Many of you know Don as the guy primarily responsible for the design and execution of Assembly. We're doing this to assure that we prioritize and allocate our formidable development talent across all opportunities at the company, based on the best risk-adjusted termination of likely value creation. 
Don has been with us for over 15 years and represents one of the country's most experienced and most respected mixed-use developers. He'll report directly to me, as well a new position that we've just announced aimed at maximizing our residential profitability. You may have seen our press release last month about Mike Ennes, who comes to us from Hilton worldwide and will join the team next month as Vice President of Residential Operations and Branding. We've learned a lot and made a lot of money from the residential product that we've been offering at Santana Row over the last decade. 
Bethesda Row, Congressional, Pike & Rose and soon Assembly need to benefit similarly. We've simply come to believe that higher-end residential product in the successful mix-use environment requires a quarterback, one that can oversee our third-party residential managers, while at the same time, understanding, capitalizing on and integrating the different uses to provide a better residential service and profit model. That's developing. 
We're taking a different approach to operations. While we're consolidating and centralizing our development group and residential oversight, we're decentralizing our East Coast operating group and breaking it up a little differently. The West Coast already operates on decentralized basis under Executive Vice President, Jeff Berkes, and now, we'll be dividing up our East Coast portfolio between our mixed-use division and our foundational core shopping center division. 
Our mixed-use division will be run by newly promoted Senior Vice President, John Hendrickson, who has been running our Northeast region for the last 7 years, out of our suburban Philadelphia office. John will relocate to federal headquarters in Maryland in the next several months. In terms of the leadership of the core shopping center division, we feel like this is a great opportunity to add a senior level shopping center operator to our executive team. There's a lot going on at the company these days, more than ever before and the creation of a new position to lead and grow the core shopping center division, gives us the chance to expand our senior team. 
Accordingly, we've instituted a search that Dawn Becker, and I will be leading for a new senior VP at the core shopping center division. That division will include over 60 properties, spanning from Boston to Florida and oversee nearly $300 million of property level income. We would expect to identify the executives in the next several months. These changes and the organizations below them recognize a changing real estate landscape and better align our company and take advantage of it in the most productive way. Frankly, I couldn't be more excited. 
That's all I've got for our prepared remarks. Let me now turn it over to Jim, and look forward to taking your questions after that."

As Don highlighted, our bottom line results for both the quarter and the year represented yet another record for the Trust. As usual, the large driver was growth in the core, which grew over 4%, including redevelopment while occupancy remained flat. Our results also reflected the successful integration of the growth in Brook 35 acquisitions made earlier in the year, both of which outperformed our initial underwritings, a true testament to our partner Chris Cole and the team he has brought on board. 
This year, as Don also highlighted, we overcame several cents of drags from the openings of Assembly and Pike & Rose, initial phases of which have now successfully delivered as Don has discussed in depth. 
Our balanced business plan continues to deliver bottom line results while we invest in future growth. Value that we are delivering today that we'll continue to deliver in the future. In addition to the larger multi-face, multi-year projects at Pike & Rose and Assembly, we should also highlight that we delivered over 90 million of redevelopments during the year at assets like Ellisburg, Santana Row, Barracks Road and Hollywood at very attractive returns. 
In addition to these projects, we continue to expand and execute upon redevelopment pipeline of over 290 million of redevelopments like the Point at Plaza El Segundo, Westgate and even a new 48-unit apartment building that's being built as we speak right behind this conference room. In addition to successfully integrating the growth in Brook 35 acquisitions, we also closed last month on the acquisition of San Antonio Center in Mountain View, California, which we announced on last quarter's call. 
We couldn't be more excited about the potential for additional value creation at this phenomenal location, which comprises 33 acres in one of the most dense and affluent areas of Silicon Valley. This transaction, which was sourced off market and structured on a tax-deferred basis, truly simplifies the type of acquisitions we remain focused on executing. While asset pricing remains very high against the backdrop of record low interest rates, we continue to actively pursue a few opportunities like San Antonio Center, where importantly, we believe that there is value to be added over time. We hope to have further updates on our next call, but you can expect us to remain disciplined and focused on unearthing the right opportunities to fit our business plan.
Turning to the balance sheet, we successfully raised $250 million of 4.5% 30-year notes in November, and used about $200 million of those proceeds to pay off our 5.65% senior notes and our $61 million mortgage on East Bay Bridge. In so doing, we brought down the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt and importantly, increased our weighted average maturity by a little over 3 years. 
We ended the year with $47 million of cash and nothing drawn under our $600 million revolver. This provides us with more than adequate capacity to fund our remaining development activity without having to access the capital markets. Of course, with rates recently testing all-time lows, we remain well positioned to opportunistically access these markets to further term out our near-term maturities and fund our development pipeline. Stay tuned.
Turning to guidance, we have maintained our range given last quarter of $5.26 to $5.34. For those of you, who have accused us of being sandbaggers and automatically moved to the top of the range, allow me to offer some insights on why we gave a larger than usual range and the factors that will influence where we end up in that range. 
First, the potential sale of Houston Street assets in Texas, which we are close to having under contract. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, the sale is not included in our guidance, but will be approximately $0.02 to $0.03 diluted depending on the timing of the closing and how quickly we can redeploy the proceeds from this sale of this slower growing asset. We will update you as that situation progresses. 
Second, given the timing of the San Antonio Center closing occurring this past January versus December, we incurred an additional $0.015 of transaction costs this year. While we typically have cushion for such costs in any given year, we do hope to incur additional transaction costs in other opportunities that we are pursuing. Some of which may be incurred prior to closing anything. 
Third, we've made a strategic decision to continue to invest in our R&D as Don put it, investing in our people and our platform, so that we can responsibly scale into this massive pipeline of value creation that we have underway. As you would expect from us, we will not sacrifice the long-term for a few pennies in the short-term. I believe that we have most of this investment covered in our numbers, the transitional costs and other one-time expenses could also impact our numbers by up to a $0.01 or $0.02. 
Finally on the investment side, we will always aggressively pursue near-term rollover and the related temporary decline in occupancy to create long-term value. It is always been a core tenet of our business plan and always will be. It's not a new initiative for us. However, with recent announcements like the potential Staples-Office Depot merger and the recent Chapter 11 filing of RadioShack, in addition to opportunities that Assemblies Power Center that had become more real in light of Assemblies amazing opening performance, we may get the chance to generate some long-term retenanting opportunities. Too early to tell what the extent of the impact will be in 2015, but again, we'll keep you posted.
Turning again to the larger timing assumptions factored into our guidance, we expect to deliver approximately $375 million of development and redevelopment this year. Some of the more significant deliveries include, approximately $80 million of office space at Pike & Rose and Assembly, which is being delivered in the first  -- in the second quarter of this year. We conservatively underwritten 2016 rent starts and hope to beat those with the final lease up. 
Approximately 77% of the retail at Pike & Rose is delivered and is occupied, which includes the iPic theater, Del Frisco's, Summer House, City Sports and Sport & Health among others. The balance of the retail space, which is 95% leased will continue to open as planned through the middle of this year. 
Pallas, the 319-unit luxury high-rise at Pike & Rose, which represents approximately $110 million of investments is slated to open this summer and is expected to lease up over the following 18 months. Finally, we expect the Point redevelopment at Plaza El Segundo, which represents approximately $80 million of investments, to also open mid-summer and stabilize in early 2016. 
Given this timing, we expect our quarterly FFO to start lower in the first quarter and ramp significantly during the course of the year versus being flat. From a capital standpoint again, we expect to fund approximately $300 million of development and redevelopment expenditures through long-term debt, our ATM and our line of credit. As mentioned earlier, we will remain opportunistic as it relates to rates and will always look for ways in this environment to term out our maturities and reduce our weighted average debt cost.
In closing, we had a lot of great opportunities delivering now for the long-term, and couldn't be more excited about how we continue to execute upon that business plan that we've laid out for you in 2013. We look forward to seeing many of you at the Wells Fargo and Citi conferences in the coming weeks. 
And with that, operator, we'd like to turn it over for questions."

What we've been doing for the last 5 years really since the recession hit is really doing some very, very good blocking and tackling, and we divided the portfolio up between Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. The problem with that, as you get into a more aggressive -- offensive posture is that what we're delivering on the mixed-use stuff, it takes a lot of time. It's hard and the skill set on the leasing side is a different skill set than it is on the core shopping center side. So being able to align that leasing with specific management for those properties, we see as a real positive on both mixed-use and what it should do to the core, because it allows a lot more -- it doesn't allow distractions between properties that do take more time, that do -- have different skill sets associated with them, and the core, which is the horse and the thing that allows it to keep going. So this is an alignment of leasing with the management of each of those divisions that I doubt it will have a significant impact in 2015, but we're resetting this up for the long term and where we're going over the next 10 years. So better alignment is what it's all about. It will not change the leasing process. It will focus the leasing personnel more with their operating counterpoint -- part."

For me, that -- we're trying to anticipate that into the Pallas building also in about the same amount, the same thoughts, but I don't want to say this, I don't want to sound cavalier, but big deal because this -- that nice thing about this 12-month lease process as you go forward and we've seen it at Santana, in fact, just before the meeting, I wanted to -- I asked Dawn, can we pull together, do you think, what our growth rate has been over 10 years at Santana and our various different products, and we don't have it here, but we will in time for City. I think you'll see what I'm saying by being able to create this kind of a mixed-use environment, which other people do not have to this level. We can see it in the people who're coming in, the ability to push rents going forward is clearly better than in other type of more generic products through and through. So always trying to be upfront with what your expectations are. I really didn't feel comfortable. We didn't feel comfortable keeping it at 8% to 9%, given what has happened with the first building being 9% off, and so to appropriately lay out where we think we'll be upon that first complete phase, including Pallas, leased up, we brought it to 7% and 8%.

I think that aggregate NOI growth also included acquisitions, which what I would tell you is we remained disciplined and what you can take from acquisitions like San Antonio Center is that we're still able to find in this low-cap rate environment opportunities that we think will be accretive to our growth in the long-term and that's the discipline that we've retained. We certainly could go out and drive a bunch of near-term accretion, but diminish our long-term growth and we're just not going to do that. But in terms of how the core is performing and what we laid out, I think we're right on track. I think as I've said before, our rollover growth right now at this point in recovery is very strong. The other thing I'd point out is that we've been producing this really on an occupancy-neutral basis, which is important to highlight because I think that on a comparative basis, it can look less robust, but when you're able to generate this type of growth on a portfolio that was 95.6% leased at the beginning of the year and 95.6% leased at the end of the year, I think it speaks volumes to the job that our leasing team is doing led by Chris and the assets themselves."

There is -- new supply is not a surprise. It takes time to build and if it was clear as to what was going to be there, but it's never clear in a particular environment or at a particular leasing meeting or strategy or when you have a person on the other side of you, what it is that those competitors are doing with their rents, what is that they're doing with their concessions and you do business in a marketplace. So it's not about lessons learned in this case at all, frankly, in terms of the product that was coming on, I think we're right on, but to the extent we are going to have competitors drop prices significantly or significantly increase our concessions, we're going to follow suit because we want the bodies in the building. I do think where we did underestimate it was the impact of the construction on the site and it's not like it's a single building, it is a building within the middle of lots of stuff happening on it and I don't remember the last time that you were at the site specifically. But you know when we do these phased projects, we are going to lay, if we're confident with what we're seeing in terms of demand in the first phase and we are, despite the fact that it's 9% lower on the actual rent by the way, the rent is still a big number. It's not like we're -- it's not like this is a 9% off, this are not $1,500 a month apartment. This is expensive stuff, so it's still a big number. We are going to try to start the next phase as long as we're comfortable on top of the first phase to be able to create the critical math. So if you're going to ask -- if really, let's say, what it is that we've learned, it would be that first set of lease up, we've got to fill the building and the construction impact of that first phase in a mixed-use project where you got lots of other construction directly adjacent to where you're asking somebody to live, it's going to be more than we thought."

This is the opportunity and whether  it's Amazon, you would certainly think that new retailers, whoever they might be, who want to be in brick-and-mortar will look hard at the locations that we have. It's just hard to imagine if they wouldn't, and so I view that as an extreme positive in terms of brick-and-mortar retailing. I look at RadioShack going away as a positive in terms of brick-and-mortar retailing and so from my perspective at least, this is what we do and the ability to be able to negotiate and create value has to happen with opportunities like this where I need supply and demand, that's why the locations are so important."

It's an excellent question and frankly, I love to use the word balance in there because it is a balance, the entire thing all the way through. It is the notion that there is not demand for the residential product, it's just wrong. The residential product -- I mean, this -- that first building is done, it is leased up, and it is leased up in exactly the time frame that we expected it to. So when you're sitting and talking about rents that are at $2.40 a foot versus $2.58 a foot or something like that, that on the balance equation is certainly not going to lead you to, well not building. In fact, in answer to Alex's question earlier, if we had thought harder about the construction impact and had laid out 7% to 8% at the on-site set here, I think you would've said wow, that's fantastic that you're getting those kind of numbers. That's how I feel. And so you're right that there is that balanced question on these projects. Assembly, frankly, has made it extremely easy for us because on the retail side in particular, it's just -- it really has been accepted by the community much more than we have even hoped it to stay, and as far as I understand, I'm not talking for AvalonBay, because I don't know their numbers inside, but I have a feeling you'd hear the same from them, so going to the next phase of Assembly, again assuming we can get the numbers where we need them to be and I hope we will. We expect that we will, that one's easy. On Pike & Rose, when you talk about it the way I just laid it out, there's no doubt we should be moving forward, in my mind at least with this second phase to create the critical mass. But also because there is sufficient demand for the residential product, there's definitely demand for the hotel products. We think the condo product is going to fly off, we'll see. Who knows, it will be -- what it will be, but we are very conscious of the balance that you talk about, and in both of those situations, I don't think it's close with respect to not moving forward."

But the funny comment is whenever you talk pricing pressure, and I look across the table and I see the head of leasing, Chris Weilminster, he puts his head down and start smiling, because I appreciate you doing that, for putting pressure on him, with respect to that. And I'm going to answer for him on that. It depends. That is a one-off negotiation by negotiating dynamic. We do the best we can, do I think that by being a more leased rather than less leased, that is over all a good thing for us, yes, I do. There's no question about it, in terms of that. Can I quantify it for you, no. No, I don't. Most of the space that's left and not leased is not obviously the best space in the portfolio, so where I would rather go is actually not emphasized the lease rollovers as much and push hard on that other 6% or 7% that is not leased up there to be able to get it done at any rates. And often we hold -- not hold off, but effectively work hard to get full rent and some of that stuff you can't. So you may actually see lease rollovers come down a little a bit as occupancy goes a little bit further, again that's the balance, that's the overall mix between rate and volume. But you should see, I hope you'll see some increases to that -- to the small shop number overall."

Jim will cover acquisitions, dispositions, balance sheet, some operations and earnings point and I'll try to cover the rest before opening up to your questions. 
I don't think I've ever been as grateful for the arrival of spring of this year. Snow removal expenses topped $10 million in the quarter, double what we forecast. And while the strength of our leases allowed us to pass through over 85% of that cost, residential office and some retail leases, along with vacancy don't permit recovery. And accordingly, our first quarter FFO per share with our 26 [ph] was negatively impacted by over $0.02 a share [indiscernible] for Boston in particular. 
Other than the weather, the company continues to perform well and in line with our expectations and early anecdotal evidence suggests that cooped up Northeastern choppers are more anxious than in most years to get out and shop and eat as spring has arrived. We're certainly seeing that Assembly Assembly Row. 
All right, enough about snow. Rental income growth in the first quarter was strong at 9% as the same center growth of 3.6% despite only $500,000 in lease termination fees this quarter versus $1.5 billion last year. Those fees are such an integral part of managing our business and we always include same store numbers as we do with all financial impact of running the shopping centers. Sometimes they benefit the comparison, sometimes they hurt it. We live with it either way. 
In terms of leasing, it was a good quarter. We completed 86 deals, 75 of them for 0.25 million [ph] square feet of comparable space at an average rent of $37.50, 11% more than the $33.70 per foot, representing the last year's formal lease. Both leases with new tenants and renewals with existing tenants were profitable and grew at 16% and 8%, respectively. The capital included in those new deals was consistent and in fact lower than last year's first quarter and very much in line with the past couple of years, which I view very positively. 
California in general and Silicon Valley in particular, continues to lead the markets we do business in in terms of leasing demand, activity supply and the product that we offer, with Boston and New York Metro following closely behind, really, strong. The other markets we do business in, particularly Washington, D.C, are good, but are not exhibiting the same leasing power and strength that we are experiencing out West at this point in time. A few years back, it was just the opposite, reminding us how important geographically diverse portfolio is in a business plan that drives consistency and stability. 
Occupancy remained strong in the quarter with portfolio of 95.4% leased, slightly off the 95.6% lease percentage at the end of the year and last year's first quarter. On a same-center basis, we were 96% leased, up slightly from the end of last year. All in all, these are very healthy times in our business. 
Let me move on now and report some development news. The early success of Assembly Row made really clear to us that commercial and residential demand in the relevant sites wasn't satisfied with the first phase. Earlier this week, our investment committee and then board approved the next phase of Assembly Row. This new space will include an extension of the retail street interconnection with the ground and second floor retail in the Partners HealthCare building. All in all, an additional 167,000 feet of retail for the project. 447 [indiscernible] that Federal will build and manage, 155 room with hotels owned in a partnership with New England based group. The deal is not done but is close. And 117 [indiscernible] condominiums sitting 8 floors above the hotel. Excluding the  we've committed and appropriated up to $285 million to the space and expect to yield an unlevered return of about 7% in the first full year of stabilization. Appropriated capital for the condominiums approximately $65 million. And while we expect to be sold at net proceeds significantly above that cost, we're assuming breakeven in place to disclose returns. 
Assembly Row continues to perform extremely well. But the only material portion of the first phase remaining to be leased is about half of 100,000 square-foot office building. Assembly Row and the adjacent Assembly Square marketplace have really begun to solidify themselves as an important new shopping and entertainment district in the market. It feels great. And when the second phase is completed in late 2017 or early 2018, we'll still have much more to exploit on this site. 
At Pike & Rose in Maryland, you'll see a fully leased and occupied residential building called PerSei, fully leased first phase retail component to the project with opening continuing through the summer, an office component with Maryland Bank of America moving in as we speak and being negotiated on the balance of the space. We'll begin leasing the second residential building called Pallas next month and the Phase 2 parking is well under construction and will alleviate parking pressures by September of this year. 
Around that same time, construction begins on the next 2 buildings that will extend the main shopping street. We should have some pretty interesting retail leasing announcements over the next few quarters, based on the interest that we're seeing. Lots and lots happening in Pike & Rose. 
By 2017, we'll have over $510 million deployed on that site and 9 buildings for selling 104 condominium units, 340,000 feet of retail, 757,000 residential apartments, 104 condos, 8000 feet of Maryland office, a 177-room Canopy branded hotel and 2000 parking spaces. And like Assembly, we still have much more to exploit on the site. 
The Point in California will open up in late summer with additional tenant openings continuing throughout the fall and beyond. This intersection with the addition of the The Point and considering the adjacent shopping center that we control and operate has really become incredibly dominant and important to the beach communities. We expect this to become more so with the new centers opening. 
At Santana, construction of the office building addressed as 500 Santana Row at the south end of the site continues on schedule and on budget. With continued strength of the Silicon Valley economy, the strong job growth and the growing reputation of the Santana Row is very desirable office address very bullish by doing deals in this state-of-the-art building over its remaining construction period. 
In terms of our important search for Senior Vice President of our core shopping center portfolio between Boston and Washington, D.C, we're down to 2 final round candidates and expect to make a decision and announcement within a couple of weeks, maybe sooner. Personally, I've been really impressed with the quality of the candidates we've seen, feel really good that the enhanced focus on the shopping center side of our business will be fruitful over the next few years. 
On the next few slides, you may have read that our very own homegrown choice to lead the operational side of our business, John Hendrickson, was away by as COO told that process before John was promoted in his latest role at Federal. I think [indiscernible] John and wish him much continued success. 
But the Federal [indiscernible] and as such, I'm thrilled to announce that John will assume the role of Executive Vice President, Mixed-use Operations in addition to General Counsel responsibilities. As I said on last quarter's call, our company has grown significantly over the past several years in the bifurcation of core and mixed-use necessary to service each. Skills and background, relationship with our senior team partners and respect throughout this organization make perfectly suited to this role great 
We've got more to talk about in terms of our most recent Florida acquisition, future acquisition prospects and our San Antonio, Texas [indiscernible] along with balance sheet and earnings considerations. For those and other items,  I'll turn it over now to Jim Taylor before opening up the line for your questions. Jim?"

As Don covered in his remarks, this quarter has been an extremely productive one and it continues with the successful execution of our business plan. I will briefly touch upon some financial highlights, the balance sheet acquisition, dispositions transaction and our outlook for the balance of the year. 
Overall, property operating income grew 6.9% year-over-year even with higher snow cost. As usual, thanks to our growth, excluding redevelopment, was the largest single driver of that growth at 3.7%. That same-store growth was driven primarily by rental rate increases, both contractual and rollover versus occupancy. 
Redevelopment contributions from successfully delivered projects, such as Hollywood, Misora, Santana Row and Westgate, were largely offset by downtime as we redeveloped that such as East Bay Bridge in Melville as well as lower lease term fees this year. 
Developments at Assembly and Pike & Rose contributed approximately 250 basis points [indiscernible] for approximately $2.5 million POI. 
Finally, the benefit of the San Antonio acquisition in California drove the balance of the growth. In sum, each of the elements of our long-term growth plan that we articulated over a year ago continued to deliver. 
G&A increased approximately $1.1 million year-over-year, with primarily the transaction cost associated with the closing of San Antonio at the beginning of the quarter, as well as slightly higher personnel cost as we build our platform for growth, as Don just described. Even with that incremental investment on a run-rate basis, we expect our G&A margin to trend below 5% as we drive top line growth and maintain strict discipline on expenses. 
Interest expense grew approximately $1 million due to lower cap interest as we delivered approximately $300 million in development, offset by lower rates as we continue to bring down our weighted average cost of borrowing. 
Bottom line, FFO grew about 7% when you adjust for the impact of higher snow and transaction cost. Again, this growth was achieved while we continue to invest in the long term. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We successfully raised an additional $200 million of 3-year debt at an effective yield of 4.18%, a record in the REIT industry. We use the proceeds to redeem our 2017 6.2% note, bringing our weighted average rate down to 4.4% and importantly, extending our average tender to 10.5 years. Again, consistent with our long-term focus, we opportunistically executed upon historically to calculate our growth plan. 
At quarter end, we had approximately $171 million of cash with nothing drawn under our revolver, providing ample liquidity for growth. 
Speaking of growth, on the acquisition font, we are very pleased to announce earlier this week the closing of CocoWalk for $87.5 million. CocoWalk a 200,000 square-foot lifestyle center located in the heart of Coconut Grove, Florida, with trade areas boasting some of the best demographics in Miami-based County, a hip environment street retail within the center of growth districts serves the most affluent communities of South Florida, including the Grove and South Miami. CocoWalk was acquired on an off market basis from a product company with no local presence. We partnered on the acquisition with local property in the Comras Company, whose underground presence, operating leasing expertise complement our national mixed-use and retail platform. We expect to drive significant value creation at this prime location for redevelopment and remerchandise. Also, please we expect to capitalize another opportunity within this section of Miami-Dade County. 
On the disposition front, we successfully closed on the sale of Houston Street following the end of the first quarter. We sold it for $46 million for a high [indiscernible] cap rate realizing a gain of $11 million on an asset, where we saw limited future growth. 
Finally, during the quarter, we successfully integrated the acquisition of San Antonio center in Mountain View, a truly phenomenal off market acquisition with tremendous upside in the heart of Silicon Valley. We are pleased that even in this competitive environment, we've been able to find attractive investment opportunities in these highly desirable coastal markets. 
Turning to guidance. We've maintained our range of $5.26 to $5.34 per share, excluding the debt repayment. Allow me to offer again some insight on the facts that will influence where we end up in that range. Each of these factors I'm about to discuss reflect careful decisions continue to invest in long-term growth. 
First, the sale of Houston Street. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, this sale will be approximately 2.5% diluted from our original forecast. 
Second, Don mentioned, we incurred approximately $0.02 [ph] snow removal cost beyond what we expected this year. Third, we expect the acquisition of CocoWalk to be neutral to FFO this year, given the transaction cost. However, we do expect it to contribute significantly, following its repositioning and remerchandising. We are actively pursuing other acquisition opportunities and may incur additional transaction cost before we close anything. 
Fourth, we made the strategic decision to continue to invest in R&D, as Don has put it, investing in people in our platforms so that we can responsibly scale the pipeline of value creation we have underway. Again, I believe that we have most investments covered our numbers with transitional cost and other one time expenses that impact our numbers by absolute [ph] $0.01 or $0.02. 
Finally, on the investment side. We continue to aggressively pursue near-term [indiscernible] rollover and related [indiscernible] occupancy to create long-term value. This activity, along with lower than usual lease term fees that we expect to realize [indiscernible] the prior year will likely cause our same-store NOI to decelerate slightly in the second and third quarters, but we still expect to average 3% to 4% for the year. 
Turning again to larger assumptions factored in our guidance. We expect to deliver approximately $375 million of development and redevelopment this year. Some of the more significant deliveries include: Approximately $80 million of office space at Pike & Rose and Assembly, which is being delivered in the first half of this year. As I detailed last quarter, we have underwritten primarily 2016 rent starts that reflect lease [indiscernible] timing as well as [indiscernible]. The retail is fully leased at Pike & Rose, as Don mentioned, with 85% of the space now open, including Summer House, City Square and [indiscernible] The balance of this retail space will continue to open its plans for 2015. Pallas, the 319-unit high-rise, which represents approximately $110 million of investment, is slated to open this summer and is expected to lease up over the following 18 months. Given that timing, we expect it to be NOI later this year and early next as it reaches stabilization towards the end of 2016. We expect development of Plaza El Segundo, which represents approximately $85 million of investment, to open late summer, stabilizing in 2016. From a capital standpoint again, we expect to fund our approximately $250 million of development and redevelopment expenditures this year as well as in the acquisition through free cash flow, long-term debt, our ATM and our line of credit. As mentioned earlier, we remain opportunistic as interest rates and while we look for ways in this environment to term out our maturities and reduce our weighted average net cost. 
In closing, we have a lot of great opportunities delivering now for the long term and couldn't be more excited about how we continue to execute upon our plan, a plan that should reliably produce growth of 7% to 9% per year, growth driven the opportunities that we control today and moderated by our discipline and continued investment in the long term. We look forward many of you at May REIT And with that, operator, I'd like to turn it over for questions."

But I will tell you, when you look at the communities that we're building, they're a critical part. These are living, breathing communities. They're not Disneyland, they're not a pretty picture in the front of the annual report. So products, even within the apartment product, we -- it's not like we build the same buildings with the same consumer in mind or renter in mind. They're different products and Santana Row showed us that in the best example. Similarly, having some level of for sale, now we're a public REIT and we're certainly all about long-term [indiscernible]. So we're not going to do a lot of for-sale units.

And that's less risk because of the first phase open. On the residential side, you can talk to Avalon and their stuff, but boy, they're really strong. The rents are really strong. And the product that we are building is differentiated. Remember, they built 2 types of products. They got the Avila product and they got the Avalon product in 2  separate buildings in Phase I. And so Jeff like what we've seen at Santana Row, and kind of what I'm just saying to Jason, there has to be a balance of product types there. And one of the buildings we're building be on the residential side is high-rise. So those views, that will be a different product, those will be a bit higher, although we are not underwriting them to be a bunch higher at all with the -- with what Avalon is achieving today. So we feel like we're underwriting it very reasonably. We feels like our product will be significantly differentiated. Do I expect there to be -- stabilization when you put a bunch of new products on the market? Do I expect there to be some rent pressure on the lease up, particularly with the Avalon site versus the site? Sure, I do. But your question is the right one.

Jim will cover acquisitions, dispositions, balance sheet, some operations and earnings points, and I'll try to cover the rest before opening up to your questions. 
I don't think I've ever been as grateful for the arrival of spring of this year. Snow removal expenses topped $10 million in the quarter, double what we forecast. And while the strength of our leases allowed us to pass through over 85% of that cost, residential office and some retail leases, along with vacancy don't permit recovery. And accordingly, our first quarter FFO per share of $1.26 was negatively impacted by over $0.02 a share for the year, for Boston, in particular. 
Other than the weather, the company continues to perform well and in line with our expectations, and early anecdotal evidence suggests that cooped up Northeastern choppers are more anxious than in most years to get out and shop and eat as spring has arrived. We're certainly seeing that at Assembly Row. 
All right, enough about snow. Rental income growth in the first quarter was strong at 9% as the same center growth of 3.6% despite only $500,000 in lease termination fees this quarter versus $1.5 billion last year. Those fees are such an integral part of managing our business, and we always include it in our same store numbers as we do with all financial impacts to running the shopping centers. Sometimes they benefit the comparison, sometimes they hurt it. We live with it either way. 
In terms of leasing, it was a good quarter. We completed 86 deals, 75 of them for 0.25 million square feet of comparable space at an average rent of $37.50, 11% more than the $33.70 per foot, representing the last year with a formal lease. Both leases with new tenants and renewals of existing tenants were profitable and grew at 16% and 8%, respectively. The capital included in those new deals was consistent and in fact a bit lower than last year's first quarter and very much in line with the past couple of years, which I view very positively. 
California in general and Silicon Valley in particular, continues to lead the markets we do business in, in terms of leasing demand, exceeding supply in the product that we offer, with Boston and New York Metro following closely behind, really, strong. The other markets we do business in, particularly Washington, D.C, are good, but are not exhibiting the same leasing power and strength that we're experiencing out West at this point in time. A few years back, it was just the opposite, reminding us how important the geographically diversified portfolio is in a business plan that drives consistency and stability. 
Occupancy remained strong in the quarter with a portfolio of 95.4% leased, just slightly off the 95.6% lease percentage at the end of the year and last year's first quarter. On a same-center basis, we were 96% leased, up slightly from the end of last year. All in all, these are very healthy times in our business. 
Let me move on now and report some development news. The early success of Assembly Row made it really clear to us that commercial and residential demand in and around the site wasn't satisfied with the first phase. Earlier this week, our investment committee and then board approved the next phase of Assembly Row. This newest phase will include an extension of the retail streets and a connection with the ground and second floor retail in the Partners HealthCare building. All in all, an additional 167,000 feet of retail for the project. 447 rental apartments that Federal will build and manage, a 155-room boutique hotel to be owned in a partnership with New England-based XSS group. The deal is not done but it's awfully close. And 117 for-sale condominiums sitting 8 floors above the hotel. Excluding the condos, we've committed and appropriated up to $285 million to this phase and expect to yield an unlevered return of about 7% in the first full year of stabilization. Appropriated capital for the condos approximate $65 million. And while we expect them to be sold at net proceeds significantly above that cost, we're assuming breakeven in Phase II disclosed returns. 
Assembly Row continues to perform extremely well. But the only material portion of the first phase remaining to be leased is about half of 100,000 square-foot office building. Assembly Row and the adjacent Assembly Square marketplace have really begun to solidify themselves as an important new shopping and entertainment district in the market. It feels great. And when the second phase is completed in late 2017 or early 2018, we'll still have much more to exploit on this site. 
At Pike & Rose in North Bethesda, Maryland, you'll see a fully leased and occupied residential building called PerSei, fully leased first phase retail component to the project with openings continuing through the summer, and an office component with Merrill Lynch Bank of America moving in as we speak, an LOI is being negotiated on the balance to the space. We'll begin leasing the second residential building called Pallas next month and the the Phase II parking is well under construction and will alleviate limited parking pressures by September of this year. 
Around that same time, construction begins on the next 2 buildings that will extend the main shopping street. We should have some pretty interesting retail leasing announcements over the next few quarters, based on the interest that we're seeing. Lots and lots happening in Pike & Rose. 
By 2017, we'll have over $510 million deployed on that site and 9 buildings for selling 104 condos at least, 340,000 feet of retail, 757,000 residential apartments, 104 condos, 80,000 feet of Merrill Lynch anchored office, a 177-room Canopy-branded hotel and 2,000 parking spaces. And like Assembly, we'll still have much more to exploit on the site. 
The Point in El Segundo, California will open up in late summer with additional tenant openings continuing throughout the fall and beyond. This intersection, Sepulveda and Rosecrans, with the addition of the The Point and considering the adjacent Plaza El Segundo shopping center that we control and operate has really become incredibly dominant and important to the beach communities. We expect it to become more so with the new centers open.
At Santana, construction of the office building addressed as 500 Santana Row at the south end of the site continues on schedule and on budget. The continued strength of the Silicon Valley economy, the strong job growth and the growing reputation of the Santana Row as a very desirable office address had us very bullish about doing deals in this state-of-the-art building over its remaining construction period. 
In terms of our important search for a Senior Vice President of our core shopping center portfolio between Boston and Washington, D.C, we're down to 2 final round candidates and expect to make a decision and announcement within a couple of weeks, maybe sooner. Personally, I've been really impressed with the quality of the candidates we've seen. I feel really good that the enhanced focus on the shopping center side of our business will be fruitful over the next few years. 
On the mixed-use side, you may have read that our very own homegrown choice to lead the operational side of that business, John Hendrickson, was wooed away by Ramco-Gershenson to serve a their as COO. The tole of that process begun before John was promoted to his latest role at Federal. I think the world of John, I wish him much continued success. 
But the this is the Federal Realty earnings call, and as such, I'm thrilled to announce that Dawn Becker will assume the role of Executive Vice President, Mixed-use Operations, in addition to a General Counsel responsibility. As I said on last quarter's call, our company has grown significantly over the past several years and the bifurcation of core and mixed-use necessary to service each. Dawn's skills and background, her relationship with our senior team partners and respect throughout this organization make her perfectly suited for this role. She's a great asset.
We've got more to talk about in terms of our most recent Florida acquisition, future acquisition prospects and our exit from San Antonio, Texas, along with balance sheet and earnings considerations. 
For those and other items, I'll turn it over now to Jim Taylor before opening up the line for your questions. Jim?"

As Don covered in his remarks, this quarter has been an extremely productive one in the continued successful execution of our business plan. I will briefly touch upon some financial highlights, our balance sheet activity, acquisition, dispositions transaction and our outlook for the balance of the year. 
Overall, property operating income grew at 6.9% year-over-year even with higher snow cost. As usual, thanks to our growth, excluding redevelopment, was the largest single driver of that growth at 3.7%. That same-store growth was driven primarily by rental rate increases, both contractual embedded ramp-ups and rollover versus occupancy. 
The redevelopment contributions from successfully delivered projects, such as Hollywood, Misora, Santana Row and Westgate, were largely offset by downtime as we redeveloped assets such as East Bay Bridge, Quince Orchard and Melville as well as lower lease term fees this year. 
Developments at Assembly and Pike & Rose contributed approximately 250 basis points of growth for approximately $2.5 million of POI. 
Finally, the benefit of the San Antonio Center acquisition in California drove the balance of the growth. In sum, each of the elements of our long-term growth plan that we articulated over a year ago continued to deliver. 
G&A increased approximately $1.1 million year-over-year, due primarily transaction cost associated with the closing of San Antonio at the beginning of the quarter as well as slightly higher personnel cost as we build our platform for growth, as Don just discussed. Even with that incremental investment on a run-rate basis, we expect our G&A margin to trend below 5% as we drive top line growth and maintain strict discipline on expenses. 
Interest expense grew approximately $1 million due to lower cap interest as we delivered approximately $300 million in development, offset by lower rates as we continue to bring down our weighted average cost of borrowing. 
Bottom line, FFO grew about 7% when you adjust for the impact of higher snow and transaction cost. Again, this growth was achieved while we continue to invest in the long term. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We successfully raised an additional $200 million of per year debt at an effective yield of 4.18%, a record in the REIT industry. We use the proceeds to redeem our 2017 6.2% note, bringing our weighted average rate down to 4.4% and importantly, extending our average tender to 10.5 years. Again, consistent with our long-term focus, we opportunistically executed upon historically low rates and a flag-yield curve to capitalize our growth plan. 
At quarter end, we had approximately $171 million of cash with nothing drawn under our revolver, providing ample liquidity for growth. 
Speaking of growth, on the acquisition front, we are very pleased to announce earlier this week the closing of CocoWalk for $87.5 million. CocoWalk is a 200,000 square-foot lifestyle center located in the heart of Coconut Grove, Florida. With the trade area boasting some of the best demographics in Miami-Dade County, a hip and vibrant street retail within the center of growth district serves the most affluent year-round communities of South Florida, including the Grove, Coral Gables and South Miami. CocoWalk was acquired on an off-market basis from an out-of-state private company with no local presence. We partnered on the acquisition with local sharpshooters, Grass River Property and The Comras Company, whose on the ground presence, operating and leasing expertise complement perfectly our national mixed-use and retail platform. We expect to drive significant value creation at this prime location for redevelopment and remerchandising. Also, please take note that we expect to capitalize another opportunity within this year-round section of Miami-Dade County. 
On the disposition front, we successfully closed on the sale of Houston Street following the end of the first quarter. We sold it for $46 million for a high-five cap rate, realizing a gain of $11 million on an asset where we saw limited future growth. 
Finally, during the quarter, we successfully integrated the acquisition of San Antonio Center in Mountain View, a truly phenomenal off-market acquisition with tremendous upside in the heart of Silicon Valley. We are pleased that even in this competitive environment, we've been able to find attractive investment opportunities in these highly desirable coastal markets. 
Turning to guidance. We've maintained our range of $5.26 to $5.34 per share, excluding the debt repayment. Allow me to offer again some insights on the facts that will influence where we end up in that range. Each of these factors I'm about to discuss reflect careful decisions to continue to invest in long-term growth. 
First, the sale of Houston Street. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, this sale will be approximately 2.5% diluted from our original forecast. Second, Don mentioned, we incurred approximately $0.02 worth of snow removal cost beyond what we expected this year. Third, we expect the acquisition of CocoWalk to be neutral to FFO this year, given the transaction cost. However, we do expect it to contribute significantly, following its repositioning and remerchandising. We are actively pursuing other acquisition opportunities and may incur additional transaction cost before we close anything. Fourth, we made the strategic decision to continue to invest in R&D, as Don has put it, investing in people in our platforms so that we can responsibly scale the pipeline of value creation we have underway. Again, I believe that we have most those investments covered our numbers, but transitional cost and other one time expenses could impact our numbers by absolute $0.01 or $0.02. 
Finally, on the investment side. We continue to aggressively pursue near-term kind of rollover and the related  temporary decline in occupancy to create long-term value. This activity, along with lower than usual lease term fees that we expect to realize versus the prior year will likely cause our same-store NOI to decelerate slightly in the second and third quarters, but we still expect to average 3% to 4% for the year. 
Turning again to larger assumptions factored in our guidance. We expect to deliver approximately $375 million of development and redevelopment this year. Some of the more significant deliveries include: approximately $80 million of office space at Pike & Rose and Assembly, which is being delivered in the first half of this year. As I detailed last quarter, we have underwritten primarily 2016 rent starts that reflect lease-up timing as well as pre-rent period. The retail is fully leased at Pike & Rose, as Don mentioned, with 85% of the space now open, including iPic Theater, Del Frisco's, Summer House, City Sport and Sport and Health. The balance of this retail space will continue to open as planned through for 2015. 
Pallas, the 319-unit high-rise, which represents approximately $110 million of investment, is slated to open this summer and is expected to lease up over the following 18 months. Given that timing, we expect it to be -- drag NOI later this year and early next as it reaches stabilization towards the end of 2016. 
We expect The Point redevelopment at Plaza El Segundo, which represents approximately $85 million of investment, to open late summer and stabilize in 2016. 
From a capital standpoint again, we expect to fund our approximately $250 million of development and redevelopment expenditures this year as well as in the acquisition through free cash flow, long-term debt, our ATM and our line of credit. As mentioned earlier, we will remain opportunistic as it relates interest rates and while we look for ways in this environment to term out our maturities and reduce our weighted average debt cost. 
In closing, we have a lot of great opportunities delivering now for the long term and couldn't be more excited about how we continue to execute upon our plan, a plan that should reliably produce growth of 7% to 9% per year, growth largely driven by opportunities that we own and control today and moderated by our discipline and continue to invest in the long term. 
We look forward to seeing many of you at May REIT next month. And with that, operator, I'd like to turn it over for questions."

They're not Disneyland, they're not for a pretty picture in the front of the annual report. So to have product, even within the apartment product, we -- it's not like we build the same buildings with the same consumer in mind or renter in mind, they're different products. And Santana Row has showed us that in the best -- as the best example, similarly having some level of for-sale. Now we're a public REIT, and we're certainly all about a long-term income stream. So we're not going to do a lot of for-sale units. But to have some of that product just like varying levels of apartment product is critical to making the whole community work as one."

And that's simply less risk because of the first phase being open. On the residential side, you can talk to Avalon in their and stuff, but boy, they're really strong. The rents they're getting there are really strong. And the products that we were building is differentiated. Remember, they built 2 types of products. They've got the AVA product and they've got the Avalon product in 2 separate buildings in Phase I. And so, Jeff, like what we've seen at Santana Row, there -- and kind of what I'm just saying to Jason, there has to be a balance of product types there. And one of the buildings we're building there on the residential side is high-rise. So those views, that will be a different product. Those rents will be a bit higher, although we're not underwriting them to be a bunch higher at all with the -- with what Avalon is achieving today. So we feel like we're underwriting it very reasonably. We feel like our product will be significantly differentiated. Do I expect there to be in stabilization when you put a bunch of new products on the market? Do I expect there that they'll be some rent pressure on the lease up, particularly with the Avalon site versus this site? Sure, I do. But your question is the right one.

This is far more manageable for her. And on the core side -- I mean, if you just think about it, Jeff, really, if this stuff comes together, it clearly is hard to get each business, the attention that each business needs when you're delivering large projects like this. So having her work closely with Briggs, with Weilminster, with Stuart Biel, the team effectively that is bringing mixed-use out, makes all the sense in the world to us.

Assembly, what we did primarily is build out the Street and not even primarily, almost totally, built up the Street, put in our big boxes and Avalon does the residential. But the Street was key.

That project was basically a residential project in the first phase. So there isn't critical mass of the retail, which is why we did in that first phase, feels like iPic, which is killing it, as you know. Sport & Health, which is a local original health club operator that is really well known and strong. It's why we do restaurants like a Del Frisco's Grille, like a Summer House doing very well. And with respect to the retail, that's why we went with national, like Gap and City Sports there, to kind of round it out. Those guys are doing fine, not nearly as good as they'll do with the second phase opened up, which is why we're working so hard to construct that second phase.

Boy, we've got a lot to talk about on this call this quarter with some acquisitions, dispositions and personnel appointments, in addition to a very robust development and operational update. Jim will cover acquisitions, dispositions, balance sheet, some operations and earnings points, and I'll try to cover the rest before opening up to your questions. 
I don't think I've ever been as grateful for the arrival of spring as this year. Snow removal expenses topped $10 million in the quarter, double what we forecast. And while the strength of our leases allowed us to pass through over 85% of that cost, residential office and some retail leases, along with vacancy don't permit recovery. And accordingly, our first quarter FFO per share of $1.26 was negatively impacted by over $0.02 a share for the year, for Boston, in particular. 
Other than the weather, the company continues to perform well and in line with our expectations, and early anecdotal evidence suggests that cooped up Northeastern choppers are more anxious than in most years to get out and shop and eat as spring has arrived. We're certainly seeing that at Assembly Row. 
All right, enough about snow. Rental income growth in the first quarter was strong at 9% as the same center growth of 3.6% despite only $500,000 in lease termination fees this quarter versus $1.5 billion last year. Those fees are such an integral part of managing our business, that we always include it in our same store numbers as we do with all financial impacts to running the shopping centers. Sometimes they benefit the comparison, sometimes they hurt it. We live with it either way. 
In terms of leasing, it was a good quarter. We completed 86 deals, 75 of them for 0.25 million square feet of comparable space at an average rent of $37.50, 11% more than the $33.70 per foot, representing the last year with a formal lease. Both leases with new tenants and renewals of existing tenants were profitable and grew at 16% and 8%, respectively. The capital included in those new deals was consistent and in fact a bit lower than last year's first quarter and very much in line with the past couple of years, which I view very positively. 
California in general and Silicon Valley in particular, continues to lead the markets we do business in, in terms of leasing demand, exceeding supply in the product that we offer, with Boston and New York Metro following closely behind, really, strong. The other markets we do business in, particularly Washington, D.C, are good, but are not exhibiting the same leasing power and strength that we're experiencing out West at this point in time. A few years back, it was just the opposite, reminding us how important the geographically diversified portfolio is in a business plan that drives consistency and stability. 
Occupancy remained strong in the quarter with a portfolio of 95.4% leased, just slightly off the 95.6% lease percentage at the end of the year and last year's first quarter. On a same-center basis, we were 96% leased, up slightly from the end of last year. All in all, these are very healthy times in our business. 
Let me move on now and report some development news. The early success of Assembly Row made it really clear to us that commercial and residential demand in and around the site wasn't satisfied with the first phase. Earlier this week, our investment committee and then board approved the next phase of Assembly Row. This newest phase will include an extension of the retail streets and a connection with the ground and second floor retail in the Partners HealthCare building. All in all, an additional 167,000 feet of retail for the project. 447 rental apartments that Federal will build and manage, a 155-room boutique hotel to be owned in a partnership with New England-based XSS group. The deal is not done but it's awfully close. And 117 for-sale condominiums sitting 8 floors above the hotel. Excluding the condos, we've committed and appropriated up to $285 million to this phase and expect to yield an unlevered return of about 7% in the first full year of stabilization. Appropriated capital for the condos approximate $65 million. And while we expect them to be sold at net proceeds significantly above that cost, we're assuming breakeven in Phase II disclosed returns. 
Assembly Row continues to perform extremely well. But the only material portion of the first phase remaining to be leased is about half of 100,000 square-foot office building. Assembly Row and the adjacent Assembly Square marketplace have really begun to solidify themselves as an important new shopping and entertainment district in the market. It feels great. And when the second phase is completed in late 2017 or early 2018, we'll still have much more to exploit on this site. 
At Pike & Rose in North Bethesda, Maryland, you'll see a fully leased and occupied residential building called PerSei, fully leased first phase retail component to the project with openings continuing through the summer, and an office component with Merrill Lynch Bank of America moving in as we speak, an LOI is being negotiated on the balance to the space. We'll begin leasing the second residential building called Pallas next month and the  Phase II parking garage is well under construction and will alleviate limited parking pressures by September of this year. 
Around that same time, construction begins on the next 2 buildings that will extend the main shopping street. We should have some pretty interesting retail leasing announcements over the next few quarters, based on the interest that we're seeing. Lots and lots happening in Pike & Rose. 
By 2017, we'll have over $510 million deployed on that site and 9 buildings for selling 104 condos at least, 340,000 feet of retail, 757,000 residential apartments, 104 condos, 80,000 feet of Merrill Lynch anchored office, a 177-room Canopy-branded hotel and 2,000 parking spaces. And like Assembly, we'll still have much more to exploit on the site. 
The Point in El Segundo, California will open up in late summer with additional tenant openings continuing throughout the fall and beyond. This intersection, Sepulveda and Rosecrans, with the addition of The Point and considering the adjacent Plaza El Segundo shopping center that we control and operate has really become incredibly dominant and important to the beach communities. We expect it to become more so with the new centers open.
At Santana, construction of the office building addressed as 500 Santana Row at the south end of the site continues on schedule and on budget. The continued strength of the Silicon Valley economy, the strong job growth and the growing reputation of the Santana Row as a very desirable office address had us very bullish about doing deals in this state-of-the-art building over its remaining construction period. 
In terms of our important search for a Senior Vice President of our core shopping center portfolio between Boston and Washington, D.C, we're down to 2 final round candidates and expect to make a decision and announcement within a couple of weeks, maybe sooner. Personally, I've been really impressed with the quality of the candidates we've seen. I feel really good that the enhanced focus on the shopping center side of our business will be fruitful over the next few years. 
On the mixed-use side, you may have read that our very own homegrown choice to lead the operational side of that business, John Hendrickson, was wooed away by Ramco-Gershenson to serve a their as COO. I'm told that, that process began before John was promoted to his latest role at Federal. I think the world of John, I wish him much continued success. 
But this is the Federal Realty earnings call, and as such, I'm thrilled to announce that Dawn Becker will assume the role of Executive Vice President, Mixed-use Operations, in addition to his General Counsel responsibilities. As I said on last quarter's call, our company has grown significantly over the past several years and the bifurcation of core and mixed-use necessary to service each. Dawn's skills and background, her relationship with our senior team partners and respect throughout this organization make her perfectly suited for this role. She's a great asset.
We've got more to talk about in terms of our most recent Florida acquisition, future acquisition prospects and our exit from San Antonio, Texas, along with balance sheet and earnings considerations. 
For those and other items, I'll turn it over now to Jim Taylor before opening up the line for your questions. Jim?"

As Don covered in his remarks, this quarter has been an extremely productive one in the continued successful execution of our business plan. I will briefly touch upon some financial highlights, our balance sheet",1342,"Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. As Don covered in his remarks, this quarter has been an extremely productive one in the continued successful execution of our business plan. I will briefly touch upon some financial highlights, our balance sheet activity, acquisition, dispositions transaction and our outlook for the balance of the year. 
Overall, property operating income grew at 6.9% year-over-year even with higher snow cost. As usual, thanks to our growth, excluding redevelopment, was the largest single driver of that growth at 3.7%. That same-store growth was driven primarily by rental rate increases, both contractual embedded rent-bumps and rollover versus occupancy. 
The redevelopment contributions from successfully delivered projects, such as Hollywood, Misoras' new Santana Row and Westgate, were largely offset by downtime as we redeveloped assets such as East Bay Bridge, Quince Orchard and Melville as well as lower lease term fees this year. 
Developments at Assembly and Pike & Rose contributed approximately 250 basis points of growth for approximately $2.5 million of POI. 
Finally, the benefit of the San Antonio Center acquisition in California drove the balance of the growth. In sum, each of the elements of our long-term growth plan that we articulated over a year ago continue to deliver. 
G&A increased approximately $1.1 million year-over-year, due primarily transaction cost associated with the closing of San Antonio at the beginning of the quarter as well as slightly higher personnel cost as we build our platform for growth, as Don just discussed. Even with that incremental investment on a run-rate basis, we expect our G&A margin to trend below 5% as we drive top line growth and maintain strict discipline on expenses. 
Interest expense grew approximately $1 million due to lower cap interest as we delivered approximately $300 million in development, offset by lower rates as we continue to bring down our weighted average cost of borrowing. 
Bottom line, FFO grew about 7% when you adjust for the impact of higher snow and transaction cost. Again, this growth was achieved while we continue to invest in the long term. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We successfully raised an additional $200 million of per year debt at an effective yield of 4.18%, a record in the REIT industry. We use the proceeds to redeem our 2017 6.2% note, bringing our weighted average rate down to 4.4% and importantly, extending our average tender to 10.5 years. Again, consistent with our long-term focus, we opportunistically executed upon historically low rates and a flag-yield curve to capitalize our growth plan. 
At quarter end, we had approximately $171 million of cash with nothing drawn under our revolver, providing ample liquidity for growth. 
Speaking of growth, on the acquisition front, we are very pleased to announce earlier this week the closing of CocoWalk for $87.5 million. CocoWalk is a 200,000 square-foot lifestyle center located in the heart of Coconut Grove, Florida. With the trade area boasting some of the best demographics in Miami-Dade County, a hip and vibrant street retail within the center Grove district serves the most affluent year-round communities of South Florida, including the Grove, Coral Gables and South Miami. CocoWalk was acquired on an off-market basis from an out-of-state private company with no local presence. We partnered on the acquisition with local sharpshooters, Grass River Property and The Comras Company, whose on the ground presence, operating and leasing expertise complement perfectly our national mixed-use and retail platform. We expect to drive significant value creation at this prime location for redevelopment and remerchandising. Also, please stay tuned as we expect to capitalize another opportunity within this year-round section of Miami-Dade County. 
On the disposition front, we successfully closed on the sale of Houston Street following the end of the first quarter. We sold it for $46 million for a high-five cap rate, realizing a gain of $11 million on an asset where we saw limited future growth. 
Finally, during the quarter, we successfully integrated the acquisition of San Antonio Center in Mountain View, a truly phenomenal off-market acquisition with tremendous upside in the heart of Silicon Valley. We are pleased that even in this competitive environment, we've been able to find attractive investment opportunities in these highly desirable coastal markets. 
Turning to guidance. We've maintained our range of $5.26 to $5.34 per share, excluding the debt repayment. Allow me to offer again some insights on the facts that will influence where we end up in that range. Each of these factors I'm about to discuss reflect careful decisions to continue to invest in long-term growth. 
First, the sale of Houston Street. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, this sale will be approximately 2.5x diluted from our original forecast. Second, Don mentioned, we incurred approximately $0.02 worth of snow removal cost beyond what we expected this year. Third, we expect the acquisition of CocoWalk to be neutral to FFO this year, given the transaction cost. However, we do expect it to contribute significantly, following its repositioning and remerchandising. We are actively pursuing other acquisition opportunities and may incur additional transaction cost before we close anything. Fourth, we made the strategic decision to continue to invest in R&D, as Don has put it, investing in people in our platforms so that we can responsibly scale the pipeline of value creation we have underway. Again, I believe that we have most this investment covered our numbers, but transitional cost and other one time expenses could impact our numbers by up to $0.01 or $0.02. 
Finally, on the investment side. We continue to aggressively pursue near-term kind of rollover and the related  temporary decline in occupancy to create long-term value. This activity, along with lower than usual lease term fees that we expect to realize versus the prior year will likely cause our same-store NOI to decelerate slightly in the second and third quarters, but we still expect to average 3% to 4% for the year. 
Turning again to larger timing assumptions factored in our guidance. We expect to deliver approximately $375 million of development and redevelopment this year. Some of the more significant deliveries include: approximately $80 million of office space at Pike & Rose and Assembly, which is being delivered in the first half of this year. As I detailed last quarter, we have underwritten primarily 2016 rent starts that reflect lease-up timing as well as pre-rent period. The retail is fully leased at Pike & Rose, as Don mentioned, with 85% of the space now open, including iPic Theater, Del Frisco's, Summer House, City Sport and Sport and Health. The balance of this retail space will continue to open as planned through for 2015. 
Pallas, the 319-unit high-rise, which represents approximately $110 million of investment, is slated to open this summer and is expected to lease up over the following 18 months. Given that timing, we expect it to be -- drag NOI later this year and early next as it reaches stabilization towards the end of 2016. 
We expect The Point redevelopment at Plaza El Segundo, which represents approximately $85 million of investment, to open late summer and stabilize in 2016. 
From a capital standpoint again, we expect to fund our approximately $250 million of development and redevelopment expenditures this year as well as any acquisitions through free cash flow, long-term debt, our ATM and our line of credit. As mentioned earlier, we will remain opportunistic as it relates interest rates and will always look for ways in this environment to term out our maturities and reduce our weighted average debt cost. 
In closing, we have a lot of great opportunities delivering now for the long term and couldn't be more excited about how we continue to execute upon our plan, a plan that should reliably produce growth of 7% to 9% per year, growth largely driven by opportunities that we own and control today and moderated by our discipline and continue to invest in the long term. 
We look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT next month. And with that, operator, I'd like to turn it over for questions."

They're not Disneyland, they're not for a pretty picture in the front of the annual report. So to have product, even within the apartment product, we -- it's not like we build the same buildings with the same consumer in mind or renter in mind, they're different products. And Santana Row has showed us that in the best -- as the best example, similarly having some level of for-sale. Now we're a public REIT, and we're certainly all about a long-term income stream. So we're not going to do a lot of for-sale units. But to have some of that product just like varying levels of apartment product is critical to making the whole community work as one."

We're going to push hard, and let's talk about the retail first. The single biggest thing that we'll be pushing for harder in the second phase versus the first phase is more fixed rent, less percentage. And that should be attainable based on the success of the first phase. But overall, we would expect higher numbers combined, fixed plus percentage, in the second phase than the first phase. And that's simply less risk because of the first phase being open. On the residential side, you can talk to Avalon in their call and stuff, but boy, they're really strong. The rents they're getting there are really strong. And the products that we were building is differentiated. Remember, they built 2 types of products. They've got the AVA product and they've got the Avalon product in 2 separate buildings in Phase I. And so just like we've seen at Santana Row, there -- and kind of what I'm just saying to Jason, there has to be a balance of product types there. And one of the buildings we're building there on the residential side is high-rise. So those views, that will be a different product. Those rents will be a bit higher, although we're not underwriting them to be a bunch higher at all with the -- with what Avalon is achieving today. So we feel like we're underwriting it very reasonably. We feel like the product will be significantly differentiated. Do I expect there to be in stabilization when you put a bunch of new products on the market? Do I expect there that to be some rent pressure on the lease up, particularly with the Avalon site versus this site? Sure, I do. But your question is the right one. Upon stabilization, I think you're going to see clearly underserved residential market here with the street that is just killer. So I'm really excited about it."

Assembly, what we did primarily is build out the Street and not even primarily, almost totally, built up the Street, put in our big boxes and Avalon does the residential. But the Street was key. At Pike & Rose, that was a different strategy, because there was an existing shopping center on the site, Mid-Pike Plaza, which was doing extremely well even up til the time we knocked it down. That project was basically a residential project in the first phase. So there isn't critical mass of the retail, which is why we did in that first phase, feels like iPic, which is killing it, as you know. Sport & Health, which is a local -- a regional health club operator that is really well known and strong. It's why we do restaurants like a Del Frisco's Grille, like a Summer House doing very well. And with respect to the retail, that's why we went with national, like Gap and City Sports there, to kind of round it out. Those guys are doing fine, not nearly as good as they'll do with the second phase opened up, which is why we're working so hard to construct that second phase.

271305,304769611,857819,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2015",2015-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Well, thank you, Brittany Schmelz, and good morning, everyone.

It's a pleasure to be able to report to you today about our very strong quarter for Federal all the way around our business. Strong at the growth, strong same-store growth, strong occupancy, strong development activities and more acquisition in greater Miami. As mentioned, an 8% dividend raise from $0.87 a quarter to 94 for 48 [ph] consecutive year of increased dividends. Great quarter. 
Now let's start with earnings. FFO per share of $1.33, excluding, of course, prepayment premium this year and the retirement of $200 million of senior notes, was 8% higher than the $1.23 earned in last year's quarter as the first phase of the development project began to contribute and the core continues to power along. I'd single out higher-than-anticipated percentage rent at Assembly Row, a nice residential rent growth in Santana Row especially encouraging. It's really good news because as we've discussed previously, we're consciously investing in our team with higher long-term incentives and deeper bench strength to be sure -- as sure as we can that we're well prepared to execute and deliver on a business plan and a doubling NOI in the next decade. Hence, part of the reason for the G&A increase in the quarter. This a very balanced approach for growing our business, and it's not the quarter-by-quarter business plan.
On the leasing side, nearly 300,000 feet of comparable deals were executed in the quarter at average rent of $30.41, 15% above the 26 36 [ph] the prior tenant was paying. The leasing strength was broad with both new deals and renewals registering double-digit growth from within all of 3 operating platforms of our company: West Coast, the core and the mixed-use portfolios. As an example, we're thrilled to do our first deal with Macy's in the form of their first Macy's backstage retail stores, their value-based concept opening this month at our shopping center on Long Island. In addition, we saw a strong renewal at newly acquired San Antonio Center in Mountain View, California, and at the village of in Arlington, Virginia in the health club and theater categories. Both come with significant upgrades to their facilities, a clear trend that we're seeing in the theater business in particular as competition from newer, more service-oriented companies gain traction. 
Same-store growth in the quarter was strong at 3% without the impacts of redevelopment and 4.8% with them. Lease termination fees were comparable in both periods.
The redevelopment impact really benefited from a great job at Mercer Mall in New Jersey [indiscernible] REI all opened and there's  more to come. Before-and-after pictures of Mercer Mall really reflect our core redevelopment competency. It's a transformed asset. 
in Richmond is similarly on its way to transformation to a far more relevant retail center. Occupancy jumped in the quarter to 94.9% while the percentage leased climbed to 95.7%, both up a bit compared with last year and the first quarter on a strong leasing momentum. As you can see, this was a really strong operating quarter.
Now let's move on to report and development news. First, in Somerville. Assembly Row continues to mature beautifully with most restaurants and retailers meeting or exceeding their first-year projections. We've clearly struck a chord in the community and are providing a need that wasn't being met. Percentage rent is above our expectations, and the office building is basically fully spoken for with virtually all available space occupied or under signed lease or LOI. The partners construction is right on there may be ahead of schedule and occupancy by partners employees expected to begin next summer. That building is huge and really does wonders, adding scale and perspective to the entire site. Check it out on any trip to Boston. It's impressive.
Our own construction on Phase 2 is just now getting underway, and we'll start to deliver in 2017. Future of the Assembly Row section of Somerville is extremely bright, and there'll be incremental investment opportunities here for at least the next 6 or 7 years as we fully build out. 
400 miles south is Pike & Rose in north of Bethesda, Maryland and there too, lots of construction, lots of progress to report. Let's start with the residential lease commencement at the Palace high rise build. 36 leases assigned, 11% of the building in the first couple of months at rents at or above our pro forma with the first sets of move-ins underway. That's a good start. The new parking garage will open next month as scheduled and provide an additional 550-plus sorely needed space. Virtually all available office space in the first phase is now either occupied or under signed lease or LOI. More progress. 
As the second phase gets underway, we have signed leases or LOIs with some great anchors early in the process as we give you a feel for the direction we're going. The 30,000 square foot and entertainment concept will anchor the end of the street. REI will relocate from a mile away to pipe and avenue 38,000 square feet. And we're close to a deal with H&M to take 25,000 feet on 2 levels in one of the best corners in the project. Plenty more leasing in the works with some terrific names we can be begin construction on the second phase that is so necessary to create the critical mass at this site. Deliveries and store openings in this space begin in 2017. 
I can't wait to show the project at our planned Investor Day there on September 30. I hope most of your are planning to attend. While there will still be plenty of construction on the interior upper floors of Palace, along with some exterior to finish up, as I mentioned, the second phase which will be well underway at that point, it won't be hard to see why we're still bullish about the very significant value being created here now and well into the future.
Meanwhile, on the West Coast. The first dozen or so tenants opened last week at the Point to capacity . The Point being our 150,000 square foot addition to the Plaza El Segundo shopping complex in El Segundo, California. Thank you, by the way, to the West Coast folks on the phone who emailed over the weekend with kind words after visiting the Point. It really means a lot. 80% of that space is leased or fully executed LOI and will be opening tenants throughout the rest of the summer and fall in what we know will be a favorite gathering and shopping destination for the areas underserved communities like Manhattan and Redondo Beach.
Tenants like True Food Kitchen, Lucky Jeans, Made Well, Mendocino Farms and Seoul Cycle all around a really large and attractive public space should give you the feel of what we're creating here. Significant value creation day 1 that will get better and better for years to come.
And perhaps the newest thing to talk about on this call is our well-studied commitment to South Miami. We reported on the CocoWalk acquisition with our local partners Grass River on last quarter's call, and since that time we've closed on several CocoWalk street retail buildings in close proximity to CocoWalk in order to make our presence more impactful. In addition, we've locked up a larger retail and mixed-use project just a few miles away, also with local partners Grass River with due diligence largely complete and a closing date expected in the next few weeks. 
Jim will talk more about that to the extent we can in his remarks. 
My point in talking about it is this, we will have gone from a nonplayer in South Miami a few months ago to a very significant landlord controlling hundreds of thousands of square feet in 6 months' time. Roughly $200 million of initial acquisition capital at a type of reasonable yield at first, 5% plus, while we work hard to figure out a significant repositioning and redevelopment plan because hopefully, it will allow us to deploy us much as an additional $150 million to $200 million in those assets over the next 5 years. It's, in effect, a yielding land play. I'm hopeful and confident that our work and our experience on the Bethesda, Assembly Row, Pike & Rose, Santana Row, The Point, so many smaller examples over the past 20 years put us in a unique position to be able to do just that. But if not, we still have great real estate and a very protected downside.
As you can see, there's a lot going on, on all facets of our business plan. We remain on track to double our income in the next decade, as we've talked about many times the past couple of years. So far, so good.
Let me now turn it over to Jim Taylor for additional guidance and explanation, and then we'll open up the lines to your questions."
271305,304769611,857819,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2015",2015-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. As Don highlighted in his remarks, our results this quarter not only set a new record for the trough in terms of FFO per share, they further demonstrate the continued successful execution of our long-term plan,",1233,"Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. As Don highlighted in his remarks, our results this quarter not only set a new record for the trough in terms of FFO per share, they further demonstrate the continued successful execution of our long-term plan, a plan that drove the 48th consecutive annual increase in our dividend of 8%. I will provide some additional color on our quarterly results, our balance sheet activity, acquisitions and our outlook for the balance of the year. 
Overall property operating income grew at 9.2% year-over-year. As usual, the largest single driver of that growth was our operating portfolio, which grew at 4.8% on a same-store basis, including redevelopment and 3% excluding. With cash or leasing spreads this quarter at 15% on deals that will take occupancy in the future, we believe that we remain on track and continue to deleverage sustainable growth. 
Importantly, as highlighted in our supplement, we continue to successfully deliver upon our redevelopment pipeline. As Don noted, most notably, this quarter stabilizing redevelopments and Mercer Mall. In addition, our initial phases at Pike & Rose and Assembly contributed approximately $3.5 million of during the quarter. Finally, this quarter, we benefited from the successful integration of our acquisitions of San Antonio Center in Mountain View, California as well as CocoWalk in Coconut Grove, Florida. As previously discussed, these assets are not only accretive in the near term, they present compelling redevelopment opportunities given their locations. 
Our G&A increased approximately $1.2 million year-over-year due primarily to transaction costs associated with the closing of CocoWalk as well as higher personnel costs Don mentioned as we continue to invest in our platform for growth. As discussed last quarter, even with this incremental investment in our platform, we expect our G&A to remain about 5% of revenue. 
Interest expense grew slightly during the quarter due to lower cap interest as we delivered parts of the first phases of Assembly and Pike & Rose, which was offset by lower rates as we see continue to bring down our weighted average interest rate, which today stands at about 4.3%. 
Bottom line, FFO per share grew at 8.1%, in line with our long-term plan of 7% to 9% even as we continue to invest in the future. As many of you have heard us say on conferences and one-on-one meetings, we could can generate higher absolute growth where we scale back on that investment, perhaps lever up a bit, but that is a cyclical plan. This quarter's 48th consecutive annual dividend increase, a track record that is older that many of us on this call, guides our relentless focus on predictable sustainable growth.
Turning to the balance sheet. Early in the quarter, we redeemed $200 million of our 2017 6.2% notes with the proceeds of a 30-year debt issuance at 4.18%. Importantly, we extended our weighted average tenor to 10 years, which, as we look forward, provides us with maximum flexibility to access the most opportunistic part of the yield curve, long or short, and still retain the longest weighted average tenor in the shopping center sector. At quarter end, we had approximately $100 million drawn under our revolver, leaving us with more than enough liquidity to fund the growth we have underway. 
On the acquisition front, we've successfully integrated the CocoWalk asset during the quarter and have identified near-term upside while we execute on our longer-term plan for the asset. In addition, we closed on the acquisition of interest in 7 retail assets running the primary shopping streets within the growth, providing us additional opportunity to capitalize on the positive rental rate trend within the growth district. 
Finally, as Don mentioned, we placed another approximately $110 million asset under contract within the broader trade area, which like CocoWalk benefits from a phenomenal infill location and also presents an opportunity to create significant value to redevelopment to serve the affluent population that surrounds us. More to come on net assets soon. 
With our strategic focus on this Miami-Dade market and our partnership with local sharpshooter we, as Don mentioned, have built a substantial market presence within a short period of time. We couldn't be more excited about this market and how it will benefit our overall portfolio through inevitable cycles.
Now turning to guidance for 2015. We have tightened and increased midpoint of our previously provided range to 529 to 533 or 7.5% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. This updated guidance generally reflects the strength of our opening at Assembly Row where, as Don mentioned, many of our tenants are now paying additional percentage rent and importantly, continued strength in our core where our team is doing an excellent job managing rollover and leasing additional space. We expect to continue to see robust cash flow growth for the balance of the year well above historical average while we will also see some lag in same-store NOI in the second half of 2015 due to tenant rollover and higher term fees that we realized last year. Even with these timing issues, we expect same-store NOI to average 3.5% to 4%, including redevelopments for the entire year. 
Some of the larger timing assumptions that have been factored into our guidance and that will impact the balance of this year as well as 2016 includes of the approximately 80 million [ph] of office space in Pike & Rose and Assembly that is being delivered this year, we now have leases and LOIs on over 95% [ph] of that space. Based on the deals in place, we expect these tenants to take occupancy through mid-2016 and based on free rent periods to be fully pay rent in 2017. The retail at Assembly Row is 97% leased and 95% occupied as of the end of the second quarter with the last few tenants taking occupancy in the latter part of this year. The retail is fully leased at Pike & Rose over 90% of that space now open, including good summerhouse. The balance of this retail space will continue to open over the next 6 months. 
Pallas, the 319-unit [ph] high-rise which represents approximately $110 million of investment, has opened and is expected to lease up over the next 18 months. Given that timing, we expected to be a drag to NOI this year and early as it reaches stabilization at the end of 2016. Finally, from a timing perspective, The Point redevelopment in El Segundo, which represents approximately $85 million of investment, opened last extremely well and is projected to stabilize through mid-2016. 
Again, as we look forward, we remain confident in our plan to continue to generate 7% to 9% growth even as we invest for long term on both sides of our balance sheet. While we have not yet provided guidance for 2016, which we will do next quarter, we would nonetheless expect to remain in that range. 
Finally, we all look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day on September 30. We expect to show up our first day at Pike & Rose, which will now be in also to show opportunities for additional investment in one of our first mixed-use property. We also will provide folks the opportunity to meet our broader management team responsible for the execution of our plan as well as meet members of our Board of Directors.
With that, operator, I'd like to turn the call over to questions."

Christy, well, as you know from being out there, we have a sectional plaza in El Segundo called The Collection, which is about 50,000 square feet of lifestyle that does very, very well. So thinking about the merchandising strategy for The Point, we wanted to build on that success and continue to fill an unmet need for additional lifestyle retail in that trade area, which we've done and we're doing. We have 25,000 square feet of restaurants based at The Point. We view that total market is really underserved for better dining options and also for a collection of restaurants meaning someplace kind of like Santana Row where you can come and park the car and meet your friends and figure out where you're going to go once you get there. Pretty much every other restaurant opportunity in that market is what I would call point and shoot, meaning you get in your car, you go to the restaurant, you get in your car and you leave. So that was a real unmet need in the trade area, and I think we've done a nice job of filling in. In terms of the connectivity, yes, the railroad tracks that are never going away. But we got a couple of ideas that we're working on with the city of El Segundo right now to make the connectivity better, and I think we'll achieve those ideas and work through everything with the city in the end next few months. And the connection between the collection in particular and The Point will improve. It's not super pedestrian friendly right now, but really, it's only a 2 or 3-minute walk from the front of the collection to the main the entry point at The Point so it's clearly not that bad, but we can improve it."

271305,304769611,858215,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2015",2015-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Well, thank you, Brittany Schmelz, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be able to report you today, we've had a very strong quarter for Federal all the way around our business. Strong FFO growth, strong same-store growth, strong lease rollover,",1521,"Well, thank you, Brittany Schmelz, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be able to report you today, we've had a very strong quarter for Federal all the way around our business. Strong FFO growth, strong same-store growth, strong lease rollover, strong occupancy, strong development deliveries and more acquisitions in Greater Miami. Also mentioned an 8% dividend raised from $0.87 a quarter to $0.94 for 48th consecutive year of increased dividends, great quarter.
Now let's start with earnings. FFO per share were $1.33, excluding, of course, prepayment premium this year and the retirement of $200 million of senior notes, was 8% higher than the $1.23 earned in last year's quarter as the first phase of the development project began to contribute and the core continues to power along.
I'd single out higher-than-anticipated percentage rent at Assembly Row, a nice residential rent growth in Santana Row is especially encouraging. It's really good news, because that's we've discussed previously, we're very consciously investing in our team with higher long-term incentives and deeper bench strength to be sure or as sure as we can that we're well prepared to execute and deliver on a business plan and a doubling NOI in the next decade. Hence, part of the reason for the G&A increase in the quarter. This is a very balanced approach for growing our business, and it's not a quarter-by-quarter business plan.
On the leasing side, nearly 300,000 feet of comparable deals were executed in the quarter, at average rent of $30.41, 15% above the $26.36 the prior tenant was paying. The leasing strength was broad with both new deals and renewals registering double-digit growth within all 3 operating platforms of our company: West Coast, the core and the mixed-use portfolios.
As an example, we're thrilled to do our first deal with Macy's in the form of their first Macy's Backstage retail stores. Their value-based concept opening this month at our Melville shopping center on Long Island. In addition, we saw strong renewals at newly acquired San Antonio Center in Mountain View, California, and at the Village of Shrilington in Arlington, Virginia in the health club and theater categories. Both come with significant upgrades to their facilities, a clear trend that we're seeing in the theater business in particular as competition from newer, more service-oriented companies gain traction. 
Same-store growth in the quarter was strong at 3% without the impacts of -- impact of redevelopments and 4.8%, with lease termination fees were comparable in both periods.
The redevelopment impact really benefited from a great job at Mercer Mall in New Jersey, Nordstrom Rack, Lemonpop, REI all opened and there's  more to come. Before-and-after pictures of Mercer Mall really reflect our core redevelopment competency. It's a transformed asset. 
Willow Lawn in Richmond is similarly on its way to transformation to a far more relevant retail center. Occupancy jumps in the quarter to 94.9%, while the percentage leased climbed to 95.7%. Both up a bit compared with last year and the first quarter on a strong leasing momentum. As you can see, this was a really strong operating quarter.
Now let's move on to report some development news. First, in Somerville. Assembly Row continues to mature beautifully with most restaurants and retailers meeting or exceeding their first year projections. We've clearly struck a chord in the community and are providing a need that wasn't being met. Percentage rent is above our expectations and the office building is basically fully spoken for with virtually all available space occupied or under signed lease or LOI. The partners' construction is right on or maybe ahead of schedule and occupancy by partners employees expected to begin next summer. That building is huge and really does wonders adding scale and perspective to the entire site. Check it out on any trip to Boston. It's impressive.
Our own construction on Phase 2 is just now getting underway, and we'll start to deliver in 2017. Future of the Assembly Row section of Somerville is extremely bright, and there'll be incremental investment opportunities here for at least the next 6 or 7 years as we fully build out. 400 miles south is Pike & Rose in North Bethesda, Maryland and there too, lots of construction, lots of progress to report.
Let's start with the residential lease commencement at the Palls high-rise build. 36 leases signed, 11% of the building in the first couple of months at rents at or above our pro forma with the first sets of move-ins underway. That's a good start. The new parking garage will open next month as scheduled and provide an additional 550-plus sorely-needed space. Virtually all available office space in the first phase is now either occupied or under signed lease or LOI, more progress. 
As the second phase gets underway, we have signed leases or LOIs with some great anchors early in the process that should give you a feel for the direction we're going. Pinstripes the 30,000-square-foot bowling and entertainment concept, will anchor the end of the street. REI will relocate from a mile away to anchor Rockville Pike and newly formed Rose Avenue in 38,000 square feet.
And we're close to a deal with H&M to take 25,000 feet on 2 levels at one of the best corners in the project. Plenty more leasing in the works with some terrific names we begin construction on the second phase that is so necessary to create the critical mass that this site needs. Deliveries and store openings in this phase begin in 2017.
Frankly, I can't wait to show the project off a bit at our planned Investor Day there on September 30. I hope most of your are planning to attend. While there will still be plenty of construction on the interior upper floors of Pallas along with some exterior trim to finish up, not to mention the second phase, which will be well underway at that point, It won't be hard to see why we're still bullish about the very significant value being created here now and well into the future.
Meanwhile, on the West Coast. The first dozen or so tenants opened last week at The Point to capacity  crowds. The Point being our 150,000 square foot addition to the Plaza El Segundo shopping complex in El Segundo, California. Thank you, by the way, the West Coast folks on the phone who e-mailed over the weekend with kind words after visiting The Point. It really means a lot. 80% of that space is leased are fully executed -- are in the fully executed LOI. And we'll be opening tenants throughout the rest of the summer and fall, and what we know will be a favorite gathering and shopping destination for the areas underserved communities like Manhattan, Hermosa and Redondo Beach.
Tenants like True Food Kitchen, Lucky Jeans, Madewell, Athleta, Mendocino Farms, and SoulCycle all around a really large and attractive park like public space to give you the feel of what we were creating here. Significant value creation day one that will get better and better for years to come.
And perhaps the newest thing to talk about on this call is our well-studied commitment to South Miami. We reported on the CocoWalk acquisition with our local partners, Grass River, on last quarter's call, and since that time we've closed on several Coconut Grove's street retail building and closed proximity to CocoWalk in order to make our presence more impactful. In addition, we've locked up a larger retail and mixed-use project just a few miles away, also with local partners Grass River with due diligence largely complete and a closing date expected in the next few weeks.
Jim will talk more about that to the extent we can in his remarks. 
My point is -- my point in talking about is this. We have gone from a nonplayer in South Miami a few months ago to a very significant landlord controlling hundreds of thousands of square feet in 6 months time. Roughly $200 million of initial acquisition capital at a tight reasonable yield at first, 5% plus, while we worked hard to figure out a significant repositioning and redevelopment plan that could hopefully allow us to deploy as much as an additional $150 million to $250 million in those assets over the next 5 years. It's, in effect, a yielding land play. I'm hopeful and confident that our work and our experience on the likes of Bethesda Row, Assembly Row, Pike & Rose, Santana Row, The Point, so many smaller examples over the past 20 years put us in a unique position to be able to do just that. What if not, we still have great real estate and a very protected downside.
As you can see, there's a lot going on, on all facets of our business plan. We remain on track to double our income in the next decade, as we've talked about many times in the past couple of years. So far, so good.
Let me now turn it over to Jim Taylor for additional guidance and explanation, and then we'll open up the lines to your questions."
271305,304769611,858215,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2015",2015-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Thank you, Don. And good morning, everyone. As Don highlighted in his remarks, our results this quarter not only set a new record for the Trust in terms of FFO per share, they further demonstrate the continued successful execution of our long-term plan. A",1270,"Thank you, Don. And good morning, everyone. As Don highlighted in his remarks, our results this quarter not only set a new record for the Trust in terms of FFO per share, they further demonstrate the continued successful execution of our long-term plan. A plan that drove the 48th consecutive annual increase in our dividend of 8%. I will provide some additional color on our quarterly results, our balance sheet activity, acquisitions and our outlook for the balance of the year.
Overall property operating income grew at 9.2% year-over-year. As usual, the largest single driver of that growth was our operating portfolio, which grew at 4.8% on a same-store basis including redevelopment and 3% excluding. With cash from releasing spreads this quarter at 15% on deals that will take occupancy in the future, we believe that we remain on track to continue to deliver sustainable growth.
Importantly, as highlighted in our supplement, we continue to successfully deliver upon our redevelopment pipeline. As Don noted, most notably, this quarter stabilizing redevelopments that will align in Mercer Mall. In addition, our initial phases of Pike & Rose and Assembly contributed approximately $3.5 million of DOI during the quarter.
Finally, this quarter, we benefited from the successful integration of our acquisitions of San Antonio Center in Mountain View, California as well as CocoWalk in Coconut Grove, Florida. As previously discussed, these assets are not only accretive in the near term, they will present compelling redevelopment opportunities given their infill location. 
Our G&A increased approximately $1.2 million year-over-year due primarily to transaction costs associated with the closing of CocoWalk as well as higher personnel cost, Don mentioned as we continue to invest in our platform for growth. As discussed last quarter, even with this incremental investment in our platform, we expect our G&A to remain at about 5% of revenue.
Interest expense grew slightly during the quarter due to lower cap interests as we deliver parts of the first phases of Assembly and Pike & Rose, which was offset by lower rates as we continue to bring down our weighted average interest rate, which today stands at about 4.3%.
Bottom line, FFO per share grew at 8.1%, in line with our long-term plan at 7% to 9% even as we continue to invest in the future. As many of you have heard us say at conferences and one-on-one meetings, we could generate higher absolute growth where we would scale back on that investment and perhaps lever up a bit, but that is a cyclical plan only. This quarter's 48th consecutive annual dividend increase, a track record that is older that many of us on this call, guides our relentless focus on predictable sustainable growth.
Turning to the balance sheet. Early in the quarter, we redeemed $200 million of our 2017 6.2% notes with the proceeds of a 30-year debt issuance at 4.18%. Importantly, we extended our weighted average tenure to 10 years, which as we look forward, provides us with maximum flexibility to access the most opportunistic part of the yield curve, long or short, and still retain the longest weighted average tenure in the shopping centers sector.
At quarter end, we had approximately $100 million drawn under our revolver, leaving us with more than enough liquidity to fund the growth we have underway.
On the acquisition front, we've successfully integrated the CocoWalk asset during the quarter and have identified near-term upside while we execute on our longer-term plan for the asset. In addition, we closed on the acquisition of interest in 7 retail assets running the primary shopping streets within the growth, providing us additional opportunity to capitalize on the positive rental rate trends within the resurging Grove District.
Finally, as Don mentioned, we placed another approximately $110 million asset under contract within the broader trade area, which like CocoWalk benefits from a phenomenal infill location and also presents an opportunity to create significant value through developments to serve the affluent and dense population that surrounds it. More to come on net assets soon. 
With our strategic focus on this Miami-Dade market and our partnership with local sharpshooter, Grass River, Comras, we -- as Don mentioned, have built a substantial market presence within a short period of time. We couldn't be more excited about this market and how it we'll benefit our overall portfolio through inevitable cycles.
Now turning to guidance for 2015. We have tightened and increased the midpoint of our previously provided range to 529 to 533 or 7.5% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. This updated guidance generally reflects the strength of our opening at Assembly Row where, as Don mentioned, many of our tenants are now paying additional percentage rent. As well importantly as continued strength in our core where our team has been doing an excellent job managing rollover and leasing additional space.
We expect to continue to see robust cash rollover growth for the balance of the year, well above historical average. While we will also see some lag in same-store NOI in the second half of 2015 due to tenant rollover and higher term fees that we realized last year. Even with these timing issues, we expect same-store NOI to average 3.5% to 4% including redevelopments for the entire year.
Some of the larger timing assumptions that have been factored into our guidance and that will impact the balance of this year as well as 2016 include approximately $80 million of office space in Pike & Rose and Assembly, that is being delivered this year. We now have leases and LOIs on over 95% of that space. Based on the deals in place, we expect these tenants to take occupancy through mid-2016 and based on free rent periods to be fully paying rent in 2017. The retail and Assembly Row at 97% leased and 95% occupied as of the end of the second quarter, with the last few tenants taking occupancy in the latter part of this year. The retail is fully leased to Pike & Rose is over 90% of that space now open, including iPic, Del Frisco's, Summer House, City Sport and Sport & Health. The balance of this retail space will continue to open over the next 6 months. 
Pallas, the 319-unit high-rise, which represents approximately $110 million of investment has opened and is expected to lease up over the next 18 months. Given that timing, we expect it to be a drag to NOI this year and early next as it reaches stabilization at the end of 2016. And finally, from a timing perspective, The Point redevelopment in Plaza El Segundo, which represents approximately $85 million of investment, opened last week, extremely well and is projected to stabilize through mid-2016.
Again, as we look forward, we remain confident in our plan to continue to generate 7% to 9% growth even as we invest for the long term on both sides of our balance sheet. While we have not yet provided guidance for 2016, which we will do next quarter, we would nonetheless expect to remain in that range.
Finally, we all look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day on September 30. We expect to show up our first day at Pike & Rose, which will now be a -- and also to tour Bethesda Row and show opportunities for additional investment at one of our first mixed-use property. We also will provide folks with the opportunity to meet our broader management team responsible for the execution of our plan as well as meet members of our Board of Directors.

So that was a real unmet need in the trade area and I think we've done a nice job of filling in. In terms of the connectivity, yes, the railroad tracks are never going away. But we've got a couple of ideas that we're working on with the city of El Segundo right now to make the connectivity better, and I think we'll achieve those ideas and work through everything with the city in the next few months. And the connection between the collection in particular and The Point will improve. It's not super pedestrian friendly right now, but really it's only a 2- or 3-minute walk from the front of the collection to the main Sepulveda entry point at The Point. So it's really not that bad, but we can improve it."

It's a pleasure to be able to report you today, we've had a very strong quarter for Federal all the way around our business. Strong FFO growth, strong same-store growth, strong lease rollover,",1528,"Well, thank you, Brittany Schmelz, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be able to report you today, we've had a very strong quarter for Federal all the way around our business. Strong FFO growth, strong same-store growth, strong lease rollover, strong occupancy, strong development deliveries and more acquisitions in Greater Miami. Not to mention an 8% dividend raised from $0.87 a quarter to $0.94 for 48th consecutive year of increased dividends, great quarter.
Now let's start with earnings. FFO per share of $1.33, excluding, of course, the prepayment premium this year on the retirement of $200 million of senior notes, was 8% higher than the $1.23 earned in last year's quarter as the first phase of the development project began to contribute and the core continues to power along.
I'd single out higher-than-anticipated percentage rent at Assembly Row, a nice residential rent growth in Santana Row is especially encouraging. This is really good news, because as we've discussed previously, we're very consciously investing in our team with higher long-term incentives and deeper bench strength to be sure or as sure as we can that we're well prepared to execute and deliver on a business plan and a doubling NOI in the next decade. Hence, part of the reason for the G&A increase in the quarter. This is a very balanced approach for growing our business, and it's not a quarter-by-quarter business plan.
On the leasing side, nearly 300,000 feet of comparable deals were executed in the quarter, at average rent of $30.41, 15% above the $26.36 the prior tenant was paying. The leasing strength was broad with both new deals and renewals registering double-digit growth within all 3 operating platforms of our company: West Coast, the core and the mixed-use portfolios.
As an example, we're thrilled to do our first deal with Macy's in the form of their first Macy's Backstage retail stores, their value-based concept opening this month at our Melville shopping center on Long Island. In addition, we saw strong renewals at newly acquired San Antonio Center in Mountain View, California, and at the Village of Shrilington in Arlington, Virginia in the health club and theater categories. Both come with significant upgrades to their facilities, a clear trend that we're seeing in the theater business in particular as competition from newer, more service-oriented companies gain traction. 
Same-store growth in the quarter was strong at 3% without the impacts of -- impact of redevelopments and 4.8%, with lease termination fees were comparable in both periods.
The redevelopment impact really benefited from a great job at Mercer Mall in New Jersey. Nordstrom Rack, Lemonpop, REI all opened and there's  more to come. Before-and-after pictures of Mercer Mall really reflect our core redevelopment competency. It's a transformed asset. 
Willow Lawn in Richmond is similarly on its way to transformation to a far more relevant retail center. Occupancy jumped in the quarter to 94.9%, while the percentage lease climbed to 95.7%. Both up a bit compared with last year and the first quarter on a strong leasing momentum. As you can see, this was a really strong operating quarter.
Now let's move on to report some development news. First, in Somerville. Assembly Row continues to mature beautifully with most restaurants and retailers meeting or exceeding their first year projections. We've clearly struck a chord in the community and are providing a need that wasn't being met. Percentage rent is above our expectations and the office building is basically fully spoken for with virtually all available space occupied or under signed lease or LOI. The Partners' construction is right on or maybe a bit ahead of schedule and occupancy by Partners' employees is expected to begin next summer. That building is huge and really does wonders adding scale and perspective to the entire site. Check it out on any trip to Boston. It's impressive.
Our own construction on Phase 2 is just now getting underway, and we'll start to deliver in 2017. Future of the Assembly Row section of Somerville is extremely bright, and there'll be incremental investment opportunities here for at least the next 6 or 7 years as we fully build out. 400 miles south sits Pike & Rose in North Bethesda, Maryland and there too, lots of construction, lots of progress to report.
Let's start with the residential lease commencement at the Pallas high-rise build. 36 leases signed, 11% of the building in the first couple of months at rents at or above our pro forma with the first sets of move-ins underway. That's a good start. The new parking garage will open next month as scheduled and provide an additional 550-plus sorely-needed spaces. Virtually all available office space in the first phase is now either occupied or under signed lease or LOI. More progress. 
As the second phase gets underway, we have signed leases or LOIs with some great anchors early in the process that should give you a feel for the direction we're going. Pinstripes, the 30,000-square-foot bowling and entertainment concept, will anchor the end of the street. REI will relocate from a mile away to anchor Rockville Pike and newly formed Rose Avenue in 38,000 square feet.
And we're close to a deal with H&M to take 25,000 feet on 2 levels at one of the best corners in the project. Plenty more leasing in the works with some terrific names as we begin construction on the second phase that is so necessary to create the critical mass that this site needs. Deliveries and store openings in this phase begin in 2017.
Frankly, I can't wait to show the project off a bit at our planned Investor Day there on September 30. I hope most of your are planning to attend. While there will still be plenty of construction on the interior upper floors of Pallas along with some exterior trim to finish up, not to mention the second phase, which will be well underway at that point, it won't be hard to see why we're still bullish about the very significant value being created here now and well into the future.
Meanwhile, on the West Coast. The first dozen or so tenants opened last week at The Point to capacity  crowds. The Point, being our 150,000 square foot addition to the Plaza El Segundo shopping complex in El Segundo, California. Thank you, by the way, the West Coast folks on the phone who e-mailed over the weekend with kind words after visiting The Point. It really means a lot. 80% of that space is leased or fully executed -- are under, fully executed LOIs. And we'll be opening tenants throughout the rest of the summer and fall in what we know will be a favorite gathering and shopping destination for the areas; underserved communities like Manhattan, Hermosa and Redondo Beach.
Tenants like True Food Kitchen, Lucky Jeans, Madewell, Athleta, Mendocino Farms, and SoulCycle all around a really large and attractive park-like public space should give you the feel of what we are creating here. Significant value creation day one that will get better and better for years to come.
And perhaps the newest thing to talk about on this call is our well-studied commitment to South Miami. We reported on the CocoWalk acquisition with our local partners, Grass River, on last quarter's call, and since that time we've closed on several Coconut Grove's street retail building in close proximity to CocoWalk in order to make our presence more impactful. In addition, we've locked up a larger retail and mixed-use project just a few miles away, also with local partners Grass River with due diligence largely complete and a closing date expected in the next few weeks.
Jim will talk more about that to the extent we can in his remarks. 
My point is -- my point in talking about is this. We will have gone from a nonplayer in South Miami a few months ago to a very significant landlord controlling hundreds of thousands of square feet in 6 months time. Roughly $200 million of initial acquisition capital at a tight but reasonable yield at first, 5% plus, while we worked hard to figure out a significant repositioning and redevelopment plan that could hopefully allow us to deploy as much as an additional $150 million to $250 million in those assets over the next 5 years. It's, in effect, a yielding land play. I'm hopeful and confident that our work and our experience on the likes of Bethesda Row, Assembly Row, Pike & Rose, Santana Row, The Point, so many smaller examples over the past 20 years put us in a unique position to be able to do just that. But if not, we still have great real estate and a very protected downside.
As you can see, there's a lot going on, on all facets of our business plan. We remain on track to double our income in the next decade, as we've talked about many times in the past couple of years. So far, so good.
Let me now turn it over to Jim Taylor for additional guidance and explanation, and then we'll open up the lines to your questions."
271305,304769611,858258,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2015",2015-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Thank you, Don. And good morning, everyone. As Don highlighted in his remarks, our results this quarter not only set a new record for the Trust in terms of FFO per share, they further demonstrate the continued successful execution of our long-term plan. A",1271,"Thank you, Don. And good morning, everyone. As Don highlighted in his remarks, our results this quarter not only set a new record for the Trust in terms of FFO per share, they further demonstrate the continued successful execution of our long-term plan. A plan that drove the 48th consecutive annual increase in our dividend of 8%. I will provide some additional color on our quarterly results, our balance sheet activity, acquisitions and our outlook for the balance of the year.
Overall property operating income grew at 9.2% year-over-year. As usual, the largest single driver of that growth was our operating portfolio, which grew at 4.8% on a same-store basis including redevelopment and 3% excluding. With cash from releasing spreads this quarter at 15% on deals that will take occupancy in the future, we believe that we remain on track to continue to deliver sustainable growth.
Importantly, as highlighted in our supplement, we continue to successfully deliver upon our redevelopment pipeline. As Don noted, most notably, this quarter stabilizing redevelopments that will align in Mercer Mall. In addition, our initial phases of Pike & Rose and Assembly contributed approximately $3.5 million of POI during the quarter.
Finally, in this quarter, we benefited from the successful integration of our acquisitions of San Antonio Center in Mountain View, California as well as CocoWalk in Coconut Grove, Florida. As previously discussed, these assets are not only accretive in the near term, they will present compelling redevelopment opportunities given their infill location. 
Our G&A increased approximately $1.2 million year-over-year due primarily to transaction costs associated with the closing of CocoWalk as well as higher personnel cost, Don mentioned as we continue to invest in our platform for growth. As discussed last quarter, even with this incremental investment in our platform, we expect our G&A to remain at about 5% of revenue.
Interest expense grew slightly during the quarter due to lower cap interests as we deliver parts of the first phases of Assembly and Pike & Rose, which was offset by lower rates as we continue to bring down our weighted average interest rate, which today stands at about 4.3%.
Bottom line, FFO per share grew at 8.1%, in line with our long-term plan at 7% to 9% even as we continue to invest in the future. As many of you have heard us say at conferences and one-on-one meetings, we could generate higher absolute growth were we to scale back on that investment and perhaps lever up a bit, but that is a cyclical plan only. This quarter's 48th consecutive annual dividend increase, a track record that is older than many of us on this call, guides our relentless focus on predictable sustainable growth.
Turning to the balance sheet. Early in the quarter, we redeemed $200 million of our 2017 6.2% notes with the proceeds of a 30-year debt issuance at 4.18%. Importantly, we extended our weighted average tenure to 10 years, which as we look forward, provides us with maximum flexibility to access the most opportunistic parts of the yield curve, long or short, and still retain the longest weighted average tenure in the shopping center sector.
At quarter end, we had approximately $100 million drawn under our revolver, leaving us with more than enough liquidity to fund the growth we have underway.
On the acquisition front, we've successfully integrated the CocoWalk asset during the quarter and have identified near-term upside while we execute on our longer-term plan for the asset. In addition, we closed on the acquisition of interest in 7 retail assets fronting the primary shopping streets within the growth, providing us additional opportunity to capitalize on the positive rental rate trends within the resurging Grove District.
Finally, as Don mentioned, we placed another approximately $110 million asset under contract within the broader trade area, which like CocoWalk, benefits from a phenomenal infill location and also presents an opportunity to create significant value through developments to serve the affluent and dense population that surrounds it. More to come on net assets soon. 
With our strategic focus on this Miami-Dade market and our partnership with local sharpshooter, Grass River, Comras, we -- as Don mentioned, have built a substantial market presence within a short period of time. We couldn't be more excited about this market and how it will benefit our overall portfolio through inevitable cycles.
Now turning to guidance for 2015. We have tightened and increased the midpoint of our previously provided range to 529 to 533 or 7.5% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. This updated guidance generally reflects the strength of our opening at Assembly Row where, as Don mentioned, many of our tenants are now paying additional percentage rent. As well importantly is continued strength in our core where our team has been doing an excellent job managing rollover and leasing additional space.
We expect to continue to see robust cash rollover growth for the balance of the year, well above historical average, while we will also see some lag in same-store NOI in the second half of 2015 due to tenant rollover and higher term fees that we realized last year. Even with these timing issues, we expect same-store NOI to average 3.5% to 4% including redevelopment for the entire year.
Some of the larger timing assumptions that have been factored into our guidance and that will impact the balance of this year as well as 2016 include approximately $80 million of office space at Pike & Rose and Assembly, that is being delivered this year. We now have leases and LOIs on over 95% of that space. Based on the deals in place, we expect these tenants to take occupancy through mid-2016 and based on free rent periods, to be fully paying rent in 2017. The retail at Assembly Row is 97% leased and 95% occupied as of the end of the second quarter, with the last few tenants taking occupancy in the latter part of this year. The retail is fully leased to Pike & Rose with over 90% of that space now open, including iPic, Del Frisco's, Summer House, City Sport and Sport & Health. The balance of this retail space will continue to open over the next 6 months. 
Pallas, the 319-unit high-rise, which represents approximately $110 million of investment has opened and is expected to lease up over the next 18 months. Given that timing, we expect it to be a drag to NOI this year and early next as it reaches stabilization at the end of 2016. And finally, from a timing perspective, The Point redevelopment in Plaza El Segundo, which represents approximately $85 million of investment, opened last week, extremely well and is projected to stabilize through mid-2016.
Again, as we look forward, we remain confident in our plan to continue to generate 7% to 9% growth even as we invest for the long term on both sides of our balance sheet. While we have not yet provided guidance for 2016, which we will do next quarter, we would nonetheless expect to remain in that range.
Finally, we all look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day on September 30. We expect to show off our first day at Pike & Rose, which will now be a -- and also to tour Bethesda Row and show opportunities for additional investment at one of our first mixed-use property. We also will provide folks with the opportunity to meet our broader management team responsible for the execution of our plan as well as meet members of our Board of Directors.
With that, operator, I'd like to turn the call over to questions."

Well, as you know from being out there, that we have a sectional plaza at El Segundo called The Collection, which is about 50,000 square feet of lifestyle that does very, very well. So thinking about the merchandising strategy for The Point, we wanted to build on that success and continue to fill an unmet need for additional lifestyle retail in that trade area, which we've done and we're doing. We have 25,000 square feet of restaurant space at The Point. We view that whole market is really underserved for better dining options and also for a collection of restaurants meeting at some place kind of like Santana Row or you can come and park the car and meet your friends and figure out where you're going to go once you get there. Pretty much every other restaurant opportunity in that market is what I will call, point and shoot, meaning you get into your car, you go to the restaurant, you get into your car and you will leave. So that was a real unmet need in the trade area and I think we've done a nice job of filling in. In terms of the connectivity, yes, the railroad tracks are never going away. But we've got a couple of ideas that we're working on with the city of El Segundo right now to make the connectivity better, and I think we'll achieve those ideas and work through everything with the city in the next few months. And the connection between the Collection in particular and The Point will improve. It's not super pedestrian friendly right now, but really it's only a 2- or 3-minute walk from the front of the Collection to the main Sepulveda entry point at The Point. So it's really not that bad, but we can improve it."

And it's got a lot of people, like all those markets that we're in, who live there, who do well living there and they need their place for their families and their life. That's what we're doing in Coconut Grove. That's what we're doing in that whole area. That's why we're making this incremental investment in total.

When we're talking here about South Miami, which is the most recent one we can talk through here, there was no question that having a local partner who truly knows better than we do, the specific ins and outs and dynamics of the marketplace, the leasing person who is involved with that partnership is the best in the marketplace. So we're getting additional expertise there that in that particular case, we thought was really important to the whole risk reward balance. Now clearly by doing that, we've got another seat at the table. Clearly by doing that, partnerships add complexity.

So we had a big important quarter for the company here with FFO per share of $1.36, result higher than we ever reported before, 10.6% higher than last year's third quarter. It starts on the top line with overall revenue growth of 8.4%, which flows nicely down overall property level operating income, growth of 8.7%. Somewhat higher G&A from additional personnel and down below the operating line, the strength of our balance sheet paid huge dividends in the form of lower interest costs. If you sit back and you pause for a minute and really reflect on the components of that third quarter P&L, you'll start to recognize that the 5 main sources of our growth all contribute here, creating what we think is the most balanced and durable set of financial results in the business. Consider that in this third quarter, there were contributions from; number one, the big developments that Assembly and Pike and Rose, which added nearly $4 million more rent than last year's quarter; two, after redevelopments, especially shopping center in New Jersey, Westgate Center in San Jose, the Peterson building in Hollywood, which along with others resulted in overall same-store growth including redevelopment of 4.2%; third, same-store growth in the core, excluding redevelopment, which were only 2% was a result of a aggressive towards to get back space for redevelopment along with a tough year over year comp caused by lower termination and other fees this year. Four, acquisition like CocoWalk and San Antonio Center, which contributed an incremental $2.4 million in rent over last year and most importantly, number five, a balance sheet track record that results one of the lowest cost of debt and equity capital among REITs that really provide a level of P&L flexibility that's enviable. As an aside, our entire debt portfolio with an average maturity over 10 years from now as a weighted average interest rate of 4.07%. So my for now, I know I'm going to be made fun for this, but it really fits here. The ballplayer player, it would be referred to a 5-tool player. 5-tool players are baseball scout lingo for a complete baseball player. One with superior arm strength, speed, offensive abilities and those who can hit for average and hit for power. is considered one of the best 5-tool players of all time. And that's what we're humbly trying to mimic, complete players. It's the completeness of the business plan. We are not dependent on any one tool that we're most proud of, and that was so evident during the third quarter. Think about that. Even with 2% same-store growth, FFO per share grew over 10% in the quarter and is expected to be over 7% for the year. Again, running this entity with so many arrows in our quiver, it gives us great flexibility to be able to take the longer view, a view required to maximize real estate value. I will talk a little more about this, because I think it's really important to any investors decision to own Federal. When we broke the company up between core and mixed-use earlier in the year and brought in additional real estate talent to lead the core, Jeff Michael Linson, Jarett Parker, Liz Ryan and others, which caused higher level of G&A by the way. We did so in order to ensure that the all-important core portfolio got the attention and aggressive asset management that it deserves to create more value and to continue to act as a strongest possible foundation to the development and acquisition pipeline. In that means getting control of space that has long hindered value-creation in certain shopping centers. The A&P bankruptcy led a strike. We have 4. One, A&P, one Pathmark and 2 Wal-marts between New Jersey and Long Island. All 4 leases has significant value, not just us, but to multiple parties. And if we chose to not participate in the bankruptcy process, I'm quite confident that all 4 leases would have been bought by someone, which would have resulted in 0 downtime and 0 lost rent in any of those spaces. Had our business plan were one-dimensional, we might have let that happen. But we didn't. Nearly a 185,000 feet of space and over $3 million of same-store occupancy and rent went out the door. And by the way, we had to pay millions of dollars to get the rent to lose all that income beginning this month. We have taken an educated and calculated gamble that 6 million-dollar-plus investment, plus a year or more of downtime. We would pay back many times over, not in terms of the 4 walls of those grocery stores, which is how a lot of people look at the leases value. But for us, by unlocking more significant redevelopments that improve the entire shopping centers. While same-store growth and occupancy will be negatively impacted in the fourth quarter and certainly for next year, the future value of Brick Plaza and Wall Township, New Jersey, Troy shopping center in New Jersey and Melville Mall on Long Island will be far higher when we're done releasing and redeveloping. I don't know if could have made that decision if same-store growth and year-end occupancy where the only considerations. And yet, we could, because of our FFO per share growth is still expected to be 7%-plus in 2015 and we strive to hit FFO per share growth of 7% in 2016. 
Okay. Let's back up and talk about leasing for a moment. 478,000 feet of comparable deals executed in the quarter at an average rent of 2,698, 19% higher than the 2,269 per foot prior tenant was the leasing strength was brought with those new deals and renewals registering double-digit growth as did both anchor and small shop leases. In addition, 19 noncomparable deals done, largely on the new developments, representing an additional 800,000 square feet of space. So over 560,000 square feet of deals in a 3-month period, there is plenty of productive leasing being done these days in virtually all markets that we do business in. That's an important point to focus on at this point lead time, as we assess the sustainability of the strong retail leasing market. We are betting that demand for solid retail real estate remains that way due primarily to the limited amount of great real estate locations that are available. Most good stuff is pretty well leased out. You can see it in the occupancies of most high-quality portfolios. Heres a slide that represents a particularly good opportunity. We're going to consciously take it the other way for a while. As I mentioned earlier, we're aggressively tasking our core team to go hard after space occupied by underperforming retailers, in part, because we want use these favorable economic conditions to release them now. We expect to have more anchor vacancies to attack in the next few quarters than we have had in years. The A&P supermarket, as I discussed, are only 1 example. Fitness is former Valley's location and our Grant Park Shopping Center in Arlington, Virginia is another example, or getting close to a redevelopment plan that makes financial sense at that center that requires us to get that and adjacent space back in order to control enough of the shopping center to be able to execute the redevelopment. Of course, it's downtime and lost rent in the meantime. The Hudson trail closure resulting from that company's bankruptcy at Montrose Crossing, that many of you remembered from the Investor Day, is another that can give us just the flexibility we've been looking for at that end of the shopping center. Of course, it's downtime and lost rent in the meantime. But basically, because of our big developments beginning to contribute, our developments already in process, acquisitions like CocoWalk and Sunset Place and a low leverage of balance sheet with a favorable cost of capital, we believe that the inherent balance in the plan will continue to allow us to grow earnings at roughly 7% annually, which is necessarily for us to double earnings over 10 years of foundational goals of our company. So far so good. 
And when it comes to those acquisitions and developments, man, we have a lot going on. From continued advancement of the construction and leasing at both Pike & Rose and Assembly, so the opening of the Point development in El Segundo to critical acclaim this quarter. To the largest office deal that we've done with data mining technology powerhouse Splunk at 500 Santana row, which by the way will create an immediate $75 million-or-so of value. So the closing on October 1, a previously referenced Sunset Place in South Miami, we've got more going on to keep our five growth buckets fully productive than ever before. 
Let me give you a few more updates on those big projects and then I'll turn it over to Jim. At Pike & Rose, we had a strong quarter in terms of residential leasing, and by the way, I thank many of you for joining us there for the Investor Day about a month ago. As we reported in the past per se, which is this 174 unit first residential building of a project is and remains 95% leased up, and you remember that leasing began on high-rise building called Pallas over the summer. We currently 100 of the 319 units in that building leased, that's faster than we anticipated and it rents and in line is our performance. The update isn't as positive on the construction site as cost overruns largely on and around the façade and the skin of the high-rise buildings, both material cost and labors with will overrun by approximately $10 million. Accordingly, we reflected but still expect to complete Pallas lease up as scheduled, throughout 2016. Construction is underway on the second phase. And Assembly, construction on the Partners Healthcare Complex is proceeding very well, and we're hopeful that many of the 4000-plus employees expected at that location will begin occupying the space by the midyear 2016. The balance of the second phase of Assembly row is now underway also. 
Turning to 500 Santana row, in addition to the strong financial return from the Splunk deal, that return brace of trust, we're really excited that the incremental daytime office traffic and the added and complementary parking that is surrounding out Santana row. With Apple's new headquarters being built just 4 miles down the road, and the Splunk deal signed at Santana, the rest of the build out at the balance of Santana row as well as the 12 acres across the street, we call Santana West, will be lower risk and more valuable. Construction remains on time and on schedule for 2017 rent start in Splunk building. 
And finally, in South Miami, they deal that we've been referring to all year, finally closed on October 1, and I trust you've all seen the detail in the acquisition press release. The demographics surrounding of this 10 acres that make up Sunset Place are among the strongest in our portfolio and we're actively looking at redevelopment and remerchandising plans and schemes. I'm going to resist talking about those redevelopment plans and schemes in those possibilities until we're confident what it is that we can do. But in the meantime, we should is yield above 6% on nearly $100 million investment for 85% before our interest cost. That's it from my prepared remarks. I'll turn it over to Jim, and I look forward to your questions afterwards."

As Don alluded to, this quarter represented yet another record for us at $1.36 per share, and just pausing on FFO for a moment, I would like at the outset to recognize the contribution of the entire federal team",1541,"Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. As Don alluded to, this quarter represented yet another record for us at $1.36 per share, and just pausing on FFO for a moment, I would like at the outset to recognize the contribution of the entire federal team from leasing, operations, development and investments. Many of them you got to meet at our Investor Day last month, who delivered these outstanding results. 
Turning to the numbers. Overall POI grew at 8.7% over the prior year, in line with our long-term plan. The largest single driver of that growth was our core portfolio, which grew at 4.2% on a same-store basis including redevelopment. Given the volume of properties that we have under redevelopment, that pool represents approximately 95% of our total POI. Our same-store pool, excluding redevelopment activity, which is a smaller percentage grew at 2%. We realized about 70 basis points of drag from year-over-year differences in term fees and certain onetime fees. Other drags on same-store POI growth, which began to show this quarter and will accelerate as Don alluded to and I will cover in guidance, associated with rollout contributed another 30 basis points of drag. When you consider the strong rollover that we're achieving from a leasing perspective, which was 19% on a cash basis and has averaged 17% over the last four quarters, this timing lag or downtime is as we release this space in a very strong market. The balance of POI growth was driven by development deliveries, collectively Pike & Rose and Assembly contributed approximately $3.5 million of POI this quarter. And the successful integration of the San Antonio Center and CocoWalk acquisitions, both of which are performing very well against our initial acquisition underwriting. G&A increased to $1 million year-over-year largely due to higher personnel costs and placement fees, as we invest in our platform for growth. Again, we'll cover in guidance, but we expect our G&A margin to remain below 5% of revenue. Interest expense declined $1.7 million due primarily to the reduction in the weighted average interest rate from 4.7% to 4.1%, which was offset by a lower interest capitalization, as we continue to deliver development. Bottom line, FFO per share grew 10.6% in the quarter, followed by the long-term plan. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We opportunistically accessed the debt market in late September, capitalizing on favorable pricing dynamics as the 5-year part of the curve and issued $250 million of 2.55% senior notes and at all-time spread for us at 110 basis points. This issuance moved our weighted average tenure beyond 10 years versus the peer average closer to 5. We utilized the proceeds to term out borrowings under the line of credit, which are full capacity of $600 million at quarter end, providing more than enough liquidity to fund the growth that we have underway. Our debt-to-EBITDA remains strong at 5.25x and our fixed charge coverage improved to 4.5x. On the acquisition front, as Don alluded to, we successfully closed on October 1 on the acquisition of Sunset Place are the total price of $110 million. As we discussed of our Investor Day, we're pleased that within the last 6 months, we've successfully deployed almost $200 million of capital into 2 in field assets in coconut Grove and South Miami. These 2 assets not only provide an attractive current yield in a 6% range, importantly, that present great upside potential for redevelopment and repositioning to better serve the affluent and population to South Miami days. 
Looking at the balance of 2015, we've increased our FFO guidance range to 530 to 533. This range is based on our expectation that we will achieve same-store NOI for the full year of 3.5%, which reflects the downside Don mentioned, for approximately 184,000 square feet on the 3 ANB location as well as an additional 60,000 square feet of box space associated with Hudson trail and City Sports that were taking over this quarter. Assuming our leasing was static, which never is, that would represent about 120 basis points of occupancy. Thus we expect our same-store NOI to be low in the fourth quarter. 
Looking ahead to 2016, this is another big year for the company in terms of NAV creation. For somebody who has to provide guidance, it doesn't make it easy, but the level of activity just blows me away. First, as Dan alluded to, we expect to complete the lease up of the 319 unit Pallas high rise of Pike & Rose, initial leasing as Don alluded to is going well, and we expect that building to stabilize in the fourth quarter of 2016. We will experience some drag through early 2016 as the building achieves breakeven occupancy. The office space at both Assembly row and Pike & Rose, which represents approximately $80 million of investment is fully committed, and we'll continue to see rent commencing through 2016 and early 2017 as those tenants take occupancy. 500 Santana row, our 234,000 square foot office building, which represents approximately $120 million of investment, is a 100% pre-leased and we'll deliver in 2016 and rent commence in 2017. The point redevelopment of Plaza El Segundo, which opened successfully this quarter with strong tenant performance will stabilize in the latter half of 2016. In addition to the 500 Santana row, this is important, we approximately $85 million of tactical redevelopment stabilizing over the next 5 quarters. The partners building at Assembly row, as Don alluded to, will deliver with over 4500 employees taking occupancy in the latter part of 2016. We will grand open Saks OFF 5th in our old headquarters basement space in addition to stabilizing the storage residential building. We will be well underway on the second phase as the Pike & Rose and Assembly that represent another $600 million of investment and we'll begin delivering in 2017 and 2018. And finally, as we've covered in some detail, we'll be re-leasing the L.A. Fitness and A&P and other boxes in our core portfolio that we have recaptured this year. We expect our 2016 FFO per share to be in the range of 565% to 575%, or approximately 7% growth at midpoint. That growth of 7% remains at the top of the estimates for our peer group, none of whom have yet provided 2016 guidance. It's consistent with our long-term plan and reflects some critical investments in future value creation and consistent growth that we discussed at length at our Investor Day. Those investments include a balance sheet with weighted average debt tenor of over 10 years. That's the market of 21%, that importantly, provides us maximum flexibility to fund our long-term value creation at the lowest positive capital. Downtown, associated with the targeted and recapture of the A&P and LAF in 2016, represents approximately $5 million or almost $0.07 a share on 100 basis points of same-store NOI. That target box recapture is on top of an additional $6 million or almost $0.08 a share of downtime associated with the rollover of larger box basis in our portfolio. To provide some overall context, the average downtime in our same-store portfolio associated with all rollover in the last 5 years, has been an average about $10 million to $11 million of impact. There that downtime impact in 2016 is approximately $17 million. Thus importantly, as Don alluded to, we are investing in NAV creation, while our near-term same-store NOI is expected to be in the 3% to 3.5% range for the year. Approximately $2.5 million of incremental marketing spend that we're investing to ensure that the critical first phases of our mixed-use developments opened successfully as well as starting the market the condos that we deliver in the second phases of the Assembly and Pike & Rose. As I discussed at our Investor Day, these new urban this cost center becomes a potential revenue opportunity. Over 1 million of redevelopment R&D as we continue to fill our pipeline of redevelopment -- excuse redevelopment id as we continue to fill our redevelopment pipeline. We expense these costs until the projects are profitable. As Don mentioned, our core team is actively engaged in executing upon these and identifying new opportunities for the future. And then finally, higher G&A that we expect to be approximately 34% to $35 million, as we invest in growing the team, but we'll always stay disciplined as we maintain the G&A margin among the lowest in our peer group. As always, our guidance for next year does not include any acquisitions or dispositions that are not already closed. However we do expect the net remain active on both fronts and will update guidance as those transactions occur. We have covered a lot. But before I turn it back to the operator to open the line, let me thank all of you would in the Investor Day last month. Your turnout was terrific, we've had great feedback and as always, greatly appreciated the opportunity to connect with our owners and analysts. We look forward to seeing many of you again in a week or so at NAREIT, the extent you haven't reserved the spot of the calendar, please do so soon.

And they would have been no different investment decision made. It takes 7 years from beginning to end to do this. You never going get. Sometimes you get lucky and you are in the peak of the part of cycle, where the residential rents are higher, sometimes the opposite. But you wouldn't have made a different decision. In terms of the cost, I feel differently about that. I mean, we've got cost overruns on that high-rise in particular, that I wish we didn't have. That is value that is gone. So it's a different type of thing. Do I think that's a mixed-use thing? No. I don't. I think that's a screw up. On that particular design implementation and construction project.

There is a lot of focus on these brands and/or for the companies for that different platforms to grow. And so when you think about to what it means to Federal, when you look at our high-quality of assets, surrounded by the best-in-class demographics, they very much have an interest in it. So the 3 locations, the A&P's that we have there, there is interest from groceries and all of those locations. In addition to that, there is interest with other players that are out there. We talked at the Investor Day about the soft goods categories looking for growth, whether that's Macy's, HBCs, fifth concepts, we have demand and some of the category killers that are out there, the pet categories, the shoe categories, the cosmetic categories.

So we're clearly -- you may see some groceries backfilling some of the portions of what those boxes were. But we're looking at all opportunities. And fortunately for us, we've got the demand from different categories. Don, you want to take it from there?"

And that business is struggling in parts of it, just like women's fashion is struggling, just like goods are trying to figure themselves out, just like banks are trying to figure how to impact how to reach retail customers. Every industry, the grocery business too. It does come down to having the right place, where their demand will exceed supply and to extent that demand can be beyond grocers the better. Having said that, it's real clear to us, that particularly, in at least 2 of the 4 and probably more of the A&P boxes, they are great grocery locations. So we do believe, there'll be negotiations with better grocers for those boxes. In addition, as Chris says, a wider plethora of retailers."

So we had a big important quarter for the company here with FFO per share of $1.36, a result higher than we've ever reported before, 10.6% higher than last year's third quarter. It starts on the top l",1955,"Well, thank you, Brittany, and good morning, everyone. So we had a big important quarter for the company here with FFO per share of $1.36, a result higher than we've ever reported before, 10.6% higher than last year's third quarter. It starts on the top line with overall revenue growth of 8.4%, which flows nicely down overall property level operating income, growth of 8.7%. Somewhat higher G&A from additional personnel and down below the operating line, the strength of our balance sheet pays huge dividends in the form of lower interest costs. 
If you sit back and you pause for a minute and really reflect on the components of the third quarter P&L, you'll start to recognize that the 5 main sources of our growth all contribute here, creating what we think is the most balanced and durable set of financial results from the business. Consider that in this third quarter, there were contributions from; number one, the big developments at Assembly and Pike & Rose, which added nearly $4 million more rent than last year's quarter; two, after redevelopments, especially Mercer Shopping Center in New Jersey, Westgate Center in San Jose, the Petersen building in Hollywood, which along with others resulted in overall same-store growth including redevelopment of 4.2%; third, same-store growth from the core, excluding redevelopment, which were only 2% was a result of a purposeful and aggressive push to get back space for redevelopment along with a tough year-over-year comp caused by lower termination and other fees this year; four, acquisitions like CocoWalk and San Antonio Center, which contributed an incremental $2.4 million in rent over last year; and most importantly, number five, a balance sheet and track record that results in one of the lowest cost of debt and equity capital among REITs that really provide a level of P&L flexibility that's enviable. 
As an aside, our entire debt portfolio with an average maturity over 10 years from now has a weighted average interest rate of 4.07%. So excuse my baseball analogy, I know I'm going to be made fun for this, but it really fits here. If Federal were a baseball player, it would be referred to as a 5-tool player. 5-tool players are baseball scout lingo for a complete baseball player. One with superior arm strength, speed, defensive abilities and those who can hit for average and hit for power. Wllie Mays is considered one of the best 5-tool players of all time. And that's what we are humbly trying to mimic, complete players. It's the completeness of the business plan. We're not dependent on any one tool that we're most proud of, and that was so evident during the third quarter. 
Think about that. Even with 2% same-store growth, FFO per share grew over 10% in the quarter and is expected to be over 7% for the year. Again, running this entity with so many arrows in our quiver, it gives us great flexibility to be able to take the longer view, a view required to maximize real estate value. I want to talk a little more about this because I think it's really important to any investor's decision to own Federal. When we broke the company up between core and mixed-use earlier in the year and brought in additional real estate talent to lead the core:  Jeff Mooallem, Michael Linson, Jarett Parker, Liz Ryan and others, which caused higher level of G&A by the way. We did so in order to ensure that the all-important core portfolio got the attention and aggressive asset management that it deserves to create more value and to continue to act as the strongest powerful possible foundation to the development and acquisition pipeline. 
In part, that means getting control of space that has long hindered value-creation at certain shopping centers. The A&P bankruptcy led a strike. We have 4: 1 A&P, 1 Pathmark and 2 Waldbaums between New Jersey and Long Island. All 4 leases have significant value, not just to us, but to multiple parties. And if we chose to not participate in the bankruptcy process, I am quite confident that all 4 leases would have been bought by someone, which would have resulted in 0 downtime and 0 lost rent in any of those spaces. And if our business plan were one-dimensional, we might have let that happen. But we didn't. 
Nearly 185,000 feet of space and over $3 million of same-store occupancy and rent went out the door. And by the way, we had to pay millions of dollars to get the right to lose all that income beginning this month. We've taken an educated and calculated gamble that, that $6 million-plus investment, plus 1 year or more of downtime, would pay back many times over, not only in terms of the 4 walls of those grocery stores, which is how a lot of people look at the leases' value, but for us, by unlocking more significant redevelopments that improve the entire shopping centers. While same-store growth and occupancy will be negatively impacted in the fourth quarter and certainly for next year, the future value of Brick Plaza and Wall Township, New Jersey, Troy Shopping Center in Parsippany, New Jersey and Melville Mall on Long Island will be far higher when we're done releasing and redeveloping. 
I don't know if we could have made that decision if same-store growth and year-end occupancy where the only considerations. And yet we could, because our FFO per share growth is still expected to be 7%-plus in 2015 and we strive to hit FFO per share growth of 7% in 2016. 
Okay. Let's back up and talk about leasing for a minute. 478,000 feet of comparable deals executed in the quarter at an average rent of $26.98, 19% higher than the $22.69 per foot prior tenant was paying. The leasing strength was brought with both new deals and renewals registering double-digit growth as did both anchor and small shop leases. In addition, 19 noncomparable deals done, largely on the new developments, representing an additional 82,000 square feet of space. So over 560,000 square feet of deals in a 3-month period. There is plenty of productive leasing being done these days in virtually all markets that we do business in. 
And that's an important point to focus on at this particular time, as we assess the sustainability of the strong retail leasing market. We're betting that demand for solid retail real estate remains that way due primarily to the limited amount of great real estate locations that are available. Most good stuff is pretty well leased up. You can see it in the occupancies of most high-quality portfolios. Here's why that represents a particularly good opportunity. We're going to consciously take it the other way for a while. As I mentioned earlier, we're aggressively tasking our core team to go hard after space occupied by underperforming retailers, in part, because we want to use these favorable economic conditions to release them now. We expect to have more anchor vacancies to attack in the next few quarters than we've had in years. 
The A&P supermarket I've discussed are only 1 example. L.A. Fitness's former Valley location and our Grant Park Shopping Center in Arlington, Virginia is another example. We're getting pretty close to a redevelopment plan that makes financial sense at that center that requires us to get that, an adjacent space back in order to control enough of the shopping center to be able to execute the redevelopment. Of course, it's downtime and lost rent in the meantime. The Hudson Trail closure resulting from that company's bankruptcy at Montrose Crossing, that many of you remembered from the Investor Day, is another that could give us just the flexibility we've been looking for at that end of the shopping center. Of course, it's downtime and lost rent in the meantime. But basically, because of our big developments beginning to contribute, our redevelopments already in process, acquisitions like CocoWalk and Sunset Place and a low leverage of balance sheet with a favorable cost of capital, we believe that the inherent balance in the plan will continue to allow us to grow earnings at roughly 7% annually, which is necessarily for us to double earnings over 10 years, a foundation goal of our company. So far so good. 
And when it comes to those acquisitions and developments, man, we have a lot going on: from continued advancement of the construction and leasing at both Pike & Rose and Assembly; to the opening of the Point development in El Segundo to critical acclaim this quarter; to the largest office deal that we've ever done with data mining technology powerhouse Splunk at 500 Santana row, which by the way will create an immediate $75 million-or-so of value; to the closing on October 1 of previously referenced Sunset Place in South Miami; we've got more going on to keep our 5 growth buckets fully productive than ever before. 
Let me give you a few more updates on those big projects and then I'll turn it over to Jim. At Pike & Rose, we had a strong quarter in terms of residential leasing, and by the way, I want to thank many of you for joining us there for the Investor Day about a month ago. As we've reported in the past per se, which is this 174-unit first residential building of a project is and remains 95% leased up, and you'll remember that leasing began on a high-rise building called Pallas over the summer. We currently already have 100 of the 319 units in that building leased. That's faster than we anticipated at rents in line with our pro formas. 
The update isn't as positive on the construction site as cost overruns largely on and around the façade and the skin of the high-rise building, both material cost and labors, will overrun by approximately $10 million. Accordingly, we reflected that in the 8-K but still expect to complete Pallas lease up as scheduled, throughout 2016. Construction is underway on the second phase. 
At Assembly, construction on the Partners Healthcare Complex is proceeding very well. We're hopeful that many of the 4,000-plus employees expected at that location will begin occupying the space by midyear 2016. The balance of the second phase of Assembly Row is now underway also. 
Turning to 500 Santana row. In addition to the strong financial return from the Splunk deal that, that return brings to Trust, we're really excited at the incremental daytime office traffic and the added and complementary parking that it adds surrounding out Santana Row. With Apple's new headquarters being built just 4 miles down the road, and the Splunk deal signed at Santana, the rest of the buildout at the balance of Santana Row, as well as the 12 acres across the street that we call Santana West, will be lower risk and more valuable. Construction remains on time and on schedule for 2017 rent starts in Splunk building. 
And finally, in South Miami, the deal that we've been referring to all year finally closed on October 1, and I trust you've all seen the detail in the acquisition press release. The demographics surrounding these 10 acres that make up Sunset Place are among the strongest in our portfolio and we're actively looking at redevelopment and remerchandising plans and schemes. I'm going to resist talking about those redevelopment plans and schemes and those possibilities until we're confident what it is that we can do, but in the meantime, we should yield above 6% on nearly $100 million investment for 85% before interest cost. That's it from my prepared remarks. I'll turn it over to Jim, and I look forward to your questions afterwards."

As Don alluded to, this quarter represented yet another record for us at $1.36 per share. And just pausing on FFO for a moment, I'd like, at the outset, to recognize the contribution of the entire Federal team from leasing, operations, development and investments. Many of them you've got to meet at our Investor Day last month, who've delivered these outstanding results. 
Turning to the numbers. Overall POI grew at 8.7% over the prior year, in line with our long-term plan. The largest single driver of that growth was our core portfolio, which grew at 4.2% on a same-store basis including redevelopment. Given the volume of properties that we have under redevelopment, that pool represents approximately 95% of our total POI. Our same-store pool, excluding redevelopment activity, which is a smaller percentage grew at 2%. We realized about 70 basis points of drag from year-over-year differences in term fees and certain onetime fees. Other drags on same-store POI growth, which began to show this quarter and will accelerate, as Don alluded to, and I'll cover in guidance, associated with rollover, contributed another 30 basis points of drag. 
When you consider the strong rollover that we are achieving from a leasing perspective, which was 19% on a cash basis and has averaged 17% over the last four quarters, this timing lag or downtime is very opportune as we release the space in a very strong market. The balance of POI growth was driven by development deliveries, collectively, Pike & Rose and Assembly contributed approximately $3.5 million of POI this quarter. And the successful integration of the San Antonio Center and CocoWalk acquisitions, both of which are performing very well against our initial acquisition underwriting. 
G&A increased $1 million year-over-year largely due to higher personnel costs and placement fees, as we invest in our platform for growth. Again, we will cover it in guidance but we expect our G&A margin to remain below 5% of revenue. Interest expense declined $1.7 million due primarily to the reduction in our weighted average interest rate from 4.7% to 4.1%, which was offset by lower interest capitalization as we continue to deliver development. Bottom line, FFO per share grew at 10.6% in the quarter, followed by long-term plan. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We opportunistically accessed the debt markets in late September, capitalizing on favorable pricing dynamics as the 5-year part of the curve and issued $250 million of 2.55% senior notes at an all-time low spread for us of 110 basis points. This issuance moved our weighted average tenure beyond 10 years versus the peer average closer to 5. We utilized the proceeds to term out borrowings under our line of credit, which add full capacity of $600 million at quarter end, providing more than enough liquidity to fund the growth that we have underway. Our debt-to-EBITDA remains strong at 5.25x and our fixed charge coverage improved to 4.5x. 
On the acquisition front, as Don alluded to, we successfully closed on October 1 on the acquisition of Sunset Place for a total price of $110 million. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we are pleased that within the last 6 months, we have successfully deployed almost $200 million of capital into 2 in-field assets in Coconut Grove and South Miami. These 2 assets not only provide an attractive current yield in a 6% range, importantly, they present great upside potential for redevelopment and repositioning to better serve the affluent and year-out population of South Miami Bay. 
Looking at the balance of 2015, we've increased our FFO guidance range to $5.30 to $5.33. This range is based on our expectation that we will achieve same-store NOI for the full year of 3.5%, which reflects the downtime Don mentioned for approximately 184,000 square feet on the 3 A&P locations, as well as an additional 60,000 square feet of box space associated with Hudson Trail and City Sports that we are taking over this quarter. 
Assuming our leasing was static, which it never is, that would represent about 120 basis points of occupancy. Thus, we expect our same-store NOI to be low in the fourth quarter. 
Looking ahead to 2016, this is another big year for the company in terms of NAV creation. For somebody who has to provide guidance, it doesn't make it easy, but the level of activity just blows me away. First, as Dan alluded to, we expect to complete the lease up of the 319 unit Pallas high rise at Pike & Rose, initial leasing as Don alluded to is going well and we expect that building to stabilize in the fourth quarter of 2016. We will experience some drag through early 2016 as the building achieves breakeven occupancy. The office space at both Assembly row and Pike & Rose, which represents approximately $80 million of investment is fully committed, and we will continue to see rent commencing through 2016 and early 2017 as those tenants take occupancy. 
500 Santana Row. Our 234,000 square foot office building, which represents approximately $120 million of investment, is a 100% pre-leased and we'll deliver in 2016 and rent commence in 2017. The Point redevelopment of Plaza El Segundo, which opened successfully this quarter with strong tenant performance will stabilize in the latter half of 2016. In addition to The Point and 500 Santana Row, this is important, we have approximately $85 million of tactical redevelopment stabilizing over the next 5 quarters. The Partners building at Assembly row, as Don alluded to, will deliver with over 4,500 employees taking occupancy in the latter part of '16. 
We will grand open Saks OFF 5TH in our old headquarters basement space at Congressional in addition to stabilizing the storage residential building. We will be well underway on the second phase of the Pike & Rose and Assembly that represent another $600 million of investment and we'll begin delivering in 2017 and 2018. And finally, as we've covered in some detail, we'll be re-leasing the L.A. Fitness and A&P and other boxes in our core portfolio that we've recaptured this year. 
We expect our 2016 FFO per share to be in the range of $5.65 to $5.71 per share or approximately 7% growth at the midpoint. That growth of 7% remains at the top of the estimates for our peer group, none of whom have yet provided 2016 guidance. It's consistent with our long-term plan and reflects critical investments and future value creation and consistent growth that we discussed at length at our Investor Day. Those investments include: a balance sheet with a weighted average debt tenure of over 10 years, that's the market cap of 21% that, importantly, provides us maximum flexibility to fund our long-term value creation at the lowest cost of capital; downtime, associated with the targeted recapture of the A&P and LAF in 2016, represents approximately $5 million or almost $0.07 a share or 100 basis points of same-store NOI. That targeted box recapture is on top of an additional $6 million or almost $0.08 a share of downtime associated with the rollover of larger box basis in our portfolio. 
To provide some overall context, the average downtime in our same-store portfolio associated with all rollover in the last 5 years, has been on average about $10 million to $11 million of impact. That downtime impact in 2016 is approximately $17 million. Thus importantly, as Don alluded to, we are investing in NAV creation, while our near-term same-store NOI is expected to be in the 3% to 3.5% range for the year. Approximately $2.5 million of incremental marketing spend that we're investing to ensure that the critical first phases of our mixed-use developments opened successfully as well as starting to market the condos that will deliver in the second phases of the Assembly and Pike & Rose. 
As I discussed at our Investor Day, as this new urban neighborhood successfully this cost center becomes a potential revenue opportunity. Over 1 million of redevelopment R&D as we continue to fill our pipeline of redevelopment -- excuse me, redevelopment R&D as we continue to fill our redevelopment pipeline. We expense these costs until the projects are profitable. As Don mentioned, our core team is actively engaged in executing upon these and identifying new opportunities for the future. And then finally, higher G&A that we expect to be approximately $34 million to $35 million, as we invest in growing the team but we'll always stay disciplined as we maintain the G&A margin among the lowest in our peer group. 
As always, our guidance for next year does not include any acquisitions or dispositions that are not already closed. However we do expect to remain active on both fronts and we'll update guidance as those transactions occur. 
We have covered a lot. But before I turn it back to the operator to open the line, let me thank all of you who attended the Investor Day last month. Your turnout was terrific, we've had great feedback and as always, greatly appreciated the opportunity to connect with our owners and analysts. We look forward to seeing many of you again in a week or so at NAREIT. To the extent that you haven't reserved a spot on the calendar, please do so soon. And with that, Operator, I'd like to turn it over for questions."

I was hoping it wasn't the first question. Listen, I do want to talk about Sunset Place a little bit. Look, you may have heard that the former owner of Sunset Place, Simon Property Group, is pretty darn good at what they do. The -- if it were an easy fix and there was an easy way to create a lot of value in 12 months or something else like that, they would have done it. So I don't want to talk about that just yet. There's  a lot of complexity with it. Basically, when you look at the going in yield, and the going in price, we basically said, all right, there's enough cushion based on what that location is and what you have to pay for a perfect asset. There's enough cushion over that to give us the opportunity, give us the time to take the chance, to see if we can find a better merchandising scheme or better physical plant, see if we can make the numbers, make some sense and which includes -- which will include a new entitlement process, et cetera. So that will take, it will take a couple of years. It will take some time. And so I don't want to get out ahead -- I don't really want to have anything in your mind. I'd love you to just kind of take it for what it is. And when we start talking about a way to create value that we see, pay for it then. Give us credit for it then, but at this point I'm really not ready to do that, Craig."

This year it's going to be over 17%. So it gives you a sense of the scale and scope of the drag on what we're getting after. Just A&P and LAF alone, from an occupancy standpoint, would be approximately 180 bps of occupancy, just those are pretty meaningful. Again, nothing is static. Chris and team continue to be very active on the leasing front. But even if we get that space leased, as you understand, it will take some time before that rent commences. So that's what we're forecasting for '16."

Not to mention 50 additional units -- residential units on the back of the shopping center. So this is all tied in. That's not specific to LAF or to A&P.

It's probably 25% over the last 3 years, or something like that. I don't know how many competitors have that. But I do think that's because of all the tools we have. So when you take the other ways we have to grow, coupled with what we believe about the particular anchor boxes that we are purposely trying to upgrade the tenancy on and upgrade the shopping centers on, this seems like the right time to do it aggressively. And by the way, we are paying -- we are paying more G&A for more individuals who have smaller portfolios from which to create value.

When you are talking about largely residential, you are talking about 12-month leases. And we had board meeting down in Miami yesterday, and I was talking the board about this. The reality is that -- and I don't mean to say this in a cavalier way, I don't mean to come across that way, but so what? To the extent we missed the rents in a 12-month lease on a residential product to start because of more supply in the market, because of whatever economic conditions that there are, 12 months from then, we'll have another chance. 12 months from then we'll have another chance at that. And there would have been no different investment decision made. It takes 7 years from beginning to end to do this. You're never going get -- sometimes you get lucky and you're in the peak of the part of the cycle where the residential rents are higher, sometimes the opposite. But you wouldn't have made a different decision. In terms of the cost, I feel differently about that. I mean, we've got cost overruns on that high-rise in particular, that I wish we didn't have. That's value that is gone. So it's a different type of thing. Do I think that's a mixed-use thing? No, I don't. I think that's a screw up. On that particular design implementation and construction project. So I wouldn't take that and extrapolate that all along. When you're talking about retail deals, where we're dealing with much longer-term leases in terms of that office, you're certainly talking about much longer-term leases. So I view them a little differently."

We're seeing for -- again, I think about our portfolio, I mean you look more macro on a macro basis, there is certain -- there is demand. We're seeing it certainly in our assets, and I think there are some of the larger companies that are out there whether it's Ahold looking at a small store concept to get more urban-located, whether it's Kroger trying to figure out of way to grow its shares to its footprint, differentiated brands a little bit more, or Whole Foods working on the 365. There is a lot of focus on these brands and/or the companies figuring out different platforms to grow. And so when you then think about that to what it means to Federal, when you look at our high-quality of assets, surrounded by the best-in-class demographics, they very much have an interest in it. So the 3 locations, the A&Ps that we have, there is interest from groceries in all of those locations. In addition to that, there's interest with other players that are out there. We talked at the Investor Day about the soft goods categories looking for growth, whether that's Macy's, Nordstrom Rack, HBC's Saks OFF 5TH concepts, we have demand in some of the category killers that are out there, the pet categories, the shoe categories, the cosmetic categories. All of these players are looking for growth opportunities. And with a limited amount of new supply that's entered the market, opportunistically with a great piece of real estate, Federal Realty certainly takes advantage of that demand that's out there. So we're clearly -- you may see some groceries backfilling some of the portions of what those A&P boxes were, but we're looking at all opportunities. And fortunately for us, we've got the demand from different categories. Don, you want to take it from there?"

Every category is impacted. And groceries are no different. It's funny. It's why, a long time ago I just did not want to be seen as a grocery anchored shopping center company. The idea of being open, I mean when you listen to Chris Weilminster speak, you can tell that his view of the retail world is not grocery centric. And that business is struggling in parts of it, just like women's fashion is struggling, just like hardware [ph] goods are trying to figure themselves out, just like banks are trying to figure out how to impact -- it's a rich retail customers,  every industry and the grocery business too. It does come down to having the right place, where demand will exceed supply and to the extent that demand can be beyond groceries, the better. Having said that, it's real clear to us, that particularly in at least 2 of the 4 and probably more of the A&P boxes, they are great grocery locations. So we do believe, there'll be negotiations with better groceries for those boxes. In addition, as Chris says, a wider plethora of retailers."

So we had a big important quarter for the company here with FFO per share of $1.36, a result higher than we've ever reported before, and 10.6% higher than last year's third quarter. It starts on the t",1963,"Well, thank you, Brittany, and good morning, everyone. So we had a big important quarter for the company here with FFO per share of $1.36, a result higher than we've ever reported before, and 10.6% higher than last year's third quarter. It starts on the top line with overall revenue growth of 8.4%, which flows nicely down overall property level operating income growth of 8.7%. Somewhat higher G&A from additional personnel. And down below the operating line, the strength of our balance sheet pays huge dividends in the form of lower interest costs. 
If you sit back and you pause for a minute and really reflect on the components of that third quarter P&L, you'll start to recognize that the 5 main sources of our growth all contribute here, creating what we think is the most balanced and durable set of financial results in the business. Consider that in this third quarter, there were contributions from; number one, the big developments at Assembly and Pike & Rose, which added nearly $4 million more rent than last year's quarter; two, active redevelopments, especially Mercer Shopping Center in New Jersey, Westgate Center in San Jose, the Petersen building in Hollywood, which along with others resulted in overall same-store growth including redevelopment of 4.2%; third, same-store growth from the core, excluding redevelopment, which were only 2%, was a result of a purposeful and aggressive push to get back space for redevelopment, along with a tough year-over-year comp caused by lower termination and other fees this year; four, acquisitions like CocoWalk and San Antonio Center, which contributed an incremental $2.4 million in rent over last year; and most importantly, number five, a balance sheet and track record that results in one of the lowest costs of debt and equity capital among REITs that really provides a level of P&L flexibility that's enviable. 
As an aside, our entire debt portfolio with an average maturity over 10 years from now has a weighted average interest rate of 4.07%. 
So excuse my baseball analogy, I know I'm going to be made fun of for this, but it really fits here. If Federal were a baseball player, it would be referred to as a 5-tool player. 5-tool players are baseball scout's lingo for a complete baseball player. One with superior arm strength, speed, defensive abilities and those who can hit for average and hit for power. Willie Mays is considered one of the best 5-tool players of all time. And that's what we are humbly trying to mimic, complete players. It's the completeness of the business plan. We're not dependent on any one tool that we're most proud of, and that was so evident during the third quarter. 
Think about that. Even with 2% same-store growth, FFO per share grew over 10% in the quarter and is expected to be over 7% for the year. Again, running this entity with so many arrows in our quiver, it gives us great flexibility to be able to take the longer view, a view required to maximize real estate value. 
I want to talk a little more about this, because I think it's really important to any investor's decision to own Federal. When we broke the company up between core and mixed-use earlier in the year and brought in additional real estate talent to lead the core: Jeff Mooallem, Michael Linson, Jarett Parker, Liz Ryan and others -- which caused higher level of G&A by the way -- we did so in order to ensure that the all-important core portfolio got the attention and aggressive asset management that it deserves to create more value and to continue to act as the strongest possible foundation to the development and acquisition pipeline. 
In part, that means getting control of space that has long hindered value-creation at certain shopping centers. The A&P bankruptcy let us strike. We have 4: 1 A&P, 1 Pathmark and 2 Waldbaums between New Jersey and Long Island. All 4 leases have significant value, not just to us, but to multiple parties. And if we chose to not participate in the bankruptcy process, I am quite confident that all 4 leases would have been bought by someone, which would have resulted in 0 downtime and 0 lost rent in any of those spaces. And if our business plan were one-dimensional, we might have let that happen. But we didn't. 
Nearly 185,000 feet of space and over $3 million of same-store occupancy and rent went out the door. And by the way, we had to pay millions of dollars to get the right to lose all that income beginning this month. 
We've taken an educated and calculated gamble that, that $6 million-plus investment, plus 1 year or more of downtime, would pay back many times over, not only in terms of the 4 walls of those grocery stores, which is how a lot of people look at the leases' value. But for us, by unlocking more significant redevelopment that improved the entire shopping centers. While same-store growth and occupancy will be negatively impacted in the fourth quarter and certainly for next year, the future value of Brick Plaza in Wall Township, New Jersey, Troy Shopping Center in Parsippany, New Jersey and Melville Mall on Long Island will be far higher when we're done releasing and redeveloping. 
I don't know if we could have made that decision if same-store growth and year-end occupancy were the only considerations. And yet we could, because our FFO per share growth is still expected to be 7%-plus in 2015, and we strive to hit FFO per share growth of 7% in 2016. 
Okay. Let's back up and talk about leasing for a minute. 478,000 feet of comparable deals executed in the quarter at an average rent of $26.98, 19% higher than the $22.69 per foot the prior tenant was paying. The leasing strength was brought with both new deals and renewals registering double-digit growth, as did both anchor and small shop leases. In addition, 19 noncomparable deals done, largely on the new developments, representing an additional 82,000 square feet of space. So over 560,000 square feet of deals in a 3-month period. There is plenty of productive leasing being done these days in virtually all markets that we do business in. 
And that's an important point to focus on at this particular time, as we assess the sustainability of this strong retail leasing market. We're betting that demand for solid retail real estate remains that way due primarily to the limited amount of great real estate locations that are available. Most good stuff is pretty well leased up. You can see it in the occupancies of most high-quality portfolios. Here's why that represents a particularly good opportunity. We're going to consciously take it the other way for a while. As I mentioned earlier, we're aggressively tasking our core team to go hard after space occupied by underperforming retailers, in part, because we want to use these favorable economic conditions to re-lease them now. We expect to have more anchor vacancies to attack in the next few quarters than we've had in years. 
The A&P supermarkets I discussed are only one example. L.A. Fitness's former Bally's location in our Graham Park Shopping Center in Arlington, Virginia, is another example. We're getting pretty close to a redevelopment plan that makes financial sense at that center that requires us to get that and adjacent space back in order to control enough of the shopping center to be able to execute the redevelopment. Of course, it's downtime and lost rent in the meantime. 
The Hudson Trail closure resulting from that company's bankruptcy at Montrose Crossing, that many of you remembered from the Investor Day, is another that could give us just the flexibility we've been looking for at that end of the shopping center. Of course, it's downtime and lost rent in the meantime. 
But basically, because of our big developments beginning to contribute, our redevelopments already in process, acquisitions like CocoWalk and Sunset Place and a low leveraged balance sheet with a favorable cost of capital, we believe that the inherent balance in the plan will continue to allow us to grow earnings at roughly 7% annually, which is necessarily for us to double earnings over 10 years, a foundational goal of our company. So far so good. 
And when it comes to those acquisitions and developments, man, we have a lot going on. From continued advancement of the construction and leasing at both Pike & Rose and Assembly; to the opening of The Point development in El Segundo to critical acclaim this quarter; to the largest office deal that we've ever done with data mining technology powerhouse Splunk at 500 Santana Row, which by the way will create an immediate $75 million-or-so of value; to the closing on October 1 of previously referenced Sunset Place in South Miami; we've got more going on to keep our 5 growth buckets fully productive than ever before. 
Let me give you a few more updates on those big projects, and then I'll turn it over to Jim. At Pike & Rose, we had a strong quarter in terms of residential leasing, and by the way, I want to thank many of you for joining us there for the Investor Day about a month ago. As we've reported in the past, PerSei, which is this 174-unit first residential building of the project, is and remains 95% leased up. And you'll remember that leasing began on a high-rise building we call Pallas over the summer. We currently already have 100 of the 319 units in that building leased. That's faster than we anticipated at rents in line with our pro formas. 
The update isn't as positive on the construction side as cost overruns largely on and around the façade and the skin of the high-rise building, both material cost and labor, will overrun by approximately $10 million. Accordingly, we reflected that in the 8-K, but still expect to complete Pallas lease up as scheduled, throughout 2016. Construction is underway on the second phase. 
At Assembly, construction on the Partners HealthCare Complex is proceeding very well. We're hopeful that many of the 4,000-plus employees expected at that location will begin occupying the space by midyear 2016. The balance of the second phase of Assembly Row is now underway also. 
Turning to 500 Santana Row. In addition to the strong financial return from the Splunk deal that, that return brings to Trust, we're really excited to have the incremental daytime office traffic and the added and complementary parking that it adds to rounding out Santana Row. With Apple's new headquarters being built just 4 miles down the road, and the Splunk deal signed at Santana, the rest of the buildout at the balance of Santana Row, as well as the 12 acres across the street that we call Santana West, will be lower risk and more valuable. Construction remains on time and on schedule for a 2017 rent start in Splunk building. 
And finally, in South Miami, the deal that we've been referring to all year finally closed on October 1, and I trust you've all seen the detail in the acquisition press release. The demographics surrounding this 10 acres that make up Sunset Place are among the strongest in our portfolio, and we're actively looking at redevelopment and remerchandising plans and schemes. I'm going to resist talking about those redevelopment plans and schemes and those possibilities until we're confident in what it is that we can do. But in the meantime, we should yield above 6% on our nearly $100 million investment for 85% before interest costs. 
That's it from my prepared remarks. I'll turn it over to Jim, and I look forward to your questions afterwards."
271305,314623238,900235,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2015",2015-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. As Don alluded to, this quarter represented yet another record for us at $1.36 per share. And just pausing on FFO for a moment, I'd like, at the outset, to recognize the contribution of the entire Federal team f",1559,"Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. As Don alluded to, this quarter represented yet another record for us at $1.36 per share. And just pausing on FFO for a moment, I'd like, at the outset, to recognize the contribution of the entire Federal team from leasing, operations, development and investments, many of whom you got to meet at our Investor Day last month, who've delivered these outstanding results. 
Turning to the numbers. Overall POI grew at 8.7% over the prior year, in line with our long-term plan. The largest single driver of that growth was our core portfolio, which grew at 4.2% on a same-store basis, including redevelopment. Given the volume of properties that we have under redevelopment, that pool represents approximately 95% of our total POI. Our same-store pool, excluding redevelopment activity, which is a smaller percentage, grew at 2%. We realized about 70 basis points of drag from year-over-year differences in term fees and certain onetime fees. Other drags on same-store POI growth, which began to show this quarter and will accelerate, as Don alluded to, and I'll cover in guidance, associated with rollover, contributed another 30 basis points of drag. 
When you consider the strong rollover that we are achieving from a leasing perspective, which was 19% on a cash basis and has averaged 17% over the last four quarters, this timing lag or downtime is very opportune as we re-lease this space in a very strong market. The balance of POI growth was driven by development deliveries. Collectively, Pike & Rose and Assembly contributed approximately $3.5 million of POI this quarter. And the successful integration of the San Antonio Center and CocoWalk acquisitions, both of which are performing very well against our initial acquisition underwriting. 
G&A increased $1 million year-over-year largely due to higher personnel costs and placement fees, as we invest in our platform for growth. Again, we will cover it in guidance, but we expect our G&A margin to remain below 5% of revenue. Interest expense declined $1.7 million due primarily to the reduction in our weighted average interest rate from 4.7% to 4.1%, which was offset by lower interest capitalization as we continue to deliver development. Bottom line, FFO per share grew at 10.6% in the quarter, followed by the long-term plan. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We opportunistically accessed the debt markets in late September, capitalizing on favorable pricing dynamics at the 5-year part of the curve and issued $250 million of 2.55% senior notes at an all-time low spread for us of 110 basis points. This issuance moved our weighted average tenure beyond 10 years, versus the peer average closer to 5. We utilized the proceeds to term out borrowings under our line of credit, which had full capacity of $600 million at quarter end, providing more than enough liquidity to fund the growth that we have underway. Our debt-to-EBITDA remains strong at 5.25x, and our fixed charge coverage improved to 4.5x. 
On the acquisition front, as Don alluded to, we successfully closed on October 1 on the acquisition of Sunset Place for a total price of $110 million. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we are pleased that within the last 6 months, we have successfully deployed almost $200 million of capital into 2 in-fill assets in Coconut Grove and South Miami. These 2 assets not only provide an attractive current yield in the 6% range, importantly, they present great upside potential through redevelopment and repositioning to better serve the affluent and year-round populations of South Miami-Dade. 
Looking at the balance of 2015, we've increased our FFO guidance range to $5.30 to $5.33. This range is based on our expectation that we will achieve same-store NOI for the full year of 3.5%, which reflects the downtime Don mentioned for approximately 184,000 square feet on the 3 A&P locations, as well as an additional 60,000 square feet of box space associated with Hudson Trail and City Sports that we are taking over this quarter. 
Assuming our leasing was static, which it never is, that would represent about 120 basis points of occupancy. Thus, we expect our same-store NOI to be low in the fourth quarter. 
Looking ahead to 2016, this is another big year for the company in terms of NAV creation. For somebody who has to provide guidance, it doesn't make it easy, but the level of activity just blows me away. 
First, as Don alluded to, we expect to complete the lease up of the 319 unit Pallas high rise at Pike & Rose. Initial leasing as Don alluded to is going well, and we expect that building to stabilize in the fourth quarter of 2016. We will experience some drag through early 2016 as the building achieves breakeven occupancy. The office space at both Assembly Row and Pike & Rose, which represents approximately $80 million of investment, is fully committed. And we will continue to see rent commencing through 2016 and early 2017, as those tenants take occupancy. 
500 Santana Row. Our 234,000 square foot office building, which represents approximately $120 million of investment, is 100% pre-leased and we'll deliver in 2016 and rent commence in 2017. 
The Point redevelopment at Plaza El Segundo, which opened successfully this quarter with strong tenant performance, will stabilize in the latter half of 2016. 
In addition to The Point and 500 Santana Row, this is important, we have approximately $85 million of tactical redevelopment stabilizing over the next 5 quarters. The Partners building at Assembly Row, as Don alluded to, will deliver with over 4,500 employees taking occupancy in the latter part of '16. 
We will grand open Saks OFF 5th in our old headquarters basement space at Congressional, in addition to stabilizing The Stories residential building. We will be well underway on the second phases at Pike & Rose and Assembly that represent another $600 million of investment, and we'll begin delivering in 2017 and 2018. And finally, as we've covered in some detail, we'll be re-leasing the L.A. Fitness and A&P and other boxes in our core portfolio that we've recaptured this year. 
We expect our 2016 FFO per share to be in the range of $5.65 to $5.71 per share or approximately 7% growth at the midpoint. That growth of 7% remains at the top of the estimates for our peer group, none of whom have yet provided 2016 guidance. It's consistent with our long-term plan and reflects some critical investments in future value creation and consistent growth that we discussed at length at our Investor Day. Those investments include: a balance sheet with a weighted average debt tenure of over 10 years; debt-to-market cap of 21% that, importantly, provides us maximum flexibility to fund our long-term value creation at the lowest cost of capital; downtime associated with the targeted recapture of the A&P and LAF in 2016 represents approximately $5 million or almost $0.07 a share or 100 basis points of same-store NOI. That targeted box recapture is on top of an additional $6 million or almost $0.08 a share of downtime associated with the rollover of larger box spaces in our portfolio. 
To provide some overall context, the average downtime in our same-store portfolio associated with all rollover in the last 5 years has been on average about $10 million to $11 million of impact. That downtime impact in 2016 is approximately $17 million. Thus importantly, as Don alluded to, we are investing in NAV creation, while our near-term same-store NOI is expected to be in the 3% to 3.5% range for the year. Approximately $2.5 million of incremental marketing spend that we're investing to ensure that the critical first phases of our mixed-use developments open successfully, as well as starting to market the condos that we'll deliver in the second phases of Assembly and Pike & Rose. 
As I discussed at our Investor Day, as these new urban neighborhoods successfully stabilize, this cost center becomes a potential revenue opportunity. Over 1 million of redevelopment R&D as we continue to fill our pipeline of redevelopment -- excuse me, redevelopment R&D as we continue to fill our redevelopment pipeline. We expense these costs until the projects are probable. As Don mentioned, our core team is actively engaged in executing upon these and identifying new opportunities for the future. And then finally, higher G&A that we expect to be approximately $34 million to $35 million, as we invest in growing the team. But we'll always stay disciplined as we maintain a G&A margin among the lowest in our peer group. 
As always, our guidance for the next year does not include any acquisitions or dispositions that have not already closed. However we do expect to remain active on both fronts, and we'll update guidance as those transactions occur. 
We have covered a lot. But before I turn it back to the operator to open the line, let me thank all of you who attended the Investor Day last month. Your turnout was terrific. We've had great feedback. And as always, greatly appreciated the opportunity to connect with our owners and analysts. We look forward to seeing many of you again in a week or so at NAREIT.

There's a lot of complexity with it. Basically, when you look at the going in yield, and the going in price, we basically said, all right, there's enough cushion based on what that location is and what you'd have to pay for a perfect asset. There's enough cushion over that to give us the opportunity, give us the time to take the chance, to see if we can find a better merchandising scheme, a better physical plant, see if we can make the numbers make some sense, and which include -- which will include a new entitlement process, et cetera.

But it's not only that we expect it to be -- to remain strong in terms of demand exceeding supply on the particular locations and in the particular boxes that we're talking about. But we have other ways to grow the company. And so on balance, I mean -- I'm not sure how many of the competitors that are out there are going to grow at 7% next year, or certainly, 7% this year, 7% next year, 7% 2 years ago, more. I mean, it's probably 25% over the last 3 years, something like that. I don't know how many competitors have that. And I do think that's because of all the tools we have. So when you take the other ways we have to grow, coupled with what we believe about the particular anchor boxes that we are purposely trying to upgrade the tenancy on and upgrade the shopping centers on, this seems like the right time to do it aggressively. And by the way, we are paying more G&A for more individuals who have smaller portfolios from which to create value. And so that better have more aggressive management of those particular anchor boxes. It all works together at this particular time, and that's our bet."

To the extent we missed the rents in a 12-month lease on a residential product to start, because of more supply in the market, because of whatever economic conditions that there are, 12 months from then, we'll have another chance. 12 months from then, we'll have another chance into that. And there would have been no different investment decision made. It takes 7 years from beginning to end to do this. You're never going get -- sometimes you get lucky, and you're hitting the peak of the part of the cycle where the residential rents are higher. Sometimes the opposite, but you wouldn't have made a different decision. In terms of the costs, I feel differently about that. I mean, we've got cost overruns on that high-rise in particular, that I wish we didn't have. That's value that is gone. So it's a different type of thing. Do I think that's a mixed-use thing? No, I don't. I think that's a screw up on that particular design implementation and construction project. So I wouldn't take that and extrapolate that all along. When you're talking about retail deals, where we're dealing with much longer-term leases and you're talking about office, you're certainly talking about much longer-term leases.

There is a lot of focus on these brands and/or the companies figuring out different platforms to grow. And so when you then think about that, to what it means to Federal, when you look at our high quality of assets, surrounded by the best-in-class demographics, they very much have an interest in it. So the 3 locations, the A&Ps that we have back, there's interest from grocers in all of those locations. In addition to that, there's interest with other players that are out there. We talked at the Investor Day about the soft goods categories looking for growth, whether that's Macy's, Nordstrom Rack, HBC's Saks OFF 5TH concepts. We have demand in some of the category killers that are out there, the pet categories, the shoe categories, the cosmetic categories. All of these players are looking for growth opportunities. And with the limited amount of new supply that's entered the market, opportunistically with a great piece of real estate, Federal Realty certainly takes advantage of that demand that's out there. So we're clearly -- you may see some groceries backfilling some of the portions of what those A&P boxes were, but we're looking at all opportunities.

Every category is impacted. And grocers are no different. It's funny. It's why a long time ago I just did not want to be seen as a grocery anchored shopping center company. The idea of being open -- I mean when you listen to Chris Weilminster speak, you can tell that his view of the retail world is not grocery centric. And as that business is struggling in parts of it, just like women's fashion is struggling, just like hard goods are trying to figure themselves out, just like banks are trying to figure out how to impact, to reach retail customers. Every industry is. The grocery business too. It does come down to having the right place, where demand will exceed supply. And to the extent that demand can be beyond grocers, the better. Having said that, it's real clear to us, that particularly in at least 2 of the 4 and probably more of the A&P boxes, they are great grocery locations. So we do believe, there'll be negotiations with better grocers for those boxes. In addition to, as Chris says, a wider plethora of retailers."

I'm sorry, I'm not in the room with Don. But I think one thing's important about these A&P leases, with Brick, Melville and Troy that everybody should understand, and Don's touching on it, but we inherited those leases. Those weren't leases that we had. And they were very much encumbered with restrictions on other categories and other uses that we know demand exists. So I just -- I want to make sure that in addition to everything Don is talking about, that you guys understand that this does unlever our ability to go after categories that we were not able to do. And when we renegotiate leases or when we find replacement tenants, we will maintain that flexibility, as well as hopefully future out-parcel development. I just -- I think it's really important. So it was not like getting it back to control the end destiny of the space. But it really does, and from a leasing standpoint, unlever our ability to really add value with more relevant retail, which is what we need to stay connected with our communities."

Just maybe one last question for Jim, just I know you've talked about sort of the difficulty in projecting out earnings, given the amount of development that's going on and sort of the timing of all that.

Just maybe one last question for Jim, just I know you've talked about sort of the difficulty in projecting out earnings, given the amount of development that's going on and sort of the timing of all that. And certainly that can shift here and there, but I was just curious, the guidance range that you provided is pretty tight. I think it's only about a 1% spread at the midpoint. Just curious what gives you the confidence to have it so tight, given the amount of new pieces [ph]."
