Welcome, and thank you for joining us for the fourth quarter 2014 Allegion earnings call. With me today is Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. 
Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we will refer to in today's call, are available on our website at www.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.
Please go to Slide #2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities law.
Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results.
The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
Our release and today's commentary include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude restructuring and spin expenses. Also included in these adjustments are the impacts related to a movement in measuring results in Venezuela from the official exchange rate of VEF 6.3 per U.S. dollar to using the Venezuelan government's SICAD II exchange rate of VEF 50 per U.S. dollar. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior year period. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release and the quarterly information in the appendix of today's presentation for further details. 
Also in the fourth quarter of 2014, the company changed its method of accounting so that all inventory is now based on first in, first out method from the last in, first out method. The financial statements for all periods have been revised for this change, and recast quarterly data has been provided in the appendix of today's presentation. The impact of this adjustment was favorable by $1.3 million or $0.01 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2013. The impact for the year ended December 31, 2014, was favorable by $0.4 million. As a result, our tax and inventory accounting are now on the same basis, and the company achieves global consistency with one inventory accounting treatment. 
Please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to Dave."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Allegion posted another strong quarter of organic growth, operating leverage and cash flow generation. Revenues were $573 million, up 5.5% on an adjusted basis versus last year and",1234,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
Allegion posted another strong quarter of organic growth, operating leverage and cash flow generation. Revenues were $573 million, up 5.5% on an adjusted basis versus last year and up 7.6% on an organic basis. 
The Americas region deliver strong organic growth of 8.4% with increases in all segments, and the timing of large system integration projects drove organic growth of 17% in the Asia-Pacific region. Organic revenues were relatively flat in Europe, reflecting ongoing market softness. 
Adjusted operating income of $106 million increased 9% versus last year, and adjusted operating margin increased 60 basis points for the company, reflecting solid operating leverage on the incremental volume and improved pricing. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.76 increased 26.7% versus the prior year. Patrick will cover the details later. 
We are issuing our full year 2015 EPS guidance of $2.65 to $2.75, an increase of 12% to 17% compared to adjusted 2014 EPS, excluding Venezuela. The guidance reflect overall organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%. 
Please go to Slide 4. Now that we've completed our first full year as a standalone public company, I'd like to take a moment to review our performance. First, it's hard to appreciate the amount of effort it takes to stand up a company. We are truly fortunate to have a strong team in Allegion that embraces the change necessary while ensuring we met our customer and shareholder commitments. 
And although you don't see it as a metric on this slide, one of our core values is to be safe and healthy, which we focus on every single day of the year. We finished 2014 with a lost time incident rate of less than 1%, 26 locations with 0 lost time days, 13 sites celebrated a million-hour milestone without lost time incidents. And in our Bogota facility, there was an 81% reduction in the number of injuries, resulting in 0 life -- lost time days in our first full year of ownership. 
Allegion is one of the safest companies in the world. I'm extremely proud of this. It's a true north metric of Allegion's manufacturing excellence and a commitment to safety. 
Last year at this time, I shared with you the 2014 financial goals of the company. We delivered revenue in the expected range with some incremental volume covering lower-than-expected price. I'm pleased with the top line performance of the business given the challenging market environments and currency headwinds. 
Adjusted earnings per share came in at the high end of our range, and taking into account the realization of our lower effective tax rate, we exceeded the high end of our original guidance by $0.09. Spin and restructuring expenses were within expected ranges, and we over delivered on available cash flow. It was a solid first year for Allegion, and I believe we are positioned well for 2015 and the long-term growth to deliver high shareholder returns. 
Please go to Slide 5. Globally, we hit the ground running in 2014 to secure large project customer wins for the Allegion portfolio. This slide reflects a sampling of some of the project wins in 2014. We continue to leverage our strong institutional knowledge with project wins in education and health care. 
We're proud to outfitted both an elementary school and middle school in Shanghai, China with Schlage locks as part of a safe campus initiative and to have our locks and accessories at the premier Sanford Medical Center in Fargo, North Dakota. It's exciting to also note that Allegion is pioneering safety and security for world-travel facilities like Levi's Stadium, which is the new home of the San Francisco 49ers as well as notable hotels and office spaces alike. 
Please go to Slide 6. Of course, our project wins are also highly reliant on our ability to innovate. And in 2014, it was a year of significant innovation investment. With Allegion's emphasis on electromechanical convergence, we launched both ENGAGE technology and Schlage touch. 
With ENGAGE technology, we're changing the way commercial building owners and tenants think about the interior building access. ENGAGE is a connectivity platform that is easy to install, manage and use. Our Schlage NDE series wireless lock with ENGAGE technology can be installed in minutes with a screwdriver, and they allow users to manage electronic credentials with cloud-based web and mobile apps. 
Schlage touch, which launched in October, aligns with the keyless era we've been pioneering for homeowners, give them the ability to unlock their doors using a stylish touchscreen pen pad. For residential, we've really emphasized not just the strength of our locks but the style and design. In 2014, we expanded our style options to offer more choices to our customers. We're now offering more design and finish options that support both modern and traditional taste. 
Allegion also expanded style options for high-end nonresidential and multifamily customers with the M collection series of levers for Schlage and Von Duprin. 
In our nonresidential mechanical product lines, we created more specialized applications for our customers. This includes the Von Duprin AX device, which was the first and currently only UL-certified exit device to meet the new California building code 5-pound operating force requirement; and the Von Duprin quiet electric watts for medical facilities, where both patients and caregivers value an environment free of excessive noise from traditional exit operations. 
Please go to Slide 7. As you've probably seen, Allegion recently launched Schlage Sense in January 2015 as an integral part of Schlage's leadership position in the Internet of Things. As an innovative extension of the keyless era, the residential lock comes with a mobile app that allows homeowners to manage it with their phones or with the lock's touchscreen pen pad. Specifically, it's designed to work with Apple's HomeKit technology, providing advanced security with end-to-end encryption and authentication between the Schlage sense lock and an iPhone, an iPad and an iTouch. HomeKit also lets consumers control their Schlage Sense lock with their voice using Siri. 
The Schlage Sense system can manage up to 30 codes at the same time. Its app allows homeowners to create and delete access codes, check on lock status and view activity. Residents can also use the app to update settings and check battery life without connecting to an existing home automation system or pay a monthly subscription charge. 
Schlage Sense launched at the Consumer Electronics Show and had over 300 million impressions in 1 week. Major news outlets applauded the innovation. Wired named it one of the 11 hot products from the show. FOX News named it as one of their top 8 list of the most innovative products there, and CNet praised the talk to unlock capability. 
With Schlage Sense, we're continuing to generate positive coverage for Allegion and expect the product to be available for our customers later this year. 
To help stay on the forefront of innovation and the growth of the Internet of Things, Allegion also recently made an equity investment in iDevices. iDevices, like Schlage, launched the next-generation Connected Home solution at the Consumer Electronics Show, and our partnership will amplify the impact of Schlage Sense on the market. As part of the minority stake in the company, Allegion and iDevices entered into a joint technology agreement. 
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to update our full year 2015 guidance."

Please go to Slide #8. This slide depicts the components of our revenue for both fourth quarter and full year. This is helpful as the impact of pricing in Venezuela and currency headwinds across the business drive",1613,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please go to Slide #8. This slide depicts the components of our revenue for both fourth quarter and full year. This is helpful as the impact of pricing in Venezuela and currency headwinds across the business drive quite a bit of noise in the results. 
If you focus on the organic growth, we delivered 7.6% and 5.1% growth for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. Both include 2% of price increase associated with Venezuela. The stronger organic growth reflects improving markets and introduction of new products. 
Pricing benefits have been mostly driven by Venezuela. However, we are seeing pricing improvement sequentially and expect to gain improved traction in the first half of 2015, particularly in our U.S. nonresidential business. 
One other thing to note is the currency line. We really started to see the impact of a weaker euro in the fourth quarter. Add in the impacts of a softer Canadian dollar, Chinese RMB and Australian dollar, and you will see a fourth quarter year-over-year impact of a negative 2.4%. 
Although the strong U.S. dollar will continue to create pressure on the bottom line, it is important to remember that most of our costs were in the same region with our revenues, which mitigate some of the income pressure. 
Please go to Slide #9. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $573.5 million. As mentioned on the previous slide, this reflects an increase of 5.5% versus the prior year, up 7.6% on an organic basis, inclusive of Venezuela pricing. We realized high single-digit growth in the Americas with growth in all segments of the market. U.S. commercial grew low single digits, and residential segments increased mid-single digits. Latin America was up significantly, primarily due to incremental price realization and Venezuela to offset inflation. 
EMEIA revenues were down approximately 10%, driven by currency headwind. Asia-Pacific revenues were up over 17% due to strong mechanical hardware and the timing of large system integration projects. 
Adjusted operating income of $106.6 million increased 9% compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin of 18.6% reflects an increase of 60 basis points versus the prior year as favorable price, volume leverage and productivity more than offset increased investments and inflation. 
We are extremely pleased with the incremental operating leverage of the business, particularly as we continue to make incremental growth investments for new products and channel development in order to accelerate our earnings growth and return on capital. 
Please go to Slide #10. This reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2013, reported EPS was $0.12 a share. Adjusting for prior year onetime separation and restructuring expenses of $0.04 and $0.44 related to discrete tax items, the 2013 reported EPS was $0.60. 
Operational results increased EPS by $0.13 as pricing, productivity and favorable operating leverage more than offset inflation. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate to 26.3% grow $0.07 per share improvement versus the prior year. Other net items added $0.04 primarily due to foreign exchange gains, offset by $0.01 of incremental interest expense. 
Next, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and M&A were a $0.07 reduction. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2014 EPS of $0.76 a share. 
Continuing on, we have a negative $0.39 per share reduction consisting of $0.08 for restructuring and spin-related expenses, $0.09 for the Venezuela devaluation charge to revalue monetary assets, $0.19 for noncash impairment charge to adjust Venezuelan inventory balances and $0.03 with extinguishment of capitalized debt costs related to the October amendment and extension of our senior credit facility. After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at the fourth quarter 2014 reported EPS of $0.37. 
Please go to Slide #11. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $390.8 million, up 8.4% on an adjusted basis. Removing the impact of Venezuela price increases, revenues were up 5.4% on an adjusted basis. 
Higher volumes, Venezuela pricing and the acquisition of Schlage Colombia in January 2014 offset unfavorable currency movement in Canada. Volumes improved in the nonresidential segment by low single digits led by the strength in mechanical and door businesses. U.S. residential growth in the mid-single digits was driven by strength in the builder and e-commerce segments. 
Revenues in Venezuela doubled year-over-year led primarily by price. Americas adjusted operating income of $100 million was up 13.3% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 110 basis points due to favorable volume leverage, price and productivity that more than offset inflation and ongoing investment in new product and channel development. 
Please go to Slide #12. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $103.5 million, down 10.3% and down 0.3% on an organic basis. Currency headwind continues to be a challenge in the region due to the softening euro and the Russian ruble, which impacts Eastern European sales. Market-driven weakness in hardware sales in France and Italy were mostly offset by strength in the interflex and hospitality businesses. 
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $11.6 million was down 13.4% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 11.2%, down 40 basis primarily due to unfavorable product and market mix. 
For the full year, adjusted operating profit has more than doubled, delivering 210 basis points of improvement. When including the impact of the U.K. door divestiture, operating margins improved 280 basis points compared to the reported results in 2013. 
The company continues to target an operating margin of 10% in 2016 through ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives, specific customer market pricing actions and the elimination of unprofitable business. 
Please go to Slide #13. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $79.2 million, up 17%. The revenue growth was driven by mid-teen system integration growth and high-teen mechanical hardware growth. 
Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income of $9.7 million was up 42.6% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 220 basis points due to incremental volume leverage and favorable margins from the FSH acquisition completed in Q2 2014. 
Please go to Slide #14. Available cash flow for 2014 was $207.5 million, a decrease of $1.6 million compared to the prior year. The reduction reflects higher capital expenditures of $31.3 million, mostly offset by improved working capital. The incremental capital expenditures were associated with new product development, information systems and spin-related projects. 
We continue to operate with a very effective working capital structure and realized a 15% improvement in our cash conversion cycle for the year. The full year available cash flow ended the year at 111% of net earnings from continuing operations, exceeding our original goal of 100%. 
Please go to Slide #15. By now, this slide will be very familiar as it reflects our commitment to a balanced and flexible capital allocation strategy. We ended the year with gross debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.9, well within a normalized target range of 2.75 to 3.25. 
we continue to fund incremental investments in organic growth for new product development, channel strategies and operational excellence to accelerate core market expansion. We believe these investments will enable the company to grow at an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market. 
We remain focused on growing our portfolio through acquisitions. Dave already mentioned the iDevices equity investment made earlier this month. We have additional opportunities that are deep in the pipeline process. 
Over the course of the past year, the company has developed an acquisition strategy, built capability and developed an acquisition pipeline. We want to keep our flexibility and our balance sheet optionality available until we bet and conclude on all M&A opportunities. 
Please go to Slide #16. Our full year 2014 effective tax rate was 28.6%, and we are forecasting a full year 2015 effective rate of approximately 22% as a result of the tax strategies executed in 2014. We continue to view our structure as a strategic asset of the company that we can leverage to move cash efficiently through the business and achieve a lower effective tax rate to accelerate earnings as well as cash flow growth. We are still targeting our effective rate to be at or below 20% next year. 
Please go to Slide #17. Before I hand things back to Dave, I want to speak about our Venezuela business and the impact of the devaluation. The recent drop in the price of oil has accelerated the deterioration of the economic conditions in Venezuela, and the company concluded that the SICAD II exchange rate was the most appropriate rate to use at the end of the year. 
This decision had 2 immediate impacts: first, we devalued the bolivar-denominated monetary assets, resulting in a pretax charge of $12.1 million or negative $0.09 per share; second, we took a noncash before tax inventory impairment charge of $33.3 million or negative $0.19. This impairment charge was recorded in cost of goods sold and reflected the lower cost market valuation of the inventory held in Venezuela. 
As a result of the change in exchange rates, there will be significant ongoing translation impacts related to the devaluation, which will essentially eliminate the reported 2014 results associated with the Venezuela business. This month, the Venezuela government announced changes to an exchange rate system that introduced a new market-based system called the Marginal Currency System or Simadi. The company is currently evaluating this announcement. Adoption to the Simadi rate would result in additional charges to remeasure the net monetary assets and impair other assets. 
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update of our full year 2015 guidance."

As we look forward to 2015, we will continue to be faced with currency volatility and a challenging macroeconomic environment. In the Americas, we remain cautious but increasingly positive on the U.S. nonresidenti",772,"Thanks, Patrick. Please go to Slide 18. As we look forward to 2015, we will continue to be faced with currency volatility and a challenging macroeconomic environment. 
In the Americas, we remain cautious but increasingly positive on the U.S. nonresidential market recovery. We are still in the early days of a construction rebound and estimate that we are only 75% to 80% of the prerecession peak. 
The recovery will continue at a much slower pace as compared to historic cycles as the economy navigates tight labor availability and modest improvement in public spending. This is especially true as it relates to the Institutional segment, which is approximately 60% of our nonresidential revenue. 
As such, we see the nonresidential market growing at low single digits in 2015. The commercial new construction markets will continue to grow in the low to mid-single digits with the institutional markets beginning to improve. 
The nonresidential aftermarket growth will approximate GDP growth and remain in the low single-digit range. The U.S. residential markets will increase mid-single digit, driven by both builder and big-box segments as we continue our slow and steady recovery out of the recession. 
Single-family home construction, which remains approximately 30% below historic average, will continue its recovery although we don't expect to see normal levels for a few more years. The multifamily segment will continue to remain strong. 
Consolidating the market outlooks, we project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 4% to 5%. Foreign exchange headwinds from Venezuela and Canada will be about 6 to 8 percentage points, leaving us with a reported revenue growth of negative 2% to negative 3%. 
Our outlook in Europe continues to remain subdued, driven by weak GDP growth, political uncertainty and high debt. The southern markets remain soft with relatively slow growth as monetary policy easing helps to support recovery. We project low growth in the nonresidential construction markets in Germany and the U.K. France and Italy will see slight improvement supported by renovation activity offsetting weak new construction, and Eastern Europe growth will struggle given geopolitical climates. All in, we project EMEIA organic growth to be flat to negative 2%. Taking into account currency headwinds in the region, we expect reported revenue of negative 9% to negative 11%. 
The Asia-Pacific markets continue to show mid-single-digit growth in both residential and on residential segments. Growth in China continues but at a slower rate than recent history. Australia and New Zealand will continue to improve while North Asia will be flat, driven by soft residential construction. Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 6% to 8%. Total revenue is estimated to be 5% to 7%. All in, we are projecting organic growth of 3% to 4% for Allegion. Incorporating the currency headwinds, we expect total revenue of negative 3% to negative 4%. 
Please go to Slide 19. Our 2015 earnings per share range is $2.65 to $2.75, an increase of 12% to 17% compared to 2014 adjusted results, excluding Venezuela. The earnings increase is primarily driven by operational improvements and tax rate charge, partially offset by investments in the business, Venezuela devaluation and EMEIA currency headwinds and nonrecurring exchange rate gains and other income. 
Investments will be predominantly focused on new product and channel development to meet demands of the electromechanical conversion as well as driving solutions for the underserved repair and replacement market. 
The full year effective tax rate assumption in the guidance is approximately 22%, and our outstanding diluted shares are approximately 97 million. 
As mentioned previously, the guidance assumes minimal contribution from Venezuela. And although we don't typically provide quarterly guidance, it's important to note that margins early in the year will be under some pressure on a year-over-year basis due to carryover expenditures, which we were not in place at the beginning of 2014 as well as new investments in 2015. 
Please go to Slide 20. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm pleased with our 2014 results. We made significant progress in our first year. We delivered solid organic revenue growth. We increased operating margins while investing for future growth, made significant progress on our tax planning strategies, established a foundation for ongoing margin improvement in Europe and continue to achieve a high level of cash conversion for performance. We entered 2015 positioned well, and we'll build on our results. We'll remain focused on our growth pillars, core market expansion, innovation, growth in emerging markets, enterprise excellence and opportunistic acquisitions. And I believe we have the right team in place that will drive long-term growth that will deliver value to shareholders. 
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

As we look at the M&A front, I'd say we've got a much broader acquisition pipeline certainly than we did a year ago. Feel very confident that you'll be seeing a step up in activity here in the short term. So we're still betting a lot of opportunities. I would characterize the delta between, say, M&A and share distribution would be -- if we don't see opportunities to expand our business and product portfolio in the M&A front, we would be looking at accelerating shareholder distribution. But right now, that's not what we're going to be doing. We will be offsetting our dilution associated with management compensation plans. The idea is not to hoard cash on the balance sheet. So to the extent we're not increasing our M&A activity, you'd be seeing a further step up in shareholder distributions."

Welcome, and thank you for joining us for the Fourth Quarter 2014 Allegion Earnings Call. With me today is Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. 
Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we will refer to in today's call, are available on our website at www.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.
Please go to Slide #2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
Our release and today's commentary include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude restructuring and spin expenses. Also included in these adjustments are the impacts related to a movement in measuring results in Venezuela from the official exchange rate of VEF 6.3 per U.S. dollar to using the Venezuelan government's SICAD II exchange rate of VEF 50 per U.S. dollar. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior year period. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release and the quarterly information in the appendix of today's presentation for further details. 
Also in the fourth quarter of 2014, the company changed its method of accounting so that all inventory is now based on first-in, first-out method from the last-in, first-out method. The financial statements for all periods have been revised for this change, and recast quarterly data has been provided in the appendix of today's presentation. The impact of this adjustment was favorable by $1.3 million or $0.01 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2013. The impact for the year ended December 31, 2014, was favorable by $0.4 million. As a result, our tax and inventory accounting are now on the same basis, and the company achieves global consistency with one inventory accounting treatment.

Allegion posted another strong quarter of organic growth, operating leverage and cash flow generation. Revenues were $573 million, up 5.5% on an adjusted basis versus last year and up 7.6% on an organic basis. 
The Americas region delivered strong organic growth of 8.4% with increases in all segments, and the timing of large system integration projects drove organic growth of 17% in the Asia Pacific region. Organic revenues were relatively flat in Europe, reflecting ongoing market softness. 
Adjusted operating income of $106 million increased 9% versus last year, and adjusted operating margin increased 60 basis points for the company, reflecting solid operating leverage on the incremental volume and improved pricing. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.76 increased 26.7% versus the prior year. Patrick will cover the details later. 
We are issuing our full year 2015 EPS guidance of $2.65 to $2.75, an increase of 12% to 17% compared to adjusted 2014 EPS, excluding Venezuela. The guidance reflect overall organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%. 
Please go to Slide 4. Now that we've completed our first full year as a stand-alone public company, I'd like to take a moment to review our performance. First, it's hard to appreciate the amount of effort it takes to stand up a company. We are truly fortunate to have a strong team in Allegion that embraces the change necessary while ensuring we met our customer and shareholder commitments. 
And although you don't see it as a metric on this slide, one of our core values is to be safe and healthy, which we focus on every single day of the year. We finished 2014 with a lost time incident rate of less than 1%, 26 locations with 0 lost time days, 13 sites celebrated a 1 million-hour milestone without lost time incident. And in our Bogota facility, there was an 81% reduction in the number of injuries, resulting in 0 life -- lost time days in our first full year of ownership. Allegion is one of the safest companies in the world. I'm extremely proud of this. It's a true north metric of Allegion's manufacturing excellence and a commitment to safety. 
Last year at this time, I shared with you the 2014 financial goals of the company. We delivered revenue in the expected range, with some incremental volume covering lower-than-expected price. I'm pleased with the top line performance of the business, given the challenging market environments and currency headwinds. Adjusted earnings per share came in at the high end of our range and taking into account the realization of our lower effective tax rate, we exceeded the high end of our original guidance by $0.09. Spin and restructuring expenses were within expected ranges, and we over-delivered on available cash flow. It was a solid first year for Allegion, and I believe we are positioned well for 2015 and the long-term growth to deliver high shareholder returns. 
Please go to Slide 5. Globally, we hit the ground running in 2014 to secure large project customer wins for the Allegion portfolio. This slide reflects a sampling of some of the project wins in 2014. We continue to leverage our strong institutional knowledge with project wins in education and health care. We're proud to have outfitted both an elementary school and middle school in Shanghai, China, with Schlage Locks as part of a safe campus initiative, and to have our locks and accessories at the premier Sanford Medical Center in Fargo, North Dakota. It's exciting to also note that Allegion is pioneering safety and security for world travel facilities like Levi's Stadium, which is the new home of the San Francisco 49ers as well as notable hotels and office spaces alike. 
Please go to Slide 6. Of course, our project wins are also highly reliant on our ability to innovate. And in 2014, it was a year of significant innovation investment. With Allegion's emphasis on electromechanical convergence, we launched both the ENGAGE technology and Schlage Touch. 
With ENGAGE technology, we're changing the way commercial building owners and tenants think about the interior building access. ENGAGE is a connectivity platform that is easy to install, manage and use. Our Schlage NDE series wireless locks with ENGAGE technology can be installed in minutes with a screwdriver, and they allow users to manage electronic credentials with cloud-based web and mobile apps. 
Schlage Touch, which launched in October, aligns with the keyless era we've been pioneering for homeowners, given the ability to unlock their doors using a stylish touchscreen pen pad. For residential, we've really emphasized, not just the strength of our locks, but the style and design. In 2014, we expanded our style options to offer more choices to our customers. We're now offering more design and finish options that support both modern and traditional taste. Allegion also expanded style options for high-end nonresidential and multi-family customers with the M Collection series of levers for Schlage and Von Duprin. 
In our nonresidential mechanical product lines, we've created more specialized applications for our customers. This includes the Von Duprin AX device, which was the first and currently only UL-certified exit device to meet the new California building code 5-pound operating force requirement; and the Von Duprin quiet electric latch for medical facilities, where both patients and caregivers value an environment free of excessive noise from traditional exit operations. 
Please go to Slide 7. As you've probably seen, Allegion recently launched Schlage Sense in January 2015 as an integral part of Schlage's leadership position in the Internet of Things. As an innovative extension of the keyless era, the residential lock comes with a mobile app that allows homeowners to manage it with their phones or with the lock's touchscreen pen pad. Specifically, it's designed to work with Apple's HomeKit technology, providing advanced security with end-to-end encryption and authentication between the Schlage Sense lock and an iPhone, an iPad and an iTouch. HomeKit also lets consumers control their Schlage Sense lock with their voice using Siri. 
The Schlage Sense system can manage up to 30 codes at the same time. Its app allows homeowners to create and delete access codes, check on lock status and view activity. Residents can also use the app to update settings and check battery life without connecting to an existing home automation system or pay a monthly subscription charge. Schlage Sense launched at the Consumer Electronics Show and had over 300 million impressions in 1 week. Major news outlets applauded the innovation. WIRED named it one of the 11 hot products from the show, FOX News named it as one of their top 8 list of the most innovative products there and CNET praised the talk-to-unlock capability. With Schlage Sense, we're continuing to generate positive coverage for Allegion and expect the product to be available for our customers later this year. 
To help stay on the forefront of innovation and the growth of the Internet of Things, Allegion also recently made an equity investment in iDevices. iDevices, like Schlage, launched the next-generation connected home solution at the Consumer Electronics Show, and our partnership will amplify the impact of Schlage Sense on the market. As part of the minority stake in the company, Allegion and iDevices entered into a joint technology agreement. 
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to update our full year 2015 guidance."

This slide depicts the components of our revenue for both fourth quarter and full year. This is helpful as the impact of pricing in Venezuela and currency headwinds across the business drive quite a bit of noise in the results. 
If you focus on the organic growth, we delivered 7.6% and 5.1% growth for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. Both include 2% of price increase associated with Venezuela. The stronger organic growth reflects improving markets and introduction of new products. Pricing benefits have been mostly driven by Venezuela. However, we are seeing pricing improvement sequentially and expect to gain improved traction in the first half of 2015, particularly in our U.S. nonresidential business. 
One other thing to note is the currency line. We really started to see the impact of a weaker euro in the fourth quarter. Add in the impacts of a softer Canadian dollar, Chinese RMB and Australian dollar and you will see a fourth quarter year-over-year impact of a negative 2.4%. Although the strong U.S. dollar will continue to create pressure on the bottom line, it is important to remember that most of our costs were in the same region with our revenues, which mitigate some of the income pressure. 
Please go to Slide #9. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $573.5 million. As mentioned on the previous slide, this reflects an increase of 5.5% versus the prior year, up 7.6% on an organic basis, inclusive of Venezuela pricing. We realized high single-digit growth in the Americas, with growth in all segments of the market. U.S. commercial grew low single digits, and residential segments increased mid-single digits. Latin America was up significantly, primarily due to incremental price realization in Venezuela to offset inflation. 
EMEIA revenues were down approximately 10%, driven by currency headwind. Asia Pacific revenues were up over 17% due to strong mechanical hardware and the timing of large system integration projects. 
Adjusted operating income of $106.6 million increased 9% compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin of 18.6% reflects an increase of 60 basis points versus the prior year as favorable price, volume leverage and productivity more than offset increased investments and inflation. 
We are extremely pleased with the incremental operating leverage of the business, particularly as we continue to make incremental growth investments for new products and channel development in order to accelerate our earnings growth and return on capital. 
Please go to Slide #10. This reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2013, reported EPS was $0.12 a share. Adjusting for prior year onetime separation and restructuring expenses of $0.04 and $0.44 related to discrete tax items, the 2013 reported EPS was $0.60. 
Operational results increased EPS by $0.13, as pricing, productivity and favorable operating leverage more than offset inflation. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate to 26.3% drove $0.07 per share improvement versus the prior year. Other net items added $0.04, primarily due to foreign exchange gains, offset by $0.01 of incremental interest expense. 
Next, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and M&A were a $0.07 reduction. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2014 EPS of $0.76 a share. 
Continuing on, we have a negative $0.39 per share reduction consisting of $0.08 for restructuring and spin-related expenses, $0.09 for the Venezuelan devaluation charge to revalue monetary assets, $0.19 for a noncash impairment charge to adjust Venezuelan inventory balances and $0.03 for the extinguishment of capitalized debt costs related to the October amendment and extension of our senior credit facility. After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at the fourth quarter 2014 reported EPS of $0.37. 
Please go to Slide #11. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $390.8 million, up 8.4% on an adjusted basis. Removing the impact of Venezuelan price increases, revenues were up 5.4% on an adjusted basis. 
Higher volumes, Venezuela pricing and the acquisition of Schlage at Colombia in January 2014 offset unfavorable currency movement in Canada. Volumes improved in the nonresidential segment by low single digits, led by the strength in the mechanical and door businesses. U.S. residential growth in the mid-single digits was driven by strength in the builder and e-commerce segments. 
Revenues in Venezuela doubled year-over-year, led primarily by price. Americas adjusted operating income of $100 million was up 13.3% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 110 basis points due to favorable volume leverage, price and productivity that more than offset inflation and ongoing investments in new product and channel development. 
Please go to Slide #12. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $103.5 million, down 10.3% and down 0.3% on an organic basis. Currency headwind continues to be a challenge in the region, due to the softening euro and the Russian ruble, which impacts Eastern European sales. Market-driven weakness in hardware sales in France and Italy were mostly offset by strength in the interflex and hospitality businesses. 
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $11.6 million was down 13.4% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 11.2%, down 40 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable product and market mix. 
For the full year, adjusted operating profit has more than doubled, delivering 210 basis points of improvement. When including the impact of the U.K. door divestiture, operating margins improved 280 basis points compared to the reported results in 2013. The company continues to target an operating margin of 10% in 2016 through ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives, specific customer market pricing actions and the elimination of unprofitable business. 
Please go to Slide #13. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $79.2 million, up 17%. The revenue growth was driven by mid-teen system integration growth and high-teen mechanical hardware growth. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income of $9.7 million was up 42.6% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 220 basis points, due to incremental volume leverage and favorable margins from the FSH acquisition completed in Q2 2014. 
Please go to Slide #14. Available cash flow for 2014 was $207.5 million, a decrease of $1.6 million compared to the prior year. The reduction reflects higher capital expenditures of $31.3 million, mostly offset by improved working capital. The incremental capital expenditures were associated with new product development, information systems and spin-related projects. 
We continue to operate with a very effective working capital structure and realized a 15% improvement in our cash conversion cycle for the year. Full year available cash flow ended the year at 111% of net earnings from continuing operations, exceeding our original goal of 100%. 
Please go to Slide #15. By now, this slide will be very familiar, as it reflects our commitment to a balanced and flexible capital allocation strategy. We ended the year with gross debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.9, well within a normalized target range of 2.75 to 3.25. 
We continue to fund incremental investments in organic growth for new product development, channel strategies and operational excellence to accelerate core market expansion. We believe these investments will enable the company to grow at an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market. 
We remain focused on growing our portfolio through acquisitions. Dave already mentioned the iDevices equity investment made earlier this month. We have additional opportunities that are deep in the pipeline process. Over the course of the past year, the company has developed an acquisition strategy, built capability and developed an acquisition pipeline. We want to keep our flexibility and our balance sheet optionality available until we vet and conclude on all M&A opportunities. 
Please go to Slide #16. Our full year 2014 effective tax rate was 28.6%, and we are forecasting a full year 2015 effective rate of approximately 22% as a result of the tax strategies executed in 2014. We continue to view our structure as a strategic asset of the company that we can leverage to move cash efficiently through the business and achieve a lower effective tax rate to accelerate earnings as well as cash flow growth. We are still targeting our effective rate to be at or below 20% next year. 
Please go to Slide #17. Before I hand things back to Dave, I want to speak about our Venezuela business and the impact of the devaluation. The recent drop in the price of oil has accelerated the deterioration of the economic conditions in Venezuela, and the company concluded that the SICAD II exchange rate was the most appropriate rate to use at the end of the year. This decision had 2 immediate impacts: First, we devalued the bolivar-denominated monetary assets, resulting in a pretax charge of $12.1 million or negative $0.09 per share; second, we took a noncash before tax inventory impairment charge of $33.3 million or negative $0.19. This impairment charge was recorded in cost of goods sold and reflected a lower cost to market valuation of the inventory held in Venezuela. 
As a result of the change in exchange rates, there will be significant ongoing translation impacts related to the devaluation, which will essentially eliminate the reported 2014 results associated with the Venezuela business. This month, the Venezuelan government announced changes to an exchange rate system that introduced a new market-based system called the Marginal Currency System or Simadi. The company is currently evaluating this announcement. Adoption to the Simadi rate would result in additional charges to remeasure the net monetary assets and impair other assets. 
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update of our full year 2015 guidance."

As we look forward to 2015, we will continue to be faced with currency volatility and a challenging macroeconomic environment. 
In the Americas, we remain cautious but increasingly positive on the U.S. nonresidential market recovery. We are still in the early days of a construction rebound and estimate that we are only 75% to 80% of the prerecession peak. The recovery will continue at a much slower pace as compared to historic cycles as the economy navigates tight labor availability and modest improvement in public spending. This is especially true as it relates to the institutional segment, which is approximately 60% of our nonresidential revenue. As such, we see the nonresidential markets growing at low single digits in 2015. The commercial new construction markets will continue to grow in the low to mid-single digits, with the institutional markets beginning to improve. 
The nonresidential aftermarket growth will approximate GDP growth and remain in the low single-digit range. The U.S. residential markets will increase mid-single digit, driven by both builder and Big Box segments as we continue our slow and steady recovery out of the recession. 
Single-family home construction, which remains approximately 30% below historic average, will continue its recovery, although we don't expect to see normal levels for a few more years. The multi-family segment will continue to remain strong. 
Consolidating the market outlooks. We project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 4% to 5%. Foreign exchange headwinds from Venezuela and Canada will be about 6 to 8 percentage points, leaving us with a reported revenue growth of negative 2% to negative 3%. 
Our outlook in Europe continues to remain subdued, driven by weak GDP growth, political uncertainty and high debt. The southern markets remain soft with relatively slow growth, as monetary policy easing helps to support recovery. We project low growth in the nonresidential construction markets in Germany and the U.K. France and Italy will see slight improvement, supported by renovation activity offsetting weak new construction. And Eastern Europe growth will struggle, given geopolitical climates. All in, we project EMEIA organic growth to be flat to negative 2%. Taking into account currency headwinds in the region, we expect reported revenue of negative 9% to negative 11%. 
The Asia Pacific markets continue to show mid-single digit growth in both residential and residential segments. Growth in China continues, but at a slower rate than recent history. Australia and New Zealand will continue to improve, while North Asia will be flat, driven by soft residential construction. Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 6% to 8%. Total revenue is estimated to be 5% to 7%. All in, we are projecting organic growth of 3% to 4% for Allegion. Incorporating the currency headwinds, we expect total revenue of negative 3% to negative 4%. 
Please go to Slide 19. Our 2015 earnings per share range is $2.65 to $2.75, an increase of 12% to 17% compared to 2014 adjusted results, excluding Venezuela. The earnings increase is primarily driven by operational improvements and tax rate charge, partially offset by investments in the business, Venezuela devaluation and EMEIA currency headwind and nonrecurring exchange rate gains, other income. 
Investments will be predominantly focused on new products and channel development to meet demands of the electromechanical conversion as well as driving solutions for the underserved repair and replacement market. 
The full year effective tax rate assumption in the guidance is approximately 22%, and our outstanding diluted shares are approximately 97 million. 
As mentioned previously, the guidance assumes minimal contribution from Venezuela. And although we don't typically provide quarterly guidance, it's important to note that margins early in the year will be under some pressure on a year-over-year basis, due to carryover expenditures, which were not in place at the beginning of 2014 as well as new investments in 2015. 
Please go to Slide 20. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm pleased with our 2014 results. We made significant progress in our first year. We delivered solid organic revenue growth. We increased operating margins while investing for future growth, made significant progress on our tax planning strategies, established the foundation for ongoing margin improvement in Europe and continue to achieve a high level of cash conversion performance. We entered 2015 positioned well, and we'll build on our results. We'll remain focused on our growth pillars, core market expansion, innovation, growth in emerging markets, enterprise excellence and opportunistic acquisitions. And I believe we have the right team in place that will drive long-term growth that will deliver value to shareholders. 
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

As we look at the M&A front, I'd say we've got a much broader acquisition pipeline, certainly, than we did a year ago. Feel very confident that you'll be seeing a step-up in activity here in the short term. So we're still vetting a lot of opportunities. I would characterize the delta between, say, M&A and share distribution would be -- if we don't see opportunities to expand our business and product portfolio in M&A front, we would be looking at accelerating shareholder distribution. But right now, that's not what we're going to be doing. We will be offsetting our dilution associated with management compensation plans. The idea is not to hoard cash on the balance sheet.

Steel, you kind of look at the spot rate today relative to the average of 2014, I think, very consistent. Brass, which is a big spend for ours -- for us, is down. So that would be beneficial. Aluminum and zinc, flat to a little bit up. So collectively, right now, based on those spot rates, I would say kind of the same as 2014. We do hedge commodities in terms of supplier lock contracts, so it's not a financial hedge or instrument. So any further decrease in the spot rates would kind of come into our results over an extended period of time."

So I look at capital $40 million kind of a normalized level. One thing to keep in mind is this business, and we get a recovery in the nonres area, we do not have significant capacity constraints that would require additional incremental capital expenditure. So feel pretty good that we can manage at $40 million."

Welcome, and thank you for joining us for the Fourth Quarter 2014 Allegion Earnings Call. With me today is Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. 
Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we will refer to in today's call, are available on our website at www.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.
Please go to Slide #2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
Our release and today's commentary include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude restructuring and spin expenses. Also included in these adjustments are the impacts related to a movement in measuring results in Venezuela from the official exchange rate of VEF 6.3 per U.S. dollar to using the Venezuelan government's SICAD II exchange rate of VEF 50 per U.S. dollar. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior year period. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release and the quarterly information in the appendix of today's presentation for further details. 
Also in the fourth quarter of 2014, the company changed its method of accounting so that all inventory is now based on first-in, first-out method from the last-in, first-out method. The financial statements for all periods have been revised for this change, and recast quarterly data has been provided in the appendix of today's presentation. The impact of this adjustment was favorable by $1.3 million or $0.01 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2013. The impact for the year ended December 31, 2014, was favorable by $0.4 million. As a result, our tax and inventory accounting are now on the same basis, and the company achieves global consistency with one inventory accounting treatment.

Allegion posted another strong quarter of organic growth, operating leverage and cash flow generation. Revenues were $573 million, up 5.5% on an adjusted basis versus last year and up 7.6% on an organic basis. 
The Americas region delivered strong organic growth of 8.4% with increases in all segments, and the timing of large system integration projects drove organic growth of 17% in the Asia Pacific region. Organic revenues were relatively flat in Europe, reflecting ongoing market softness. 
Adjusted operating income of $106 million increased 9% versus last year, and adjusted operating margin increased 60 basis points for the company, reflecting solid operating leverage on the incremental volume and improved pricing. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.76 increased 26.7% versus the prior year. Patrick will cover the details later. 
We are issuing our full year 2015 EPS guidance of $2.65 to $2.75, an increase of 12% to 17% compared to adjusted 2014 EPS, excluding Venezuela. The guidance reflect overall organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%. 
Please go to Slide 4. Now that we've completed our first full year as a stand-alone public company, I'd like to take a moment to review our performance. First, it's hard to appreciate the amount of effort it takes to stand up a company. We are truly fortunate to have a strong team in Allegion that embraces the change necessary while ensuring we met our customer and shareholder commitments. 
And although you don't see it as a metric on this slide, one of our core values is to be safe and healthy, which we focus on every single day of the year. We finished 2014 with a loss time incident rate of less than 1%, 26 locations with 0 loss time days, 13 sites celebrated a 1 million-hour milestone without loss time incident. And in our Bogota facility, there was an 81% reduction in the number of injuries, resulting in 0 life -- loss time days in our first full year of ownership. Allegion is one of the safest companies in the world. I'm extremely proud of this. It's a true north metric of Allegion's manufacturing excellence and a commitment to safety. 
Last year at this time, I shared with you the 2014 financial goals of the company. We delivered revenue in the expected range, with some incremental volume covering lower-than-expected price. I'm pleased with the top line performance of the business, given the challenging market environments and currency headwinds. Adjusted earnings per share came in at the high end of our range, and taking into account the realization of our lower effective tax rate, we exceeded the high end of our original guidance by $0.09. Spin and restructuring expenses were within expected ranges, and we over-delivered on available cash flow. It was a solid first year for Allegion, and I believe we are positioned well for 2015 and the long-term growth to deliver high shareholder returns. 
Please go to Slide 5. Globally, we hit the ground running in 2014 to secure large project customer wins for the Allegion portfolio. This slide reflects a sampling of some of the project wins in 2014. We continue to leverage our strong institutional knowledge with project wins in education and health care. We're proud to have outfitted both an elementary school and middle school in Shanghai, China, with Schlage Locks as part of a safe campus initiative and to have our locks and accessories at the premier Sanford Medical Center in Fargo, North Dakota. It's exciting to also note that Allegion is pioneering safety and security for well-traveled facilities like Levi's Stadium, which is the new home of the San Francisco 49ers as well as notable hotels and office spaces alike. 
Please go to Slide 6. Of course, our project wins are also highly reliant on our ability to innovate. And in 2014, it was a year of significant innovation investment. With Allegion's emphasis on electromechanical convergence, we launched both the ENGAGE technology and Schlage Touch. 
With ENGAGE technology, we're changing the way commercial building owners and tenants think about the interior building access. ENGAGE is a connectivity platform that is easy to install, manage and use. Our Schlage NDE series wireless locks with ENGAGE technology can be installed in minutes with a screwdriver, and they allow users to manage electronic credentials with cloud-based web and mobile apps. 
Schlage Touch, which launched in October, aligns with the keyless era we've been pioneering for homeowners, given the ability to unlock their doors using a stylish touchscreen pin pad. For residential, we've really emphasized, not just the strength of our locks, but the style and design. In 2014, we expanded our style options to offer more choices to our customers. We're now offering more design and finish options that support both modern and traditional taste. Allegion also expanded style options for high-end nonresidential and multi-family customers with the M Collection series of levers for Schlage and Von Duprin. 
In our nonresidential mechanical product lines, we've created more specialized applications for our customers. This includes the Von Duprin AX device, which was the first and currently only UL-certified exit device to meet the new California building code 5-pound operating force requirement; and the Von Duprin quiet electric latch for medical facilities, where both patients and caregivers value an environment free of excessive noise from traditional exit operations. 
Please go to Slide 7. As you've probably seen, Allegion recently launched Schlage Sense in January 2015 as an integral part of Schlage's leadership position in the Internet of Things. As an innovative extension of the keyless era, the residential lock comes with a mobile app that allows homeowners to manage it with their phones or with the lock's touchscreen pen pad. Specifically, it's designed to work with Apple's HomeKit technology, providing advanced security with end-to-end encryption and authentication between the Schlage Sense lock and an iPhone, an iPad and an iTouch. HomeKit also lets consumers control their Schlage Sense lock with their voice using Siri. 
The Schlage Sense system can manage up to 30 codes at the same time. Its app allows homeowners to create and delete access codes, check on lock status and view activity. Residents can also use the app to update settings and check battery life without connecting to an existing home automation system or pay a monthly subscription charge. Schlage Sense launched at the Consumer Electronics Show and had over 300 million impressions in 1 week. Major news outlets applauded the innovation. WIRED named it one of the 11 hot products from the show, FOX News named it as one of their top 8 list of the most innovative products there and CNET praised the talk-to-unlock capability. With Schlage Sense, we're continuing to generate positive coverage for Allegion and expect the product to be available for our customers later this year. 
To help stay on the forefront of innovation and the growth of the Internet of Things, Allegion also recently made an equity investment in iDevices. iDevices, like Schlage, launched the next-generation connected home solution at the Consumer Electronics Show, and our partnership will amplify the impact of Schlage Sense on the market. As part of the minority stake in the company, Allegion and iDevices entered into a joint technology agreement. 
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to update our full year 2015 guidance."

Please go to Slide #8. This slide depicts the components of our revenue for both fourth quarter and full year.

This slide depicts the components of our revenue for both fourth quarter and full year. This is helpful as the impact of pricing in Venezuela and currency headwinds across the business drive quite a bit of noise in the results. 
If you focus on the organic growth, we delivered 7.6% and 5.1% growth for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. Both include 2% of price increase associated with Venezuela. The stronger organic growth reflects improving markets and introduction of new products. Pricing benefits have been mostly driven by Venezuela. However, we are seeing pricing improvement sequentially and expect to gain improved traction in the first half of 2015, particularly in our U.S. nonresidential business. 
One other thing to note is the currency line. We really started to see the impact of a weaker euro in the fourth quarter. Add in the impacts of a softer Canadian dollar, Chinese RMB and Australian dollar and you will see a fourth quarter year-over-year impact of a negative 2.4%. Although the strong U.S. dollar will continue to create pressure on the bottom line, it is important to remember that most of our costs were in the same region with our revenues, which mitigate some of the income pressure. 
Please go to Slide #9. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $573.5 million. As mentioned on the previous slide, this reflects an increase of 5.5% versus the prior year, up 7.6% on an organic basis, inclusive of Venezuela pricing. We realized high single-digit growth in the Americas, with growth in all segments of the market. U.S. commercial grew low single digits, and residential segments increased mid-single digits. Latin America was up significantly, primarily due to incremental price realization in Venezuela to offset inflation. 
EMEIA revenues were down approximately 10%, driven by currency headwind. Asia Pacific revenues were up over 17% due to strong mechanical hardware and the timing of large system integration projects. 
Adjusted operating income of $106.6 million increased 9% compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin of 18.6% reflects an increase of 60 basis points versus the prior year as favorable price, volume leverage and productivity more than offset increased investments and inflation. 
We are extremely pleased with the incremental operating leverage of the business, particularly as we continue to make incremental growth investments for new products and channel development in order to accelerate our earnings growth and return on capital. 
Please go to Slide #10. This reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2013, reported EPS was $0.12 a share. Adjusting for prior year onetime separation and restructuring expenses of $0.04 and $0.44 related to discrete tax items, the 2013 reported EPS was $0.60. 
Operational results increased EPS by $0.13, as pricing, productivity and favorable operating leverage more than offset inflation. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate to 26.3% drove $0.07 per share improvement versus the prior year. Other net items added $0.04, primarily due to foreign exchange gains, offset by $0.01 of incremental interest expense. 
Next, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and M&A were a $0.07 reduction. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2014 EPS of $0.76 a share. 
Continuing on, we have a negative $0.39 per share reduction consisting of $0.08 for restructuring and spin-related expenses, $0.09 for the Venezuelan devaluation charge to revalue monetary assets, $0.19 for a noncash impairment charge to adjust Venezuelan inventory balances and $0.03 for the extinguishment of capitalized debt costs related to the October amendment and extension of our senior credit facility. After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at the fourth quarter 2014 reported EPS of $0.37. 
Please go to Slide #11. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $390.8 million, up 8.4% on an adjusted basis. Removing the impact of Venezuelan price increases, revenues were up 5.4% on an adjusted basis. 
Higher volumes, Venezuela pricing and the acquisition of Schlage to Colombia in January 2014 offset unfavorable currency movement in Canada. Volumes improved in the nonresidential segment by low single digits led by the strength in the mechanical and door businesses. U.S. residential growth in the mid-single digits was driven by strength in the builder and e-commerce segments. 
Revenues in Venezuela doubled year-over-year, led primarily by price. Americas adjusted operating income of $100 million was up 13.3% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 110 basis points due to favorable volume leverage, price and productivity that more than offset inflation and ongoing investments in new product and channel development. 
Please go to Slide #12. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $103.5 million, down 10.3% and down 0.3% on an organic basis. Currency headwind continues to be a challenge in the region, due to the softening euro and the Russian ruble, which impacts Eastern European sales. Market-driven weakness in hardware sales in France and Italy were mostly offset by strength in the interflex and hospitality businesses. 
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $11.6 million was down 13.4% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 11.2%, down 40 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable product and market mix. 
For the full year, adjusted operating profit has more than doubled, delivering 210 basis points of improvement. When including the impact of the U.K. door divestiture, operating margins improved 280 basis points compared to the reported results in 2013. The company continues to target an operating margin of 10% in 2016 through ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives, specific customer market pricing actions and the elimination of unprofitable business. 
Please go to Slide #13. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $79.2 million, up 17%. The revenue growth was driven by mid-teen system integration growth and high-teen mechanical hardware growth. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income of $9.7 million was up 42.6% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 220 basis points, due to incremental volume leverage and favorable margins from the FSH acquisition completed in Q2 2014. 
Please go to Slide #14. Available cash flow for 2014 was $207.5 million, a decrease of $1.6 million compared to the prior year. The reduction reflects higher capital expenditures of $31.3 million, mostly offset by improved working capital. The incremental capital expenditures were associated with new product development, information systems and spin-related projects. 
We continue to operate with a very effective working capital structure and realized a 15% improvement in our cash conversion cycle for the year. Full year available cash flow ended the year at 111% of net earnings from continuing operations, exceeding our original goal of 100%. 
Please go to Slide #15. By now, this slide will be very familiar, as it reflects our commitment to a balanced and flexible capital allocation strategy. We ended the year with gross debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.9, well within a normalized target range of 2.75 to 3.25. 
We continue to fund incremental investments in organic growth for new product development, channel strategies and operational excellence to accelerate core market expansion. We believe these investments will enable the company to grow at an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market. 
We remain focused on growing our portfolio through acquisitions. Dave already mentioned the iDevices equity investment made earlier this month. We have additional opportunities that are deep in the pipeline process. Over the course of the past year, the company has developed an acquisition strategy, built capability and developed an acquisition pipeline. We want to keep our flexibility and our balance sheet optionality available until we vet and conclude on all M&A opportunities. 
Please go to Slide #16. Our full year 2014 effective tax rate was 28.6%, and we are forecasting a full year 2015 effective rate of approximately 22% as a result of the tax strategies executed in 2014. We continue to view our structure as a strategic asset of the company that we can leverage to move cash efficiently through the business and achieve a lower effective tax rate to accelerate earnings as well as cash flow growth. We are still targeting our effective rate to be at or below 20% next year. 
Please go to Slide #17. Before I hand things back to Dave, I want to speak about our Venezuela business and the impact of the devaluation. The recent drop in the price of oil has accelerated the deterioration of the economic conditions in Venezuela, and the company concluded that the SICAD II exchange rate was the most appropriate rate to use at the end of the year. This decision had 2 immediate impacts: First, we devalued the bolivar-denominated monetary assets, resulting in a pretax charge of $12.1 million or negative $0.09 per share; second, we took a noncash before tax inventory impairment charge of $33.3 million or negative $0.19. This impairment charge was recorded in cost of goods sold and reflected a lower cost to market valuation of the inventory held in Venezuela. 
As a result of the change in exchange rates, there will be significant ongoing translation impacts related to the devaluation, which will essentially eliminate the reported 2014 results associated with the Venezuela business. This month, the Venezuelan government announced changes to an exchange rate system that introduced a new market-based system called the Marginal Currency System, or Simadi. The company is currently evaluating this announcement. Adoption to the Simadi rate would result in additional charges to remeasure the net monetary assets and impair other assets. 
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update of our full year 2015 guidance."

As we look forward to 2015, we will continue to be faced with currency volatility and a challenging macroeconomic environment. In the Americas, we remain cautious but increasingly positive on the U.S. nonresidenti",772,"Thanks, Patrick. Please go to Slide 18. As we look forward to 2015, we will continue to be faced with currency volatility and a challenging macroeconomic environment. 
In the Americas, we remain cautious but increasingly positive on the U.S. nonresidential market recovery. We are still in the early days of a construction rebound and estimate that we are only 75% to 80% of the prerecession peak. The recovery will continue at a much slower pace as compared to historic cycles as the economy navigates tight labor availability and modest improvement in public spending. This is especially true as it relates to the institutional segment, which is approximately 60% of our nonresidential revenue. As such, we see the nonresidential markets growing at low single digits in 2015. The commercial new construction markets will continue to grow in the low to mid-single digits, with the institutional markets beginning to improve. 
The nonresidential aftermarket growth will approximate GDP growth and remain in the low single-digit range. The U.S. residential markets will increase mid-single digit, driven by both builder and Big Box segments as we continue our slow and steady recovery out of the recession. 
Single-family home construction, which remains approximately 30% below historic average, will continue its recovery, although we don't expect to see normal levels for a few more years. The multi-family segment will continue to remain strong. 
Consolidating the market outlooks. We project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 4% to 5%. Foreign exchange headwinds from Venezuela and Canada will be about 6 to 8 percentage points, leaving us with a reported revenue growth of negative 2% to negative 3%. 
Our outlook in Europe continues to remain subdued, driven by weak GDP growth, political uncertainty and high debt. The southern markets remain soft with relatively slow growth, as monetary policy easing helps to support recovery. We project low growth in the nonresidential construction markets in Germany and the U.K. France and Italy will see slight improvement, supported by renovation activity offsetting weak new construction. And Eastern Europe growth will struggle, given geopolitical climates. All in, we project EMEIA organic growth to be flat to negative 2%. Taking into account currency headwinds in the region, we expect reported revenue of negative 9% to negative 11%. 
The Asia Pacific markets continue to show mid-single digit growth in both residential and residential segments. Growth in China continues, but at a slower rate than recent history. Australia and New Zealand will continue to improve, while North Asia will be flat, driven by soft residential construction. Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 6% to 8%. Total revenue is estimated to be 5% to 7%. All in, we are projecting organic growth of 3% to 4% for Allegion. Incorporating the currency headwinds, we expect total revenue of negative 3% to negative 4%. 
Please go to Slide 19. Our 2015 earnings per share range is $2.65 to $2.75, an increase of 12% to 17% compared to 2014 adjusted results, excluding Venezuela. The earnings increase is primarily driven by operational improvements and tax rate charge, partially offset by investments in the business, Venezuela devaluation and EMEIA currency headwind and nonrecurring exchange rate gains in other income. 
Investments will be predominantly focused on new products and channel development to meet demands of the electromechanical conversion as well as driving solutions for the underserved repair and replacement market. 
The full year effective tax rate assumption in the guidance is approximately 22%, and our outstanding diluted shares are approximately 97 million. 
As mentioned previously, the guidance assumes minimal contribution from Venezuela. And although we don't typically provide quarterly guidance, it's important to note that margins early in the year will be under some pressure on a year-over-year basis, due to carryover expenditures which were not in place at the beginning of 2014 as well as new investments in 2015. 
Please go to Slide 20. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm pleased with our 2014 results. We made significant progress in our first year. We delivered solid organic revenue growth. We increased operating margins while investing for future growth, made significant progress on our tax planning strategies, established the foundation for ongoing margin improvement in Europe and continue to achieve a high level of cash conversion performance. We entered 2015 positioned well, and we'll build on our results. We'll remain focused on our growth pillars, core market expansion, innovation, growth in emerging markets, enterprise excellence and opportunistic acquisitions. And I believe we have the right team in place that will drive long-term growth that will deliver value to shareholders. 
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

So as we indicated, basically 3 pillars in capital allocation, the first being organic growth opportunities. And as you saw in the guidance, we're going to continue to invest in the business for things that we feel are aligned with our strategy obviously and can accelerate our growth faster than the market. Feel pretty good about those particular opportunities, and fully vetted will provide a good return on capital going forward. As we look at the M&A front, I'd say we've got a much broader acquisition pipeline, certainly, than we did a year ago. Feel very confident that you'll be seeing a step-up in activity here in the short term. So we're still vetting a lot of opportunities. I would characterize the delta between, say, M&A and share distribution would be if we don't see opportunities to expand our business and product portfolio in M&A front, we would be looking at accelerating shareholder distribution. But right now, that's not what we're going to be doing. We will be offsetting our dilution associated with management compensation plans. The idea is not to hoard cash on the balance sheet. So to the extent we're not increasing our M&A activity, you'd be seeing a further step-up in shareholder distributions."

Welcome, and thank you for joining us for the Fourth Quarter 2014 Allegion Earnings Call. With me today is Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. 
Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we will refer to in today's call, are available on our website at www.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.
Please go to Slide #2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
Our release and today's commentary include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude restructuring and spin expenses. Also included in these adjustments are the impacts related to a movement in measuring results in Venezuela from the official exchange rate of VEF 6.3 per U.S. dollar to using the Venezuelan government's SICAD II exchange rate of VEF 50 per U.S. dollar. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior year period. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release and the quarterly information in the appendix of today's presentation for further details. 
Also in the fourth quarter of 2014, the company changed its method of accounting so that all inventory is now based on first-in, first-out method from the last-in, first-out method. The financial statements for all periods have been revised for this change, and recast quarterly data has been provided in the appendix of today's presentation. The impact of this adjustment was favorable by $1.3 million or $0.01 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2013. The impact for the year ended December 31, 2014, was favorable by $0.4 million. As a result, our tax and inventory accounting are now on the same basis, and the company achieves global consistency with one inventory accounting treatment. 
Please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to Dave."

The Americas region delivered strong organic growth of 8.4% with increases in all segments, and the timing of large system integration projects drove organic growth of 17% in the Asia Pacific region. Organic revenues were relatively flat in Europe, reflecting ongoing market softness. 
Adjusted operating income of $106 million increased 9% versus last year, and adjusted operating margin increased 60 basis points for the company, reflecting solid operating leverage on the incremental volume and improved pricing. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.76 increased 26.7% versus the prior year. Patrick will cover the details later. 
We are issuing our full year 2015 EPS guidance of $2.65 to $2.75, an increase of 12% to 17% compared to adjusted 2014 EPS, excluding Venezuela. The guidance reflect overall organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%. 
Please go to Slide 4. Now that we've completed our first full year as a stand-alone public company, I'd like to take a moment to review our performance. First, it's hard to appreciate the amount of effort it takes to stand up a company. We are truly fortunate to have a strong team in Allegion that embraces the change necessary while ensuring we met our customer and shareholder commitments. 
And although you don't see it as a metric on this slide, one of our core values is to be safe and healthy, which we focus on every single day of the year. We finished 2014 with a loss time incident rate of less than 1%, 26 locations with 0 loss time days, 13 sites celebrated a 1 million-hour milestone without loss time incident. And in our Bogota facility, there was an 81% reduction in the number of injuries, resulting in 0 life -- loss time days in our first full year of ownership. Allegion is one of the safest companies in the world. I'm extremely proud of this. It's a true north metric of Allegion's manufacturing excellence and a commitment to safety. 
Last year at this time, I shared with you the 2014 financial goals of the company. We delivered revenue in the expected range, with some incremental volume covering lower-than-expected price. I'm pleased with the top line performance of the business, given the challenging market environments and currency headwinds. Adjusted earnings per share came in at the high end of our range, and taking into account the realization of our lower effective tax rate, we exceeded the high end of our original guidance by $0.09. Spin and restructuring expenses were within expected ranges, and we over-delivered on available cash flow. It was a solid first year for Allegion, and I believe we are positioned well for 2015 and the long-term growth to deliver high shareholder returns. 
Please go to Slide 5. Globally, we hit the ground running in 2014 to secure large project customer wins for the Allegion portfolio. This slide reflects a sampling of some of the project wins in 2014. We continue to leverage our strong institutional knowledge with project wins in education and health care. We're proud to have outfitted both an elementary school and middle school in Shanghai, China, with Schlage Locks as part of a safe campus initiative and to have our locks and accessories at the premier Sanford Medical Center in Fargo, North Dakota. It's exciting to also note that Allegion is pioneering safety and security for well-traveled facilities like Levi's Stadium, which is the new home of the San Francisco 49ers as well as notable hotels and office spaces alike. 
Please go to Slide 6. Of course, our project wins are also highly reliant on our ability to innovate. And in 2014, it was a year of significant innovation investment. With Allegion's emphasis on electromechanical convergence, we launched both the ENGAGE technology and Schlage Touch. 
With ENGAGE technology, we're changing the way commercial building owners and tenants think about the interior building access. ENGAGE is a connectivity platform that is easy to install, manage and use. Our Schlage NDE series wireless locks with ENGAGE technology can be installed in minutes with a screwdriver, and they allow users to manage electronic credentials with cloud-based web and mobile apps. 
Schlage Touch, which launched in October, aligns with the keyless era we've been pioneering for homeowners, given the ability to unlock their doors using a stylish touchscreen pin pad. For residential, we've really emphasized, not just the strength of our locks, but the style and design. In 2014, we expanded our style options to offer more choices to our customers. We're now offering more design and finish options that support both modern and traditional taste. Allegion also expanded style options for high-end nonresidential and multi-family customers with the M Collection series of levers for Schlage and Von Duprin. 
In our nonresidential mechanical product lines, we've created more specialized applications for our customers. This includes the Von Duprin AX device, which was the first and currently only UL-certified exit device to meet the new California building code 5-pound operating force requirement; and the Von Duprin quiet electric latch for medical facilities, where both patients and caregivers value an environment free of excessive noise from traditional exit operations. 
Please go to Slide 7. As you've probably seen, Allegion recently launched Schlage Sense in January 2015 as an integral part of Schlage's leadership position in the Internet of Things. As an innovative extension of the keyless era, the residential lock comes with a mobile app that allows homeowners to manage it with their phones or with the lock's touchscreen pin pad. Specifically, it's designed to work with Apple's HomeKit technology, providing advanced security with end-to-end encryption and authentication between the Schlage Sense lock and an iPhone, an iPad and an iTouch. HomeKit also lets consumers control their Schlage Sense lock with their voice using Siri. 
The Schlage Sense system can manage up to 30 codes at the same time. Its app allows homeowners to create and delete access codes, check on lock status and view activity. Residents can also use the app to update settings and check battery life without connecting to an existing home automation system or pay a monthly subscription charge. Schlage Sense launched at the Consumer Electronics Show and had over 300 million impressions in 1 week. Major news outlets applauded the innovation. WIRED named it one of the 11 hot products from the show, FOX News named it as one of their top 8 list of the most innovative products there and CNET praised the talk-to-unlock capability. With Schlage Sense, we're continuing to generate positive coverage for Allegion and expect the product to be available for our customers later this year. 
To help stay on the forefront of innovation and the growth of the Internet of Things, Allegion also recently made an equity investment in iDevices. iDevices, like Schlage, launched the next-generation connected home solution at the Consumer Electronics Show, and our partnership will amplify the impact of Schlage Sense on the market. As part of the minority stake in the company, Allegion and iDevices entered into a joint technology agreement. 
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to update our full year 2015 guidance."

Please go to Slide #8. This slide depicts the components of our revenue for both fourth quarter and full year. This is helpful as the impact of pricing in Venezuela and currency headwinds across the business drive",1621,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Please go to Slide #8. This slide depicts the components of our revenue for both fourth quarter and full year. This is helpful as the impact of pricing in Venezuela and currency headwinds across the business drive quite a bit of noise in the results. 
If you focus on the organic growth, we delivered 7.6% and 5.1% growth for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. Both include 2% of price increase associated with Venezuela. The stronger organic growth reflects improving markets and introduction of new products. Pricing benefits have been mostly driven by Venezuela. However, we are seeing pricing improvement sequentially and expect to gain improved traction in the first half of 2015, particularly in our U.S. nonresidential business. 
One other thing to note is the currency line. We really started to see the impact of a weaker euro in the fourth quarter. Add in the impacts of a softer Canadian dollar, Chinese RMB and Australian dollar and you will see a fourth quarter year-over-year impact of a negative 2.4%. Although the strong U.S. dollar will continue to create pressure on the bottom line, it is important to remember that most of our costs were in the same region with our revenues, which mitigate some of the income pressure. 
Please go to Slide #9. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $573.5 million. As mentioned on the previous slide, this reflects an increase of 5.5% versus the prior year, up 7.6% on an organic basis, inclusive of Venezuela pricing. We realized high single-digit growth in the Americas, with growth in all segments of the market. U.S. commercial grew low single digits, and residential segments increased mid-single digits. Latin America was up significantly, primarily due to incremental price realization in Venezuela to offset inflation. 
EMEIA revenues were down approximately 10%, driven by currency headwind. Asia Pacific revenues were up over 17% due to strong mechanical hardware and the timing of large system integration projects. 
Adjusted operating income of $106.6 million increased 9% compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin of 18.6% reflects an increase of 60 basis points versus the prior year as favorable price, volume leverage and productivity more than offset increased investments and inflation. 
We are extremely pleased with the incremental operating leverage of the business, particularly as we continue to make incremental growth investments for new products and channel development in order to accelerate our earnings growth and return on capital. 
Please go to Slide #10. This reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2013, reported EPS was $0.12 a share. Adjusting for prior year onetime separation and restructuring expenses of $0.04 and $0.44 related to discrete tax items, the 2013 reported EPS was $0.60. 
Operational results increased EPS by $0.13, as pricing, productivity and favorable operating leverage more than offset inflation. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate to 26.3% drove $0.07 per share improvement versus the prior year. Other net items added $0.04, primarily due to foreign exchange gains, offset by $0.01 of incremental interest expense. 
Next, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and M&A were a $0.07 reduction. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2014 EPS of $0.76 a share. 
Continuing on, we have a negative $0.39 per share reduction consisting of $0.08 for restructuring and spin-related expenses, $0.09 for the Venezuelan devaluation charge to revalue monetary assets, $0.19 for a noncash impairment charge to adjust Venezuelan inventory balances and $0.03 for the extinguishment of capitalized debt costs related to the October amendment and extension of our senior credit facility. After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at the fourth quarter 2014 reported EPS of $0.37. 
Please go to Slide #11. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $390.8 million, up 8.4% on an adjusted basis. Removing the impact of Venezuelan price increases, revenues were up 5.4% on an adjusted basis. 
Higher volumes, Venezuela pricing and the acquisition of Schlage to Colombia in January 2014 offset unfavorable currency movement in Canada. Volumes improved in the nonresidential segment by low single digits led by the strength in the mechanical and door businesses. U.S. residential growth in the mid-single digits was driven by strength in the builder and e-commerce segments. 
Revenues in Venezuela doubled year-over-year, led primarily by price. Americas adjusted operating income of $100 million was up 13.3% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 110 basis points due to favorable volume leverage, price and productivity that more than offset inflation and ongoing investments in new product and channel development. 
Please go to Slide #12. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $103.5 million, down 10.3% and down 0.3% on an organic basis. Currency headwind continues to be a challenge in the region, due to the softening euro and the Russian ruble, which impacts Eastern European sales. Market-driven weakness in hardware sales in France and Italy were mostly offset by strength in the interflex and hospitality businesses. 
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $11.6 million was down 13.4% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 11.2%, down 40 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable product and market mix. 
For the full year, adjusted operating profit has more than doubled, delivering 210 basis points of improvement. When including the impact of the U.K. door divestiture, operating margins improved 280 basis points compared to the reported results in 2013. The company continues to target an operating margin of 10% in 2016 through ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives, specific customer market pricing actions and the elimination of unprofitable business. 
Please go to Slide #13. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $79.2 million, up 17%. The revenue growth was driven by mid-teen system integration growth and high-teen mechanical hardware growth. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income of $9.7 million was up 42.6% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 220 basis points, due to incremental volume leverage and favorable margins from the FSH acquisition completed in Q2 2014. 
Please go to Slide #14. Available cash flow for 2014 was $207.5 million, a decrease of $1.6 million compared to the prior year. The reduction reflects higher capital expenditures of $31.3 million, mostly offset by improved working capital. The incremental capital expenditures were associated with new product development, information systems and spin-related projects. 
We continue to operate with a very effective working capital structure and realized a 15% improvement in our cash conversion cycle for the year. Full year available cash flow ended the year at 111% of net earnings from continuing operations, exceeding our original goal of 100%. 
Please go to Slide #15. By now, this slide will be very familiar, as it reflects our commitment to a balanced and flexible capital allocation strategy. We ended the year with gross debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.9, well within a normalized target range of 2.75 to 3.25. 
We continue to fund incremental investments in organic growth for new product development, channel strategies and operational excellence to accelerate core market expansion. We believe these investments will enable the company to grow at an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market. 
We remain focused on growing our portfolio through acquisitions. Dave already mentioned the iDevices equity investment made earlier this month. We have additional opportunities that are deep in the pipeline process. Over the course of the past year, the company has developed an acquisition strategy, built capability and developed an acquisition pipeline. We want to keep our flexibility and our balance sheet optionality available until we vet and conclude on all M&A opportunities. 
Please go to Slide #16. Our full year 2014 effective tax rate was 28.6%, and we are forecasting a full year 2015 effective rate of approximately 22% as a result of the tax strategies executed in 2014. We continue to view our structure as a strategic asset of the company that we can leverage to move cash efficiently through the business and achieve a lower effective tax rate to accelerate earnings as well as cash flow growth. We are still targeting our effective rate to be at or below 20% next year. 
Please go to Slide #17. Before I hand things back to Dave, I want to speak about our Venezuela business and the impact of the devaluation. The recent drop in the price of oil has accelerated the deterioration of the economic conditions in Venezuela, and the company concluded that the SICAD II exchange rate was the most appropriate rate to use at the end of the year. This decision had 2 immediate impacts: First, we devalued the bolivar-denominated monetary assets, resulting in a pretax charge of $12.1 million or negative $0.09 per share; second, we took a noncash before tax inventory impairment charge of $33.3 million or negative $0.19. This impairment charge was recorded in cost of goods sold and reflected a lower cost to market valuation of the inventory held in Venezuela. 
As a result of the change in exchange rates, there will be significant ongoing translation impacts related to the devaluation, which will essentially eliminate the reported 2014 results associated with the Venezuela business. This month, the Venezuelan government announced changes to an exchange rate system that introduced a new market-based system called the Marginal Currency System, or Simadi. The company is currently evaluating this announcement. Adoption to the Simadi rate would result in additional charges to remeasure the net monetary assets and impair other assets. 
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update of our full year 2015 guidance."

As we look forward to 2015, we will continue to be faced with currency volatility and a challenging macroeconomic environment. In the Americas, we remain cautious but increasingly positive on the U.S. nonresidenti",772,"Thanks, Patrick. Please go to Slide 18. As we look forward to 2015, we will continue to be faced with currency volatility and a challenging macroeconomic environment. 
In the Americas, we remain cautious but increasingly positive on the U.S. nonresidential market recovery. We are still in the early days of a construction rebound and estimate that we are only 75% to 80% of the prerecession peak. The recovery will continue at a much slower pace as compared to historic cycles as the economy navigates tight labor availability and modest improvement in public spending. This is especially true as it relates to the institutional segment, which is approximately 60% of our nonresidential revenue. As such, we see the nonresidential markets growing at low single digits in 2015. The commercial new construction markets will continue to grow in the low to mid-single digits, with the institutional markets beginning to improve. 
The nonresidential aftermarket growth will approximate GDP growth and remain in the low single-digit range. The U.S. residential markets will increase mid-single digit, driven by both builder and Big Box segments as we continue our slow and steady recovery out of the recession. 
Single-family home construction, which remains approximately 30% below historic average, will continue its recovery, although we don't expect to see normal levels for a few more years. The multi-family segment will continue to remain strong. 
Consolidating the market outlooks. We project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 4% to 5%. Foreign exchange headwinds from Venezuela and Canada will be about 6 to 8 percentage points, leaving us with a reported revenue growth of negative 2% to negative 3%. 
Our outlook in Europe continues to remain subdued, driven by weak GDP growth, political uncertainty and high debt. The southern markets remain soft with relatively slow growth, as monetary policy easing helps to support recovery. We project low growth in the nonresidential construction markets in Germany and the U.K. France and Italy will see slight improvement, supported by renovation activity offsetting weak new construction. And Eastern Europe growth will struggle, given geopolitical climates. All in, we project EMEIA organic growth to be flat to negative 2%. Taking into account currency headwinds in the region, we expect reported revenue of negative 9% to negative 11%. 
The Asia Pacific markets continue to show mid-single digit growth in both residential and residential segments. Growth in China continues, but at a slower rate than recent history. Australia and New Zealand will continue to improve, while North Asia will be flat, driven by soft residential construction. Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 6% to 8%. Total revenue is estimated to be 5% to 7%. All in, we are projecting organic growth of 3% to 4% for Allegion. Incorporating the currency headwinds, we expect total revenue of negative 3% to negative 4%. 
Please go to Slide 19. Our 2015 earnings per share range is $2.65 to $2.75, an increase of 12% to 17% compared to 2014 adjusted results, excluding Venezuela. The earnings increase is primarily driven by operational improvements and tax rate charge, partially offset by investments in the business, Venezuela devaluation and EMEIA currency headwind and nonrecurring exchange rate gains in other income. 
Investments will be predominantly focused on new products and channel development to meet demands of the electromechanical conversion as well as driving solutions for the underserved repair and replacement market. 
The full year effective tax rate assumption in the guidance is approximately 22%, and our outstanding diluted shares are approximately 97 million. 
As mentioned previously, the guidance assumes minimal contribution from Venezuela. And although we don't typically provide quarterly guidance, it's important to note that margins early in the year will be under some pressure on a year-over-year basis, due to carryover expenditures which were not in place at the beginning of 2014 as well as new investments in 2015. 
Please go to Slide 20. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm pleased with our 2014 results. We made significant progress in our first year. We delivered solid organic revenue growth. We increased operating margins while investing for future growth, made significant progress on our tax planning strategies, established the foundation for ongoing margin improvement in Europe and continue to achieve a high level of cash conversion performance. We entered 2015 positioned well, and we'll build on our results. We'll remain focused on our growth pillars, core market expansion, innovation, growth in emerging markets, enterprise excellence and opportunistic acquisitions. And I believe we have the right team in place that will drive long-term growth that will deliver value to shareholders. 
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

As we look at the M&A front, I'd say we've got a much broader acquisition pipeline, certainly, than we did a year ago. Feel very confident that you'll be seeing a step-up in activity here in the short term. So we're still vetting a lot of opportunities. I would characterize the delta between, say, M&A and share distribution would be if we don't see opportunities to expand our business and product portfolio in M&A front, we would be looking at accelerating shareholder distribution. But right now, that's not what we're going to be doing. We will be offsetting our dilution associated with management compensation plans. The idea is not to hoard cash on the balance sheet.

As I look at 2015, you could assume kind of similar performance in terms of margin improvement year-over-year, and a lot of that coming from some of the carryover activities that took place in our restructuring in 2014. Again, we're taking a rifle-shot approach on pricing specific to customers and markets. And then the ongoing productivity and cost containment, I think, will be the primary drivers there."

We're putting in the systems and processes to be able to get our share of that market with what we think is naturally ours."

The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
Our release and today's commentary includes non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude restructuring and spin expenses from prior year results. Excluded from the current quarter results is a remeasurements of monetary assets and inventory charge, reflecting a change from the Venezuela SICAD II exchange rates, using the Venezuelan government's market-based Simadi exchange rate. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior year period.

Allegion posted another solid quarter of organic revenue and EPS growth. We continue to make progress on our capital allocation plan and are beginning to realize the early benefits of our new product and channel initiatives. Revenues of $458 million, grew 5.9% on an organic basis. Total revenue declined 1.7%, reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency.
All regions posted positive organic growth. Of note, the Americas segment grew 7.7% organically, driven by strength in the nonresidential business.
Adjusted operating income of $75.2 million decreased 2.5% versus last year. And as we mentioned in the previous earnings call, incremental investments were a headwind to margins in the first quarter, which declined by 10 basis points. The investment impact was approximately 170 basis points.
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.51 increased 15.9% versus the prior year, driven primarily from the improved operating performance in a lower effective tax rate, offset by incremental investments in foreign exchange impact. This is our third straight quarter of double-digit earning per share growth. 
In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 500,000 Allegion shares, which more than offset dilution related to incentive plans. We are affirming our full year 2015 adjusted EPS guidance of $2.65 to $2.75 or $2.61 to $2.71 on a reported basis, which reflects the first quarter Venezuelan devaluation charge that Tom mentioned previously. 
Please go to Slide 4. As you know, opportunistic acquisitions is one of Allegion's 5 strategic pillars. Aligned with this, we've recently announced 2 acquisitions, and I'd like to welcome Zero International and Brio to the Allegion team. We remain focused on acquiring great businesses and these strategic acquisitions will expand our product portfolio and provide opportunity to expand globally.
Zero International is a recognized leader in door and window products for commercial applications. These product lines include premium sealing systems for sound control, fire and smoke protection and threshold applications. The high-quality product portfolio from Zero expands our customer offerings, which can be leveraged through our existing specification capability and channels.
The acquisition of Brio, expected to close in the second quarter, add sliding and folding door to Allegion's portfolio that provides opportunity to expand globally. Brio's suite of products include door hardware systems and accessories for interior sliding and folding doors, weather-fold exterior folding doors, straight sliding top and bottom roller doors and retractable insect screens.
We have made significant progress in building the relationships and capability necessary to execute on our acquisition strategy. We continue to work with pipeline and are confident we are building this as a core competency. 
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2015 guidance."

Please go to Slide #5. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth in the first quarter as well as our growth by regional segment. As indicated, we delivered 5.9% organic growth in the first quarter, supported by incremental volume, reflecting improving market fundamentals, modest price improvement and early traction on our key organic investments and products and channels. 
We saw a good growth across most product segments and continued experience favorable traction on our electronic products portfolio. All segments reported positive organic revenue growth for the quarter. 
Currency rates continue to be a headwind to revenue growth as reflected by negative 7.4% decline. All reporting segments were impacted, most notably, the weaker euro and EMEA and softer Canadian dollars and Venezuela and Bolivar devaluation impacted America's results.  
In Asia Pacific, the impact of weaker Australian, New Zealand dollars were offset by prior year acquisition. As a result of unfavorable exchange rates, reported revenue decreased 1.7% compared to the prior year period.
Please go to Slide #6. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $458.7 million. This reflects a decrease of 1.7% versus the prior year, up 5.9% on an organic basis. We realized 2.6% growth in the Americas, up 7.7% on an organic basis. 
U.S. nonresidential grew high single digits and residential segments, ex Venezuela, increased low single digits. EMEIA revenues were down 17.6%, driven by currency headwind. Asia Pacific revenues were up 3.2%, with good traction on residential electronic locks.
Adjusted operating income was $75.2 million, decreased 2.5% compared to the prior year. The decline was driven by increased investment spending and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. 
Adjusted operating margin of 16.4% reflects a decrease of 10 basis points versus the prior year. This was expected for the first quarter and reflects the impact of incremental investments and currency rates, already mentioned. 
Incremental investments made in areas of new product development, channel market expansion and certain infrastructure programs had an impact of 170 basis points on the quarter. This headwind was largely offset by the favorable operating leverage on increased volume. The impact of incremental investment comparisons gets easier in the second half of the year. 
We are in the early stage of new product and channel initiatives and are very encouraged by the early feedback by the market. We continue to navigate the currency headwind, but still expect margin rates to improve in all regions for the full year.
Please go to Slide #7. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter of 2014, reported EPS was $0.38. Adjusting for prior year onetime separation and restructuring expenses of $0.06, the 2014 adjusted EPS was $0.44. 
Operational results increased EPS by $0.09 as pricing, productivity and favorable operating leverage more than offset inflation. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate of 20.2% drove $0.06 per share improvement versus the prior year. 
Of note, we benefited from discrete tax items in the current quarter that were exchange rate related. We are forecasting these types of items to balance out on a full year basis and accordingly, are maintaining our effective tax rate guidance of 22%.
Interest expense improvements from the credit facility amendment in 2014 added $0.01 and other net items added $0.01, primarily due to lower noncontrolling interest expenses.
Foreign exchange impacts reduced earnings by $0.04 due to the stronger U.S. dollar compared to most currencies across the globe. Incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategies specific to taxes and M&A were $0.06 reduction. This results in adjusted first quarter 2015 EPS of $0.51 per share.
Continuing on, we have a negative $0.04 per share reduction for the Venezuela devaluation charge to revalue monetary assets, noncash impairment charge to adjust Venezuelan inventory.
After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at the first quarter 2015 reported EPS of $0.47.
Please go to Slide #8. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $354.3 million, up 2.6% or an increase of 7.7% on an organic basis. Higher volumes and pricing compensated for unfavorable currency movements in Canada and Venezuela. The higher volumes reflect solid results against a week weather impact in 2014, but also steady nonresidential improvement and better-than-market results with our new products and channel initiatives. 
Net favorable pricing reflects traction in the nonresidential segment, offset by slightly unfavorable residential pricing driven by pricing adjustments to clear older generation products and make shelf space for new electronic products and new merchandising connected to our stall-and-design strategy. 
Americas adjusted operating income of $88.4 million was up 2.1% versus prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 10 basis points due to incremental investment spending, which created 150 basis points headwind in the quarter.
The investments are related to the previously mentioned new product and channel development initiatives.
Please go to Slide #9. First quarter revenues for the EMEA region were $81.7 million, down 17.6% and up 0.7% on an organic basis. Currency headwind continues to be a challenge in the region due to the softening euro and the Russian ruble, which impacts Eastern European sales.
Solid results in Interflex, hospitality and Turkey more than offset weakness in France and the soft Eastern European performance.
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $2.6 million was up $1.4 million or 116.7% versus the prior year period on revenues that were down over 17%. 
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 200 basis points, primarily due to favorable pricing and productivity that more than offset inflation, investments and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. 
We are pleased with the ongoing improvement in this region especially with increased currency headwinds and unfavorable sales mix due to lower Eastern European sales. The company continues to target an operating margin of 10% in 2016, with ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives, specific customer and market pricing actions and the elimination of unprofitable business.
Please go to Slide #10. First quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $22.7 million, up 3.2%. Modest pricing and volume increases in a prior year acquisition more than offset unfavorable currency exchange rate movements. 
Residential electronic locks continue to grow in the region and the system integration pipeline supports the full year outlook, which is seasonally weighted to the second half of the year. 
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income of negative $2.6 million was up 10.3% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 170 basis points due to incremental pricing, productivity and the prior year acquisition of FSH, which offset inflation and currency exchange impacts.
As a reminder, the Asia Pacific region historically loses money in the first quarter due to the seasonal nature of the business, with the lowest revenues in the first quarter.
Please go to Slide #11. Available cash flow for the first quarter of 2015 was negative $4.8 million, an improvement of $4.4 million compared to the prior year. The negative cash flow is typical of our historical performance and reflects seasonal use of working capital. We continue to operate with an effective working capital structure and have realized a year-over-year improvements in working capital as a percent of revenue in every quarter since the spin. 
In addition, our cash conversion cycle improved 17% in the first quarter of 2015. We continue to guide full year available cash flow of 95% of net earnings from continuing operations.
Please go to Slide #12. As mentioned in our last call, the Venezuelan government announced changes to exchange rate system that introduced a new market-based system called, the Marginal Currency System or Simadi. We adopted the Simadi rate after its introduction and recorded a charge of $7 million before tax and noncontrolling interests of $0.04 per share. The charge includes remeasurement of net monetary assets of $2.8 million and a noncash impairment charge to adjust Venezuelan inventory balances of $4.2 million
Subsequent changes to the market-based Simadi rate will flow through the income statement. However, at the current level of exchange, Venezuelan operating results are expected to have minimal impact to Allegion recorded 2015 results. 
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update of our full year 2015 guidance."

Looking at full year revenue guidance, we are increasing our organic growth expectations but decreasing our overall revenue growth based on increased exchange rate headwinds. The incremental organic growth is from the Americas region and reflects continued optimism in 2015 markets and ongoing traction of our growth initiatives. 
We continue to monitor institutional market recovery but given health of state budget surpluses and potential impacts of energy sector slowdown on construction markets, it's too early to call more than a moderate recovery for the year. 
Overall, inorganic revenue headwind in the Americas is unchanged and the slight increase from the Zero acquisitions, offset the increase in Canadian currency headwinds. The most notable change in the EMEIA region is the EMEIA region although organic projections currency movements have created another 6 points of headwind.
Inclusive of the revenue uptick, we are affirming our full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.65 to $2.75 and reported EPS of $2.61 to $2.71, which incorporates the first quarter Venezuela devaluation impact of $0.04 per share.
We continue to project full year margin growth in all regions with incremental operating leverage being used to support growth investments.
Please go to Slide 14. Let me finish by reiterating that I was pleased with the first quarter results. We delivered organic revenue growth of 5.9%, held adjusted margins relatively flat, while absorbing investments and currency pressure and grew EPS by nearly 16%.

I can certainly understand a wanting to have some caution. But given the quarter you just put up, I think, to get back to the midpoint of your revised organic growth range implies a pretty material slowdown in the volume for the next few quarters. So are you seeing evidence of some of those headwinds that you flag as reasons for caution? Or just how are you thinking about the evolution of the core growth through the rest of the year in Americas?"

It's the residential side that we commented was a little softer than anticipated, and some of that is just moving older product to make room for the high demand of our new electronic products. So although pressure from that. Relative to your inflation question, you're exactly right. I mean, in the commodity area, steel, brass, copper, zinc, olefins, inputs are going into our products seen a decline year-over-year. We're not yet seeing the full impact to that because as part of our policy, we lock in the supplier hedge contracts. And so we look out 12 months and we kind of hedge some of that.

But as it relates specific to Americas, I'd say 2/3, probably NPD related on both residential, nonresidential products. 1/3 being channel related to this discretionary market, which we think is a huge upside for us in the future. If you relate that relative to the benefits we're seeing, I would say in the organic revenue growth for Americas, which was close to 8% for the quarter, you're probably getting 1 to 2 points tied back to those initiatives.

Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we will refer to in today's call, are available on our website at www.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.
Please go to Slide #2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Federal Securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
Our release and today's commentary includes non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude restructuring and spin expenses from prior year results. Excluded from the current quarter results is a remeasurement of monetary assets and inventory charge, reflecting a change from the Venezuela SICAD II exchange rate to using the Venezuelan government's market-based Simadi exchange rate. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior year periods.

Allegion posted another solid quarter of organic revenue and EPS growth. We continue to make progress on our capital allocation plan and are beginning to realize the early benefits of our new product and channel initiatives. Revenues of $458 million grew 5.9% on an organic basis. Total revenue declined 1.7%, reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency.
All regions posted positive organic growth. Of note, the Americas segment grew 7.7% organically, driven by strength in the nonresidential business.
Adjusted operating income of $75.2 million decreased 2.5% versus last year. And as we mentioned in the previous earnings call, incremental investments were a headwind to margins in the first quarter, which declined by 10 basis points. The investment impact was approximately 170 basis points.
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.51 increased 15.9% versus the prior year, driven primarily from the improved operating performance in a lower effective tax rate, offset by incremental investments in foreign exchange impact. This is our third straight quarter of double-digit earning per share growth. 
In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 500,000 Allegion shares, which more than offset dilution related to incentive plans. We are affirming our full year 2015 adjusted EPS guidance of $2.65 to $2.75 or $2.61 to $2.71 on a reported basis, which reflects the first quarter Venezuelan devaluation charge that Tom mentioned previously. 
Please go to Slide 4. As you know, opportunistic acquisitions is one of Allegion's 5 strategic pillars. Aligned with this, we've recently announced 2 acquisitions, and I'd like to welcome Zero International and Brio to the Allegion team. We remain focused on acquiring great businesses, and these strategic acquisitions will expand our product portfolio and provide opportunity to expand globally.
Zero International is a recognized leader in door and window products for commercial applications. These product lines include premium sealing systems for sound control, fire and smoke protection and threshold applications. The high-quality product portfolio from Zero expands our customer offerings, which can be leveraged through our existing specification capability and channels.
The acquisition of Brio, expected to close in the second quarter, add sliding and folding door hardware to Allegion's portfolio that provides opportunity to expand globally. Brio's suite of products include door hardware systems and accessories for interior sliding and folding doors, Weatherfold exterior folding doors, straight-sliding, top-hung and bottom-roller doors and retractable insect screens.
We have made significant progress in building the relationships and capability necessary to execute on our acquisition strategy. We continue to work the pipeline and are confident we are building this as a core competency. 
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2015 guidance."

Please go to Slide #5. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth in the first quarter as well as our growth by regional segment. As indicated, we delivered 5.9% organic growth in the first quarter, supported by incremental volume reflecting improving market fundamentals, modest price improvements and early traction on our key organic investments in products and channels. 
We saw good growth across most product segments and continued to experience favorable traction on our electronic products portfolio. All segments reported positive organic revenue growth for the quarter. 
Currency rates continued to be a headwind to revenue growth, as reflected by a negative 7.4% decline. All reporting segments were impacted. Most notably, the weaker euro in EMEIA and softer Canadian dollar and Venezuelan bolivar devaluation impact in the Americas results. In Asia Pacific, the impact of weaker Australian and New Zealand dollars were offset by a prior year acquisition. 
As a result of unfavorable exchange rates, reported revenue decreased 1.7% compared to the prior year period.
Please go to Slide #6. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $458.7 million. This reflects a decrease of 1.7% versus the prior year, up 5.9% on an organic basis. We realized 2.6% growth in the Americas, up 7.7% on an organic basis. 
U.S. nonresidential grew high single digits and residential segments, x Venezuela, increased low single digits. EMEIA revenues were down 17.6%, driven by currency headwind. Asia Pacific revenues were up 3.2%, with good traction on residential electronic locks.
Adjusted operating income of $75.2 million decreased 2.5% compared to the prior year. The decline was driven by increased investment spending in unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. 
Adjusted operating margin of 16.4% reflects a decrease of 10 basis points versus the prior year. This was expected for the first quarter and reflects the impact of incremental investments and currency rates, as already mentioned. 
Incremental investments made in the areas of new product development, channel market expansion and certain infrastructure programs had an impact of 170 basis points on the quarter. This headwind was largely offset by the favorable operating leverage on increased volume. The impact of incremental investment comparisons get easier in the second half of the year. 
We are in the early stage of new product and channel initiatives and are very encouraged by the early feedback from the market. We continue to navigate the currency headwind but still expect margin rates to improve in all regions for the full year.
Please go to Slide #7. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter of 2014, reported EPS was $0.38. Adjusting for prior year onetime separation and restructuring expenses of $0.06, the 2014 adjusted EPS was $0.44. 
Operational results increased EPS by $0.09 as pricing, productivity and favorable operating leverage more than offset inflation. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate to 20.2% drove $0.06-per-share improvement versus the prior year. Of note, we benefited from discrete tax items in the current quarter that were exchange rate-related. We are forecasting these types of items to balance out on a full year basis and, accordingly, are maintaining our effective tax rate guidance of 22%.
Interest expense improvements from the credit facility amendment in 2014 added $0.01 and other net items added $0.01, primarily due to lower noncontrolling interest expenses.
Foreign exchange impacts reduced earnings by $0.04 due to the stronger U.S. dollar compared to most currencies across the globe. Incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and M&A were a $0.06 reduction. This results in adjusted first quarter 2015 EPS of $0.51 per share.
Continuing on, we have a negative $0.04-per-share reduction for the Venezuela devaluation charge to revalue monetary assets, the noncash impairment charge to adjust Venezuelan inventory.
After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at the first quarter 2015 reported EPS of $0.47.
Please go to Slide #8. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $354.3 million, up 2.6%, or an increase of 7.7% on an organic basis. Higher volumes and pricing compensated for unfavorable currency movements in Canada and Venezuela. The higher volumes reflect solid results against a weak weather impact to 2014, but also steady nonresidential improvement and better-than-market results with our new products and channel initiatives. 
Net favorable pricing reflects traction in the nonresidential segment, offset by slightly unfavorable residential pricing driven by pricing adjustments to clear older-generation product and make shelf space for our new electronic products and new merchandising connected to our style and design strategy. 
Americas adjusted operating income of $88.4 million was up 2.1% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 10 basis points due to incremental investment spending, which created a 150-basis-point headwind in the quarter. The investments are related to the previously mentioned new product and channel development initiatives.
Please go to Slide #9. First quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $81.7 million, down 17.6%, and up 0.7% on an organic basis. Currency headwind continues to be a challenge in the region due to the softening euro and the Russian ruble, which impacts Eastern European sales. Solid results in Interflex, hospitality and Turkey more than offset weakness in France and the soft Eastern European performance.
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $2.6 million was up $1.4 million or 116.7% versus the prior year period on revenues that were down over 17%. 
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 200 basis points, primarily due to favorable pricing and productivity that more than offset inflation, investments and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. 
We are pleased with the ongoing improvement in this region, especially with the increased currency headwinds and unfavorable sales mix due to lower Eastern European sales. The company continues to target an operating margin of 10% in 2016 through ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives, specific customer and market pricing actions and the elimination of unprofitable business.
Please go to Slide #10. First quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $22.7 million, up 3.2%. Modest pricing and volume increases and our prior year acquisition more than offset unfavorable currency exchange rate movements. 
Residential electronic locks continued to grow in the region, and the system integration pipeline supports the full year outlook, which is seasonally weighted to the second half of the year. 
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income of negative $2.6 million was up 10.3% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 170 basis points due to incremental pricing, productivity and the prior year acquisition of FSH, which offset inflation and currency exchange impacts.
As a reminder, the Asia Pacific region historically loses money in the first quarter due to the seasonal nature of the business, with the lowest revenues in the first quarter.
Please go to Slide #11. Available cash flow for the first quarter of 2015 was negative $4.8 million, an improvement of $4.4 million compared to the prior year. The negative cash flow is typical of our historical performance and reflects seasonal use of working capital. We continue to operate with an effective working capital structure and have realized a year-over-year improvement in working capital as a percent of revenue in every quarter since the spin. 
In addition, our cash conversion cycle improved 17% in the first quarter of 2015. We continue to guide full year available cash flow of 95% of net earnings from continuing operations.
Please go to Slide #12. As mentioned in our last call, the Venezuelan government announced changes to exchange rate system that introduced a new market-based system called the Marginal Currency System or Simadi. We adopted the Simadi rate after its introduction and recorded a charge of $7 million before tax and noncontrolling interest or $0.04 per share. The charge includes remeasurement of net monetary assets of $2.8 million and a noncash impairment charge to adjust Venezuelan inventory balances of $4.2 million
Subsequent changes to the market-based Simadi rate will flow through the income statement. However, at the current level of exchange, Venezuelan operating results are expected to have minimal impact to Allegion reported 2015 results. 
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update of our full year 2015 guidance."

Looking at full year revenue guidance, we are increasing our organic growth expectations but decreasing our overall revenue growth based on increased exchange rate headwinds. The incremental organic growth is from the Americas region and reflects continued optimism in 2015 markets and ongoing traction of our growth initiatives. 
We continue to monitor institutional market recovery, but given health of state budget surpluses and potential impacts of the energy sector slowdown on construction markets, it's too early to call more than a moderate recovery for the year. 
Overall, inorganic revenue headwind in the Americas is unchanged, as a slight increase from the Zero acquisitions offsets the increase in Canadian currency headwinds. The most notable change in the EMEIA region -- is the EMEIA region. Although organic projections remain unchanged, currency movements have created another 6 points of headwind.
Inclusive of the revenue update, we are affirming our full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.65 to $2.75 and reported EPS of $2.61 to $2.71, which incorporates the first quarter Venezuela devaluation impact of $0.04 per share.
We continue to project full year margin growth in all regions, with incremental operating leverage being used to support growth investments.
Please go to Slide 14. Let me finish by reiterating that I was pleased with the first quarter results. We delivered organic revenue growth of 5.9%, held adjusted margins relatively flat while absorbing investments and currency pressure and grew EPS by nearly 16%.
We are executing on our margin improvement efforts in Europe and continue to deliver a flexible and balanced capital allocation plan, with both share repurchases and acquisitions announced in the quarter. And finally, we remain on track to deliver our original EPS guidance.
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

It's the residential side that we commented was a little softer than anticipated, and some of that is just moving out older product to make room for the high demand of our new electronic products. So a little pressure from that. Relative to your inflation question, you're exactly right. I mean, in the commodity area, steel, brass, copper, zinc, olefins, inputs that go into our products, seeing the decline year-over-year. We're not yet seeing the full impact of that because, as part of our policy, we lock in the supplier hedge contracts. And so we look out 12 months and we kind of hedge some of that. So you'd see some more of that in the back half of the year. But potentially, it's some upside if the prices stay where they are today."

But as it relates specific to Americas, I'd say, 2/3, probably, NPD-related on both residential, nonresidential products; 1/3 being channel related to this discretionary market, which, we think, is a huge upside for us in the future. If you relate that relative to the benefits we're seeing, I would say, in the organic revenue growth for Americas, which was close to 8% for the quarter, you're probably getting 1 to 2 points tied back to those specific initiatives.

Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we will refer to in today's call, are available on our website at www.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.
Please go to Slide #2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Federal Securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
Our release and today's commentary includes non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude restructuring and spin expenses from prior year results. Excluded from the current quarter results is a remeasurement of monetary assets and inventory charge, reflecting a change from the Venezuela SICAD II exchange rate to using the Venezuelan government's market-based Simadi exchange rate. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior year periods.

Allegion posted another solid quarter of organic revenue and EPS growth. We continue to make progress on our capital allocation plan and are beginning to realize the early benefits of our new product and channel initiatives. Revenues of $458 million grew 5.9% on an organic basis. Total revenue declined 1.7%, reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency.
All regions posted positive organic growth. Of note, the Americas segment grew 7.7% organically, driven by strength in the nonresidential business.
Adjusted operating income of $75.2 million decreased 2.5% versus last year. And as we mentioned in the previous earnings call, incremental investments were a headwind to margins in the first quarter, which declined by 10 basis points. The investment impact was approximately 170 basis points.
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.51 increased 15.9% versus the prior year, driven primarily from the improved operating performance in a lower effective tax rate, offset by incremental investments in foreign exchange impact. This is our third straight quarter of double-digit earning per share growth. 
In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 500,000 Allegion shares, which more than offset dilution related to incentive plans. We are affirming our full year 2015 adjusted EPS guidance of $2.65 to $2.75 or $2.61 to $2.71 on a reported basis, which reflects the first quarter Venezuelan devaluation charge that Tom mentioned previously. 
Please go to Slide 4. As you know, opportunistic acquisitions is one of Allegion's 5 strategic pillars. Aligned with this, we've recently announced 2 acquisitions, and I'd like to welcome Zero International and Brio to the Allegion team. We remain focused on acquiring great businesses, and these strategic acquisitions will expand our product portfolio and provide opportunity to expand globally.
Zero International is a recognized leader in door and window products for commercial applications. These product lines include premium sealing systems for sound control, fire and smoke protection and threshold applications. The high-quality product portfolio from Zero expands our customer offerings, which can be leveraged through our existing specification capability and channels.
The acquisition of Brio, expected to close in the second quarter, add sliding and folding door hardware to Allegion's portfolio that provides opportunity to expand globally. Brio's suite of products include door hardware systems and accessories for interior sliding and folding doors, Weatherfold exterior folding doors, straight-sliding, top-hung and bottom-roller doors and retractable insect screens.
We have made significant progress in building the relationships and capability necessary to execute on our acquisition strategy. We continue to work the pipeline and are confident we are building this as a core competency. 
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2015 guidance."

Thank you for joining the call this morning. Please go to Slide #5. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth in the first quarter as well as our growth by regional segment. As indicated, we delive",1391,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. 
Please go to Slide #5. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth in the first quarter as well as our growth by regional segment. As indicated, we delivered 5.9% organic growth in the first quarter, supported by incremental volume reflecting improving market fundamentals, modest price improvements and early traction on our key organic investments in products and channels. 
We saw good growth across most product segments and continued to experience favorable traction on our electronic products portfolio. All segments reported positive organic revenue growth for the quarter. 
Currency rates continued to be a headwind to revenue growth, as reflected by a negative 7.4% decline. All reporting segments were impacted. Most notably, the weaker euro in EMEIA and softer Canadian dollar and Venezuelan bolivar devaluation impact in the Americas results. In Asia Pacific, the impact of weaker Australian and New Zealand dollars were offset by a prior year acquisition. 
As a result of unfavorable exchange rates, reported revenue decreased 1.7% compared to the prior year period.
Please go to Slide #6. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $458.7 million. This reflects a decrease of 1.7% versus the prior year, up 5.9% on an organic basis. We realized 2.6% growth in the Americas, up 7.7% on an organic basis. 
U.S. nonresidential grew high single digits and residential segments, x Venezuela, increased low single digits. EMEIA revenues were down 17.6%, driven by currency headwind. Asia Pacific revenues were up 3.2%, with good traction on residential electronic locks.
Adjusted operating income of $75.2 million decreased 2.5% compared to the prior year. The decline was driven by increased investment spending in unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. 
Adjusted operating margin of 16.4% reflects a decrease of 10 basis points versus the prior year. This was expected for the first quarter and reflects the impact of incremental investments and currency rates, as already mentioned. 
Incremental investments made in the areas of new product development, channel market expansion and certain infrastructure programs had an impact of 170 basis points on the quarter. This headwind was largely offset by the favorable operating leverage on increased volume. The impact of incremental investment comparisons get easier in the second half of the year. 
We are in the early stage of new product and channel initiatives and are very encouraged by the early feedback from the market. We continue to navigate the currency headwind but still expect margin rates to improve in all regions for the full year.
Please go to Slide #7. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter of 2014, reported EPS was $0.38. Adjusting for prior year onetime separation and restructuring expenses of $0.06, the 2014 adjusted EPS was $0.44. 
Operational results increased EPS by $0.09 as pricing, productivity and favorable operating leverage more than offset inflation. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate to 20.2% drove $0.06-per-share improvement versus the prior year. Of note, we benefited from discrete tax items in the current quarter that were exchange rate-related. We are forecasting these types of items to balance out on a full year basis and, accordingly, are maintaining our effective tax rate guidance of 22%.
Interest expense improvements from the credit facility amendment in 2014 added $0.01 and other net items added $0.01, primarily due to lower noncontrolling interest expenses.
Foreign exchange impacts reduced earnings by $0.04 due to the stronger U.S. dollar compared to most currencies across the globe. Incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and M&A were a $0.06 reduction. This results in adjusted first quarter 2015 EPS of $0.51 per share.
Continuing on, we have a negative $0.04-per-share reduction for the Venezuela devaluation charge to revalue monetary assets, the noncash impairment charge to adjust Venezuelan inventory.
After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at the first quarter 2015 reported EPS of $0.47.
Please go to Slide #8. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $354.3 million, up 2.6%, or an increase of 7.7% on an organic basis. Higher volumes and pricing compensated for unfavorable currency movements in Canada and Venezuela. The higher volumes reflect solid results against a weak weather impact to 2014, but also steady nonresidential improvement and better-than-market results with our new products and channel initiatives. 
Net favorable pricing reflects traction in the nonresidential segment, offset by slightly unfavorable residential pricing driven by pricing adjustments to clear older-generation product and make shelf space for our new electronic products and new merchandising connected to our style and design strategy. 
Americas adjusted operating income of $88.4 million was up 2.1% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 10 basis points due to incremental investment spending, which created a 150-basis-point headwind in the quarter. The investments are related to the previously mentioned new product and channel development initiatives.
Please go to Slide #9. First quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $81.7 million, down 17.6%, and up 0.7% on an organic basis. Currency headwind continues to be a challenge in the region due to the softening euro and the Russian ruble, which impacts Eastern European sales. Solid results in Interflex, hospitality and Turkey more than offset weakness in France and the soft Eastern European performance.
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $2.6 million was up $1.4 million or 116.7% versus the prior year period on revenues that were down over 17%. 
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 200 basis points, primarily due to favorable pricing and productivity that more than offset inflation, investments and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. 
We are pleased with the ongoing improvement in this region, especially with the increased currency headwinds and unfavorable sales mix due to lower Eastern European sales. The company continues to target an operating margin of 10% in 2016 through ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives, specific customer and market pricing actions and the elimination of unprofitable business.
Please go to Slide #10. First quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $22.7 million, up 3.2%. Modest pricing and volume increases and our prior year acquisition more than offset unfavorable currency exchange rate movements. 
Residential electronic locks continued to grow in the region, and the system integration pipeline supports the full year outlook, which is seasonally weighted to the second half of the year. 
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income of negative $2.6 million was up 10.3% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 170 basis points due to incremental pricing, productivity and the prior year acquisition of FSH, which offset inflation and currency exchange impacts.
As a reminder, the Asia Pacific region historically loses money in the first quarter due to the seasonal nature of the business, with the lowest revenues in the first quarter.
Please go to Slide #11. Available cash flow for the first quarter of 2015 was negative $4.8 million, an improvement of $4.4 million compared to the prior year. The negative cash flow is typical of our historical performance and reflects seasonal use of working capital. We continue to operate with an effective working capital structure and have realized a year-over-year improvement in working capital as a percent of revenue in every quarter since the spin. 
In addition, our cash conversion cycle improved 17% in the first quarter of 2015. We continue to guide full year available cash flow of 95% of net earnings from continuing operations.
Please go to Slide #12. As mentioned in our last call, the Venezuelan government announced changes to exchange rate system that introduced a new market-based system called the Marginal Currency System or Simadi. We adopted the Simadi rate after its introduction and recorded a charge of $7 million before tax and noncontrolling interest or $0.04 per share. The charge includes remeasurement of net monetary assets of $2.8 million and a noncash impairment charge to adjust Venezuelan inventory balances of $4.2 million
Subsequent changes to the market-based Simadi rate will flow through the income statement. However, at the current level of exchange, Venezuelan operating results are expected to have minimal impact to Allegion reported 2015 results. 
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update of our full year 2015 guidance."

Looking at full year revenue guidance, we are increasing our organic growth expectations but decreasing our overall revenue growth based on increased exchange rate headwinds. The incremental organic growth is from the Americas region and reflects continued optimism in 2015 markets and ongoing traction of our growth initiatives. 
We continue to monitor institutional market recovery, but given health of state budget surpluses and potential impacts of the energy sector slowdown on construction markets, it's too early to call more than a moderate recovery for the year. 
Overall, inorganic revenue headwind in the Americas is unchanged, as a slight increase from the Zero acquisitions offsets the increase in Canadian currency headwinds. The most notable change in the EMEIA region -- is the EMEIA region. Although organic projections remain unchanged, currency movements have created another 6 points of headwind.
Inclusive of the revenue update, we are affirming our full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.65 to $2.75 and reported EPS of $2.61 to $2.71, which incorporates the first quarter Venezuela devaluation impact of $0.04 per share.
We continue to project full year margin growth in all regions, with incremental operating leverage being used to support growth investments.
Please go to Slide 14. Let me finish by reiterating that I was pleased with the first quarter results. We delivered organic revenue growth of 5.9%, held adjusted margins relatively flat while absorbing investments and currency pressure and grew EPS by nearly 16%.
We are executing on our margin improvement efforts in Europe and continue to deliver a flexible and balanced capital allocation plan, with both share repurchases and acquisitions announced in the quarter. And finally, we remain on track to deliver our original EPS guidance.
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

I mean, in the commodity area, steel, brass, copper, zinc, olefins, inputs that go into our products, seeing the decline year-over-year. We're not yet seeing the full impact of that because, as part of our policy, we lock in the supplier hedge contracts. And so we look out 12 months and we kind of hedge some of that. So you'd see some more of that in the back half of the year. But potentially, it's some upside if the prices stay where they are today."

And you saw a $0.06 headwind in Q1 relative to the prior year period. The majority of that is Americas related, probably 2/3. The remaining 1/3 would be tied to our corporate, what we call, infrastructure investments, tied back to our M&A building capability, taxes, systems, those types of things. But as it relates specific to Americas, I'd say, 2/3, probably, NPD-related on both residential, nonresidential products; 1/3 being channel related to this discretionary market, which, we think, is a huge upside for us in the future. If you relate that relative to the benefits we're seeing, I would say, in the organic revenue growth for Americas, which was close to 8% for the quarter, you're probably getting 1 to 2 points tied back to those specific initiatives. I think, pretty good traction early on. That should hopefully accelerate. We like what we're seeing in the marketplace. So on a full year basis, I would see that maybe improving a little bit, but getting good, I'd say, return from those investments."

However, looking forward into 2016 and beyond, the level of incremental investments comes down. I think there would still be some as we continue to find growth alternatives organically. And then, you may recall, with the payback and the returns on those investments, EBITDA margin growth starts to outpace significantly the incremental investment spend. And so look at it as an increase in the cost base, but the level of year-over-year incremental spend coming down beginning in 2016."

Since the last time we spoke, we've announced 3 more acquisitions and communicated further steps in our European transformation. But most importantly, we continue to deliver solid results the one with our communicated growth strategy and financial expectations.
Revenues of $519 million grew 5.8% on an organic basis. Total revenue declined 2.3%, reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency. The Americas segment grew 7.2% organically, driven by strength in both nonresidential and residential businesses. In EMEIA, market recovered continues to get uneven across countries and organic revenues were relatively flat as expected. In our Asia Pacific region, organic growth of 7.7% was supported with contributions from the hardware businesses and the inclusion of previously announced acquisition of Brio.
Adjusted operating income of $101.2 million was relatively flat to prior year. We realized operating margin expansion in all regions for the quarter and improved overall margin by 40 basis points. It's important to remember that we're showing margin improvement while absorbing incremental investments. Investments from predominantly a new product and channel initiatives created 140 basis point headwind in the quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.71 increased 16.4% versus the prior year, driven primarily from improved operating performance and lower tax rate, partially offset by incremental investments in foreign exchange impact. This is our 4 straight quarter with double digits earnings per share growth. We are raising our full year 2015 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $2.70 to $2.80 per share. Please go to Slide 4.
As you are aware, one of Allegion's core strategies is to grow through strategic acquisitions. Our strategy has been focused on opportunities that fill certain product gaps, expand our business geographically, provide new innovative technologies that can be leveraged across the business and provide solid financial returns.
Since the spin, we've been actively building our capabilities, developing a process and expanding our pipeline of opportunities. Since the last earnings release, we announced 3 acquisitions that are an excellent fit with our core business, expand our product and geographical footprint and provide exciting accelerated growth opportunities.
In June, we entered into an agreement to acquire SimonsVoss, a leading electronic lock manufacturer that holds the #1 market position in Germany and #2 market position in Europe with a track record of innovation, product development that complements Allegion's growth strategy. SimonsVoss is not just a forerunner. This company is a pioneer, setting standards for connected products like digital cylinders and smart handles. By adding SimonsVoss to the Allegion business, we are expanding our electronic portfolio in the European market, as well as strengthening our global technology in electro-mechanical convergence and miniaturization.
Just last week, we made 2 more acquisitions announcements, starting with Milre Systek. Milre is a market leading manufacturer in South Korea, focusing on producing high-quality and innovative electronic security solutions, including Morris, RIM and cabinet locks. Milre has a well-established cadence of operational excellence, which is also highly aligned with Allegion's growth strategy. Combined with this culture of continuous improvement and technical innovations, Milre offers superior quality digital products and creates lasting relationships in the industry that will enhance Allegion's portfolio in South Korea and other Asian markets.
And finally, last week, we announced the acquisition of AXA Stenman, a leading European residential and portable security provider headquartered in the Netherlands. Founded in 1902, AXA manufactures and sells a branded portfolio bicycle locks and lines in a wide variety of window and door hardware. Joining the Allegion family will enhance AXA's deep local heritage and create more meaningful growth opportunities through innovative product development across Europe and globally.
AXA's portable security portfolio is highly synergistic with our Kryptonite business, allowing the 2 brands to leverage one another's extensive customer and channel relationship and product development. AXA Stenman also provides a highly profitable position in the residential security arena in the Dutch market with opportunities to expand into Holland and German markets. In 2015, AXA is expected to generate double-digit revenue growth.
All of these transactions are expected to close in the third quarter, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. We're very excited to welcome these businesses, brands and employees to the Allegion family.
Please go to Slide 5. Allegion is on the cutting-edge in the security sector with the Internet of Things. We recognized early that the smartphone would be a disruptive innovation in security and it has certainly become an essential part of creating a responsive environment and managing access.
As Tech Watch recently noted, the connected tone really take hold when Schlage entered the market with its key leash Schlage link lock in 2009. We followed up in 2014 with the launch of ENGAGE technology for the commercial market. And in the first quarter of this year, Allegion unveiled Schlage Sense solution for Apple HomeKit, while in the second quarter, we announced Schlage Control for managing multi-family buildings. All of these connected solutions make Schlage lock a prevalent entry point for home and office automation.
Consider these results. We have the leading security position in retail with channel players like Home Depot, Lowe's and Menard's. We are anticipating to sell 1 million electronic locks in 2015. A leading consumer publication recently rates Schlage lock #1 in both keyless locks and connected locks.
Allegion is a clear thought leader with a strong share of voice on security solutions in the Internet of Things. What's driving these results? We believe 3 unique advantages drive our success in this space.
First, Allegion has key partnerships in place with companies like Apple, Chamberlin, CBORD and iDevices, among others. This collaboration expands our footprint and expedite adoption of security products.
Second, our leading position across residential, multi-family and commercial markets in the U.S. gives Allegion the experience and vision to recognize trends and customer needs very early. We move very quickly to adapt technology and spread it into new markets, new businesses and new applications.
Third, thanks to our worldwide engineering and operations, we continue to invest, develop and support global platforms and open standards. This gives us extraordinary flexibility and adaptability to meet the -- and exceeds expectation of both industry professionals and consumers alike.
Allegion had an early commitment to the Internet of Things. And today, we see dividends of our leadership in this dramatic high-growth space. 
Before I turn the call over to Patrick, I want to thank -- provide some comments with regard to our European transformation. We have seen positive results from the work done by our team in the region under the leadership of Lucia Beretti. The transformation is changing the way EMEIA does business. The team is focusing its efforts on developing comprehensive of solutions for verticals and enhancing specific capabilities across the region. This approach creates demand and additional customer value. They are also simplifying and streamlining systems and processes to better serve its customers into becoming a more agile organization. Last, the EMEIA team is optimizing its assets to drive enterprise excellence.
In the second quarter, Allegion announced its intention to implement a restful plant in CISA's Italian operations. The objective of this plan, in line with the region's overall transformation, is to improve CISA's competitive position, ensure long-term viability and enhance the customer experience. Negotiations are currently underway, and we are working to find the best possible solution of the people affected in accordance with these social parties involved.
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, then I'll be back to discuss our full year 2015 guidance."

This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth in the second quarter, as well as our growth by regional segment. 
As indicated, we delivered 5.8% organic growth in the second quarter, supported by incremental volume that reflects improving market fundamentals, price improvements and early traction on our key organic growth investments and products and channels.
We realized good growth across most product segments and continue to experience favorable traction on our electronic products portfolio, which grew more than 20%. As expected, currency rates continued to be a headwind to revenue growth noted by the negative 9.3% decline. All reporting segments were impacted. Most notably, the weaker euro in EMEIA, softer Canadian dollar and Venezuelan Bolivar devaluation impact in the Americas results. In Asia Pacific, the impact of weaker Australian and New Zealand dollars were offset by acquisitions in the region. As a result of unfavorable exchange rates, reported revenue decreased 2.3% compared to the prior year period.
Please go to Slide #7. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $519.5 million. This reflects a decrease of 2.3% versus the prior year, up 5.8% on an organic basis. America's revenue grew 0.3%, up 7.2% on an organic basis. U.S. nonresidential and residential segments provided balanced growth.
EMEIA revenues were down 17.1%, driven primarily by currency headwinds. Asia Pacific revenues were up 13.2% with good traction, residential electronic clocks and contributions from acquisitions. Adjusted operating income of $101.2 million was essentially flat compared to the prior year. Incremental volume leverage compensated were increased investment spending.
Adjusted operating margin of 19.5% reflects an increase of 40 basis points versus the prior year. Incremental investments made in areas of new product development, channel and market expansion, and certain infrastructure programs had an impact of 140 basis points on the quarter. The impact of incremental investment comparisons get easier in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter.
We are in the early stage of new product and channel initiatives and are encouraged by the early feedback from the market. We continue to navigate the currency headwind, but still expect margin rates to improve in all regions for the full year.
Please go to Slide #8. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter 2014, reported EPS was $0.53. Adjusting for prior year one-time separation and restructuring expenses of $0.08, the 2014 adjusted EPS was $0.61.
Operational results increased EPS by $0.11, as pricing, productivity and favorable operating leverage more than offset inflation. As noted on the chart, this includes a favorable $0.01 per share related to a reduction in year-over-year bad debt adjustments in the Asia-Pacific region. The decrease in adjusted effective tax rate to 22.3% drove $0.09 per share improvement versus the prior year. Interest expense improvements from the credit facility amendment in 2014 added $0.01 and other net items were a $0.02 reduction, primarily due to unfavorable currency exchange losses and related expenses.
Next, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management, as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and IT investments were a $0.05 reduction.
And lastly, the net year-over-year impact of Venezuela at current exchange rates is a $0.04 reduction. This results in adjusted second quarter 2015 EPS of $0.71 per share. Continuing on, we have a negative $0.05 per share reduction for restructuring and acquisition expenses. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at the second quarter 2015 reported EPS of $0.66.
Please go to Slide #9. Second quarters for the Americas region were $402.1 million, up 0.3% or an increase of 7.2% on an organic basis. Higher volumes, pricing and contribution from the acquisition of 0 compensated for unfavorable currency movements in Canada and Venezuela. The higher volumes reflect balanced organic growth in both residential and nonresidential markets, as well as electronics growth exceeding 20% with strong contributions from both residential and nonresidential products. This reflects better than market performance-driven by our new products and channel initiatives. 
America's adjusted operating income of $111.9 million was up 0.9% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points while absorbing incremental investment spending that created a 70 basis point headwind in the quarter. Please go to Slide #10. 
Second quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $83.9 million, down 17.1% and down 0.3% on an organic basis. Currency headwind continues to be a challenge in the region due to the softening euro and the Russian ruble, which impacts Eastern European sales. Slightly lower organic volume was offset by favorable pricing and net acquisition contributions.
Electronics growth was also strong in the region. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $4.3 million was up $2.2 million or 104.8% versus the prior year period on revenues that were down more than 17%.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 300 basis points, primarily due to favorable pricing and productivity that more than offset inflation, investment and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. Our EMEIA results continued to improve, and we continue the transformation work that not only reshapes and resizes the business, but also scaled the business with strategic acquisitions. The company continues to target an operating margin of 10% through the base business in 2016 through ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives, specific customer and market pricing actions, and the elimination of unprofitable business.
Please go to Slide #11. Second quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $33.5 million, up 13.2%. Improved residential electronic lock growth, pricing and the impact of acquisitions more than offset unfavorable currency exchange rate movements. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income of negative $1.4 million was up $1.9 million or 57.6% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 690 basis points due to incremental pricing, productivity and acquisitions, which offset inflation and currency exchange impacts results also reflect a year-over-year improvement in bad debt adjustments of $1.2 million.
Please go to Slide #12. Year-to-date, available cash flow for 2015 was $14.8 million, a reduction of $24.6 million compared to the prior year period. The reduction in year-over-year cash flow is due to increased operating cash requirements, offset by increased earnings and reduced capital expenditures. And as you know, available cash flow for the business is very seasonal and the majority of our available cash flow is generated in the second half of the year. 
We continue to operate with an effective working capital structure and have realized a year-over-year improvement in working capital as a percentage of revenue in every quarter since the spin. In addition, our cash conversion cycle continues to improve with more than a 20% reduction in the second quarter 2015. We continue to guide full year available cash flow of 95% of net earnings from continuing operations, which reflects some one-time tax-related cash expenditures.
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2015 guidance."

Looking at full year revenue guidance, we are increasing our growth expectation for the year by a full point. We are increasing total revenue expectations in the Asia Pacific region by 3%, reflecting the inclusion of the Brio acquisition, partially offset by additional currency headwind in Australia and New Zealand.
In the Americas, we are improving total revenue by 1%, supported by first half organic growth and favorable contributions from new product and channel initiatives. We continue to project year-over-year improvements in the U.S. markets. Institutional markets continue to grow slowly with improvement in higher education markets, while K-12 education continues to lag, driven by modest state funding increases.
Our outlook for institutional recovery remains favorable, although we are watching labor availability that may struggle to meet demand in the midterm. Residential construction markets continue to grow as inventory continues to tighten, foreclosure rates are at their highest since 2006 and mortgage rates continue to remain low.
However, builders are facing challenges with land availability and labor shortages. Our revenue outlook remains unchanged for the EMEIA region. I would characterize the market as stable overall, but uneven across countries. We see growth in the U.K. and Spain, flat performance in Italy [indiscernible] new construction and continued weakness in France.
The Russian ruble depreciation is driving negative revenue growth for our Eastern European business, as imports enter that region have declined considerably. In Asia Pacific, we continue to expect favorable growth across the region and see China slowing due to excess of debt and industrial capacity glut and ongoing real estate recession. Australia's residential construction market has been positive, but commercial construction continues to lag expectation. Market growth for the overall Asia Pacific region will remain in the low to mid single-digits for the year.
Inclusive of the revenue update, we are updating our full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations to range -- to a range of $2.70 to $2.80 and a reported EPS of $2.51 to $2.63, which incorporates the first quarter Venezuela devaluation incurred, acquisition expenses in the second quarter and full year estimated expenses related to the announced restructuring plan in Italy. The guidance does not reflect announced acquisitions not yet closed.
Please go to Slide 14. The second quarter results were very stern and represented solid growth with a 5.8% organic revenue increase, a 40 basis point margin expansion and EPS growth of over 16%. Our markets are essentially as we expected at the beginning of the year, and we continue to make progress on new product introductions in our channel initiatives. Our results demonstrate alignment with our strategic growth pillars, and we continue to expand our acquisition capability as indicated in our recent announcements.
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today.
It's been an exciting quarter for Allegion. Since the last time we spoke, we've announced 3 more acquisitions and communicated further steps in our European transformation. But most importantly, we continue to deliver solid results aligned with our communicated growth strategy and financial expectations.
Revenues of $519 million grew 5.8% on an organic basis. Total revenue declined 2.3%, reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency. The Americas segment grew 7.2% organically, driven by strength in both nonresidential and residential businesses. In EMEIA, market recovered continues to be uneven across countries and organic revenues were relatively flat as expected. In our Asia Pacific region, organic growth of 7.7% was supported with contributions from the hardware businesses and the inclusion of previously announced acquisition of Brio.
Adjusted operating income of $101.2 million was relatively flat to prior year. We realized operating margin expansion in all regions for the quarter and improved overall margin by 40 basis points. It's important to remember that we're showing margin improvement while absorbing incremental investments. Investments from predominantly a new product and channel initiatives created 140-basis point headwind in the quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.71 increased 16.4% versus the prior year, driven primarily from improved operating performance and a lower tax rate, partially offset by incremental investments in foreign exchange impact. This is our fourth straight quarter with double digits earning per share growth. We are raising our full year 2015 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $2.70 to $2.80 per share.
Please go to Slide 4.
As you are aware, one of Allegion's core strategies is to grow through strategic acquisitions. Our strategy has been focused on opportunities that fill certain product gaps, expand our business geographically, provide new innovative technologies that can be leveraged across the business and provide solid financial returns. Since the spin, we've been actively building our capabilities, developing a disciplined [ph] process and expanding our pipeline of opportunities. Since the last earnings release, we announced 3 acquisitions that are an excellent fit with our core business, expand our product and geographical footprint and provide exciting accelerated growth opportunities.
In June, we entered into an agreement to acquire SimonsVoss, a leading electronic lock manufacturer that holds the #1 market position in Germany and #2 market position in Europe with a track record of innovation, product development that complements Allegion's growth strategy. SimonsVoss is not just the forerunner. This company is a pioneer, setting standards for connected products like digital cylinders and smart handles. By adding SimonsVoss to the Allegion business, we are expanding our electronic portfolio in the European market as well as strengthening our global technology in electro-mechanical convergence and miniaturization.
Just last week, we made 2 more acquisitions announcements, starting with Milre Systek. Milre is a market leading manufacturer in South Korea, focusing on producing high-quality and innovative electronic security solutions, including mortise, rim and cabinet locks. Milre has a well-established cadence of operational excellence, which is also highly aligned with Allegion's growth strategy. Combined with this culture of continuous improvement and technical innovations, Milre offers superior quality digital products and creates lasting relationships in the industry that will enhance Allegion's portfolio in South Korea and other Asian markets.
And finally, last week, we announced the acquisition of AXA Stenman, a leading European residential and portable security provider headquartered in the Netherlands. Founded in 1902, AXA manufactures and sells a branded portfolio of bicycle locks and lights and a wide variety of window and door hardware. Joining the Allegion family will enhance AXA's deep local heritage and create more meaningful growth opportunities through innovative product development across Europe and globally. AXA's portable security portfolio is highly synergetic with our Kryptonite business, allowing the 2 brands to leverage one another's extensive customer and channel relationship and product development. AXA Stenman also provides a highly profitable position in the residential security arena in the Dutch market with opportunities to expand into Poland and German markets. In 2015, AXA is expected to generate double-digit revenue growth.
All of these transactions are expected to close in the third quarter, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. We're very excited to welcome these businesses, brands and employees to the Allegion family.
Please go to Slide 5.
Allegion is on the cutting-edge in the security sector with the Internet of Things. We recognized early that the smartphone would be a disruptive innovation in security, and it has certainly become an essential part of creating a responsive environment and managing access.
As Tech Watch recently noted, the connected tone really took hold when Schlage entered the market with its keyless Schlage link lock in 2009. We followed up in 2014 with the launch of ENGAGE technology for the commercial market. And in the first quarter of this year, Allegion unveiled Schlage Sense solution for Apple HomeKit, while in the second quarter, we announced Schlage Control for managing multi-family buildings. All of these connected solutions make Schlage lock a prevalent entry point for home and office automation.
Consider these results. We have the leading security position in retail with channel players like Home Depot, Lowe's and Menards. We are anticipating to sell 1 million electronic locks in 2015. A leading consumer publication recently ranked Schlage locks #1 in both keyless locks and connected locks.
Allegion is a clear thought leader with a strong share of voice on security solutions in the Internet of Things. What's driving these results? We believe 3 unique advantages drive our success in this space. First, Allegion has key partnerships in place with companies like Apple, Chamberlin, CBORD and iDevices, among others. This collaboration expands our footprint and expedites adoption of security products.
Second, our leading position across residential, multi-family and commercial markets in the U.S. gives Allegion the experience and vision to recognize trends and customer needs very early. We move very quickly to adapt technology and spread it into new markets, new businesses and new applications.
Third, thanks to our worldwide engineering and operations, we continue to invest, develop and support global platforms and open standards. This gives us extraordinary flexibility and adaptability to meet the -- and exceed the expectation of both industry professionals and consumers alike.
Allegion had an early commitment to the Internet of Things, and today, we see dividends of our leadership in this dramatic high-growth space.
Before I turn the call over to Patrick, I want to thank -- provide some comments with regard to our European transformation. We have seen positive results from the work done by our team in the region under the leadership of Lucia Moretti. The transformation is changing the way EMEIA does business. The team is focusing its efforts on developing comprehensive solutions for verticals and enhancing specific capabilities across the region. This approach creates demand and additional customer value. They are also simplifying and streamlining systems and processes to better serve its customers into becoming a more agile organization. Last, the EMEIA team is optimizing its assets to drive enterprise excellence.
In the second quarter, Allegion announced its intention to implement a restructuring plan in CISA's Italian operations. The objective of this plan, in line with the region's overall transformation, is to improve CISA's competitive position, ensure long-term viability and enhance the customer experience. Negotiations are currently underway, and we are working to find the best possible solution for the people affected in accordance with these social parties involved.
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, then I'll be back to discuss our full year 2015 guidance."

Thank you for joining the call this morning.
Please go to Slide #6. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth in the second quarter, as well as our growth by regional segment.
As indicated, we delivered 5.8% organic growth in the second quarter, supported by incremental volume that reflects improving market fundamentals, price improvements and early traction on our key organic growth investments and products and channels.
We realized good growth across most product segments and continued to experience favorable traction on our electronic products portfolio, which grew more than 20%. As expected, currency rates continue to be a headwind to revenue growth noted by the negative 9.3% decline. All reporting segments were impacted. Most notably, the weaker euro in EMEIA, softer Canadian dollar and Venezuelan bolivar devaluation impact in the Americas results. In Asia Pacific, the impact of weaker Australian and New Zealand dollars were offset by acquisitions in the region. As a result of unfavorable exchange rates, reported revenue decreased 2.3% compared to the prior year period.

Reported net revenues for the quarter were $519.5 million. This reflects a decrease of 2.3% versus the prior year, up 5.8% on an organic basis. Americas revenue grew 0.3%, up 7.2% on an organic basis. U.S. nonresidential and residential segments provided balanced growth.
EMEIA revenues were down 17.1%, driven primarily by currency headwinds. Asia Pacific revenues were up 13.2% with good traction in residential electronic locks and contributions from acquisitions. Adjusted operating income of $101.2 million was essentially flat compared to the prior year. Incremental volume leverage compensated were increased investment spending.
Adjusted operating margin of 19.5% reflects an increase of 40 basis points versus the prior year. Incremental investments made in areas of new product development, channel and market expansion and certain infrastructure programs had an impact of 140 basis points on the quarter. The impact of incremental investment comparisons get easier in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter.
We are in the early stage of new product and channel initiatives and are encouraged by the early feedback from the market. We continue to navigate the currency headwind but still expect margin rates to improve in all regions for the full year.
Please go to Slide #8. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the second quarter.
For the second quarter 2014, reported EPS was $0.53. Adjusting for prior year one-time separation and restructuring expenses of $0.08, the 2014 adjusted EPS was $0.61.
Operational results increased EPS by $0.11 as pricing, productivity and favorable operating leverage more than offset inflation. As noted on the chart, this includes a favorable $0.01 per share related to a reduction in year-over-year bad debt adjustments in the Asia Pacific region. The decrease in adjusted effective tax rate to 22.3% drove $0.09 per share improvement versus the prior year. Interest expense improvements from the credit facility amendment in 2014 added $0.01 and other net items were a $0.02 reduction, primarily due to unfavorable currency exchange losses and related expenses.
Next, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and IT investments were a $0.05 reduction.
And lastly, the net year-over-year impact of Venezuela at current exchange rates is a $0.04 reduction. This results in adjusted second quarter 2015 EPS of $0.71 per share.
Continuing on, we have a negative $0.05 per share reduction for restructuring and acquisition expenses. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at the second quarter 2015 reported EPS of $0.66.

Second quarters for the Americas region were $402.1 million, up 0.3% or an increase of 7.2% on an organic basis. Higher volumes, pricing and contribution from the acquisition of Zero compensated for unfavorable currency movements in Canada and Venezuela. The higher volumes reflect balanced organic growth in both residential and nonresidential markets as well as electronics growth exceeding 20%, with strong contributions from both residential and nonresidential products. This reflects better-than-market performance driven by our new products and channel initiatives.
Americas' adjusted operating income of $111.9 million was up 0.9% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points while absorbing incremental investment spending that created a 70 basis point headwind in the quarter.
Please go to Slide #10.
Second quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $83.9 million, down 17.1% and down 0.3% on an organic basis. Currency headwind continues to be a challenge in the region due to the softening euro and the Russian ruble, which impacts Eastern European sales. Slightly lower organic volume was offset by favorable pricing and net acquisition contributions.
Electronics growth was also strong in the region. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $4.3 million was up $2.2 million or 104.8% versus the prior year period on revenues that were down more than 17%.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 300 basis points, primarily due to favorable pricing and productivity that more than offset inflation, investment and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. Our EMEIA results continued to improve, and we continue the transformation work that not only reshapes and resizes the business, but also scales the business with strategic acquisitions. The company continues to target an operating margin of 10% for the base business in 2016 through ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives, specific customer and market pricing actions and the elimination of unprofitable business.
Please go to Slide #11.
Second quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $33.5 million, up 13.2%. Improved residential electronic lock growth, pricing and the impact of acquisitions more than offset unfavorable currency exchange rate movements. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income of negative $1.4 million was up $1.9 million or 57.6% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 690 basis points due to incremental pricing, productivity and acquisitions, which offset inflation and currency exchange impacts. Results also reflect a year-over-year improvement in bad debt adjustments of $1.2 million.
Please go to Slide #12.
Year-to-date, available cash flow for 2015 was $14.8 million, a reduction of $24.6 million compared to the prior year period. The reduction in year-over-year cash flow is due to increased operating cash requirements, offset by increased earnings and reduced capital expenditures. And as you know, available cash flow for the business is very seasonal and the majority of our available cash flow is generated in the second half of the year.
We continue to operate with an effective working capital structure and have realized a year-over-year improvement in working capital as a percentage of revenue in every quarter since the spin. In addition, our cash conversion cycle continues to improve with more than a 20% reduction in the second quarter 2015. We continue to guide full year available cash flow of 95% of net earnings from continuing operations, which reflects some one-time tax-related cash expenditures.
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2015 guidance."

Please go to Slide 13.
Looking at full year revenue guidance, we are increasing our growth expectation for the year by a full point. We are increasing total revenue expectations in the Asia Pacific region by 3%, reflecting the inclusion of the Brio acquisition, partially offset by additional currency headwind in Australia and New Zealand.
In the Americas, we are improving total revenue by 1%, supported by first half organic growth and favorable contributions from new product and channel initiatives. We continue to project year-over-year improvements in the U.S. markets. Institutional markets continue to grow slowly with improvement in higher education markets, while K-12 education continues to lag, driven by modest state funding increases.
Our outlook for institutional recovery remains favorable, although we are watching labor availability that may struggle to meet demand in the midterm. Residential construction markets continue to grow as inventory continues to tighten, foreclosure rates are at their highest since 2006 and mortgage rates continue to remain low. However, builders are facing challenges with land availability and labor shortages.
Our revenue outlook remains unchanged for the EMEIA region. I would characterize the market as stable overall but uneven across countries. We see growth in the U.K. and Spain, flat performance in Italy
[Audio Gap]
offset new construction and continued weakness in France.
The Russian ruble depreciation is driving negative revenue growth for our Eastern European business as imports enter that region have declined considerably. In Asia Pacific, we continue to expect favorable growth across the region and see China slowing due to excess of debt and industrial capacity glut and ongoing real estate recession. Australia's residential construction market has been positive, but commercial construction continues to lag expectation. Market growth for the overall Asia Pacific region will remain in the low to mid single-digits for the year.
Inclusive of the revenue update, we are updating our full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations to range -- to a range of $2.70 to $2.80 and a reported EPS of $2.51 to $2.63, which incorporates the first quarter Venezuela devaluation incurred, acquisition expenses in the second quarter and full year estimated expenses related to the announced restructuring plan in Italy. The guidance does not reflect announced acquisitions not yet closed.
Please go to Slide 14.
The second quarter results were very strong and represented solid growth with a 5.8% organic revenue increase, a 40 basis point margin expansion and EPS growth of over 16%. Our markets are essentially as we expected at the beginning of the year, and we continue to make progress on new product introductions in our channel initiatives. Our results demonstrate alignment with our strategic growth pillars, and we continue to expand our acquisition capability as indicated in our recent announcements.
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

And let me -- hey, Josh, let me just -- I'll -- just a follow-on comment just so everyone's clear on that. So that would exclude acquisition- and integration-related expenses. So to the extent we incur additional one-time related costs, i.e., expenses for third-party assistants, whether it will be integration or third-party cost to help complete the transaction, those costs would be excluded from that -- from those accretion numbers."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today.
It's been an exciting quarter for Allegion. Since the last time we spoke, we've announced 3 more acquisitions and communicated further steps in our European transformation. But most importantly, we continue to deliver solid results aligned with our communicated growth strategy and financial expectations.
Revenues of $519 million grew 5.8% on an organic basis. Total revenue declined 2.3%, reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency. The Americas segment grew 7.2% organically, driven by strength in both nonresidential and residential businesses. In EMEIA, market recovered continues to be uneven across countries and organic revenues were relatively flat as expected. In our Asia Pacific region, organic growth of 7.7% was supported with contributions from the hardware businesses and the inclusion of previously announced acquisition of Brio.
Adjusted operating income of $101.2 million was relatively flat to prior year. We realized operating margin expansion in all regions for the quarter and improved overall margin by 40 basis points. It's important to remember that we're showing margin improvement while absorbing incremental investments. Investments from predominantly a new product and channel initiatives created 140-basis point headwind in the quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.71 increased 16.4% versus the prior year, driven primarily from improved operating performance and a lower tax rate, partially offset by incremental investments in foreign exchange impact. This is our fourth straight quarter with double digits earning per share growth. We are raising our full year 2015 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $2.70 to $2.80 per share.
Please go to Slide 4.
As you are aware, one of Allegion's core strategies is to grow through strategic acquisitions. Our strategy has been focused on opportunities that fill certain product gaps, expand our business geographically, provide new innovative technologies that can be leveraged across the business and provide solid financial returns. Since the spin, we've been actively building our capabilities, developing a disciplined [ph] process and expanding our pipeline of opportunities. Since the last earnings release, we announced 3 acquisitions that are an excellent fit with our core business, expand our product and geographical footprint and provide exciting accelerated growth opportunities.
In June, we entered into an agreement to acquire SimonsVoss, a leading electronic lock manufacturer that holds the #1 market position in Germany and #2 market position in Europe with a track record of innovation, product development that complements Allegion's growth strategy. SimonsVoss is not just a forerunner. This company is a pioneer, setting standards for connected products like digital cylinders and smart handles. By adding SimonsVoss to the Allegion business, we are expanding our electronic portfolio in the European market as well as strengthening our global technology in electro-mechanical convergence and miniaturization.
Just last week, we made 2 more acquisitions announcements, starting with Milre Systek. Milre is a market leading manufacturer in South Korea, focusing on producing high-quality and innovative electronic security solutions, including mortise, rim and cabinet locks. Milre has a well-established cadence of operational excellence, which is also highly aligned with Allegion's growth strategy. Combined with this culture of continuous improvement and technical innovations, Milre offers superior quality digital products and creates lasting relationships in the industry that will enhance Allegion's portfolio in South Korea and other Asian markets.
And finally, last week, we announced the acquisition of AXA Stenman, a leading European residential and portable security provider headquartered in the Netherlands. Founded in 1902, AXA manufactures and sells a branded portfolio of bicycle locks and lights and a wide variety of window and door hardware. Joining the Allegion family will enhance AXA's deep local heritage and create more meaningful growth opportunities through innovative product development across Europe and globally. AXA's portable security portfolio is highly synergetic with our Kryptonite business, allowing the 2 brands to leverage one another's extensive customer and channel relationship and product development. AXA Stenman also provides a highly profitable position in the residential security arena in the Dutch market with opportunities to expand into Poland and German markets. In 2015, AXA is expected to generate double-digit revenue growth.
All of these transactions are expected to close in the third quarter, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. We're very excited to welcome these businesses, brands and employees to the Allegion family.
Please go to Slide 5.
Allegion is on the cutting-edge in the security sector with the Internet of Things. We recognized early that the smartphone would be a disruptive innovation in security, and it has certainly become an essential part of creating a responsive environment and managing access.
As Tech Watch recently noted, the connected tone really took hold when Schlage entered the market with its keyless Schlage link lock in 2009. We followed up in 2014 with the launch of ENGAGE technology for the commercial market. And in the first quarter of this year, Allegion unveiled Schlage Sense solution for Apple HomeKit, while in the second quarter, we announced Schlage Control for managing multi-family buildings. All of these connected solutions make Schlage lock a prevalent entry point for home and office automation.
Consider these results. We have the leading security position in retail with channel players like Home Depot, Lowe's and Menards. We are anticipating to sell 1 million electronic locks in 2015. A leading consumer publication recently ranked Schlage locks #1 in both keyless locks and connected locks.
Allegion is a clear thought leader with a strong share of voice on security solutions in the Internet of Things. What's driving these results? We believe 3 unique advantages drive our success in this space. First, Allegion has key partnerships in place with companies like Apple, Chamberlin, CBORD and iDevices, among others. This collaboration expands our footprint and expedites adoption of security products.
Second, our leading position across residential, multi-family and commercial markets in the U.S. gives Allegion the experience and vision to recognize trends and customer needs very early. We move very quickly to adapt technology and spread it into new markets, new businesses and new applications.
Third, thanks to our worldwide engineering and operations, we continue to invest, develop and support global platforms and open standards. This gives us extraordinary flexibility and adaptability to meet the -- and exceed the expectation of both industry professionals and consumers alike.
Allegion had an early commitment to the Internet of Things, and today, we see dividends of our leadership in this dramatic high-growth space.
Before I turn the call over to Patrick, I want to thank -- provide some comments with regard to our European transformation. We have seen positive results from the work done by our team in the region under the leadership of Lucia Moretti. The transformation is changing the way EMEIA does business. The team is focusing its efforts on developing comprehensive solutions for verticals and enhancing specific capabilities across the region. This approach creates demand and additional customer value. They are also simplifying and streamlining systems and processes to better service customers into becoming a more agile organization. Last, the EMEIA team is optimizing its assets to drive enterprise excellence.
In the second quarter, Allegion announced its intention to implement a restructuring plan in CISA's Italian operations. The objective of this plan, in line with the region's overall transformation, is to improve CISA's competitive position, ensure long-term viability and enhance the customer experience. Negotiations are currently underway, and we are working to find the best possible solution for the people affected in accordance with these social parties involved.
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, then I'll be back to discuss our full year 2015 guidance."

Thank you for joining the call this morning.
Please go to Slide #6. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth in the second quarter, as well as our growth by regional segment.
As indicated, we delivered 5.8% organic growth in the second quarter, supported by incremental volume that reflects improving market fundamentals, price improvements and early traction on our key organic growth investments and products and channels.
We realized good growth across most product segments and continued to experience favorable traction on our electronic products portfolio, which grew more than 20%. As expected, currency rates continue to be a headwind to revenue growth noted by the negative 9.3% decline. All reporting segments were impacted. Most notably, the weaker euro in EMEIA, softer Canadian dollar and Venezuelan bolivar devaluation impact in the Americas results. In Asia Pacific, the impact of weaker Australian and New Zealand dollars were offset by acquisitions in the region. As a result of unfavorable exchange rates, reported revenue decreased 2.3% compared to the prior year period.
Please go to Slide #7.
Reported net revenues for the quarter were $519.5 million. This reflects a decrease of 2.3% versus the prior year, up 5.8% on an organic basis. Americas revenue grew 0.3%, up 7.2% on an organic basis. U.S. nonresidential and residential segments provided balanced growth.
EMEIA revenues were down 17.1%, driven primarily by currency headwinds. Asia Pacific revenues were up 13.2% with good traction in residential electronic locks and contributions from acquisitions. Adjusted operating income of $101.2 million was essentially flat compared to the prior year. Incremental volume leverage compensated were increased investment spending.
Adjusted operating margin of 19.5% reflects an increase of 40 basis points versus the prior year. Incremental investments made in areas of new product development, channel and market expansion and certain infrastructure programs had an impact of 140 basis points on the quarter. The impact of incremental investment comparisons get easier in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter.
We are in the early stage of new product and channel initiatives and are encouraged by the early feedback from the market. We continue to navigate the currency headwind but still expect margin rates to improve in all regions for the full year.
Please go to Slide #8. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the second quarter.
For the second quarter 2014, reported EPS was $0.53. Adjusting for prior year one-time separation and restructuring expenses of $0.08, the 2014 adjusted EPS was $0.61.
Operational results increased EPS by $0.11 as pricing, productivity and favorable operating leverage more than offset inflation. As noted on the chart, this includes a favorable $0.01 per share related to a reduction in year-over-year bad debt adjustments in the Asia Pacific region. The decrease in adjusted effective tax rate to 22.3% drove $0.09 per share improvement versus the prior year. Interest expense improvements from the credit facility amendment in 2014 added $0.01 and other net items were a $0.02 reduction, primarily due to unfavorable currency exchange losses and related expenses.
Next, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and IT investments were a $0.05 reduction.
And lastly, the net year-over-year impact of Venezuela at current exchange rates is a $0.04 reduction. This results in adjusted second quarter 2015 EPS of $0.71 per share.
Continuing on, we have a negative $0.05 per share reduction for restructuring and acquisition expenses. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at the second quarter 2015 reported EPS of $0.66.
Please go to Slide #9.
Second quarters for the Americas region were $402.1 million, up 0.3% or an increase of 7.2% on an organic basis. Higher volumes, pricing and contribution from the acquisition of Zero compensated for unfavorable currency movements in Canada and Venezuela. The higher volumes reflect balanced organic growth in both residential and nonresidential markets as well as electronics growth exceeding 20%, with strong contributions from both residential and nonresidential products. This reflects better-than-market performance driven by our new products and channel initiatives.
Americas' adjusted operating income of $111.9 million was up 0.9% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points while absorbing incremental investment spending that created a 70 basis point headwind in the quarter.
Please go to Slide #10.
Second quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $83.9 million, down 17.1% and down 0.3% on an organic basis. Currency headwind continues to be a challenge in the region due to the softening euro and the Russian ruble, which impacts Eastern European sales. Slightly lower organic volume was offset by favorable pricing and net acquisition contributions.
Electronics growth was also strong in the region. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $4.3 million was up $2.2 million or 104.8% versus the prior year period on revenues that were down more than 17%.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 300 basis points, primarily due to favorable pricing and productivity that more than offset inflation, investment and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. Our EMEIA results continued to improve, and we continue the transformation work that not only reshapes and resizes the business, but also scales the business with strategic acquisitions. The company continues to target an operating margin of 10% for the base business in 2016 through ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives, specific customer and market pricing actions and the elimination of unprofitable business.
Please go to Slide #11.
Second quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $33.5 million, up 13.2%. Improved residential electronic lock growth, pricing and the impact of acquisitions more than offset unfavorable currency exchange rate movements. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income of negative $1.4 million was up $1.9 million or 57.6% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 690 basis points due to incremental pricing, productivity and acquisitions, which offset inflation and currency exchange impacts. Results also reflect a year-over-year improvement in bad debt adjustments of $1.2 million.
Please go to Slide #12.
Year-to-date, available cash flow for 2015 was $14.8 million, a reduction of $24.6 million compared to the prior year period. The reduction in year-over-year cash flow is due to increased operating cash requirements, offset by increased earnings and reduced capital expenditures. And as you know, available cash flow for the business is very seasonal and the majority of our available cash flow is generated in the second half of the year.
We continue to operate with an effective working capital structure and have realized a year-over-year improvement in working capital as a percentage of revenue in every quarter since the spin. In addition, our cash conversion cycle continues to improve with more than a 20% reduction in the second quarter 2015. We continue to guide full year available cash flow of 95% of net earnings from continuing operations, which reflects some one-time tax-related cash expenditures.
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2015 guidance."

Please go to Slide 13.
Looking at full year revenue guidance, we are increasing our growth expectation for the year by a full point. We are increasing total revenue expectations in the Asia Pacific region by 3%, reflecting the inclusion of the Brio acquisition, partially offset by additional currency headwind in Australia and New Zealand.
In the Americas, we are improving total revenue by 1%, supported by first half organic growth and favorable contributions from new product and channel initiatives. We continue to project year-over-year improvements in the U.S. markets. Institutional markets continue to grow slowly with improvement in higher education markets, while K-12 education continues to lag, driven by modest state funding increases.
Our outlook for institutional recovery remains favorable, although we are watching labor availability that may struggle to meet demand in the midterm. Residential construction markets continue to grow as inventory continues to tighten, foreclosure rates are at their highest since 2006 and mortgage rates continue to remain low. However, builders are facing challenges with land availability and labor shortages.
Our revenue outlook remains unchanged for the EMEIA region. I would characterize the market as stable overall but uneven across countries. We see growth in the U.K. and Spain, flat performance in Italy
[Audio Gap]
offset new construction and continued weakness in France.
The Russian ruble depreciation is driving negative revenue growth for our Eastern European business as imports into that region have declined considerably. In Asia Pacific, we continue to expect favorable growth across the region and see China slowing due to excessive debt and industrial capacity glut and ongoing real estate recession. Australia's residential construction market has been positive, but commercial construction continues to lag expectation. Market growth for the overall Asia Pacific region will remain in the low- to mid-single-digits for the year.
Inclusive of the revenue update, we are updating our full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations to range -- to a range of $2.70 to $2.80 and a reported EPS of $2.51 to $2.63, which incorporates the first quarter Venezuela devaluation incurred, acquisition expenses in the second quarter and full year estimated expenses related to the announced restructuring plan in Italy. The guidance does not reflect announced acquisitions not yet closed.
Please go to Slide 14.
The second quarter results were very strong and represented solid growth with a 5.8% organic revenue increase, a 40 basis point margin expansion and EPS growth of over 16%. Our markets are essentially as we expected at the beginning of the year, and we continue to make progress on new product introductions in our channel initiatives. Our results demonstrate alignment with our strategic growth pillars, and we continue to expand our acquisition capability as indicated in our recent announcements.
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

In terms of a pipeline, as Dave mentioned, since the spin, it's been all about building capabilities, getting resources, focused on building the pipeline.

I think the last 3 announced transactions in the last 30 days or so is more a factor of just kind of availability, 2 of which were auctioned assets. And so those come and go in ebbs and flows and that type of thing. But we continue to build the pipeline. And we like what we see. We think there's some opportunities that we'd like to pursue, and we're going to continue to do that. In terms of our confidence relative to the integration of the acquisitions, yes, the team there is working on a lot of things, not only the transformation of the business, but also staffing up to integrate the acquired businesses. I like our opportunities there. I think we've got a great team in place there as well as the employees that we've acquired from the businesses. From an integration perspective, we've got a fairly disciplined process. We're going to hire external assistants, third-party provider, to help us accelerate the process to really focus on the value drivers and the synergies that's attached to the acquisitions. We've got teams in place, and we're beginning to work on the necessary activities to integrate the businesses.

I'm pleased to report another strong quarter for Allegion with nice organic growth and operating margin expansion.

I'm pleased to report another strong quarter for Allegion with nice organic growth and operating margin expansion. There has been a tremendous amount of positive activity during this past quarter and we'll be covering in today's call. 
Revenues of $544 million grew 5.1% on an organic basis. Total revenue declined four tenths of a percent, reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency. Of note, organic growth for the businesses has averaged more than 6% over the last 12 months. And our electronics portfolio continues to perform well in the quarter improving more than 30% versus prior year. We have seen a continuous acceleration of the electronic growth rate, reflective of the ongoing electromechanical transformation and supportive of our increased investment in accelerating new electronic security products and solutions. 
The Americas segment grew 7% organically, driven by continued strength in both the nonresidential and residential business. In EMEIA, organic growth of 2% reflects a slight improvement in the region, although market recovery continues to be mixed across countries. Our one decline this quarter is in the Asia Pacific region with negative organic growth of 10%. Patrick will provide more details on this later, but the decline is primarily driven by weakness in our system integration business in China. 
Adjusted operating income of $160.8 million increased 5.3% versus the prior year. We realized operating margin expansion in all regions and improved overall margin by 120 basis points. We continue to show margin improvement while absorbing incremental investments, investments predominantly in new products and channel initiatives created a 90 basis point headwind in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 increased 35% versus the prior year, driven primarily from improved operating performance, acquisition and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by incremental investments and foreign exchange impacts. This is our fifth straight quarter with double-digit earnings per share growth. We are raising our full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance of a -- to a range of $2.85 to $2.90 per share. 
Please go to Slide 4. We have been extremely active as a company affecting change in line with our long-term growth strategies. I'm happy to report that we successfully closed the 3 acquisitions mentioned last quarter within the expected time frame. We are well underway with the integration work and have already seen contribution in our third quarter results. We are excited to realize the benefits of a broader electronics portfolio as well as seeing the expansion of our position as a global leader in portable security. 
During the quarter, we completed the divestiture of our Venezuela business. This decision was made to reduce risks associated with an uncertain economic operating environment. Also in the quarter, we announced our intent to sell a majority stake in our Bocom Wincent business in China. Although a market leader in the system integration industry in China, this business was not deemed to be a good strategic fit with the rest of the Allegion portfolio. The sale has the benefit of reducing risk to the environment that is currently realizing its economic flowing combined with tightened credit and reduces the high cap capital requirements of the business. This decision allows us to prioritize efforts and resources on core mechanical and electronic hardware solutions. And earlier this month, we reached an agreement with regard to the restructuring plans for our CISA business in Italy that will ensure long-term viability enhance the customer experience. CISA remains a critical part of the European portfolio and will continue to provide innovative solutions for convergence of mechanical and electronic technologies. In conjunction with the plan, we will begin to transition products of nonspecialized products to Flex, an existing supplier of Allegion today. Flex offers innovative design, engineering, manufacturing, real-time supply chain insight and logistical services to companies of all sizes in various industries around today's connected world. By partnering with Flex, we will simplify and optimize our supply chain, reducing risks associated with the transition and will better serve our customer needs. And last, we enhanced our debt structure with the issuance of 300 million of senior notes as well as completing an amendment and extension of our senior credit facility. The proceeds of the senior notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility as a result of the previous completed acquisitions. 
Please go to Slide 5. On September 1, we launched pre-orders for Schlage newest Internet of Things innovation, the Schlage Sense Mark Deadbolt at amazon.com, homedepot.com and build.com. Schlage Sense is one of the strongest, most intelligent Bluetooth enabled locks on the market with the highest industry rating for security and durability. It's designed to work with Apple HomeKit, allowing users to control their doorlock as part of their smartphone. Apple HomeKit technology provides advanced security with end-to-end encryption and authentication between the Schlage Sense Mark Deadbolt and an iPhone, an iPad or an iPod Touch. With an Apple TV at home, users can enjoy the convenience of remote access. Additionally, HomeKit let's consumers talk to their -- to unlock their Schlage Sense using Siri voice control. In November, Schlage Sense will be available in Apple Stores and online. This lock has received media attention from large industry [indiscernible] like CNET and Hardware Building Supply Viewer, along with praise with tech industry publications like Mashable, Tech Crunch and Mac Rumors. I'm also proud to say it's been featured by large national media outlets like Fortune and CNBC. Schlage Sense will be officially be available in retail in November in selected Big Box stores like Home Depot and Lowe's. 
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back up to update you on our full year 2015 guidance."

Please go to Slide #6. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth in the third quarter as well as our growth by regional segment. As indicated, we delivered 5.1% organic growth in the third quarter supported by incremental volume that reflects improving market fundamentals, price improvements and early traction on our key organic growth investments and products and channels. We realized solid organic growth in the Americas and EMEIA segments. As expected, unfavorable foreign currency rates continue to be a headwind to revenue growth noted by the negative 7.5% decline. All reporting segments were impacted by currency due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against currencies in EMEIA and Asia Pacific as well as the devaluation of Venezuelan Bolivar. Acquisition and divestitures provided 2% of growth, which includes contributions from acquisitions offset by Venezuelan divestiture. 
Please go to Slide #7. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $544.5 million. This reflects a decrease of 0.4% versus the prior year, up 5.1% on an organic basis. We realized strong organic growth in Americas and EMEIA across most product segments. We continue to experience great progress in electronic product growth, up over 30% compared to the prior-year period. This growth was across both residential and commercial segments and is the result of new products and accelerated adoption of electronic products. 
Adjusted operating income of $116.8 million grew 5.3% compared to the prior year. Incremental volume leverage and acquisitions compensated for increased investment spending and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. Adjusted operating margin of 21.5% reflects an increase of 120 basis points versus the prior year. Incremental investments made in the areas of new product development, channel and market expansion and certain infrastructure programs have a negative impact of 90 basis points on the quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.7% is a record performance since the company went public in December 2013. 
Please go to Slide #8. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2014, reported EPS was $0.65, adjusting for prior year onetime separation and restructuring expenses of $0.03, the 2014 adjusted EPS was $0.68. Operational results increased EPS by $0.12 as pricing, productivity and favorable operating leverage were more than offset inflation and unfavorable currency exchange impacts. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate drove $0.15 per share improvement versus the prior year. The improvement reflects favorable changes in the mix of income earned and lower rate jurisdictions and the benefit of discrete tax items recorded in the quarter. Acquisitions and interest expense added $0.02, as did other net items. Next, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and IT investments were a $0.03 reduction. And lastly, the net year-over-year impact of Venezuela at current exchange rates is a $0.04 reduction. These result in adjusted third quarter 2015 EPS of $0.92 per share. 
Continuing on, we have a negative $1.20 per share reduction for charges related to the Bocom Wincent and Venezuelan business divestitures as well as acquisition and restructuring expenses. After giving effect to these onetime items, we arrived at the third quarter 2015 reported EPS of negative $0.28. 
Please go to Slide #9. Third quarter revenues for the Americas region were $418.9 million, down 1% or an increase of 7% on an organic basis. Higher volumes, pricing and contribution from the acquisition of Zero compensated for unfavorable currency movements in Canada, in Venezuela and the divestiture of the Venezuelan business. The higher volumes reflect strong organic growth in both residential and nonresidential products. This reflects better-than-market performance driven by our new product and channel initiatives. Americas adjusted operating income of $122.2 million was down 1% versus the prior-year period. Pricing and productivity more than offset inflation and investment, while incremental volume was absorbed by unfavorable foreign exchange rates in the Venezuelan divestiture. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points while absorbing incremental investment spending that created a 70 basis point headwind in the quarter and unfavorable mix due to the Venezuelan divestiture. 
Please go to Slide #10. Third quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $91.5 million, up 2.2% growth both on a reported and an organic basis. The growth was driven by strong pricing within the mechanical business and modest volume increases. Significant ongoing currency headwinds were offset by recent acquisitions completed in the quarter. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $5.9 million was up $4.7 million or 392% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 510 basis points, reflected continued improvements in an ongoing business transformation as well as partial quarter contributions from the recent acquisitions, which were accretive to the region's margins. 
Please go to Slide #11. Third quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $34.1 million, flat to the prior year. Revenues were down 10.2% on an organic basis. Strength in the hardware business and acquisitions offset unfavorable foreign exchange and a decline in the Bocom Wincent system integration business. The decline reflects the slowdown of the China business environment and the delay of a few large projects. Note that this business historically relies on large project awards in the second half of the year. During the third quarter, projects in the pipeline have been delayed, resulting a year-over-year reduction of revenue of approximately $6 million or negative 36%. We also expect an impact to the fourth quarter organic growth rates, which Dave will discuss later. Of note, the announced divestiture of Bocom Wincent to assist future risk inherent in the seasonal nature of the business both in terms of size and timing of awards. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income of $0.7 million was up $1.2 million or 240% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 360 basis points due to the mixed shift of hardware volume, productivity and acquisitions, which offset inflation and currency exchange impacts. 
Please go to Slide #12. Year-to-date available cash flow for 2015 was $98.7 million, a reduction of $36.3 million compared to the prior-year period. The reduction in year-over-year cash flow was due to increased operating cash requirements and onetime cash tax payments partially offset by reduced capital expenditures. We continue to operate with an effective working capital structure and continue to see improvement in working capital as a percentage of revenue as well as our cash conversion cycle. We expect full year available cash flow for the business to be approximately $200 million. This guidance incorporates a reduction in anticipated 2015 collections for our Bocom Wincent business and slightly higher working capital requirements. 
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2015 guidance."

Looking at full year revenue guidance, we are increasing our growth expectations for the full year by a point. In the Americas, we're improving organic revenue growth by 50 basis points, [indiscernible] the third quarter results. Reported full year revenue growth for the Americas remains consistent to prior guidance as the increases in organic revenue is offset by increased currency headwinds. We've seen end markets as unchanged from prior guidance with regard to verticals or construction growth. 
Total revenue for EMEIA region now reflects the inclusion of the SimonsVoss and AXA acquisitions, while organic growth guidance remains unchanged. The largest change occurs within our Asia Pacific region where we now forecast organic revenue to decline for the full year by negative 13% to 15%. This impact flows through the total Asia Pacific revenues that are primarily offset by the inclusion of the Milre acquisition. 
As Patrick mentioned earlier, when discussing Q3 results, the revenue call down [ph] is related to the Bocom Wincent system integration business where we now forecast a number of large projects to be delayed until 2016. And note that we would continue to include Bocom Wincent in our guidance as announced, but not yet closed transaction. Furthermore, margins for Bocom Wincent are historically strongest in the fourth quarter due to increased volume, which compensates for operating losses in the first 3 quarters. Given the reduction of volume, we expect full year margin for Asia Pacific to be down from prior year and close to breakeven. We estimate the earnings impact of a lower Bocom Wincent revenues in the fourth quarter to be a headwind of approximately $0.05 versus prior guidance. Inclusive of this impact, we are still able to increase full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations to the range of $2.85 to $2.90. This reflects an improvement of our adjusted effective tax rate now estimated to be 20% for the full year and improved operational performance. Furthermore, this incorporates the impact of acquisitions as well as increased interest expense related to the new senior notes.

The third quarter results were very strong and represented solid growth with a 5.1% organic revenue increase, a 120 basis point margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share growth of over 35%. From a market perspective, the trends for the U.S. market are still leaning positive, although economic data remains choppy. And after a long recessionary cycle, we are seeing signs of slight improvements in our primary European geographies. In Asia Pacific, China growth is accelerating, while other countries outside China are holding. Overall, the business continues to perform well, and we are executing at a high level. We're making the top portfolio decisions that need to be made and we'll continue to execute on our strategies to drive profitable growth and customer satisfaction. 
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

I'm pleased to report another strong quarter for Allegion with nice organic growth and operating margin expansion. There has been a tremendous amount of positive activity during this past quarter, and we'll be covering in today's call. 
Revenues of $544 million grew 5.1% on an organic basis. Total revenue declined 0.4%, reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency. Of note, organic growth for the business has averaged more than 6% over the last 12 months. And our electronics portfolio continues to perform well in the quarter, improving more than 30% versus prior year. We have seen a continuous acceleration of the electronics growth rate, reflected of a ongoing electromechanical transformation and supportive of our increased investment in accelerating new electronic security products and solutions. 
The Americas segment grew 7% organically, driven by continued strength in both the nonresidential and residential business. In EMEIA, organic growth of 2% reflects a slight improvement in the region, although market recovery continues to be mixed across countries. Our one decline this quarter is in the Asia Pacific region with negative organic growth of 10%. Patrick will provide more details on this later, but the decline is primarily driven by weaknesses in our system integration business in China. 
Adjusted operating income of $116.8 million increased 5.3% versus the prior year. We realized operating margin expansion in all regions and improved overall margin by 120 basis points. We continue to show margin improvement while absorbing incremental investments, investments predominantly in new product and channel initiatives creating the 90 basis point headwind in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 increased 35% versus the prior year, driven primarily from improved operating performance, acquisition and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by incremental investments and foreign exchange impact. This is our fifth straight quarter with double-digit earnings per share growth. We are raising our full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance of a -- to a range of $2.85 to $2.90 per share. 
Please go to Slide 4. We have been extremely active as a company affecting change in line with our long-term growth strategies. I'm happy to report that we successfully closed the 3 acquisitions mentioned last quarter within the expected time frame. We are well underway with the integration work, and have already seen contribution in our third quarter results. We are excited to realize the benefits of a broader electronics portfolio as well as seeing the expansion of our position as a global leader in portable security. 
During the quarter, we completed the divestiture of our Venezuela business. This decision was made to reduce risk associated with an uncertain economic operating environment. Also in the quarter, we announced our intent to sell a majority stake in our Bocom Wincent business in China. Although a market leader in the system integration industry in China, this business was not deemed to be a good strategic fit with the rest of the Allegion portfolio. The sale has the benefit of reducing risk in an environment that is currently realizing a economic flowing combined with tightening credit, and reduces the high cap -- capital requirements of the business. This decision allows us to prioritize efforts and resources on core mechanical and electronic hardware solutions. And earlier this month, we reached an agreement with regard to the restructuring plan for our CISA business in Italy that will ensure a long-term viability enhance the customer experience. CISA remains a critical part of the European portfolio, and will continue to provide innovative solutions for convergence of mechanical and electronic technologies. In conjunction with the plan, we will begin to transition products of nonspecialized product to Flex, an existing supplier of Allegion today. Flex offers innovative design, engineering, manufacturing, real-time supply chain insight and logistical services to companies of all sizes in various industries around today's connected world. By partnering with Flex, we will simplify and optimize our supply chain, reducing risks associated with the transition, and will better serve our customer needs. And last, we enhanced our debt structure with the issuance of $300 million of senior notes as well as completing an amendment and extension of our senior credit facility. The proceeds of the senior notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility as a result of the previous completed acquisitions. 
Please go to Slide 5. On September 1, we launched pre-orders for Schlage's newest Internet of Things innovation, the Schlage Sense Smart Deadbolt at amazon.com, homedepot.com and build.com. Schlage Sense is one of the strongest, most intelligent Bluetooth enabled locks on the market with the highest industry ratings for security and durability.

241782379,312130369,885849,"Allegion Plc, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Allegion plc","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone.

Please go to Slide #6. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth in the third quarter as well as our growth by regional segments. As indicated, we delivered 5.1% organic growth in the third quarter, supported by incremental volume that reflects improving market fundamentals, price improvements and early traction on our key organic growth investments and products and channels. We realized solid organic growth in Americas and EMEIA segments. As expected, unfavorable foreign currency rates continue to be a headwind to revenue growth noted by the negative 7.5% decline. All reporting segments were impacted by currency due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against currencies in EMEIA and Asia Pacific as well as the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar. Acquisitions and divestitures provided 2% of growth, which includes contributions from acquisitions offset by Venezuelan divestiture. 
Please go to Slide #7. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $544.5 million. This reflects a decrease of 0.4% versus the prior year, up 5.1% on an organic basis. We realized strong organic growth in Americas and EMEIA across most product segments. We continue to experience great progress in electronic product growth, up over 30% compared to the prior-year period. This growth was across both residential and commercial segments, and is the result of new products and accelerated adoption of electronic products. 
Adjusted operating income of $116.8 million grew 5.3% compared to the prior year. Incremental volume leverage and acquisitions compensated for increased investment spending and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. Adjusted operating margin of 21.5% reflects an increase of 120 basis points versus the prior year. Incremental investments made in the areas of new product development, channel and market expansion and certain infrastructure programs had a negative impact of 90 basis points on the quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.7% is a record performance since the company went public in December 2013. 
Please go to Slide #8. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter 2014, reported EPS was $0.65, adjusting for prior year onetime separation and restructuring expenses of $0.03, the 2014 adjusted EPS was $0.68. Operational results increased EPS by $0.12 as pricing, productivity and favorable operating leverage were more than offset inflation and unfavorable currency exchange impacts. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate drove $0.15 per share improvement versus the prior year. The improvement reflects favorable changes in the mix of income earned and lower rate jurisdictions, and the benefit of discrete tax items recorded in the quarter. Acquisitions and interest expense added $0.02, as did other net items. Next, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and IT investments were a $0.03 reduction. And lastly, the net year-over-year impact of Venezuela at current exchange rates is a $0.04 reduction. This results in adjusted third quarter 2015 EPS of $0.92 per share. 
Continuing on, we have a negative $1.20 per share reduction for charges related to the Bocom Wincent and Venezuelan business divestitures as well as acquisition and restructuring expenses. After giving effect to these onetime items, we arrived at the third quarter 2015 reported EPS of negative $0.28. 
Please go to Slide #9. Third quarter revenues for the Americas region were $418.9 million, down 1% or an increase of 7% on an organic basis. Higher volumes, pricing and contribution from the acquisition of Zero compensated for unfavorable currency movements in Canada, in Venezuela and the divestiture of the Venezuelan business. The higher volumes reflect strong organic growth in both residential and nonresidential products. This reflects better-than-market performance driven by our new product and channel initiatives. Americas adjusted operating income of $122.2 million was down 1% versus the prior-year period. Pricing and productivity more than offset inflation and investment, while incremental volume was absorbed by unfavorable foreign exchange rates in the Venezuelan divestiture. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points, while absorbing incremental investment spending that created a 70 basis point headwind in the quarter and unfavorable mix due to the Venezuelan divestiture. 
Please go to Slide #10. Third quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $91.5 million, up 2.2% both on a reported and in an organic basis. The growth was driven by strong pricing within the mechanical business and modest volume increases. Significant ongoing currency headwinds were offset by recent acquisitions completed in the quarter. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $5.9 million was up $4.7 million or 392% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 510 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in an ongoing business transformation as well as partial quarter contributions from the recent acquisitions which were accretive to the region's margins. 
Please go to Slide #11. Third quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $34.1 million, flat to the prior year. Revenues were down 10.2% on an organic basis. Strength in the hardware business and acquisitions offset unfavorable foreign exchange and a decline in the Bocom Wincent system integration business. The decline reflects the slowdown of the China business environment and the delay of a few large projects. Note that this business historically relies on large project awards in the second half of the year. During the third quarter, projects in the pipeline have been delayed, resulting in a year-over-year reduction in revenue of approximately $6 million or negative 36%. We also expect an impact to the fourth quarter organic growth rates, which Dave will discuss later. Of note, the announced divestiture of Bocom Wincent reduces future risk inherent in the seasonal nature of the business both in terms of size and timing of awards. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income of $0.7 million was up $1.2 million or 240% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 360 basis points due to the mixed shift of hardware volume, productivity and acquisitions which offset inflation and currency exchange impacts. 
Please go to Slide #12. Year-to-date available cash flow for 2015 was $98.7 million, a reduction of $36.3 million compared to the prior-year period. The reduction in year-over-year cash flow was due to increased operating cash requirements and onetime cash tax payments, partially offset by reduced capital expenditures. We continue to operate with an effective working capital structure and continue to see improvement in working capital as a percentage of revenue as well as our cash conversion cycle. We expect full year available cash flow for the business to be approximately $200 million. This guidance incorporates a reduction in anticipated 2015 collections for our Bocom Wincent business and slightly higher working capital requirements. 
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2015 guidance."
241782379,312130369,885849,"Allegion Plc, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Allegion plc","Executives","Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide 13. Looking at full year revenue guidance, we are increasing our growth expectations for the full year by 1 point. In the Americas, we're improving organic revenue growth by 50 basis points reflecting the third quart",489,"Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide 13. Looking at full year revenue guidance, we are increasing our growth expectations for the full year by 1 point. In the Americas, we're improving organic revenue growth by 50 basis points reflecting the third quarter results. Reported full year revenue growth for the Americas remains consistent to prior guidance as the increases in organic revenue is offset by increased currency headwinds. We see the end markets as unchanged from prior guidance with regard to verticals or construction growth. 
Total revenue for EMEIA region now reflects the inclusion of the SimonsVoss and AXA acquisitions, while organic growth guidance remains unchanged. The largest change occurs within our Asia Pacific region where we now forecast organic revenues to decline for the full year by negative 13% to 15%. This impact flows through the total Asia Pacific revenues that are primarily offset by the inclusion of the Milre acquisition. 
As Patrick mentioned earlier, when discussing Q3 results, the revenue call down is related to the Bocom Wincent system integration business where we now forecast a number of large projects to be delayed until 2016. And note that we would continue to include Bocom Wincent in our guidance as announced, but not yet closed transaction. Furthermore, margins for Bocom Wincent are historically strongest in the fourth quarter due to increased volume, which compensates for operating losses in the first 3 quarters. Given the reduction in volume, we expect full year margins for Asia Pacific to be down from prior year and close to breakeven. We estimate the earnings impact of the lower Bocom Wincent revenues in the fourth quarter to be a headwind of approximately $0.05 versus prior guidance. Inclusive of this impact, we are still able to increase full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations to a range of $2.85 to $2.90. This reflects an improvement of our adjusted effective tax rate now estimated to be 20% for the full year and improved operational performance. Furthermore, this incorporates the impact of acquisitions as well as increased interest expense related to the new senior notes. 
Please go to Slide 14. The third quarter results were very strong and represented solid growth with a 5.1% organic revenue increase, a 120 basis point margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share growth of over 35%. From a market perspective, the trends for the U.S. market are still leaning positive, although economic data, it remains choppy. And after a long recessionary cycle, we are seeing signs of slight improvements in our primary European geographies. In Asia Pacific, China growth is decelerating, while other countries outside China are holding. Overall, the business continues to perform well, and we are executing at a high level. We're making the top portfolio decisions that need to be made, and we'll continue to execute on our strategies to drive profitable growth and customer satisfaction. 
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

I'm pleased to report another strong quarter for Allegion with nice organic growth and operating margin expansion.

I'm pleased to report another strong quarter for Allegion with nice organic growth and operating margin expansion. There has been a tremendous amount of positive activity during this past quarter, and we'll be covering in today's call. 
Revenues of $544 million grew 5.1% on an organic basis. Total revenue declined 0.4%, reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency. Of note, organic growth for the business has averaged more than 6% over the last 12 months. And our electronics portfolio continues to perform well in the quarter, improving more than 30% versus prior year. We have seen a continuous acceleration of the electronics growth rate, reflected of a ongoing electromechanical transformation and supportive of our increased investment in accelerating new electronic security products and solutions. 
The Americas segment grew 7% organically, driven by continued strength in both the nonresidential and residential business. In EMEIA, organic growth of 2% reflects a slight improvement in the region, although market recovery continues to be mixed across countries. Our one decline this quarter is in the Asia Pacific region with negative organic growth of 10%. Patrick will provide more details on this later, but the decline is primarily driven by weakness in our system integration business in China. 
Adjusted operating income of $116.8 million increased 5.3% versus the prior year. We realized operating margin expansion in all regions and improved overall margin by 120 basis points. We continue to show margin improvement while absorbing incremental investments, investments predominantly in new product and channel initiatives creating a 90 basis point headwind in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 increased 35% versus the prior year, driven primarily from improved operating performance, acquisition and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by incremental investments and foreign exchange impact. This is our fifth straight quarter with double-digit earnings per share growth. We are raising our full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance of a -- to a range of $2.85 to $2.90 per share. 
Please go to Slide 4. We have been extremely active as a company affecting change in line with our long-term growth strategies. I'm happy to report that we successfully closed the 3 acquisitions mentioned last quarter within the expected time frame. We are well underway with the integration work, and have already seen contribution in our third quarter results. We are excited to realize the benefits of a broader electronics portfolio as well as seeing the expansion of our position as a global leader in portable security. 
During the quarter, we completed the divestiture of our Venezuela business. This decision was made to reduce risk associated with an uncertain economic operating environment. Also in the quarter, we announced our intent to sell a majority stake in our Bocom Wincent business in China. Although a market leader in the system integration industry in China, this business was not deemed to be a good strategic fit with the rest of the Allegion portfolio. The sale has the benefit of reducing risk in an environment that is currently realizing a economic slowing combined with tightening credit, and reduces the high cap -- capital requirements of the business. This decision allows us to prioritize efforts and resources on core mechanical and electronic hardware solutions. And earlier this month, we reached an agreement with regard to the restructuring plan for our CISA business in Italy that will ensure a long-term viability enhance the customer experience. CISA remains a critical part of the European portfolio, and will continue to provide innovative solutions for convergence of mechanical and electronic technologies. In conjunction with the plan, we will begin to transition products of nonspecialized product to Flex, an existing supplier of Allegion today. Flex offers innovative design, engineering, manufacturing, real-time supply chain insight and logistical services to companies of all sizes in various industries around today's connected world. By partnering with Flex, we will simplify and optimize our supply chain, reducing risks associated with the transition, and will better serve our customer needs. And last, we enhanced our debt structure with the issuance of $300 million in senior notes as well as completing an amendment and extension of our senior credit facility. The proceeds of the senior notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility as a result of the previous completed acquisitions. 
Please go to Slide 5. On September 1, we launched pre-orders for Schlage's newest Internet of Things innovation, the Schlage Sense Smart Deadbolt at amazon.com, homedepot.com and build.com. Schlage Sense is one of the strongest, most intelligent Bluetooth enabled locks on the market with the highest industry ratings for security and durability. It's designed to work with Apple HomeKit, allowing users to control their door lock as part of their smart home. Apple HomeKit technology provides advanced security with end-to-end encryption and authentication between the Schlage Sense Smart Deadbolt and an iPhone, an iPad or an iPod Touch. With an Apple TV in the home, users can enjoy the convenience of remote access. Additionally, HomeKit lets consumers talk to the -- to talk to unlock their Schlage Sense using Siri voice control. In November, Schlage Sense will be available in Apple Stores and online. This lock has received media attention from large industry [indiscernible]  like CNET, and Hardware and Building Supply dealer, along with praise from tech industry publications like Mashable, TechCrunch and MacRumors. I'm also proud to say it's been featured by large national media outlets like Fortune and CNBC. Schlage Sense will be officially be available in retail in November in selected Big Box stores like Home Depot and Lowe's. 
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to update you on our full year 2015 guidance."

Please go to Slide #6. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth in the third quarter as well as our growth by regional segments. As indicated, we delivered 5.1% organic growth in the third quarter, supported by incremental volume that reflects improving market fundamentals, price improvements and early traction on our key organic growth investments and products and channels. We realized solid organic growth in Americas and EMEIA segments. As expected, unfavorable foreign currency rates continue to be a headwind to revenue growth noted by the negative 7.5% decline. All reporting segments were impacted by currency due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against currencies in EMEIA and Asia Pacific as well as the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar. Acquisitions and divestitures provided 2% of growth, which includes contributions from acquisitions offset by Venezuelan divestiture. 
Please go to Slide #7. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $544.5 million. This reflects a decrease of 0.4% versus the prior year, up 5.1% on an organic basis. We realized strong organic growth in Americas and EMEIA across most product segments. We continue to experience great progress in electronic product growth, up over 30% compared to the prior-year period. This growth was across both residential and commercial segments, and is the result of new products and accelerated adoption of electronic products. 
Adjusted operating income of $116.8 million grew 5.3% compared to the prior year. Incremental volume leverage and acquisitions compensated for increased investment spending and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. Adjusted operating margin of 21.5% reflects an increase of 120 basis points versus the prior year. Incremental investments made in the areas of new product development, channel and market expansion and certain infrastructure programs had a negative impact of 90 basis points on the quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.7% is a record performance since the company went public in December 2013. 
Please go to Slide #8. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter 2014, reported EPS was $0.65, adjusting for prior year onetime separation and restructuring expenses of $0.03, the 2014 adjusted EPS was $0.68. Operational results increased EPS by $0.12 as pricing, productivity and favorable operating leverage were more than offset inflation and unfavorable currency exchange impacts. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate drove $0.15 per share improvement versus the prior year. The improvement reflects favorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower rate jurisdictions, and the benefit of discrete tax items recorded in the quarter. Acquisitions and interest expense added $0.02, as did other net items. Next, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and IT investments were a $0.03 reduction. And lastly, the net year-over-year impact of Venezuela at current exchange rates is a $0.04 reduction. This results in adjusted third quarter 2015 EPS of $0.92 per share. 
Continuing on, we have a negative $1.20 per share reduction for charges related to the Bocom Wincent and Venezuelan business divestitures as well as acquisition and restructuring expenses. After giving effect to these onetime items, we arrive at the third quarter 2015 reported EPS of negative $0.28. 
Please go to Slide #9. Third quarter revenues for the Americas region were $418.9 million, down 1% or an increase of 7% on an organic basis. Higher volumes, pricing and contribution from the acquisition of Zero compensated for unfavorable currency movements in Canada, in Venezuela and the divestiture of the Venezuelan business. The higher volumes reflect strong organic growth in both residential and nonresidential products. This reflects better-than-market performance driven by our new product and channel initiatives. Americas adjusted operating income of $122.2 million was down 1% versus the prior-year period. Pricing and productivity more than offset inflation and investment, while incremental volume was absorbed by unfavorable foreign exchange rates in the Venezuelan divestiture. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points, while absorbing incremental investment spending that created a 70 basis point headwind in the quarter and unfavorable mix due to the Venezuelan divestiture. 
Please go to Slide #10. Third quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $91.5 million, up 2.2% both on a reported and in an organic basis. The growth was driven by strong pricing within the mechanical business and modest volume increases. Significant ongoing currency headwinds were offset by recent acquisitions completed in the quarter. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $5.9 million was up $4.7 million or 392% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 510 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in an ongoing business transformation as well as partial quarter contributions from the recent acquisitions which were accretive to the region's margins. 
Please go to Slide #11. Third quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $34.1 million, flat to the prior year. Revenues were down 10.2% on an organic basis. Strength in the hardware business and acquisitions offset unfavorable foreign exchange and a decline in the Bocom Wincent system integration business. The decline reflects the slowdown of the China business environment and the delay of a few large projects. Note that this business historically relies on large project awards in the second half of the year. During the third quarter, projects in the pipeline have been delayed, resulting in a year-over-year reduction in revenue of approximately $6 million or negative 36%. We also expect an impact to the fourth quarter organic growth rates, which Dave will discuss later. Of note, the announced divestiture of Bocom Wincent reduces future risk inherent in the seasonal nature of the business both in terms of size and timing of awards. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income of $0.7 million was up $1.2 million or 240% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 360 basis points due to the mix shift of hardware volume, productivity and acquisitions which offset inflation and currency exchange impacts. 
Please go to Slide #12. Year-to-date available cash flow for 2015 was $98.7 million, a reduction of $36.3 million compared to the prior-year period. The reduction in year-over-year cash flow was due to increased operating cash requirements and onetime cash tax payments, partially offset by reduced capital expenditures. We continue to operate with an effective working capital structure and continue to see improvement in working capital as a percentage of revenue as well as our cash conversion cycle. We expect full year available cash flow for the business to be approximately $200 million. This guidance incorporates a reduction in anticipated 2015 collections for our Bocom Wincent business and slightly higher working capital requirements. 
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2015 guidance."

Looking at full year revenue guidance, we are increasing our growth expectations for the full year by 1 point. In the Americas, we're improving organic revenue growth by 50 basis points reflecting the third quart",488,"Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide 13. Looking at full year revenue guidance, we are increasing our growth expectations for the full year by 1 point. In the Americas, we're improving organic revenue growth by 50 basis points reflecting the third quarter results. Reported full year revenue growth for the Americas remains consistent to prior guidance as the increases in organic revenue is offset by increased currency headwinds. We see the end markets as unchanged from prior guidance with regard to verticals or construction growth. 
Total revenue for EMEIA region now reflects the inclusion of the SimonsVoss and AXA acquisitions, while organic growth guidance remains unchanged. The largest change occurs within our Asia Pacific region where we now forecast organic revenues to decline for the full year by negative 13% to 15%. This impact flows through the total Asia Pacific revenues that are primarily offset by the inclusion of the Milre acquisition. 
As Patrick mentioned earlier, when discussing Q3 results, the revenue call down is related to the Bocom Wincent system integration business where we now forecast a number of large projects to be delayed until 2016. And note that we would continue to include Bocom Wincent in our guidance as announced, but not yet closed transaction. Furthermore, margins for Bocom Wincent are historically strongest in the fourth quarter due to increased volume, which compensates for operating losses in the first 3 quarters. Given the reduction in volume, we expect full year margins for Asia Pacific to be down from prior year and close to breakeven. We estimate the earnings impact of the lower Bocom Wincent revenues in the fourth quarter to be a headwind of approximately $0.05 versus prior guidance. Inclusive of this impact, we are still able to increase full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations to a range of $2.85 to $2.90. This reflects an improvement of our adjusted effective tax rate now estimated to be 20% for the full year and improved operational performance. Furthermore, this incorporates the impact of acquisitions as well as increased interest expense related to the new senior notes. 
Please go to Slide 14. The third quarter results were very strong and represented solid growth with a 5.1% organic revenue increase, a 120 basis point margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share growth of over 35%. From a market perspective, the trends for the U.S. market are still leaning positive, although economic data remains choppy. And after a long recessionary cycle, we are seeing signs of slight improvements in our primary European geographies. In Asia Pacific, China growth is decelerating, while other countries outside China are holding. Overall, the business continues to perform well, and we are executing at a high level. We're making the tough portfolio decisions that need to be made, and we'll continue to execute on our strategies to drive profitable growth and customer satisfaction. 
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

The State of California has passed legislation that requires lock with visible signaling capability that you can visually see that is secure for rooms with over 5 people. But there's still a long ways to go on this. We've created a consortium and awareness on this, but we're still in the front end of this initiative. And I think we're providing some good thought leadership in terms of how do we keep students safe, but how do we also create an environment that allows them to exit, if required? I mean, you've got concerns of fire safety as well as violence safety. This is all opportunistic, but it continues to be in its infancy in development and I think lacks funding."
