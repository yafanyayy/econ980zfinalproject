274561,282568590,749874,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2015",2015-01-28,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Erin. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.19 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.36 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $737 million. It was our strongest revenue performance in t",1499,"Thanks, Erin. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.19 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.36 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $737 million. It was our strongest revenue performance in the past 12 quarters, the highest operating earnings ever and the highest earnings from continuing operations. For us, it was a powerful quarter. Incidentally, we beat analyst consensus by $0.06. 
For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share of $7.83 on revenue of $30.85 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.7 billion, a return on sales of 8.7%. It was a year of solid achievement from both an operating perspective and development of significant backlog.
As you can see from schedule H to the press release, funded backlog grew from $38.3 billion at year-end 2013 to $52.9 billion at the end of last year. The story for total backlog is much the same. We were at $45.9 billion at the end of 2013 and sit at $72.4 billion at the end of 2014. As a result, we are well positioned for growth in 2016 and 2017.
Free cash flow from operations was a negative $254 million in the quarter, however, for the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $3.2 billion or [ph] 120% of earnings from continuing operations. This outpaced 2013 by $532 million.
Let me give you some detail on the quarter and the year in each of the business groups. First, Aerospace. Revenue and earnings were up nicely over the year-ago quarter. Sales were up $105 million, 4.9% and earnings were up $64 million, a significant 18.4% on very strong margin improvement. This is particularly impressive among considers that G&A and net R&D were up $40 million over the year-ago quarter. On a sequential basis, sales were up $49 million but earnings were up $1 million on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margins. 
I should add that Jet remained nicely profitable in the quarter with a better contribution on both the year-ago and sequential comparison basis.
The order activity in the quarter was robust as one would expect with the announcement of 2 new aircraft. As you can observe on exhibit H, funded backlog, total backlog and total potential contract value including options are all up significantly.
Even if we were to ignore the orders related to the 2 new aircraft, total orders from current production aircraft were the highest of the year. All large cabin aircraft had a dollar base book-to-bill greater than 1 to 1.
For the year, revenues were $8.65 billion and operating earnings were $1.61 billion on an operating margin of 18.6%. This is a year-over-year improvement of 6.5% on sales, 13.8% on earnings and 120 basis points on operating margin. All in all, a very good year at Aerospace with strong operating leverage.
At Combat Systems, sales were up $23 million or 1.4% and earnings were up $21 million or 8.4% on 110 basis point improvement in operating margin over the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, the story is similar. Sales were up $219 million and earnings were up $39 million. 
For the year, sales were down $100 million or 1.7% and earnings were down $46 million or 5.1%. This compares quite favorably to the guidance we've provided at this time last year. You may recall that we guided to a 4 [ph] to 4.5 revenue decline as opposed to the 1.7% decline that occurred. We also guided to operating margins of 14%, which we beat by 100 basis points.
Overall, Combat Systems is a story of solid additions to backlog, better-than-anticipated revenue and outstanding costs and margin performance. This is a business group that has clearly stabilized.
Marine group revenue in the quarter exceeded $2 billion for the first time ever. Operating earnings of $193 million were the second highest ever recorded. Revenue was up $410 million or 25.2% compared to the year-ago quarter and up $220 million or 12.1%, sequentially. Revenues for the year were up $600 million, almost 9%, very nice growth. 
Operating earnings were up $34 million or 21.4% against the year-ago quarter and up $23 million or 13.5% sequentially. For the full year, earnings were up $37 million or 5.6% on a 30 basis point decline on operating margin, attributable to mix shift, which was consistent with our guidance to you.
In the Marine group, we guided you at this time last year to a revenue increase of 2.5%, which we obviously exceeded. We forecasted margins at 9.5% and round up at 9.6%. All in all, a very good year for the Marine group.
IS&T is a business group where we saw less-than-expected revenue decline and improved operating performance. Revenue in the quarter was $2.47 billion, down $223 million or 8.3% against the year-ago quarter. Revenue was up 9.8% sequentially and down $1.1 billion or 10.8% for the year. Remember that this is dramatically less than the 20% revenue decline we forecasted in our guidance to you at this time last year.
Operating earnings of $212 million in the quarter were 8.2% better than the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $10 million or 5%. For the year, earnings were down only $10 million or 1.3%, which is very good performance in the face of a 10.8% revenue decline. 
On this call a year ago, I gave your guidance with respect to operating margins in the 8.2% range, which we beat by 40 basis points. All in all, we beat forecasted revenue by $1 billion and operating margins by 40 basis points. When that happens, the result is very pleasant upside surprise.
So companywide, on this call a year ago, our guidance for 2014 was to expect revenues of $30 billion, operating margin rate of 12%, a tax rate of 31% and a return on sales of 8%. We round up the year with revenues of $30.85 billion and operating margin rate of 12.6%, an effective tax rate of 29.7% and a return on sales of 8.7%.
We provided EPS guidance of $6.80 to $6.85. We round up at $7.83. About $0.62 of the improvement came from better-than-planned operating performance, $0.13 from slightly lower-than-planned tax rate and the balance from share count as a result of share repurchases.
So let me provide you some thoughts about 2015, initially by business group and then on a companywide rollup. In Aerospace, we expect revenues to be approximately $9.4 billion, up about 8.3%. Margin rate should be approximately 18%, somewhat down from 2014 attributable in part to less favorability at Jet, nonetheless, up about 4.5% in earnings.
In Combat Systems, we expect both revenue and earnings to be essentially flat with growth resuming in 2016 and beyond. The Marine group is expected to have revenue growth of 2% to 2.5% and a margin rate in the 9.5% range, resulting in a very modest improvement to operating earnings.
Finally, in IS&T, we expect a revenue decline of about 5.5% but improved margin rate of slightly more than 9%. This will result in improved operating earnings year-over-year. We expect the last year to be our low watermark for revenue. In part, we are seeing some of the decline we anticipated last year being delayed into this year. Once again, we should see revenue growth in 2016 and 2017.
All of this rolls up to an operating plan of about $31.3 billion to $31.5 billion of revenue, EBIT rate around 12.8% and a return on sales of roughly 8.7%. This plan is purely from operations, assumes a 30.5% tax rate, assumes we buy enough shares to hold the share count steady with a year-end figures so as not to permit dilution from option exercise. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $8.05 to $8.10 per fully diluted share. This compares with last year's guidance of $6.80 to $6.85 at the same time on the same basis. So much like last year, beating our guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan and the effect of share repurchases.
So how should one think about the quarterly progression of EPS? Whatever your model is for the year divided by 4 and the first and second quarters will be light by about $0.10, the third quarter about right on and the fourth quarter about $0.20 better. By the way, quarterly progression is notoriously difficult.
With respect to capital deployment, we're anticipating using all of our free cash flow in 2015 for dividends and share repurchases. While we don't anticipate a robust year from a free cash flow perspective in light of the advanced payments on international orders that we have received last year, we intend to treat the free cash available for dividends and share repurchases on a -- on some normalized basis. In short, we will use balance sheet cash as necessary to normalize the year.
I would now like to call turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken."
274561,282568590,749874,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2015",2015-01-28,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll take just a minute and cover a few miscellaneous financial items before the question-and-answer period.Net interest expense in the quarter was $19 million versus $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. And for",445,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll take just a minute and cover a few miscellaneous financial items before the question-and-answer period.
Net interest expense in the quarter was $19 million versus $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. And for the year, interest expense was $86 million, consistent with the year before. For 2015, we expect net interest expense of around $82 million, a decline from 2014 resulting from the repayment of $500 million of fixed rate notes that matured last week.
At the end of the year, our balance sheet reflects a net cash position, that's cash in excess of debt, of $477 million. This was down by about $1 billion from the end of 2013 reflecting the cash we used from the balance sheet for capital deployment activities, which I'll address in just a minute.
Our effective tax rate was 29.5% for the quarter and 29.7% for the year, and that's a bit lower than we have been forecasting. As you'll recall, our most recent productions were in the neighborhood of 30% to 30.5%. The lower outcome is attributable to the R&D tax credit extension in late December.
For 2015, as Phebe mentioned, we expect an effective tax rate of around 30.5%.
And finally on the income statement, you'll notice we took a charge in the quarter in discontinued operations. This is related to the sale of our AxleTech business, which we first reported in the second quarter when we made the decision to sell that business. The charge we took at that time is predicated on a 2014 closing of the sale. The regulatory review process for the transaction delayed the closing until the 5th of January. And as a result, we were not able to take advantage of some tax benefits we had anticipated so we adjusted the loss on the sale in the fourth quarter.
Switching gears, we contributed $515 million to our pension plans in 2014. And for 2015, we expect that amount to decline to approximately $185 million as a result of the interest rate released from the highway and transportation funding act of 2014.
On the capital deployment front, to summarize our activities for the year, we delivered on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. In total, we expended [ph] approximately $3.4 billion on share repurchases in 2014. And when you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we spent $4.2 billion in shareholder friendly actions in 2014 or 1.3x our free cash flow from operations for the year.
Erin, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A."

We're increasing mid-cabin by 10 units. So there's a somewhat unfavorable mix shift between large and midsized green. We've got less of a contribution at Jet primarily and exclusively driven by mixed shift. We've got higher R&D in this upcoming year.

That moved to the right, a quarter from third quarter of last year as a result of our good order activity. The G550 is about 12 months out. The G450, late this year. So that moved a couple of months, just a few months into the last [ph]. The G280 is also available, first available late this year, and not that anybody asked but the G150 is first quarter 2016.

We talked've frequently about margin variability at the Marine group. It's really a mixed shift.

More Block IV, less Block III, more commercial work coming off of the MLP program and first-of-class ships on the DDG-1000 and DDG-51 restart. That said, these businesses have continued to perform very, very well on cost cutting efficiency and their performance has been quite good and I frankly expect to see margin expansion, primarily driven by Block IV as we have increased margin potential and earnings potential from our profitability and efficiency as we move down our learning curve. So Marine group continues to function very, very well and I like their growth story. Combat Systems growth, we had that significant backlog and now, for us, it's all a question of performing on that backlog. And I think this group has demonstrated its operational excellence and will continue to do so. So I expect in -- I've given you my guidance for 2015 but as I project out into the future and think about the business, this is going to be -- we're going to see some growth in Combat and I would expect fully anticipate given the operational excellence of this group to see margin expansion.

So we talked multiple times about the policy of being able to predict with great specificity the Gulfstream or Aerospace margins.

If you look at our outlook, it's informed by the last 2 years where we focused on operations, reduced our costs and results built our backlog. So we are poised for growth as a result of that backlog. For several years to come, it's a very nice positioned to be. We are going to see some good growth in '16 and '17, and the business is poised for that. We've been focusing on operations in what we basically called the back to basics, which is blocking and tackling. That work is never done, so we're going to continue to attack our costs to a relentless focus on our cost performance and reengineering our business that will make us more competitive, reduces our costs, makes more competitive and that, too, will help growth. So we have positioned ourselves nicely and I think will continue to do so going forward. Our opportunities are, because of our improved competitiveness, increased growth primarily both overseas and we've talked about that before. We've got another opportunity as margin expansion going forward as we focus on our continuous improvement. We've got -- when I think about risks, you implicitly asked about a foreign currency risk. We are less exposed to foreign currency variability and -- than companies in other sectors, for example. And the [ph] 60% of our business is with U.S. government and Gulfstream's exposures to the U.S. economy. We have -- there's some translation difficulty year-over-year with respect to currency fluctuation. We've embedded those in our plan. We also have some nice natural hedges, both in Europe and in Canada. So has the strong dollar affected any of our demand? Not really. And we certainly haven't seen it in our backlog. We had a translation -- we had to adjust our Combat backlog as a result of that negative translation but that's on work that's many years out. But in terms of sales, we're not just seeing any particular impact. It's a potential? Sure, but it's not affecting us. You asked about R&D as a risk. So the key when you introduce, I think, you invest in the business and new product development and you introduced new product is that you have managed that R&D and the engineering development and design effectively. And Gulfstream has a proven history of doing that and we are continuing to see that same kind of excellent execution and our design and engineering efforts at Gulfstream. So we don't see any risk that's outside what we have fully seen in the past with respect to R&D but we managed this -- we managed our R&D at Gulfstream and the design and engine

And over time, they're -- it is our anticipation that they will grow as a larger percentage of our IS&T sales than IT. But both of those businesses are poised very, very well for, again, single-digit growth but still growth. And I would add that I'm very pleased with their margin performance. It's particularly interesting that the year that we had some revenue decline, considerable revenue decline, we outperformed on margins. And this year, we expect revenue decline and again higher margins and this time, bring with it higher earnings than last year. So that's a pretty wholesome story from my perspective."

Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.19 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.36 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $737 million. It was our strongest revenue performance in t",1492,"Thanks, Erin. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.19 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.36 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $737 million. It was our strongest revenue performance in the past 12 quarters, the highest operating earnings ever and the highest earnings from continuing operations. For us, it was a powerful quarter. Incidentally, we beat analyst consensus by $0.06.
For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share of $7.83 on revenue of $30.85 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.7 billion, a return on sales of 8.7%. It was a year of solid achievement from both an operating perspective and the development of significant backlog.
As you can see from schedule H to the press release, funded backlog grew from $38.3 billion at year-end 2013 to $52.9 billion at the end of last year. The story for total backlog is much the same. We were at $45.9 billion at the end of 2013 and sit at $72.4 billion at the end of 2014. As a result, we are well positioned for growth in 2016 and 2017.
Free cash flow from operations was a negative $254 million in the quarter, however, for the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $3.2 billion or 120% of earnings from continuing operations. This outpaced 2013 by $532 million.
Let me give you some detail on the quarter and the year in each of the business groups. First, Aerospace. Revenue and earnings were up nicely over the year-ago quarter. Sales were up $105 million, 4.9%; and earnings were up $64 million, a significant 18.4% on very strong margin improvement. This is particularly impressive when one considers that G&A and net R&D were up $40 million over the year-ago quarter. On a sequential basis, sales were off $49 million, but earnings were up $1 million on a 40-basis-point improvement in operating margins.
I should add that Jet remained nicely profitable in the quarter, with a better contribution on both a year-ago and sequential comparison basis.
The order activity in the quarter was robust, as one would expect with the announcement of 2 new aircraft. As you can observe on exhibit H, funded backlog, total backlog and total potential contract value, including options, are all up significantly.
Even if we were to ignore the orders related to the 2 new aircraft, total orders from current production aircraft were the highest of the year. All large cabin aircraft had a dollar-based book-to-bill greater than 1 to 1.
For the year, revenues were $8.65 billion and operating earnings were $1.61 billion on an operating margin of 18.6%. This is a year-over-year improvement of 6.5% on sales, 13.8% on earnings and 120 basis points on operating margin. All in all, a very good year at Aerospace, with strong operating leverage.
At Combat Systems, sales were up $23 million or 1.4%, and earnings were up $21 million or 8.4% on 110-basis-point improvement in operating margin over the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, the story is similar. Sales were up $219 million and earnings were up $39 million.
For the year, sales were down $100 million or 1.7%, and earnings were down $46 million or 5.1%. This compares quite favorably to the guidance we've provided at this time last year. You may recall that we guided to a 4% to 4.5% revenue decline as opposed to the 1.7% decline that occurred. We also guided to operating margins of 14%, which we beat by 100 basis points.
Overall, Combat Systems is a story of solid additions to backlog, better-than-anticipated revenue and outstanding cost and margin performance. This is a business group that has clearly stabilized.
Marine group revenue in the quarter exceeded $2 billion for the first time ever. Operating earnings of $193 million were the second highest ever recorded. Revenue was up $410 million or 25.2% compared to the year-ago quarter and up $220 million or 12.1%, sequentially. Revenues for the year were up $600 million, almost 9%, very nice growth.
Operating earnings were up $34 million or 21.4% against the year-ago quarter and up $23 million or 13.5%, sequentially. For the full year, earnings were up $37 million or 5.6% on a 30-basis-point decline in operating margin, attributable to mix shift, which was consistent with our guidance to you.
In the Marine group, we guided you at this time last year to a revenue increase of 2.5%, which we obviously exceeded. We forecasted margins at 9.5% and wound up at 9.6%. All in all, a very good year for the Marine group.
IS&T is a business group where we saw less-than-expected revenue decline and improved operating performance. Revenue in the quarter was $2.47 billion, down $223 million or 8.3% against the year-ago quarter. Revenue was up 9.8% sequentially and down $1.1 billion or 10.8% for the year. Remember that this is dramatically less than the 20% revenue decline we forecasted in our guidance to you at this time last year.
Operating earnings of $212 million in the quarter were 8.2% better than the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $10 million or 5%. For the year, earnings were down only $10 million or 1.3%, which is very good performance in the face of a 10.8% revenue decline.
On this call a year ago, I gave you guidance with respect to operating margins in the 8.2% range, which we beat by 40 basis points. All in all, we beat forecasted revenue by $1 billion and operating margins by 40 basis points. When that happens, the result is a very pleasant upside surprise.
So company-wide, on this call a year ago, our guidance for 2014 was to expect revenues of $30 billion, operating margin rate of 12%, a tax rate of 31% and a return on sales of 8%. We wound up the year with revenues of $30.85 billion, an operating margin rate of 12.6%, an effective tax rate of 29.7% and a return on sales of 8.7%.
We provided EPS guidance of $6.80 to $6.85. We wound up at $7.83. About $0.62 of the improvement came from better-than-planned operating performance, $0.13 from the slightly lower-than-planned tax rate and the balance from share count as a result of share repurchases.
So let me provide you some thoughts about 2015, initially by business group and then on a company-wide roll-up. In Aerospace, we expect revenues to be approximately $9.4 billion, up about 8.3%. Margin rate should be approximately 18%, somewhat down from 2014, attributable in part to less favorability at Jet, nonetheless, up about 4.5% in earnings.
In Combat Systems, we expect both revenue and earnings to be essentially flat, with growth resuming in 2016 and beyond. The Marine group is expected to have revenue growth of 2% to 2.5% and a margin rate in the 9.5% range, resulting in a very modest improvement to operating earnings.
Finally, in IS&T, we expect a revenue decline of about 5.5% but improved margin rate of slightly more than 9%. This will result in improved operating earnings year-over-year. We expected last year to be our low watermark for revenue. In part, we are seeing some of the decline we anticipated last year being delayed into this year. Once again, we should see revenue growth in 2016 and 2017.
All of this rolls up to an operating plan of about $31.3 billion to $31.5 billion of revenue, EBIT rate around 12.8% and a return on sales of roughly 8.7%. This plan is purely from operations, assumes a 30.5% tax rate, assumes we buy enough shares to hold the share count steady with the year-end figures so as not to permit dilution from option exercise. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $8.05 to $8.10 per fully diluted share. This compares with last year's guidance of $6.80 to $6.85 at the same time on the same basis. So much like last year, beating our guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan and the effect of share repurchases.
So how should one think about the quarterly progression of EPS? Whatever your model is for the year, divided by 4, and the first and second quarters will be light by about $0.10, the third quarter about right on and the fourth quarter about $0.20 better. By the way, quarterly progression is notoriously difficult.
With respect to capital deployment, we anticipate using all of our free cash flow in 2015 for dividends and share repurchases. While we don't anticipate a robust year from a free cash flow perspective in light of the advanced payments on international orders that we have received last year, we intend to treat the free cash available for dividends and share repurchases on a -- on some normalized basis. In short, we will use balance sheet cash as necessary to normalize the year.
I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken."
274561,282568590,750123,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2015",2015-01-28,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll take just a minute and cover a few miscellaneous financial items before the question-and-answer period.Net interest expense in the quarter was $19 million versus $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. And for",443,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll take just a minute and cover a few miscellaneous financial items before the question-and-answer period.
Net interest expense in the quarter was $19 million versus $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. And for the year, interest expense was $86 million, consistent with the year before. For 2015, we expect net interest expense of around $82 million, a decline from 2014 resulting from the repayment of $500 million of fixed rate notes that matured last week.
At the end of the year, our balance sheet reflects a net cash position, that's cash in excess of debt, of $477 million. This was down by about $1 billion from the end of 2013 reflecting the cash we used from the balance sheet for capital deployment activities, which I'll address in just a minute.
Our effective tax rate was 29.5% for the quarter and 29.7% for the year, and that's a bit lower than we had been forecasting. As you'll recall, our most recent projections were in the neighborhood of 30% to 30.5%. The lower outcome is attributable to the R&D tax credit extension in late December. For 2015, as Phebe mentioned, we expect an effective tax rate of around 30.5%.
And finally, on the income statement, you'll notice we took a charge in the quarter in discontinued operations. This is related to the sale of our AxleTech business, which we first reported in the second quarter when we made the decision to sell that business. The charge we took at that time was predicated on the 2014 closing of the sale. The regulatory review process for the transaction delayed the closing until the 5th of January. And as a result, we were not able to take advantage of some tax benefits we had anticipated, so we adjusted the loss on the sale in the fourth quarter.
Switching gears, we contributed $515 million to our pension plans in 2014. And for 2015, we expect that amount to decline to approximately $185 million as a result of the interest rate released from the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014.
On the capital deployment front, to summarize our activities for the year, we delivered on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. In total, we expended approximately $3.4 billion on share repurchases in 2014. And when you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we spent $4.2 billion in shareholder-friendly actions in 2014 or 1.3x our free cash flow from operations for the year.
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A."

We have a slightly unfavorable mix shift in green production between large cabin and mid-cabin. We're keeping large-cabin production about the same rate as we did last year at about 115 units. We're increasing mid-cabin by 10 units. So there's a somewhat unfavorable mix shift between large and mid-sized green. We've got less of a contribution at Jet, primarily and exclusively driven by mix shift. We've got higher R&D in this upcoming year. Remember that we're building multiple test aircraft that carry with them no revenue and earnings. And then the final issue that's impacting our margin somewhat in 2015 is we have higher preowned. So those are the 4 components that are driving the margin variability."

The 450 and 550 demand has slowed slightly. It's okay, not superheated, but good enough. And we continue to see strong demand, primarily in North America and somewhat in Asia and also in the Mid East. Heretofore, we have seen no impact on oil prices on our backlog or, frankly, in our demand. If you're asking what percentage of our backlog may have some exposure to energy-related -- or happen to have some energy-related exposures, it's about 5%, but we haven't seen any impact yet. Now with that, we're seeing historically low operating costs, which is a -- usually drives increased flight hours, and that's a potential upside for our service business.

We've talked frequently about margin variability at the Marine group, but it's really a mix shift. And you quite accurately point out that we are experiencing a mix shift really, frankly, across our portfolio. More Block IV, less Block III, more commercial work coming off of the MLP program and first-of-class ships on the DDG 1000 and DDG 51 restart. That said, these businesses have continued to perform very, very well on cost-cutting efficiency, and their performance has been quite good. And I frankly expect to see margin expansion primarily driven by Block IV, as we have increased margin potential and earnings potential from our profitability and efficiency as we move down our learning curve. So Marine group continues to function very, very well, and I like their growth story. Combat Systems' growth, we have that significant backlog. And now, for us, it's all a question of performing on that backlog. And I think this group has demonstrated its operational excellence and will continue to do so. So I expect in -- I've given you my guidance for 2015, but as I project out into the future and think about the business, this is going to be -- we're going to see some growth in Combat, and I would expect and fully anticipate, given the operational excellence of this group, to see margin expansion.

So that makes preowned a little bit tougher to articulate. We had -- the performance at Gulfstream this year was extremely strong, and we had a favorable completion mix in the fourth quarter that we are reversing somewhat going into next year. So we've talked multiple times about the fallacy of being able to predict with great specificity the Gulfstream or Aerospace margins. And I will tell you, Jet had a very strong year this year.

And I'll use 2 examples and then hopefully you can add to that. One is some of your operations have European- or Canadian-based costs and you sell in dollars, so there may be some upside there, although I know you hedged some. And then also you embarked on a very aggressive research and development campaign at Gulfstream. And how have you assessed the risk and where have you felt like you've made progress? So it's a bit of specifics and then wrapped in a little bit of -- the $8.05 to $8.10 is a nice start for the year, but I'm sure we won't end there."

And our ability to do better is simply going to be as a result of cap -- share repurchases and outperforming our plan.

And our ability to do better is simply going to be as a result of cap -- share repurchases and outperforming our plan. If you look at our outlook, it's informed by the last 2 years where we focused on operations, reduced our costs and results built our backlog. So we are poised for growth as a result of that backlog. For several years to come, it's a very nice position to be. We are going to see some good growth in '16 and '17, and the business is poised for that. We've been focusing on operations in what we basically call the back to basics, which is blocking and tackling. That work is never done, so we're going to continue to attack our costs to a relentless focus on our cost performance and reengineering our business that will make us more competitive, reduces our costs and makes us more competitive and that, too, will help growth. So we have positioned ourselves nicely and I think will continue to do so going forward. Our opportunities are, because of our improved competitiveness, increased growth primarily both overseas, and we've talked about that before. We've got another opportunity of margin expansion going forward as we focus on our continuous improvement. We've got -- when I think about risks, you implicitly asked about a foreign currency risk. We are less exposed to foreign currency variability and -- than companies in other sectors, for example. I mean, 60% of our business is with the U.S. government, and Gulfstream's exposure is to the U.S. economy. We have -- there's some translation difficulty year-over-year with respect to currency fluctuation. We've embedded those in our plan. We also have some nice natural hedges, both in Europe and in Canada. So has the strong dollar affected any of our demand? Not really. And we certainly haven't seen it in our backlog. We had a translation -- we had to adjust our Combat backlog as a result of that negative translation, but that's on work that's many years out. So -- but in terms of sales, we're not just seeing any particular impact. Is it potential? Sure, but it's not affecting us. So I -- oh, no, you asked about R&D as a risk. So the key when you introduce, I think, you invest in the business and new product development and you introduce new product is that you have managed that R&D and the engineering and development and design effectively. And Gulfstream has a proven history of doing that, and we are continuing to see that same kind of excellent execution in our design and engineering efforts at Gulfstream. So we don't see any risk that's outside what we have fully seen in the past with respect to R&D, but we managed this -- we manage R&D at Gulfstream in their design and engineering activities very, very closely. And we really have -- again, we've set the expectations accordingly, and we've got a great team there. It's all about the execution, and so far, so good. So I hope that [indiscernible] where you were headed."

We are seeing stabilization at -- in our U.S. land forces' exposure at Combat Systems directly in line with our expectations. And so we don't really see any, at least, surprises that we can see in the near term. International orders or international sales this year comprise about a little [ph] in excess of 55% of Combat sales and will increase to 60% over time, not at the expense of domestic activity, but just as a revenue expansion. So we do -- we still have a lot of, I'd say, a number of international orders in our pipeline that are of decent size that is our -- it is our expectation that given our competitiveness and our cost structure, we're going to be highly competitive in those competitions. So we have additional upside in building our backlog at Combat. But I'm not prepared to give you any specifics on whether that makes it a book-to-bill of 1 to 1 in any 1 given year. That will depend on a lot of things on when these competitions are decided. And -- but we've got a lot of proposal activity out there. And with respect to, I think, 550 -- or 500 and 600 tempo, both of those R&D programs are proceeding at pace, no major changes since the last time we talked to you about it. Our pipeline is very robust, and I expect sales to increase as -- orders to increase as we get closer and closer to the entry into service of the 500 and then the 600. So there is no -- there will be no stumbling blocks heretofore. And our profiles in R&D and production of the test airplanes remain right on plan. So we're very pleased with that, and we are pleased with the interest that both of these models have generated."

Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.19 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.36 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $737 million. It was our strongest revenue performance in t",1490,"Thanks, Erin. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.19 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.36 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $737 million. It was our strongest revenue performance in the past 12 quarters, the highest operating earnings ever and the highest earnings from continuing operations. For us, it was a powerful quarter. Incidentally, we beat analyst consensus by $0.06.
For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share of $7.83 on revenue of $30.85 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.7 billion, a return on sales of 8.7%. It was a year of solid achievement from both an operating perspective and the development of significant backlog.
As you can see from Schedule H to the press release, funded backlog grew from $38.3 billion at year-end 2013 to $52.9 billion at the end of last year. The story for total backlog is much the same. We were at $45.9 billion at the end of 2013 and sit at $72.4 billion at the end of 2014. As a result, we are well positioned for growth in 2016 and 2017.
Free cash flow from operations was a negative $254 million in the quarter, however, for the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $3.2 billion, or 120% of earnings from continuing operations. This outpaced 2013 by $532 million.
Let me give you some detail on the quarter and the year in each of the business groups. First, Aerospace. Revenue and earnings were up nicely over the year-ago quarter. Sales were up $105 million, 4.9%; and earnings were up $64 million, a significant 18.4% on very strong margin improvement. This is particularly impressive when one considers that G&A and net R&D were up $40 million over the year-ago quarter. On a sequential basis, sales were off $49 million, but earnings were up $1 million on a 40-basis-point improvement in operating margins.
I should add that Jet remained nicely profitable in the quarter, with a better contribution on both a year-ago and sequential comparison basis.
The order activity in the quarter was robust, as one would expect with the announcement of 2 new aircraft. As you can observe on Exhibit H, funded backlog, total backlog and total potential contract value, including options, are all up significantly.
Even if we were to ignore the orders related to the 2 new aircraft, total orders from current production aircraft were the highest of the year. All large cabin aircraft had a dollar-based book-to-bill greater than 1:1.
For the year, revenues were $8.65 billion and operating earnings were $1.61 billion on an operating margin of 18.6%. This is a year-over-year improvement of 6.5% on sales, 13.8% on earnings and 120 basis points on operating margin. All in all, a very good year at Aerospace, with strong operating leverage.
At Combat Systems, sales were up $23 million, or 1.4%, and earnings were up $21 million, or 8.4%, on 110-basis-point improvement in operating margin over the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, the story is similar. Sales were up $219 million and earnings were up $39 million.
For the year, sales were down $100 million, or 1.7%, and earnings were down $46 million, or 5.1%. This compares quite favorably to the guidance we've provided at this time last year. You may recall that we guided to a 4% to 4.5% revenue decline as opposed to the 1.7% decline that occurred. We also guided to operating margins of 14%, which we beat by 100 basis points.
Overall, Combat Systems is a story of solid additions to backlog, better-than-anticipated revenue and outstanding cost and margin performance. This is a business group that has clearly stabilized.
Marine group revenue in the quarter exceeded $2 billion for the first time ever. Operating earnings of $193 million were the second highest ever recorded. Revenue was up $410 million, or 25.2%, compared to the year-ago quarter and up $220 million, or 12.1%, sequentially. Revenues for the year were up $600 million, almost 9%, very nice growth.
Operating earnings were up $34 million, or 21.4%, against the year-ago quarter and up $23 million, or 13.5%, sequentially. For the full year, earnings were up $37 million, or 5.6% on a 30-basis-point decline in operating margin, attributable to mix shift, which was consistent with our guidance to you.
In the Marine group, we guided you at this time last year to a revenue increase of 2.5%, which we obviously exceeded. We forecasted margins at 9.5% and wound up at 9.6%. All in all, a very good year for the Marine group.
IS&T is a business group where we saw less-than-expected revenue decline and improved operating performance. Revenue in the quarter was $2.47 billion, down $223 million, or 8.3%, against the year-ago quarter. Revenue was up 9.8% sequentially and down $1.1 billion, or 10.8%,  for the year. Remember that this is dramatically less than the 20% revenue decline we forecasted in our guidance to you at this time last year.
Operating earnings of $212 million in the quarter were 8.2% better than the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $10 million, or 5%. For the year, earnings were down only $10 million, or 1.3%, which is very good performance in the face of a 10.8% revenue decline.
On this call a year ago, I gave you guidance with respect to operating margins in the 8.2% range, which we beat by 40 basis points. All in all, we beat forecasted revenue by $1 billion and operating margins by 40 basis points. When that happens, the result is a very pleasant upside surprise.
So company-wide, on this call a year ago, our guidance for 2014 was to expect revenues of $30 billion, operating margin rate of 12%, a tax rate of 31% and a return on sales of 8%. We wound up the year with revenues of $30.85 billion, an operating margin rate of 12.6%, an effective tax rate of 29.7% and a return on sales of 8.7%.
We provided EPS guidance of $6.80 to $6.85. We wound up at $7.83. About $0.62 of the improvement came from better-than-planned operating performance, $0.13 from a slightly lower-than-planned tax rate and the balance from share count as a result of share repurchases.
So let me provide you some thoughts about 2015, initially by business group and then on a company-wide roll-up. In Aerospace, we expect revenues to be approximately $9.4 billion, up about 8.3%. Margin rate should be approximately 18%, somewhat down from 2014, attributable in part to less favorability at Jet, nonetheless, up about 4.5% in earnings.
In Combat Systems, we expect both revenue and earnings to be essentially flat, with growth resuming in 2016 and beyond. The Marine group is expected to have revenue growth of 2% to 2.5% and a margin rate in the 9.5% range, resulting in a very modest improvement to operating earnings.
Finally, in IS&T, we expect a revenue decline of about 5.5% but improved margin rate of slightly more than 9%. This will result in improved operating earnings year-over-year. We expected last year to be our low watermark for revenue. In part, we are seeing some of the decline we anticipated last year being delayed into this year. Once again, we should see revenue growth in 2016 and 2017.
All of this rolls up to an operating plan of about $31.3 billion to $31.5 billion of revenue, EBIT rate around 12.8% and a return on sales of roughly 8.7%. This plan is purely from operations, assumes a 30.5% tax rate, assumes we buy enough shares to hold the share count steady with the year-end figures so as not to permit dilution from option exercise. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $8.05 to $8.10 per fully diluted share. This compares with last year's guidance of $6.80 to $6.85 at the same time on the same basis. So much like last year, beating our guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan and the effect of share repurchases.
So how should one think about the quarterly progression of EPS? Whatever your model is for the year, divided by 4, and the first and second quarters will be light by about $0.10, the third quarter about right on and the fourth quarter about $0.20 better. By the way, quarterly progression is notoriously difficult.
With respect to capital deployment, we anticipate using all of our free cash flow in 2015 for dividends and share repurchases. While we don't anticipate a robust year from a free cash flow perspective in light of the advanced payments on international orders that we have received last year, we intend to treat the free cash available for dividends and share repurchases on a -- on some normalized basis. In short, we will use balance sheet cash as necessary to normalize the year.
I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken."
274561,282568590,750242,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2015",2015-01-28,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll take just a minute and cover a few miscellaneous financial items before the question-and-answer period.Net interest expense in the quarter was $19 million versus $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. And for",443,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll take just a minute and cover a few miscellaneous financial items before the question-and-answer period.
Net interest expense in the quarter was $19 million versus $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. And for the year, interest expense was $86 million, consistent with the year before. For 2015, we expect net interest expense of around $82 million, a decline from 2014 resulting from the repayment of $500 million of fixed rate notes that matured last week.
At the end of the year, our balance sheet reflects a net cash position, that's cash in excess of debt, of $477 million. This was down by about $1 billion from the end of 2013 reflecting the cash we used from the balance sheet for capital deployment activities, which I'll address in just a minute.
Our effective tax rate was 29.5% for the quarter and 29.7% for the year, and that's a bit lower than we had been forecasting. As you'll recall, our most recent projections were in the neighborhood of 30% to 30.5%. The lower outcome is attributable to the R&D tax credit extension in late December. For 2015, as Phebe mentioned, we expect an effective tax rate of around 30.5%.
And finally, on the income statement, you'll notice we took a charge in the quarter in discontinued operations. This is related to the sale of our AxleTech business, which we first reported in the second quarter when we made the decision to sell that business. The charge we took at the time was predicated on the 2014 closing of the sale. The regulatory review process for the transaction delayed the closing until the 5th of January. And as a result, we were not able to take advantage of some tax benefits we had anticipated, so we adjusted the loss on the sale in the fourth quarter.
Switching gears, we contributed $515 million to our pension plans in 2014. And for 2015, we expect that amount to decline to approximately $185 million as a result of the interest rate relief from the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014.
On the capital deployment front, to summarize our activities for the year, we delivered on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. In total, we expended approximately $3.4 billion on share repurchases in 2014. And when you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we spent $4.2 billion in shareholder-friendly actions in 2014, or 1.3x our free cash flow from operations for the year.
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A."

We're increasing mid-cabin by 10 units. So there's a somewhat unfavorable mix shift between large and mid-sized green. We've got less of a contribution at Jet primarily, and exclusively driven by mix shift. We've got higher R&D in this upcoming year. Remember that we're building multiple test aircraft that carry with them no revenue and earnings. And then the final issue that's impacting margin somewhat in 2015 is we have higher preowned.

We've talked frequently about margin variability at the Marine group, but it's really a mix shift. And you quite accurately point out that we are experiencing a mix shift really, frankly, across our portfolio. More Block IV, less Block III, more commercial work coming off of the MLP program and first-of-class ships on the DDG 1000 and DDG 51 restart. That said, these businesses have continued to perform very, very well on cost-cutting efficiency, and their performance has been quite good. And I, frankly, expect to see margin expansion primarily driven by Block IV, as we have increased margin potential and earnings potential from our profitability and efficiency as we move down our learning curve. So Marine group continues to function very, very well, and I like their growth story. Combat Systems' growth, we have that significant backlog. And now, for us, it's all a question of performing on that backlog. And I think this group has demonstrated its operational excellence and will continue to do so. So I expect in -- I've given you my guidance for 2015, but as I project out into the future and think about the business, this is going to be -- we're going to see some growth in Combat, and I would expect and fully anticipate, given the operational excellence of this group, to see margin expansion. But I'm not going to bake any of that in now on some of these programs. We're still in fairly new starts and low-rate production. But for everything we see, this is a group that will continue to cut costs and improve its efficiency."

Our pipeline on the 650 is very good, the 280 also. So we really haven't seen much impact in the emerging markets, certainly not this year. North America remains very strong with us, Asia-Pacific and then -- and we're also seeing some increased demand in the Middle East. I would also tell you that about 60% of our backlog is with public and private companies, including Fortune 500s, and they tend to be very stable and reliable and predictable.

And we won't know until the quarter of execution whether, in fact, anticipated preowneds come into our market or they are sold before they get to Gulfstream. So that makes preowned a little bit tougher to articulate. We had -- the performance at Gulfstream this year was extremely strong, and we had a favorable completion mix in the fourth quarter that we are reversing somewhat going into next year. So we've talked multiple times about the fallacy of being able to predict with great specificity the Gulfstream or Aerospace margins. And I will tell you, Jet had a very strong year this year. And that contribution will be less next year, primarily driven by a mix shift as they move into some additional completion work and they come down their learning curve.

And our ability to do better is simply going to be as a result of cap -- share repurchases and outperforming our plan. If you look at our outlook, it's informed by the last 2 years, where we focused on operations, reduced our costs and, in result, built our backlog. So we are poised for growth as a result of that backlog for several years to come. It's a very nice position to be. We are going to see some good growth in '16 and '17, and the business is poised for that. We've been focusing on operations in what we basically call the back to basics, which is blocking and tackling. That work is never done, so we're going to continue to attack our costs to a relentless focus on our cost performance and reengineering our business that will make us more competitive, reduces our costs and makes us more competitive and that, too, will help growth. So we have positioned ourselves nicely and I think will continue to do so going forward. Our opportunities are, because of our improved competitiveness, increased growth primarily both overseas, and we've talked about that before. We've got another opportunity of margin expansion going forward as we focus on our continuous improvement. We've got -- when I think about risks, you implicitly asked about a foreign currency risk. We are less exposed to foreign currency variability and -- than companies in other sectors. For example, 60% of our business is with the U.S. government, and Gulfstream's exposure is to the U.S. economy. We have -- there's some translation difficulty year-over-year, with respect to currency fluctuations. We've embedded those in our plan. We also have some nice natural hedges, both in Europe and in Canada. So has the strong dollar affected any of our demand? Not really. And we certainly haven't seen it in our backlog. We had a translation -- we had to adjust our Combat backlog as a result of that negative translation, but that's on work that's many years out. So -- but in terms of sales, we're not just seeing any particular impact. Is it potential? Sure, but it's not affecting us. So I -- oh, no, you asked about R&D as a risk. So the key when you introduce, I think, you invest in a business and new product development and you introduce new product is that you have managed that R&D and the engineering and development and design effectively. And Gulfstream has a proven history of doing that, and we are continuing to see that same kind of excellent execution in our design and engineering efforts at Gulfstream. So we don't see any risk that's outside what we have always seen in the past with respect to R&D, but we managed this -- we manage R&D at Gulfstream in their design and engineering activities very, very closely. And we really have -- again, we've set the expectations accordingly, and we've got a great team there. It's all about the execution, and so far, so good. So I hope that sort of passes where you were headed."

So we do -- we still have a lot of, I'd say, a number of international orders in our pipeline that are of decent size that it's our -- it is our expectation that given our competitiveness and our cost structure, we're going to be highly competitive in those competitions. So we have additional upside in building our backlog at Combat. But I'm not prepared to give you any specifics on whether that makes it a book-to-bill of 1:1 in any 1 given year. That will depend on a lot of things on when these competitions are decided. And -- but we've got a lot of proposal activity out there. And with respect to, I think, 550 -- or 500 and 600 tempo, both of those R&D programs are proceeding apace, with no major changes since the last time we talked to you about it. Our pipeline is very robust, and I expect sales to increase as -- orders to increase as we get closer and closer to the entry into service of the 500 and then the 600.

Earlier today, we reported first quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.14 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.8 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net earnings of $716 million. We beat analyst consen",980,"Thanks, Erin. Earlier today, we reported first quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.14 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.8 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net earnings of $716 million. We beat analyst consensus by $0.20 and where we'll ahead of analyst expectations on revenue as well. We were also better than our previous guidance and our own expectations.
I should point out that we enjoyed an effective tax rate of 29% as opposed to consensus of around 30.5%. This accounted for approximately $0.05 of the outperformance. Jason Nacca will fully discuss the tax rate for later.
I should further note that the diluted weighted average share count was 334.7 million for the quarter compared to consensus of approximately 332 million. So none of the outperformance comes from a lower-than-expected share count.
I have asked Jason to give you a little more insight into our share repurchase activity when I conclude my remarks.
All in all, this is a truly strong quarter from an operating perspective as evidenced by the operating margin of 13.2% and a return on revenue of 9.2%.
It was a good quarter from a cash perspective as well. We had $745 million net cash provided by operating activity. After capital expenditures of $98 million, we had $647 million of free cash flow from operations, about 90% of net income.
The general comparisons quarter-over-quarter are pretty compelling compared to the first quarter 2014. Revenue was up $519 million or 7.1%. Total distance revenue was up 10.1%, pretty remarkable.
Our operating earnings was slightly more than $1 billion, up 17.5% over the prior year's quarter, leading to a 120 basis point improvement in margins. This very strong operating leverage is an important part of our story. Net earnings were up more than operating earnings, primarily due to the previously mentioned lower tax rate.
Finally, EPS was top 25.1% over the year ago quarter as a result of better operating earnings, lower tax rate and lower share count.
Let me provide some commentary and a little perspective around the results of our operating segments. First, aerospace. Sales are down by $17 million compared to Q1 2014, less than 1% and down $132 million sequentially against a strong fourth quarter. On the other hand, earnings outpaced the year ago quarter by $27 million, about 6.7% on 140 basis point expansion in operating margin.
Operating earnings were also up $19 million sequentially. The 20.4% operating margin for the group represents the high with both companies contributing. A word of caution here. We are out of the gate fast but this pace is not sustainable from a margin perspective. 
Orders were not overly strong in the quarter but need to be viewed in the context of a very robust fourth quarter 2014. It was a quarter where the sales pipeline was replenished and strengthened, part of a normal cycle after a strong quarter [ph]. This is consistent with what we saw in the first quarter of 2014 following the strong fourth quarter 2013.
We're off to a very good start in the Aerospace Group. Marine Systems.
Revenue of $1.94 billion was up $342 million or 21.4% compared to the year ago quarter and down $97 million sequentially as one would expect against the fourth quarter 2014. Operating earnings were up $22 million or 13.3% against the year ago quarter and down $5 million sequentially. We had particularly good performance at Electric Boat at NASSCO. 
Some of the more striking comparisons are found at Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2014, sales were up $105 million or 8.3%, and earnings were up $65 million or 46.8% on a 400 basis point improvement in operating margins.
Recall that the results in the first quarter of 2014 were impacted by a $29 million restructuring charge at European Land Systems as a result of reductions in the Austrian operations, which were consolidated into Spain and Switzerland. If we disregard that charge, margins would have been 13.4% on a pro forma basis. Even on that basis, the improvement in this year's operating margin is a significant 160 basis points.
Sequentially, revenue was down $251 million and operating earnings were down $67 million, as anticipated in the business that always has a very strong fourth quarter, largely related to contract delivery.
All up, continued strong performance of Combat Systems. It's been a long time since we've been able to report an increase in revenue in this group. 
IS&T. The big upside surprise incurred in this group. You might recall that our guidance was to expect a revenue decline of 5.5% year-over-year. Well, that certainly did not happen in the first quarter. Revenue in the quarter was up $89 million or 3.9% against the year ago quarter and off only $98 million against the powerful fourth quarter 2014. Operating earnings of $217 million in the quarter was $34 million more than the year ago quarter, up 18.6% on 120 basis point improvement in margin.
On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $5 million on a 60 basis point improvement in margins. Once again, nice operating leverage. The 9.2% operating margins were the best that this group has achieved in a while and is very encouraging. The trend is in the right direction.
So we're off to a very good start to the year, nicely ahead of our expectation. We do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice and has been for 3 years, to give you a full review of our expectation at the midpoint of the year. Suffice it to say that we're ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance was based. We will work to consolidate our improvements and to continue to outperform. 
I'd like to now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken."
274561,291068296,796933,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I want to start with a subject that we haven't talked about a lot in the past and that's foreign exchange rates. With our increasing international revenue base and the continued strengthening of the dollar, we're seeing",475,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I want to start with a subject that we haven't talked about a lot in the past and that's foreign exchange rates. With our increasing international revenue base and the continued strengthening of the dollar, we're seeing an impact in our reported results. Now to be clear, this doesn't involve anally economic gain or loss in any of our contracts. What I'm referring to is the translation of our international operating results from their local currencies to US dollars for reporting purposes.
Absent the movement of foreign currency translation rates, the growth in our revenues and earnings over the first quarter of 2014 would have been even more robust than the numbers you see. Specifically, our U.S. dollar reported revenue with an operating earnings in the quarter were reduced by approximately $120 million and $20 million, respectively compared with the exchange rates that prevailed in the first quarter of last year.
In addition, our backlog was reduced by approximately $450 million from year-end due to the same translation issue. Setting the FX impact aside, our Combat Systems backlog would have been essentially unchanged from year-end and our IS&T backlog would have been up slightly more than recorded.
Moving on to a couple of items on our income statement. Net interest is in the quarter was $21 million versus $22 million in the first quarter of 2014. During the quarter, we repaid $500 million of maturing fixed rate notes with proceeds from marketable securities on hand. At the end of the first quarter, our balance sheet reflects a net cash position, that's cash in excess of debt, of $1 billion, essentially unchanged from year end.
As Phebe mentioned earlier, our effective tax rate was a bit lower than we had forecast and a bit lower than analyst consensus of around 30.5%. The effective rate was 29% for the quarter versus 30.1% a year ago and the primary driver was some R&D tax credit claims that were settled during the quarter.
For the year, we're now anticipating an effective tax rate more in the ballpark of 29.5%. On the capital deployment front, you may recall that in the first quarter of last year, we repurchased a little over or 14 million shares, including about 11 million shares under an accelerated share repurchase program. Since the end of the first quarter of 2014, our diluted share count is down another 12.5 million shares, the result of almost 20 million additional shares we purchased in the past 4 quarters, and that includes approximately 4.7 million shares repurchased in the first quarter of this year. Altogether, was spent $826 million on share repurchases and dividends during the first quarter or 1.3x our free cash flow from operations.
Erin, that concludes my remarks. And I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A."

Russia, Latin America and China are slower at the moment. 6 50 and -- 6 50 ER demand is robust. So we're holding on our own and then some. I think, however, it's important to understand the theory of the case behind how we run this business, how we have historically and how we will continue to do so. The only decline we worry about is the decline in earnings. So accordingly, we always pool production down in the face of the weak quarters, we have no intention of doing so this year. Given our large 6 50 backlog, we can, to some degree, feather in more 6 50s to cover potential downfalls and of course, we already take cost out of that business. So I think, the way to think about Gulfstream for the next 2 years is, it's not necessarily at a strong revenue growth story. Growth will return when our new airplanes are under service. And this is pretty much in line with what we had anticipated and predictable in a business that continues to refresh its product line with clean sheet design airplanes. So I said it will be helpful to just give you a little sense of when we see changes in demand, how we act.

But again, let's just talk about the theory of the case. When you're bringing in new aircraft, the trick is to feather in that production with the existing plane and so that you have a nice smooth transition and that's what we're striving for and that's what we'll achieve. Again, there's no reason to think that, that isn't going to happen. The 650 has a quite a significant order book and in fact, the deliveries now, the next available airplanes have actually slipped to the fourth quarter of '17. So that healthy and long backlog, gives us some flexibility, nice flexibility, to feather in some more 650s to offset that transition period, the feathering in that we moved to the new airplanes. So it wouldn't be altogether a bad thing either to reduce the wait time on those 650s and the 650 ER, given the demand."

Earlier today, we reported first quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.14 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.8 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net earnings of $716 million. We beat analyst consen",978,"Thanks, Erin. Earlier today, we reported first quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.14 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.8 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net earnings of $716 million. We beat analyst consensus by $0.20 and we're well ahead of analysts' expectations on revenue as well. We were also better than our previous guidance and our own expectations.
I should point out that we enjoyed an effective tax rate of 29% as opposed to consensus of around 30.5%. This accounted for approximately $0.05 of the outperformance. Jason Aiken will more fully discuss the tax rate a little later.
I should further note that the diluted weighted average share count was 334.7 million for the quarter compared to consensus of approximately 332 million. So none of the outperformance comes from a lower-than-expected share count.
I have asked Jason to give you a little more insight into our share repurchase activity when I conclude my remarks.
All in all, this is a truly strong quarter from an operating perspective as evidenced by the operating margin of 13.2% and a return on revenue of 9.2%.
It was a good quarter from a cash perspective as well. We had $745 million net cash provided by operating activity. After capital expenditures of $98 million, we had $647 million of free cash flow from operations, about 90% of net income.
The general comparisons quarter-over-quarter are pretty compelling compared to the first quarter 2014. Revenue was up $519 million or 7.1%. Total defense revenue was up 10.1%, pretty remarkable.
Our operating earnings was slightly more than $1 billion, up 17.5% over the prior year's quarter, leading to 120 basis point improvement in margins. This very strong operating leverage is an important part of the story. Net earnings were up more than operating earnings, primarily due to the previously mentioned lower tax rate.
Finally, EPS was up 25.1% over the year-ago quarter as a result of better operating earnings, lower tax rate and lower share count.
Let me provide some commentary and a little perspective around the results of our operating segments. 
First, Aerospace. Sales are down by $17 million compared to Q1 2014, less than 1%; and down $132 million sequentially against a strong fourth quarter. On the other hand, earnings outpaced the year-ago quarter by $27 million, about 6.7% on 140 basis point expansion in operating margin.
Operating earnings were also up $19 million sequentially. The 20.4% operating margin for the group represents the high with both companies contributing. A word of caution here. We are out of the gate fast but this pace is not sustainable from a margin perspective. 
Orders were not overly strong in the quarter but need to be viewed in the context of a very robust fourth quarter 2014. It was a quarter where the sales pipeline was replenished and strengthened, part of a normal cycle after a strong order quarter. This is consistent with what we saw in the first quarter of 2014, following a strong fourth quarter of 2013. We're off to a very good start in the Aerospace group. 
Marine Systems. Revenue of $1.94 billion was up $342 million or 21.4% compared to the year-ago quarter and down $97 million sequentially, as one would expect, against the fourth quarter 2014. Operating earnings were up $22 million or 13.3% against the year-ago quarter and down $5 million sequentially. We had a particularly good performance at Electric Boat and NASSCO.
Some of the more striking comparisons are found at Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2014, sales were up $105 million or 8.3% and earnings were up $65 million or 46.8% on a 400 basis point improvement in operating margins.
Recall that the results in the first quarter of 2014 were impacted by a $29 million restructuring charge at European Land Systems as a result of reductions in the Austrian operations, which were consolidated into Spain and Switzerland. If we disregard that charge, margins would have been 13.4% on a pro forma basis. Even on that basis, the improvement in this year's operating margin is a significant 160 basis point.
Sequentially, revenue was down $251 million and operating earnings were down $67 million, as anticipated in the business that always has a very strong fourth quarter, largely related to contract delivery. All up [ph], continued strong performance at Combat Systems. It's been a long time since we've been able to report an increase in revenue in this group.
IS&T, the big upside surprise incurred in this group. You might recall that our guidance was to expect a revenue decline of 5.5% year-over-year. Well, that certainly did not happen in the first quarter. Revenue in the quarter was up $89 million or 3.9% against the year-ago quarter and off only $98 million against the powerful fourth quarter 2014. Operating earnings of $217 million in the quarter were $34 million more than the year-ago quarter, up 18.6% on 120 basis point improvement in margin.
On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $5 million on a 60 basis point improvement in margins. Once again, nice operating leverage. The 9.2% operating margins were the best that this group has achieved in a while and is very encouraging. The trend is in the right direction.
So we're off to a very good start to the year, nicely ahead of our expectations. We do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice and has been for 3 years to give you a full review of our expectation at the midpoint of the year. Suffice it to say that we're ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance was based, we will work to consolidate our improvements and to continue to outperform.
I'd like to now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken."
274561,291068296,797294,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I want to start with a subject that we haven't talked about a lot in the past, and that's foreign exchange rates. With our increasing international revenue base and the continued strengthening of the dollar, we're seein",471,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I want to start with a subject that we haven't talked about a lot in the past, and that's foreign exchange rates. With our increasing international revenue base and the continued strengthening of the dollar, we're seeing an impact in our reported results. Now to be clear, this doesn't involve any economic gain or loss in any of our contracts. What I'm referring to is the translation of our international operating results from their local currencies to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes.
Absent the movement of foreign currency translation rates, the growth in our revenues and earnings over the first quarter of 2014 would have been even more robust than the numbers you see. Specifically, our U.S. dollar reported revenue and operating earnings in the quarter were reduced by approximately $120 million and $20 million, respectively, compared with the exchange rates that prevailed in the first quarter of last year.
In addition, our backlog was reduced by approximately $450 million from year-end due to the same translation issue. Setting the FX impact aside, our Combat Systems backlog would have been essentially unchanged from year-end and our IS&T backlog would have been up slightly more than reported.
Moving on to a couple of items on our income statement. Net interest expense in the quarter was $21 million versus $22 million in the first quarter of 2014. During the quarter, we repaid $500 million of maturing fixed rate notes with proceeds from marketable securities on hand. At the end of the first quarter, our balance sheet reflects a net cash position, that's cash in excess of debt, of $1 billion, essentially unchanged from year-end.
As Phebe mentioned earlier, our effective tax rate was a bit lower than we had forecast and a bit lower than analyst consensus of around 30.5%. The effective rate was 29% for the quarter versus 30.1% a year ago, and the primary driver was some R&D tax credit claims that were settled during the quarter.
For the year, we're now anticipating an effective tax rate more in the ballpark of 29.5%. On the capital deployment front, you may recall that in the first quarter of last year, we repurchased a little over 14 million shares, including about 11 million shares under an accelerated share repurchase program. Since the end of the first quarter of 2014, our diluted share count is down another 12.5 million shares, the result of almost 20 million additional shares repurchased in the past 4 quarters. And that includes approximately 4.7 million shares repurchased in the first quarter of this year.
Altogether, we spent $826 million on share repurchases and dividends during the first quarter or 1.3x our free cash flow from operations.
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A."

And as we combined those 2 businesses, we're seeing some additional sales volume that comes in by the strength of going to market. On the IT business, they have won most of what they have been bidding on and they are a power in their marketplace. And so look, I don't have a sense of where we're going to end up in that business in particular given all the puts and takes by the end of the year, but we'll have a real good sense of that by the end of next quarter.

The only decline we worry about is the decline in earnings. So accordingly, we always pull production down in the face of weak orders, we have no intention of doing so this year. Given our large 650 backlog, we can, to some degree, feather in more 650s to cover potential downfalls. And of course, we always take cost out of that business. So I think the way to think about Gulfstream for the next 2 years is not necessarily at a strong revenue growth story. Growth will return when the new airplanes enter into service. And this is pretty much in line with what we had anticipated and predictable in a business that continues to refresh its product line with clean-sheet design airplanes. So I thought it will be helpful to just give you a little sense of when we see changes in demand how we act. But as I say, the first quarter was cautious, coming after a robust fourth quarter. And this is pretty much what we have seen in the first quarters for the last couple of years."

So that healthy and long backlog gives us some flexibility -- nice flexibility to feather in some more 650s to offset that transition period, the feathering in as we move to the new airplanes.

Earlier today, we reported first quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.14 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.8 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net earnings of $716 million. We beat analyst consen",976,"Thanks, Erin. Earlier today, we reported first quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.14 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.8 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net earnings of $716 million. We beat analyst consensus by $0.20, and we're well ahead of analysts' expectations on revenue as well. We were also better than our previous guidance and our own expectations.
I should point out that we enjoyed an effective tax rate of 29% as opposed to consensus of around 30.5%. This accounted for approximately $0.05 of the outperformance. Jason Aiken will more fully discuss the tax rate a little later.
I should further note that the diluted weighted average share count was 334.7 million for the quarter compared to consensus of approximately 332 million. So none of the outperformance comes from a lower-than-expected share count.
I have asked Jason to give you a little more insight into our share repurchase activity when I conclude my remarks.
All in all, this is a truly strong quarter from an operating perspective as evidenced by the operating margin of 13.2% and a return on revenue of 9.2%.
It was a good quarter from a cash perspective as well. We had $745 million net cash provided by operating activity. After capital expenditures of $98 million, we had $647 million of free cash flow from operations, about 90% of net income.
The general comparisons quarter-over-quarter are pretty compelling. Compared to the first quarter 2014, revenue was up $519 million or 7.1%. Total defense revenue was up 10.1%; pretty remarkable.
Our operating earnings was slightly more than $1 billion, up 17.5% over the prior year's quarter leading to 120 basis point improvement in margins. This very strong operating leverage is an important part of the story. Net earnings were up more than operating earnings primarily due to the previously mentioned lower tax rate.
Finally, EPS was up 25.1% over the year-ago quarter as a result of better operating earnings, lower tax rate and lower share count.
Let me provide some commentary and a little perspective around the results of our operating segments. 
First, Aerospace. Sales were down by $17 million compared to Q1 2014, less than 1%; and down $132 million sequentially against a strong fourth quarter. On the other hand, earnings outpaced the year-ago quarter by $27 million, about 6.7% on 140 basis point expansion in operating margin.
Operating earnings were also up $19 million sequentially. The 20.4% operating margin for the group represents a high with both companies contributing. A word of caution here. We are out of the gate fast, but this pace is not sustainable from a margin perspective. 
Orders were not overly strong in the quarter but need to be viewed in the context of a very robust fourth quarter 2014. It was a quarter where the sales pipeline was replenished and strengthened, part of a normal cycle after a strong-order quarter. This is consistent with what we saw in the first quarter of 2014 following the strong fourth quarter of 2013. We're off to a very good start in the Aerospace group. 
Marine Systems. Revenue of $1.94 billion was up $342 million or 21.4% compared to the year-ago quarter and down $97 million sequentially as one would expect against the fourth quarter 2014. Operating earnings were up $22 million or 13.3% against the year-ago quarter and down $5 million sequentially. We had particularly good performance at Electric Boat and NASSCO.
Some of the more striking comparisons are found at Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2014, sales were up $105 million or 8.3% and earnings were up $65 million or 46.8% on a 400 basis point improvement in operating margins.
Recall that the results in the first quarter of 2014 were impacted by a $29 million restructuring charge at European Land Systems as a result of reductions in the Austrian operations, which were consolidated into Spain and Switzerland. If we disregard that charge, margins would have been 13.4% on a pro forma basis. Even on that basis, the improvement in this year's operating margin is a significant 160 basis point.
Sequentially, revenue was down $251 million and operating earnings were down $67 million as anticipated in a business that always has a very strong fourth quarter largely related to contract delivery. All up [ph], continued strong performance at Combat Systems. It's been a long time since we've been able to report an increase in revenue in this group.
IS&T. The big upside surprise occurred in this group. You might recall that our guidance was to expect a revenue decline of 5.5% year-over-year. Well, that certainly did not happen in the first quarter. Revenue in the quarter was up $89 million or 3.9% against the year-ago quarter and off only $98 million against the powerful fourth quarter 2014. Operating earnings of $217 million in the quarter were $34 million more than the year-ago quarter, up 18.6% on 120 basis point improvement in margin.
On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $5 million on a 60 basis point improvement in margins. Once again, nice operating leverage. The 9.2% operating margins were the best that this group has achieved in a while and is very encouraging. The trend is in the right direction.
So we're off to a very good start to the year, nicely ahead of our expectations. We do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice and has been for 3 years to give you a full review of our expectation at the midpoint of the year. Suffice it to say that we're ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance was based. We will work to consolidate our improvements and to continue to outperform.
I'd like to now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken."
274561,291068296,797491,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I want to start with a subject that we haven't talked about a lot in the past, and that's foreign exchange rates. With our increasing international revenue base and the continued strengthening of the dollar, we're seein",475,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I want to start with a subject that we haven't talked about a lot in the past, and that's foreign exchange rates. With our increasing international revenue base and the continued strengthening of the dollar, we're seeing an impact in our reported results. Now to be clear, this doesn't involve any economic gain or loss in any of our contracts. What I'm referring to is the translation of our international operating results from their local currencies to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes.
Absent the movement of foreign currency translation rates, the growth in our revenues and earnings over the first quarter of 2014 would have been even more robust than the numbers you see. Specifically, our U.S. dollar reported revenues and operating earnings in the quarter were reduced by approximately $120 million and $20 million, respectively, compared with the exchange rates that prevailed in the first quarter of last year.
In addition, our backlog was reduced by approximately $450 million from year end due to the same translation issue. Setting the FX impact aside, our Combat Systems backlog would have been essentially unchanged from year end, and our IS&T backlog would have been up slightly more than reported.
Moving on to a couple of items on our income statement. Net interest expense in the quarter was $21 million versus $22 million in the first quarter of 2014. During the quarter, we repaid $500 million of maturing fixed rate notes with proceeds from marketable securities on hand. At the end of the first quarter, our balance sheet reflects a net cash position, that's cash in excess of debt, of $1 billion, essentially unchanged from year end.
As Phebe mentioned earlier, our effective tax rate was a bit lower than we had forecast and a bit lower than analyst consensus of around 30.5%. The effective rate was 29% for the quarter versus 30.1% a year ago, and the primary driver was some R&D tax credit claims that were settled during the quarter.
For the year, we're now anticipating an effective tax rate more in the ballpark of 29.5%. On the capital deployment front, you may recall that in the first quarter of last year, we repurchased a little over 14 million shares, including about 11 million shares under an accelerated share repurchase program. Since the end of the first quarter of 2014, our diluted share count is down another 12.5 million shares, the result of almost 20 million additional shares repurchased in the past 4 quarters. And that includes approximately 4.7 million shares repurchased in the first quarter of this year.
All together, we spent $826 million on share repurchases and dividends during the first quarter or 1.3x our free cash flow from operations.
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A."

In other words, we've got plenty of pipeline but slow to contract, not unlike what we've seen in prior quarters. In short, North America and the Mideast are okay. Russia, Latin America and China are slower at the moment. 650 and 650ER demand is robust. So we're holding our own and then some. I think, however, it's important to understand the theory of the case behind how we run this business, how we have historically and how we will continue to do so. The only decline we worry about is a decline in earnings. So accordingly, we always pull production down in the face of weak orders. We have no intention of doing so this year. Given our large 650 backlog, we can to some degree feather in more 650s to cover potential downfalls. And of course, we always take cost out of that business. So I think the way to think about Gulfstream for the next 2 years is not necessarily as a strong revenue growth story. Growth will return when the new airplanes enter into service. And this is pretty much in line with what we had anticipated and predictable in a business that continues to refresh its product line with clean-sheet design airplanes. So I thought it would be helpful to just give you a little sense of when we see changes in demand how we act. But as I say, the first quarter was cautious coming after a robust fourth quarter.

So look, you would expect with the prodigious increase in backlog that we experienced last year that we're beginning to -- we would begin to see that backlog turn into sales and revenue increase, and that's what you're seeing in that group across the portfolio. On our Canadian, Middle East contract, we are finishing up our design efforts and the initial variance, and we're going to begin production later this year. The delivery is in '16. On the U.K. program, we're working some small quantities of preproduction. But again, that will begin to ramp up. And there is -- the Army is increasing its capitalization in their wheeled and tracked vehicles. So all of that is upside and that we recognize some of that. So look, that backlog will start flowing into sales. And the key there is to perform on that backlog. So let me talk to you. You asked a second question that's kind of interesting, that we have pulled out of some competitions. Let me give you a sort of a theory of the case here. We are not going to compete for programs that respond to RFPs where we do not believe that we can get a fair and sufficient return. Chasing revenues that don't have good earnings doesn't help us or our shareholders one lick. So this really has more to do with the discipline on how we run our company rather than the response on any particular program. We're just not going to compete in programs where we think that we can't make a fair return and a good return."

Well, as you may have observed from our press release, we enjoyed a particularly strong second quarter, with revenue of $7.88 billion and net earnings of $752 million. We reported EPS of $2.27 per diluted share, $0.39 ah",1397,"Thank you, Erin, and good morning. Well, as you may have observed from our press release, we enjoyed a particularly strong second quarter, with revenue of $7.88 billion and net earnings of $752 million. We reported EPS of $2.27 per diluted share, $0.39 ahead of earnings from continuing operations in the year-ago quarter. We were also $0.21 per share better than consensus. Revenue of $7.88 billion is $408 million higher than the year-ago quarter. That represents year-over-year revenue growth of 5.5%.
Earnings from continuing operations of $752 million is $106 million higher on the strength of 13.7 operating margins, a 100 basis point improvement over the year-ago quarter. I should note that our earnings include a modest gain on the sale of our commercial cyber product business in the IS&T segment. Excluding that gain, operating margin would be 13.4%, and EPS would be $2.22, still substantially better than all comparative quarters and consensus. Sequentially, revenue was up $98 million or 1.3%, and net earnings are up $36 million on a 50 basis point improvement in operating margins.
Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2015 and compare it to the first half of 2014. Revenue was up 6.3%. Operating earnings at $2.11 billion are up 15.6%. Net earnings from continuing operations are up over 18%. In short, we're off to a very good start, well ahead of our internal plan and ahead of external expectations. That leads quite naturally to the guidance increase reflected in the press release. I'll provide some additional color on that guidance shortly.
Let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and then the half, and then I'll concluded with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and tie that into our EPS guidance.
First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a good quarter with revenue of $2.3 billion, $263 million higher than the year-ago quarter and a $55 million improvement in operating earnings. Jet Aviation once again made a strong contribution with double-digit operating margins.
For the first half of 2015 compared to the first half of last year, Aerospace revenue is up $246 million or 6%, operating earnings are up $82 million or 10.4% on the strength of an 80 basis point improvement in operating margins.
Let me spend a moment on the business aviation marketplace. There has been much speculation about it in a lot of what I would call rumor intelligence or RUMIT. From an order perspective, Gulfstream enjoyed its best discrete second quarter since the second quarter of 2008. The end result is an approximate $1 billion increase in the Aerospace group funded backlog, with Gulfstream as the primary reason. The U.S. economy remains strong, particularly compared to others in the world, so it should be no surprise that North America dominated the order book in the quarter. The sales pipeline remained steady across all models. We've seen no decline in the level of interest and a particularly encouraging return of S&P 500 companies as they seek to replenish aging fleet.
I should add that the first flight of the G500 occurred in the quarter, and the test program is proceeding on schedule.
Next, Combat Systems. Combat had a great quarter. Revenue is $1.41 billion, $57 million less than the second quarter last year, however, 110 basis point improvement in operating margins to 16.1% resulted in a modest increase in operating earnings over the year-ago quarter. All in all, a very strong performance.
For the first half, revenue increased 1.8% against the first half of 2014. Operating earnings are up $71 million or 19.8%, resulting in 230 basis point margin expansion against the first half of last year, pretty impressive.
Marine group revenue of $2 billion is higher than second quarter 2014 by $150 million or 8.1%. Operating earnings are up $13 million or 7.5% against the year-ago quarter. Revenue was up nicely on a sequential basis, and operating earnings are constant on a 40 basis point reduction in margins. For the first half, Marine group revenue of $3.94 billion is up $492 million against the first half of 2014. This is a very strong 14.3% growth.
Operating earnings are up $35 million, 10.3% on slightly lower margins. Margins were still a very respectable 9.5% for the first half.
Marine Systems has been a compelling story for us and will continue to be so. We have a little work to do, however, on margins in the second half.
You may recall that IS&T is a place where we expected a 5.5% contraction in revenue for the year. Well, fortunately, we are doing materially better than that. Revenue was $2.2 billion is up $52 million or 2.4% against 2014 second quarter. But the real story is operating earnings. They are up $449 million on a 200 basis point improvement operating margins against the year-ago quarter. As I previously noted, the sale of our cyber products business provided some profit in the quarter. On a normalized basis, without that gain, margins would have been 9.7%, an increase of 100 basis points over the year-ago quarter.
The story for the first half is much the same. Revenue is up $141 million or 3.2%, and operating earnings are up $83 million over 22% on 160 basis point improvement. Once again, on a normalized basis, operating margins would have been 9.4%, a 110 basis point improvement over the first half of 2014. This is a very good news story and as you're going to hear in a moment, it will continue.
So let me provide some guidance for the year for each segment, compare this guidance to what we told you in January and then wrap it up into our EPS guidance.
For Aerospace, our guidance to you in January was to expect revenue of approximately $9.4 billion and operating margins around 18%. We now believe revenue will be off by about $250 million to $300 million. On the other hand, margins are expected to be about 18.5% for the year, resulting in about the same as anticipated operating earnings. The 18.5% margin guidance for the year imply some pressure on margins in the second half, due largely to mixed shift, increased R&D spending, building airplanes for use in the test program and a planned reduction and production at Jet Aviation Basel. To that point, we are performing the engineering work at Basel necessary to conduct a full complement of airplanes into production in the first quarter next year.
For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue similar to 2014 or about $5.7 billion with margins around 150%. continue to expect revenue consistent with prior guidance. Margins, however, will be in the 40 to 50 basis point higher range, resulting in a higher-than-predicted operating earnings for the year.
In Marine Systems, we previously guided to revenue growth of 2.5% or approximately $7.5 billion and a margin rate in the 9.5% range. We now expect revenue of approximately $7.8 billion, which translates to growth of 6.7% against last year. Margin rates will be about 10 basis points better than previously forecast. The higher revenue and somewhat better margins were once again result in higher operating earnings and earlier forecast. By the way, the operating margin result will be driven by a double-digit fourth quarter.
For IS&T, we previously guided to a revenue decline of 5.5% or about $8.7 billion of revenue and a margin rate around 9%. It now appears that revenue will be between $9 billion to $9.1 billion, and the margin rate should be about 70 basis points better than guidance. Once again, this will result in higher than previously expected operating earnings for the year.
In summary, all of this rolls into revenue for the year of $31.7 billion to $31.8 billion, an operating margin around 13% and a return on sales from continuing operations slightly in excess of 9%. So higher than previously anticipated operating earnings, a modestly lower tax rate and a lower share count permit us to increase our EPS guidance for continuing operations to between $8.70 to $8.80.
The progression through the remainder of the year is that we will see a third quarter just weaker than the second and the fourth quarter that looks very much like the second quarter.
I'd like to now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken."

First, I'll follow-up on a point we addressed in last quarter's call, and that's impact we're seeing from foreig",522,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I've got just a couple of quick financial items to go over before we start the question-and-answer period. First, I'll follow-up on a point we addressed in last quarter's call, and that's impact we're seeing from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. When you compare our second quarter results to the year-ago period, our 2015 revenues and operating earnings would have been higher by $130 million and $20 million, respectively, at the exchange rates that prevailed in the second quarter of 2014 remained in effect this year. Combined with the first quarter results, our revenues and operating earnings were reduced by $250 million and $40 million so far this year as a result of the strengthening of the dollar. Stated another way, absent the headwind from the translation of our international business in the U.S. dollars, our revenue growth in the first half would have been 8%.
Moving down the income statement. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $20 million versus $24 million in the second quarter of 2014. The decline was driven largely by the repayment of $500 million of debt in January. For 2015, we expect interest expense to be approximately $85 million.
At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects a net cash position, and that's cash in excess of debt of $690 million. This is down by almost $400 million from the prior quarter due to our capital deployment activity, which I'll address in just a minute. Our effective tax rate was 29.1% for the quarter, slightly lower than expected as we continue to see the benefit of higher international earnings. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate in the low 29% range. We continue to expect cash contributions to our pension plans for 2015 to be $185 million, and most of that funding is expected to occur in the third quarter.
A quick point of color on the cash flow statement is included in our release. One item you'll note is cash proceeds from asset sales in the first half of just shy of $260 million. We've mentioned from time to time some of the small scaled portfolio shaping we've been doing, and that's what you see there. So that's primarily the divestitures of our commercial cyber business, which Phebe mentioned just a few minutes ago; and AxleTech, which closed earlier in the year.
And on the subject of share repurchases. In the quarter, we purchased slightly less than 7.5 million shares for just over $1 billion. We've purchased a little more than 12 million shares in the first half for just shy of $1.7 billion. And in total, when combined with dividends paid, we returned approximately $1.2 billion in the quarter and $2 billion year-to-date, well ahead of our free cash flow for the first half.
At the end of the second quarter, we have $4 billion of cash on the balance sheet and are well positioned to continue to execute our 2015 capital deployment strategy.
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the mic back over to for you for the Q&A."

Ohio engineering revenue has increased quite a bit over last year, both of those. And then the commercial ship construction at NASSCO is increasing as our backlog of the echo tankers and our construction cycles. So those are the 3 factors that are increasing our outlook for the year. On margins, we just have some work to do across the portfolio. If you think about what the history has been on blocks of submarines. Block IV is still in its early stages, and so as we continue our reengineering effort, we expect to realize some cost savings, which will improve performance and margins on Block IV. That's going to be a longer-term proposition. We historically, throughout that program, have recognized higher margins as we progress further into the construction. So we see some long-term margin expansion opportunities there, and we're seeing some -- we've seen very good performance at NASSCO on their ecotankers construction and on the MLP for the Navy, and then we've got some margin compression that back ironworks that we need to continue to work through on our DDG 1000 program. I don't expect it, but often typical of a new product shipped, particularly one that is as powerful and transformational warship as DDG 1000 is.

So this is a -- when you have an inflow of order -- orders and the completions on these airplanes require a fair amount of high-level engineering on the front end, engineering and design. So to integrate that, get that engineering design done, done so we're ready to move into full rate production at a very efficient rate is I think judicious and was part of our plan all along. You need to do that in order to produce these things that have -- at a effective margin level and profitability.

We take ELS, for example. We always knew that we were going to have to invest in that business, because when we purchased it, it had excess infrastructure. So we made the investment, and their cost structure and their rep right now is at highly competitive levels. That was the competency of that management team. They are really performing. And all of our expectations were realized because they did what they needed to do, and we supported them in that. So they have increasingly won dwant every bit that they've been in. And the Denmark win was significant for them. It's a replacement of the EMAN 13 fleet about $500 million. We've been in Denmark for a while, but it was European Land Systems. Both their design excellence, their operating performance and their understanding of that very important customer that allowed them to execute and win. In the U.K., that's really been out of the Phoenix, right? I mean, out of the ashes rose the phoenix. We had to dismantle that entire business and turn it over to Land Systems to run the SD program so the guys he knew how to build Combat vehicles actually rebuilding the Combat vehicle and returned over the remaining IS&T businesses to Mission Systems, and both have done a superb job of taking costs out, increasing the competitiveness. I think you maybe just have heard, I think it's earlier this week, maybe even last week, the U.K. government announced another $630 million service and support contract for the SC program. You don't get that unless you demonstrate your performance and with a very affordable cost structure so that you could support the needs of your customers. So that to me is a -- I said it's a parable of what can go right when you do what you need to do."

Well, as you may have observed from our press release, we enjoyed a particularly strong second quarter, with revenue of $7.88 billion and net earnings of $752 million. We reported EPS of $2.27 per diluted share, $0.39 ah",1402,"Thank you, Erin, and good morning. Well, as you may have observed from our press release, we enjoyed a particularly strong second quarter, with revenue of $7.88 billion and net earnings of $752 million. We reported EPS of $2.27 per diluted share, $0.39 ahead of earnings from continuing operations in the year-ago quarter. We were also $0.21 per share better than consensus. Revenue of $7.88 billion is $408 million higher than the year-ago quarter. That represents year-over-year revenue growth of 5.5%.
Earnings from continuing operations of $752 million is $106 million higher on the strength of 13.7 operating margins, a 100 basis point improvement over the year-ago quarter. I should note that our earnings include a modest gain on the sale of our commercial cyber product business in the IS&T segment. Excluding that gain, operating margin would be 13.4%, and EPS would be $2.22, still substantially better than all comparative quarters and consensus. Sequentially, revenue was up $98 million, or 1.3%, and net earnings are up $36 million on a 50 basis point improvement in operating margins.
Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2015 and compare it to the first half of 2014. Revenue was up 6.3%. Operating earnings at $2.11 billion are up 15.6%. Net earnings from continuing operations are up over 18%. In short, we're off to a very good start, well ahead of our internal plan and ahead of external expectations. That leads quite naturally to the guidance increase reflected in the press release. I'll provide some additional color on that guidance shortly.
Let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and then the half, and then I'll conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and tie that into our EPS guidance.
First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a good quarter with revenue of $2.3 billion, $263 million higher than the year-ago quarter and a $55 million improvement in operating earnings. Jet Aviation once again made a strong contribution with double-digit operating margins.
For the first half of 2015 compared with the first half of last year, Aerospace revenue is up $246 million, or 6%, operating earnings are up $82 million, or 10.4% on the strength of an 80 basis point improvement in operating margins.
Let me spend a moment on the business aviation marketplace. There has been much speculation about it and a lot of what I would call rumor intelligence or rumit. From an order perspective, Gulfstream enjoyed its best discrete second quarter since the second quarter of 2008. The end result is an approximate $1 billion increase in the Aerospace group funded backlog, with Gulfstream as the primary reason. The U.S. economy remains strong, particularly compared to others in the world, so it should be no surprise that North America dominated the order book in the quarter. The sales pipeline remained steady across all models. We've seen no decline in the level of interest and a particularly encouraging return of S&P 500 companies as they seek to replenish aging fleet.
I should add that the first flight of the G500 occurred in the quarter, and the test program is proceeding on schedule.
Next, Combat Systems. Combat had a great quarter. Revenue is $1.41 billion, $57 million less than the second quarter last year, however, a 110 basis point improvement in operating margins to 16.1% resulted in a modest increase in operating earnings over the year-ago quarter. All in all, a very strong performance.
For the first half, revenue increased 1.8% against the first half of 2014. Operating earnings are up $71 million, or 19.8%, resulting in 230 basis point margin expansion against the first half of last year, pretty impressive.
Marine group revenue of $2 billion is higher than second quarter 2014 by $150 million, or 8.1%. Operating earnings are up $13 million, or 7.5% against the year-ago quarter. Revenue was up nicely on a sequential basis, and operating earnings are constant on a 40 basis point reduction in margins. For the first half, Marine group revenue of $3.94 billion is up $492 million against the first half of 2014. This is a very strong 14.3% growth.
Operating earnings are up $35 million, 10.3% on slightly lower margins. Margins were still a very respectable 9.5% for the first half.
Marine Systems has been a compelling story for us and will continue to be so. We have a little work to do, however, on margins in the second half.
You may recall that IS&T is a place where we expected a 5.5% contraction in revenue for the year. Well, fortunately, we are doing materially better than that. Revenue was $2.2 billion, is up $52 million or 2.4% against 2014 second quarter. But the real story is operating earnings. They are up 400 -- $49 million on a 200 basis point improvement operating margins against the year-ago quarter. As I previously noted, the sale of our cyber products business provided some profit in the quarter. On a normalized basis, without that gain, margins would have been 9.7%, an increase of 100 basis points over the year-ago quarter.
The story for the first half is much the same. Revenue is up $141 million, or 3.2%, and operating earnings are up $83 million over 22% on a 160 basis point improvement. Once again, on a normalized basis, operating margins would have been 9.4%, a 110 basis point improvement over the first half of 2014. This is a very good news story and as you're going to hear in a moment, it will continue.
So let me provide some guidance for the year for each segment, compare this guidance to what we told you in January and then wrap it up into our EPS guidance.
For Aerospace, our guidance to you in January was to expect revenue of approximately $9.4 billion and operating margins around 18%. We now believe revenue will be off by about $250 million to $300 million. On the other hand, margins are expected to be about 18.5% for the year, resulting in about the same as anticipated operating earnings. The 18.5% margin guidance for the year implies some pressure on margins in the second half, due largely to mixed shift, increased R&D spending, building airplanes for use in the test program and a planned reduction in production at Jet Aviation Basel. To that point, we are performing the engineering work at Basel necessary to conduct a full complement of airplanes into production in the first quarter next year.
For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue similar to 2014, or about $5.7 billion with margins around 15%. We continue to expect revenue consistent with prior guidance. Margins, however, will be in the 40 to 50 basis point higher range, resulting in a higher-than-predicted operating earnings for the year.
In Marine Systems, we previously guided to revenue growth of 2.5%, or approximately $7.5 billion and a margin rate in the 9.5% range. We now expect revenue of approximately $7.8 billion, which translates to growth of 6.7% against last year. Margin rates will be about 10 basis points better than previously forecast. The higher revenue and somewhat better margins were once again result in higher operating earnings and earlier forecast. By the way, the operating margin result will be driven by a double-digit fourth quarter.
For IS&T, we previously guided to a revenue decline of 5.5%, or about $8.7 billion of revenue and a margin rate around 9%. It now appears that revenue will be between $9 billion to $9.1 billion, and the margin rate should be about 70 basis points better than guidance. Once again, this will result in higher than previously expected operating earnings for the year.
In summary, all of this rolls into revenue for the year of $31.7 billion to $31.8 billion, an operating margin around 13% and a return on sales from continuing operations slightly in excess of 9%. So higher than previously anticipated operating earnings, a modestly lower tax rate and a lower share count permit us to increase our EPS guidance for continuing operations to between $8.70 to $8.80.
The progression through the remainder of the year is that we will see a third quarter just weaker than the second and a fourth quarter that looks very much like the second quarter.
I'd like to now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken."

First, I'll follow-up on a point we addressed in last quarter's call, and that's the impact we're seeing from fo",521,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I've got just a couple of quick financial items to go over before we start the question-and-answer period. First, I'll follow-up on a point we addressed in last quarter's call, and that's the impact we're seeing from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. When you compare our second quarter results to the year-ago period, our 2015 revenues and operating earnings would have been higher by $130 million and $20 million, respectively, had the exchange rates that prevailed in the second quarter of 2014 remained in effect this year. Combined with the first quarter results, our revenues and operating earnings were reduced by $250 million and $40 million so far this year as a result of the strengthening of the dollar. Stated another way, absent the headwind from the translation of our international business in the U.S. dollars, our revenue growth in the first half would have been 8%.
Moving down the income statement. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $20 million versus $24 million in the second quarter of 2014. The decline was driven largely by the repayment of $500 million of debt in January. For 2015, we expect interest expense to be approximately $85 million.
At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects a net cash position, and that's cash in excess of debt of $690 million. This is down by almost $400 million from the prior quarter due to our capital deployment activities, which I'll address in just a minute. Our effective tax rate was 29.1% for the quarter, slightly lower than expected as we continue to see the benefit of higher international earnings. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate in the low 29% range. We continue to expect cash contributions to our pension plans for 2015 to be $185 million, and most of that funding is expected to occur in the third quarter.
A quick point of color on the cash flow statement is included in our release. One item you'll note is cash proceeds from asset sales in the first half of just shy of $260 million. We've mentioned from time to time some of the small-scale portfolio shaping we've been doing, and that's what you see there. So that's primarily the divestitures of our commercial cyber business, which Phebe mentioned just a few minutes ago; and AxleTech, which closed earlier in the year.
And on the subject of share repurchases. In the quarter, we purchased slightly less than 7.5 million shares for just over $1 billion. We've purchased a little more than 12 million shares in the first half for just shy of $1.7 billion. And in total, when combined with dividends paid, we returned approximately $1.2 billion in the quarter and $2 billion year-to-date, well ahead of our free cash flow for the first half.
At the end of the second quarter, we have $4 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and are well positioned to continue to execute our 2015 capital deployment strategy.
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the mic back over to you for the Q&A."

Ohio engineering revenue has increased quite a bit over the last year, both of those. And then the commercial ship construction at NASSCO is increasing, is our backlog of the Ecotankers and our construction cycles. So those are the 3 factors that are increasing our outlook for the year. On margins, we just have some work to do across the portfolio. If you think about what the history has been on blocks of submarines. Block IV is still in its early stages, and so as we continue our reengineering efforts, we expect to realize some cost savings, which will improve performance and margins on Block IV. That's going to be a longer-term proposition. Because we historically, throughout that program, have recognized higher margins as we progress further into the construction. So we see some long-term margin expansion opportunities there, and we're seeing some -- we're seeing very good performance at NASSCO on their Ecotanker construction and on the MLP for the Navy, and then we've got some margin compression at Bath Iron Works that we need to continue to work through on our DDG 1000 program. Not unexpected, but also typical of a new class of ship, particularly one that is this powerful and transformational warship as DDG 1000 is. So we've got a little ways to go on that, and we're working with our Navy customer, and our vendors and their vendors to get that first ship into sea trials, so more to come."

We -- take the ELS, for example. We always knew that we were going to have to invest in that business, because when we purchased it, it had excess infrastructure. So we made that investment, and their cost structure and their wrap rate now is at highly competitive levels. That was the competency of that management team. They are really performing. And all of our expectations were realized because they did what they needed to do, and we supported them in that. So they have increasingly won every bit that they've been in. And the Denmark win was significant for them. It's a replacement of the M113 fleet about $500 million. We've been in Denmark for a while, but it was European Land Systems. Both their design excellence, their operating performance and their understanding of that very important customer that allowed them to execute and win. In the U.K., that's really been out of the phoenix, right? I mean, out of the ashes rose the phoenix. We had to dismantle that entire business and turn it over to Land Systems to run the SD program, so the guys we knew how to build Combat vehicles, actually they're building the Combat vehicle and we turned over the remaining IS&T businesses to Mission Systems, and both have done a superb job of taking costs out, increasing their competitiveness. So I think you may just have heard, I think it's earlier this week, maybe even last week, the U.K. government announced another $630 million service and support contract for the SC program. You don't get that unless you demonstrate your performance and with a very affordable cost structure, so that you can support the needs of your customers.

Well, as you may have observed from our press release, we enjoyed a particularly strong second quarter, with revenue of $7.88 billion and net earnings of $752 million. We reported EPS of $2.27 per diluted share, $0.39 ah",1402,"Thank you, Erin, and good morning. Well, as you may have observed from our press release, we enjoyed a particularly strong second quarter, with revenue of $7.88 billion and net earnings of $752 million. We reported EPS of $2.27 per diluted share, $0.39 ahead of earnings from continuing operations in the year-ago quarter. We were also $0.21 per share better than consensus. Revenue of $7.88 billion is $408 million higher than the year-ago quarter. That represents year-over-year revenue growth of 5.5%.
Earnings from continuing operations of $752 million is $106 million higher on the strength of 13.7 operating margins, a 100 basis point improvement over the year-ago quarter. I should note that our earnings include a modest gain on the sale of our commercial cyber product business in the IS&T segment. Excluding that gain, operating margin would be 13.4%, and EPS would be $2.22, still substantially better than all comparative quarters and consensus. Sequentially, revenue was up $98 million, or 1.3%, and net earnings are up $36 million on a 50 basis point improvement in operating margins.
Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2015 and compare it to the first half of 2014. Revenue was up 6.3%. Operating earnings at $2.11 billion are up 15.6%. Net earnings from continuing operations are up over 18%. In short, we're off to a very good start, well ahead of our internal plan and ahead of external expectations. That leads quite naturally to the guidance increase reflected in the press release. I'll provide some additional color on that guidance shortly.
Let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and then the half, and then I'll conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and tie that into our EPS guidance.
First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a good quarter with revenue of $2.3 billion, $263 million higher than the year-ago quarter and a $55 million improvement in operating earnings. Jet Aviation once again made a strong contribution with double-digit operating margins.
For the first half of 2015 compared with the first half of last year, Aerospace revenue is up $246 million, or 6%, operating earnings are up $82 million, or 10.4% on the strength of an 80 basis point improvement in operating margins.
Let me spend a moment on the business aviation marketplace. There has been much speculation about it and a lot of what I would call rumor intelligence or rumit. From an order perspective, Gulfstream enjoyed its best discrete second quarter since the second quarter of 2008. The end result is an approximate $1 billion increase in the Aerospace group funded backlog, with Gulfstream as the primary reason. The U.S. economy remains strong, particularly compared to others in the world, so it should be no surprise that North America dominated the order book in the quarter. The sales pipeline remained steady across all models. We've seen no decline in the level of interest and a particularly encouraging return of S&P 500 companies as they seek to replenish aging fleet.
I should add that the first flight of the G500 occurred in the quarter, and the test program is proceeding on schedule.
Next, Combat Systems. Combat had a great quarter. Revenue is $1.41 billion, $57 million less than the second quarter last year, however, a 110 basis point improvement in operating margins to 16.1% resulted in a modest increase in operating earnings over the year-ago quarter. All in all, a very strong performance.
For the first half, revenue increased 1.8% against the first half of 2014. Operating earnings are up $71 million, or 19.8%, resulting in 230 basis point margin expansion against the first half of last year, pretty impressive.
Marine group revenue of $2 billion is higher than second quarter 2014 by $150 million, or 8.1%. Operating earnings are up $13 million, or 7.5% against the year-ago quarter. Revenue was up nicely on a sequential basis, and operating earnings are constant on a 40 basis point reduction in margins. For the first half, Marine group revenue of $3.94 billion is up $492 million against the first half of 2014. This is a very strong 14.3% growth.
Operating earnings are up $35 million, 10.3% on slightly lower margins. Margins were still a very respectable 9.5% for the first half.
Marine Systems has been a compelling story for us and will continue to be so. We have a little work to do, however, on margins in the second half.
You may recall that IS&T is a place where we expected a 5.5% contraction in revenue for the year. Well, fortunately, we are doing materially better than that. Revenue was $2.2 billion, is up $52 million or 2.4% against 2014 second quarter. But the real story is operating earnings. They are up 400 -- $49 million on a 200 basis point improvement operating margins against the year-ago quarter. As I previously noted, the sale of our cyber products business provided some profit in the quarter. On a normalized basis without that gain, margins would have been 9.7%, an increase of 100 basis points over the year-ago quarter.
The story for the first half is much the same. Revenue is up $141 million, or 3.2%, and operating earnings are up $83 million over 22% on a 160 basis point improvement. Once again, on a normalized basis, operating margins would have been 9.4%, a 110 basis point improvement over the first half of 2014. This is a very good news story and as you're going to hear in a moment, it will continue.
So let me provide some guidance for the year for each segment, compare this guidance to what we told you in January and then wrap it up into our EPS guidance.
For Aerospace, our guidance to you in January was to expect revenue of approximately $9.4 billion and operating margins around 18%. We now believe revenue will be off by about $250 million to $300 million. On the other hand, margins are expected to be about 18.5% for the year, resulting in about the same as anticipated operating earnings. The 18.5% margin guidance for the year implies some pressure on margins in the second half, due largely to mixed shift, increased R&D spending, building airplanes for use in the test program and a planned reduction in production at Jet Aviation Basel. To that point, we are performing the engineering work at Basel necessary to conduct a full complement of airplanes into production in the first quarter next year.
For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue similar to 2014, or about $5.7 billion with margins around 15%. We continue to expect revenue consistent with prior guidance. Margins, however, will be in the 40 to 50 basis point higher range, resulting in a higher-than-predicted operating earnings for the year.
In Marine Systems, we previously guided to revenue growth of 2.5%, or approximately $7.5 billion and a margin rate in the 9.5% range. We now expect revenue of approximately $7.8 billion, which translates to growth of 6.7% against last year. Margin rates will be about 10 basis points better than previously forecast. The higher revenue and somewhat better margins will once again result in higher operating earnings and earlier forecast. By the way, the operating margin result will be driven by a double-digit fourth quarter.
For IS&T, we previously guided to a revenue decline of 5.5%, or about $8.7 billion of revenue and a margin rate around 9%. It now appears that revenue will be between $9 billion to $9.1 billion, and the margin rate should be about 70 basis points better than guidance. Once again, this will result in higher than previously expected operating earnings for the year.
In summary, all of this rolls into revenue for the year of $31.7 billion to $31.8 billion, an operating margin around 13% and a return on sales from continuing operations slightly in excess of 9%. So higher than previously anticipated operating earnings, a modestly lower tax rate and a lower share count permit us to increase our EPS guidance for continuing operations to between $8.70 to $8.80.
The progression through the remainder of the year is that we will see a third quarter just weaker than the second and a fourth quarter that looks very much like the second quarter.
I'd like to now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken."
274561,306861597,841373,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I've got just a couple of quick financial items to go over before we start the question-and-answer period. First, I'll follow-up on a point we addressed in last quarter's call, and that's the impact we're seeing from fo",520,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I've got just a couple of quick financial items to go over before we start the question-and-answer period. First, I'll follow-up on a point we addressed in last quarter's call, and that's the impact we're seeing from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. When you compare our second quarter results to the year-ago period, our 2015 revenues and operating earnings would have been higher by $130 million and $20 million, respectively, had the exchange rates that prevailed in the second quarter of 2014 remained in effect this year. Combined with the first quarter results, our revenues and operating earnings were reduced by $250 million and $40 million so far this year as a result of the strengthening of the dollar. Stated another way, absent the headwind from the translation of our international business into U.S. dollars, our revenue growth in the first half would have been 8%.
Moving down the income statement. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $20 million versus $24 million in the second quarter of 2014. The decline was driven largely by the repayment of $500 million of debt in January. For 2015, we expect interest expense to be approximately $85 million.
At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects a net cash position, and that's cash in excess of debt of $690 million. This is down by almost $400 million from the prior quarter due to our capital deployment activities, which I'll address in just a minute. Our effective tax rate was 29.1% for the quarter, slightly lower than expected as we continue to see the benefit of higher international earnings. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate in the low 29% range. We continue to expect cash contributions to our pension plans for 2015 to be $185 million, and most of that funding is expected to occur in the third quarter.
A quick point of color on the cash flow statement is included in our release. One item you'll note is cash proceeds from asset sales in the first half of just shy of $260 million. We've mentioned from time to time some of the small-scale portfolio shaping we've been doing, and that's what you see there. So that's primarily the divestitures of our commercial cyber business, which Phebe mentioned just a few minutes ago; and AxleTech, which closed earlier in the year.
And on the subject of share repurchases. In the quarter, we purchased slightly less than 7.5 million shares for just over $1 billion. We've purchased a little more than 12 million shares in the first half for just shy of $1.7 billion. And in total, when combined with dividends paid, we returned approximately $1.2 billion in the quarter and $2 billion year-to-date, well ahead of our free cash flow for the first half.
At the end of the second quarter, we have $4 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and are well positioned to continue to execute our 2015 capital deployment strategy.
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the mic back over to you for the Q&A."

Ohio engineering revenue has increased quite a bit over the last year, both of those. And then the commercial ship construction at NASSCO is increasing, is our backlog of the Ecotankers and our construction cycles. So those are the 3 factors that are increasing our outlook for the year. On margins, we just have some work to do across the portfolio. If you think about what the history has been on blocks of submarines. Block IV is still in its early stages, and so as we continue our reengineering efforts, we expect to realize some cost savings, which will improve performance and margins on Block IV. That's going to be a longer-term proposition. Because we historically, throughout that program, have recognized higher margins as we progress further into the construction. So we see some long-term margin expansion opportunities there, and we're seeing some -- we're seeing very good performance at NASSCO on their Ecotanker construction and on the MLP for the Navy, and then we've got some margin compression at Bath Iron Works that we need to continue to work through on our DDG 1000 program. Not unexpected, but often typical of a new class of ship, particularly one that is this powerful and transformational warship as DDG 1000 is. So we've got a little ways to go on that, and we're working with our Navy customer, and our vendors and their vendors to get that first ship into sea trials, so more to come."

In 2013, we were inwardly focused on improving our operations and retiring a considerable amount of risks that we found in the company. We did all of that.

And given the backlog, we are poised for growth this year, next year and through my current planning horizon. Our defense companies are growing. We've talked about the transition at -- in Aerospace, but fundamentally these defense companies across the board are -- they have the backlog in Combat and Marine and IS&T to continue to grow.

We -- take the ELS, for example. We always knew that we were going to have to invest in that business, because when we purchased it, it had excess infrastructure. So we made that investment, and their cost structure and their wrap rate now is at highly competitive levels. That, with the competency of that management team, they are really performing. And all of our expectations were realized because they did what they needed to do, and we supported them in that. So they have increasingly won every bid that they've been in. And the Denmark win was significant for them. It's a replacement of the M113 fleet, about $500 million. We've been in Denmark for a while, but it was European Land Systems. Both their design excellence, their operating performance and their understanding of that very important customer that allowed them to execute and win. In the U.K., that's really been out of the phoenix, right? I mean, out of the ashes rose the phoenix. We had to dismantle that entire business and turn it over to Land Systems to run the SD program, so the guys we knew how to build Combat vehicles, actually were building the Combat vehicle and we turned over the remaining IS&T businesses to Mission Systems, and both have done a superb job of taking costs out, increasing their competitiveness. So I think you may just have heard, I think it's earlier this week, maybe even last week, the U.K. government announced another $630 million service and support contract for the SC program. You don't get that unless you demonstrate your performance and with a very affordable cost structure, so that you can support the needs of your customers. So that to me is a -- I said it's a parable of what can go right when you do what you need to do."

As is obvious from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.28 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.99 billion and income from continuing operations of $733 million. This is $",1228,"Good morning. As is obvious from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.28 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.99 billion and income from continuing operations of $733 million. This is $0.23 per share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.15 per share better than consensus.
Against the year-ago quarter, revenue is up $243 million or 3.1%; operating earnings are up $35 million, a 3.5% increase; and income from continuing operations is up $39 million, a 5.6% increase.
This quarter's operating earnings of $1,034,000,000 reflects 12.9 operating margin, consistent with the 12.9 operating margin of third quarter 2014. By the way, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that we have had both operating earnings and EBIT in excess of $1 billion.
Sequentially, revenue is up $112 million or 1.4%, operating earnings are down $47 million and operating margin is down 80 basis points. Recall, however, that last quarter's earnings included a gain on the sale of our cyber commercial security business. Excluding that gain, the operating earnings for the quarter rather similar.
On a year-to-date basis, revenue is up $1.17 billion, a 5.2% increase; operating earnings are up $320 million, a very strong 11.3% increase; and operating margins are up 80 basis points. Once again reflecting our emphasis on continuous improvement in operations.
With respect to cash. We had $652 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. That is 89% of net income from continuing operations. We have $1.81 billion year-to-date, 82% of net income from continuing operations. You may recall that we received significant advanced payments on international orders last year and on commercial shipbuilding orders a year before. That cash is being deployed this year and next, as we had previously advised you. 
We are also hampered by OWC growth at Gulfstream, which is the natural result of building test articles and preproduction build-up of parts and wings for the G500 and G600. All of the foregoing makes performance at 100% of net income this year and next problematic.
In the quarter, we purchased 7.15 million shares for over $1 billion. We have purchased approximately 19.3 million shares year-to-date for about $2.7 billion. This is consistent with our prior guidance to you that we would repurchase shares and pay dividends in amounts in excess of this year's free cash flow.
To help you size that, we have spent $3,380,000,000 on share repurchases and dividends year-to-date compared to free cash flow of $1.81 billion. That is a delta of $1.75 billion. That delta is likely to grow in the fourth quarter.
As you can see from the charts attached to press release, a very healthy backlog is holding nicely. Once again, there was a good intake of orders in all segments other than the Marine group, where we have received several multiyear orders in prior quarters. The Marine group has the largest backlog of all of our operating segments. We ended the quarter with total backlog for the company at $68.7 billion, down modestly from the end of last quarter.
Let me say a few words about each of our businesses -- business groups, and I'll start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another very good quarter. Revenue, earnings and margins are all up from the year-ago quarter as well as for the first 9 months of the year. The group reported sales of $2.34 billion, up from the third quarter of 2014 by $54 million or 2.4%. This represents the group's highest ever revenue quarter.
Operating earnings increased $15 million or 3.6% to $426 million on an operating margin of 18.2%, a 20 basis point improvement on the year-ago quarter. By the way, this is the fifth consecutive quarter with operating earnings in excess of $400 million. 
On a sequential basis, the group experienced some margin compression from the first half, but was nevertheless better than our expectations and guidance to you. We had good order intake in the group at 0.8:1 book to bill measured in dollar value of orders and 0.9:1 in number of units sold. The distribution of the orders is also attractive, with the G650 and 650 ER leading the way. Only 4 of the orders were from models not yet in production.
Much like the automobile industry, general business aviation market is increasingly North America focused, with particularly strong interest from Fortune 500 companies. However, the G650 continues to see activity even in areas experiencing political or economic challenges. We had G650 orders in China, Japan, Brazil and Eastern Europe in the quarter. Our pipeline of projects and active sales discussions are good. So we are reasonably optimistic about order intake for the fourth quarter.
Next, Combat Systems. Combat had a very good quarter with revenue of $1.35 billion, operating earnings of $218 million and a really strong 16.2% operating margins. However, margins are up somewhat against the third quarter 2014 when we enjoyed an operating margin that was 40 basis points higher. Compared to third quarter of 2014, revenue was off $50 million and earnings were off $14 million. Importantly, however, year-to-date revenue was flat against 2014, operating earnings are up $57 million or 9.6% and operating margin is at [ph] 15.7%, up 130 [ph] basis points. Combat Systems remains on course for a very strong year.
The Marine group's revenue is higher than 2014, both for the third quarter and for the first 9 months. Revenue in the quarter is up by $267 million, a 14.7% increase to $2.09 billion. Year-to-date, revenue has increased by $759 million or 14.4% to over $6 billion. The growth in both periods is attributable to the group's submarine programs, both construction, repair and engineering and to a lesser degree, commercial ship construction activities. This is the strongest revenue quarter ever for the Marine group. 
Operating earnings at $181 million are up modestly compared to last year's quarter. The group's operating margins were down 60 basis points in the quarter and 50 basis points year-to-date as a result of mix shift and a onetime charge at NASSCO and a warranty item in the quarter. However, margins for the first 9 months of the year remain a respectable 9.2% and should improve a bit in the fourth quarter.
And finally, IS&T. It continue to outperform our revenue expectations. Revenue at $2.2 billion is off [ph] $28 million against last year's quarter, but up $113 million or 1.7% year-to-date. Recall that we had initially expected a 5.5% revenue decline for the year and instead, we are up almost 2%.
Operating earnings of $219 million are up $17 million or 8.4% compared to the third quarter of last year on the strength of a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. Year-to-date, operating earnings are up $100 million, a 17.5% increase on a 130 basis point improvement in operating margins. This is a very good news story with both revenue and operating margin higher than expected.
So what does all this mean as far as the year's concerned? While stronger-than-expected operating results in the quarter, a lower-than-planned tax rate and somewhat lower share count enable us to increase guidance for the year by $0.20. Our guidance goes from a range of $8.70 to $8.80 to a range of $8.90 to $9.
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for some more detail."

I'll be brief as I've got just a couple of things to cover before we start the Q&A period.
As we discussed throughout this year, we're seeing more of an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility this year than we have in the past. Still not material in the aggregate, but it's having a negative impact on some of our segments, particularly Combat Systems. As Phebe pointed out, the group's revenue is held steady over the first 9 months compared with last year, but had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2014 to this year, the group's sales would have been up by 8% year-to-date.
As Combat Systems shifts away from a heavy reliance on U.S. Military sales to an increasing level of international activity, we expect foreign currency fluctuations to continue to be a part of the group's story.
Moving on to interest expense. The net expense in the quarter was $23 million versus $21 million in the third quarter of 2014. The slight increase is due to lower interest income, as we've deployed over $1 billion this year from the balance sheet towards share repurchases and dividend payments. For the full year, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $85 million.
At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects a net debt position at just about breakeven, a total of $41 million debt in excess of cash. This compares to a net cash balance of about $660 million at the end of the second quarter, and that change again is due to the capital deployment activity in the quarter.
Our effective tax rate was 27.6% for the quarter, lower than we expected as a result of increased international earnings as well as favorable contract closeouts and other true-ups associated with the filing of our tax return.
For the full year, reflecting our favorable performance to date, we now expect an effective tax rate closer to 28%.
We funded our pension plan as expected in the quarter and continue to expect cash pension contributions for 2015 to be approximately $185 million.
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the time back over to you for our Q&A."

And let me give you -- let me take this opportunity I think to give you a little bit of color and detail and I'm going to parse for you sort of the demand picture. Because I think I want you all to understand the demand signals in their totality. So what I'm going to talk to you about is what we have seen so far this year, and I think this context is important. First, Gulfstream continues to perform well in the market. This is our strongest third order intake for -- in the last 4 years. And by the way, it follows the strongest second quarter intake that we've had in 7 years last quarter. Second, our North American sales activity remains good. And this quarter, we saw some resurgence in the international market. Interestingly, with about half of our orders coming from x U.S. Asia, Pacific, Australia, Latin America, Middle East. So nice broad order interests and order activity. So our book to bill, as you noted, is wholesome. And fourth, and I think this is also important to recall and understand, our firm backlog for this quarter is $13.6 billion. That's right around the median of our backlog total for 3 years. So what does that mean? It means that the backlog has been remarkably stable. And by the way, recall that our orders come with good deposits and strong contracts, so they're rather sticky. So let me give a little bit of color going forward. Our pipeline is good as it's been all year. And if you're interested in the piece parts constituents of the pipeline, it's heavily North American, which is whole some public private companies, high net worth individuals and these are sophisticated buyers who are interested in fleet replacement and augmentation. So I think it's context that gives you a little bit of color on what we're seeing now with all of that said, there are some non-macro headwinds. We had a competitor with wide tails in the of 450 and 550 space at very low prices. There are also 5 to 6 preowned 550s on the market that are less than 5 years old, and these newer airplanes are still under warranty. And for some customers, they can be competitive with our new offering. So with all of that said, we remain pretty cautiously optimistic. I think I give you a little bit more there but I wanted you to understand how we're seeing the entire market because I think it's important to see it is in totality."

And as far as capital deployment goes, I'll look at my boss and say I'm not going to speak to our plans for next year and get out ahead of her, but that's going to -- where we are today is trying to normalize that deployment of capital to a net income level given that we see free cash flow being somewhat less than net income this year."

As is obvious from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.28 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.99 billion and income from continuing operations of $733 million. This is $",1225,"Good morning. As is obvious from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.28 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.99 billion and income from continuing operations of $733 million. This is $0.23 per share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.15 per share better than consensus.
Against the year-ago quarter, revenue is up $243 million or 3.1%; operating earnings are up $35 million, a 3.5% increase; and income from continuing operations is up $39 million, a 5.6% increase.
This quarter's operating earnings of $1,034,000,000 reflects 12.9% operating margin, consistent with the 12.9% operating margin of third quarter 2014. By the way, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that we had had both operating earnings and EBIT in excess of $1 billion.
Sequentially, revenue is up $112 million or 1.4%, operating earnings are down $47 million and operating margin is down 80 basis points. Recall, however, that last quarter's earnings included a gain on the sale of our cyber commercial security business. Excluding that gain, the operating earnings for the quarter rather similar.
On a year-to-date basis, revenue is up $1.17 billion, a 5.2% increase; operating earnings are up $320 million, a very strong 11.3% increase; and operating margins are up 80 basis points, once again reflecting our emphasis on continuous improvement in operations.
With respect to cash. We had $652 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. That is 89% of net income from continuing operations. We have $1.81 billion year-to-date, 82% of net income from continuing operations. You may recall that we received significant advanced payments on international orders last year and on commercial shipbuilding orders a year before. That cash is being deployed this year and next, as we have previously advised you. 
We are also hampered by OWC growth at Gulfstream, which is the natural result of building test articles and preproduction build-up of parts and wings for the G500 and G600. All of the foregoing makes performance at 100% of net income this year and next problematic.
In the quarter, we purchased 7.15 million shares for over $1 billion. We have purchased approximately 19.3 million shares year-to-date for about $2.7 billion. This is consistent with our prior guidance to you that we would repurchase shares and pay dividends in amounts in excess of this year's free cash flow. To help you size that, we have spent $3,380,000,000 on share repurchases and dividends year-to-date compared to free cash flow of $1.81 billion. That is a delta of $1.75 billion. That delta is likely to grow in the fourth quarter.
As you can see from the charts attached to press release, our very healthy backlog is holding nicely. Once again, there was a good intake of orders in all segments other than the Marine group, where we have received several multi-year orders in prior quarters. The Marine group has the largest backlog of all of our operating segments. 
We ended the quarter with total backlog for the company at $68.7 billion, down modestly from the end of last quarter.
Let me say a few words about each of our businesses -- business groups, and I'll start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another very good quarter. Revenue, earnings and margin are all up from the year-ago quarter as well as for the first 9 months of the year. The group reported sales of $2.34 billion, up from the third quarter of 2014 by $54 million or 2.4%. This represents the group's highest ever revenue quarter.
Operating earnings increased $15 million or 3.6% to $426 million on an operating margin of 18.2%, a 20 basis point improvement on the year-ago quarter. By the way, this is the fifth consecutive quarter with operating earnings in excess of $400 million. 
On a sequential basis, the group experienced some margin compression from the first half, but was nevertheless better than our expectations and guidance to you. We had good order intake in the group at 0.8:1 book to bill measured in dollar value of orders and 0.9:1 in number of units sold. The distribution of the orders is also attractive, with the G650 and 650ER leading the way. Only 4 of the orders were from models not yet in production.
Much like the automobile industry, general business aviation market is increasingly North America focused, with particularly strong interest from Fortune 500 companies. However, the G650 continues to see activity even in areas experiencing political or economic challenges. We had G650 orders in China, Japan, Brazil and Eastern Europe in the quarter. Our pipeline of projects and active sales discussions are good, so we are reasonably optimistic about order intake for the fourth quarter.
Next, Combat Systems. Combat had a very good quarter with revenue of $1.35 billion, operating earnings of $218 million and a really strong 16.2% operating margins. However, margins were off somewhat against the third quarter 2014 when we enjoyed an operating margin that was 40 basis points higher. Compared to third quarter of 2014, revenue was off $50 million and earnings were off $14 million. Importantly, however, year-to-date revenue was flat against 2014; operating earnings are up $57 million or 9.6%; and operating margin is at 15.7%, up 130 basis points. Combat Systems remains on course for a very strong year.
The Marine group's revenue was higher than 2014, both for the third quarter and for the first 9 months. Revenue in the quarter is up by $267 million, a 14.7% increase to $2.09 billion. Year-to-date, revenue has increased by $759 million or 14.4% to over $6 billion. The growth in both periods is attributable to the group's submarine programs, both construction, repair and engineering, and to a lesser degree, commercial ship construction activities. This is the strongest revenue quarter ever for the Marine group. 
Operating earnings at $181 million are up modestly compared to last year's quarter. The group's operating margins were down 60 basis points in the quarter and 50 basis points year-to-date as a result of mix shift and a one-time charge at NASSCO on a warranty item in the quarter. However, margins for the first 9 months of the year remain a respectable 9.2% and should improve a bit in the fourth quarter.
And finally, IS&T. It continue to outperform our revenue expectations. Revenue at $2.2 billion was off $28 million against last year's quarter, but up $113 million or 1.7% year-to-date. Recall that we had initially expected a 5.5% revenue decline for the year and instead, we are up almost 2%.
Operating earnings of $219 million are up $17 million or 8.4% compared to the third quarter of last year on the strength of a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. Year-to-date, operating earnings are up $100 million, a 17.5% increase on a 130 basis point improvement in operating margins. This is a very good news story with both revenue and operating margin higher than expected.
So what does all this mean as far as the year is concerned? While stronger-than-expected operating results in the quarter, a lower-than-planned tax rate and somewhat lower share count enable us to increase guidance for the year by $0.20. Our guidance goes from a range of $8.70 to $8.80 to a range of $8.90 to $9.
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for some more detail."

I'll be brief as I've got just a couple of things to cover before we start the Q&A period.
As we discussed throughout this year, we're seeing more of an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility this year than we have in the past. Still not material in the aggregate, but it's having a negative impact on some of our segments, particularly Combat Systems. 
As Phebe pointed out, the group's revenue is held steady over the first 9 months compared with last year, but had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2014 to this year, the group's sales would have been up by 8% year-to-date. As Combat Systems shifts away from a heavy reliance on U.S. Military sales to an increasing level of international activity, we expect foreign currency fluctuations to continue to be a part of the group's story.
Moving on to interest expense. The net expense in the quarter was $23 million versus $21 million in the third quarter of 2014. The slight increase is due to lower interest income, as we've deployed over $1 billion this year from the balance sheet towards share repurchases and dividend payments. For the full year, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $85 million.
At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects a net debt position at just about breakeven, a total of $41 million debt in excess of cash. This compares to a net cash balance of about $660 million at the end of the second quarter, and that change, again, is due to the capital deployment activity in the quarter.
Our effective tax rate was 27.6% for the quarter, lower than we expected as a result of increased international earnings as well as favorable contract closeouts and other true-ups associated with the filing of our tax return. For the full year, 9:12 PM reflecting our favorable performance to date, we now expect an effective tax rate closer to 28%.
We funded our pension plans as expected in the quarter and continue to expect cash pension contributions for 2015 to be approximately $185 million.
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A."

And let me give you -- let me take this opportunity, I think, to give you a little bit of color and detail. I'm going to parse for you sort of the demand picture, because I think I want to -- I want you all to understand the demand signals in their totality. So what I'm going to talk to you about is what we have seen so far this year, and I think this context is important. First, Gulfstream continues to perform well in the market. This was our strongest third order intake for -- in the last 4 years. And by the way, it follows the strongest second quarter intake that we had in 7 years last quarter. Second, our North American sales activity remains good. And this quarter, we saw some resurgence in the international market. Interestingly, with about half of our orders coming from ex U.S, Asia-Pacific, Australia, Latin America, Middle East. So nice broad order interests and order activity. Third, our book to bill, as you noted, is wholesome. And fourth, and I think this is also important to recall and understand, our firm backlog for this quarter is $13.6 billion. That's right around the median of our backlog total for 3 years. So what does that mean? It means that the backlog has been remarkably stable. And by the way, recall that our orders come with good deposits and strong contract terms, so they're rather sticky. So let me give you a little bit of color going forward. Our pipeline is good as it's been all year. And if you're interested in the piece parts constituents of the pipeline, it's heavily North American, which is wholesome. Public, private companies, high-net-worth individuals and these are sophisticated buyers who are interested in fleet replacement and augmentation. So I think it's context that gives you a little bit of color on what we're seeing now. With all of that said, there are some non-macro headwinds. We have a competitor with wide tails in the of 450 and 550 space at very low prices. There are also 5 to 6 pre-owned 550s on the market that are less than 5 years old, and these newer airplanes are still under warranty. And for some customers, they can be competitive with our new offerings. So with all of that said, we remain pretty cautiously optimistic. I think I gave you a little bit more there, but I wanted you to understand how we're seeing the entire market because I think it's important to see it in totality."

As is obvious from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.28 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.99 billion and income from continuing operations of $733 million. This is $",1224,"Good morning. As is obvious from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.28 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.99 billion and income from continuing operations of $733 million. This is $0.23 per share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.15 per share better than consensus.
Against the year-ago quarter, revenue is up $243 million or 3.1%; operating earnings are up $35 million, a 3.5% increase; and income from continuing operations is up $39 million, a 5.6% increase.
This quarter, operating earnings of $1,034,000,000 reflects 12.9% operating margin, consistent with the 12.9% operating margin of third quarter 2014. By the way, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that we have had both operating earnings and EBIT in excess of $1 billion.
Sequentially, revenue is up $112 million or 1.4%; operating earnings are down $47 million; and operating margin is down 80 basis points. Recall, however, that last quarter's earnings included a gain on the sale of our cyber commercial security business. Excluding that gain, the operating earnings for the quarter, rather similar.
On a year-to-date basis, revenue is up $1.17 billion, a 5.2% increase; operating earnings are up $320 million, a very strong 11.3% increase; and operating margins are up 80 basis points, once again reflecting our emphasis on continuous improvement in operations.
With respect to cash. We had $652 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. That is 89% of net income from continuing operations. We have $1.81 billion year-to-date, 82% of net income from continuing operations. You may recall that we received significant advanced payments on international orders last year and on commercial shipbuilding orders the year before. That cash is being deployed this year and next as we have previously advised you. 
We are also hampered by OWC growth at Gulfstream, which is the natural result of building test articles and preproduction build-up of parts and wings for the G500 and G600. All of the foregoing makes performance at 100% of net income this year and next problematic.
In the quarter, we purchased 7.15 million shares for over $1 billion. We have purchased approximately 19.3 million shares year-to-date for about $2.7 billion. This is consistent with our prior guidance to you that we would repurchase shares and pay dividends in amounts in excess of this year's free cash flow. To help you size that, we have spent $3,380,000,000 on share repurchases and dividends year-to-date compared to free cash flow of $1.81 billion. That is a delta of $1.57 billion. That delta is likely to grow in the fourth quarter.
As you can see from the charts attached to the press release, our very healthy backlog is holding nicely. Once again, there was a good intake of orders in all segments other than the Marine group, where we have received several multiyear orders in prior quarters. The Marine group has the largest backlog of all of our operating segments. 
We ended the quarter with total backlog for the company at $68.7 billion, down modestly from the end of last quarter.
Let me say a few words about each of our businesses -- business groups, and I'll start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another very good quarter. Revenue, earnings and margin are all up from the year-ago quarter as well as for the first 9 months of the year. The group reported sales of $2.34 billion, up from the third quarter of 2014 by $54 million or 2.4%. This represents the group's highest-ever revenue quarter.
Operating earnings increased $15 million or 3.6% to $426 million on an operating margin of 18.2%, a 20 basis point improvement on the year-ago quarter. By the way, this is the fifth consecutive quarter with operating earnings in excess of $400 million. 
On a sequential basis, the group experienced some margin compression from the first half but was nevertheless better than our expectations and guidance to you. We had good order intake in the group at 0.8:1 book-to-bill measured in dollar value of orders and 0.9:1 in number of units sold. The distribution of the orders is also attractive with the G650 and 650ER leading the way. Only 4 of the orders were from models not yet in production.
Much like the automobile industry, general business aviation market is increasingly North America focused with particularly strong interest from Fortune 500 companies. However, the G650 continues to see activity even in areas experiencing political or economic challenges. We had G650 orders in China, Japan, Brazil and Eastern Europe in the quarter. Our pipeline of projects and active sales discussions are good, so we are reasonably optimistic about order intake for the fourth quarter.
Next, Combat System. Combat had a very good quarter, with revenue of $1.35 billion, operating earnings of $218 million and a really strong 16.2% operating margin. However, margins are off somewhat against the third quarter 2014 when we enjoyed an operating margin that was 40 basis points higher. Compared to third quarter of 2014, revenue was off $50 million and earnings were off $14 million. Importantly, however, year-to-date revenue was flat against 2014; operating earnings are up $57 million or 9.6%; and operating margin is at 7 -- 15.7%, up 130 basis points. Combat Systems remains on course for a very strong year.
The Marine group's revenue was higher than 2014, both for the third quarter and for the first 9 months. Revenue in the quarter is up by $267 million, a 14.7% increase to $2.09 billion. Year-to-date, revenue has increased by $759 million or 14.4% to over $6 billion. The growth in both periods is attributable to the group's submarine programs, both construction, repair and engineering, and to a lesser degree, commercial ship construction activities. This is the strongest revenue quarter ever for the Marine group. 
Operating earnings at $181 million are up modestly compared to last year's quarter. The group's operating margins were down 60 basis points in the quarter and 50 basis points year-to-date as a result of mix shift and a onetime charge at NASSCO on a warranty item in the quarter. However, margins for the first 9 months of the year remain a respectable 9.2% and should improve a bit in the fourth quarter.
And finally, IS&T. They continue to outperform our revenue expectations. Revenue at $2.2 billion is off $28 million against last year's quarter but up $113 million or 1.7% year-to-date. Recall that we had initially expected a 5.5% revenue decline for the year, and instead, we're up almost 2%.
Operating earnings of $219 million are up $17 million or 8.4% compared to the third quarter of last year on the strength of a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. Year-to-date, operating earnings are up $100 million, a 17.5% increase on a 130 basis point improvement in operating margins. This is a very good news story with both revenue and operating margin higher than expected.
So what does all this mean as far as the year is concerned? While stronger-than-expected operating results in the quarter, a lower-than-planned tax rate and somewhat lower share count enable us to increase guidance for the year by $0.20. Our guidance goes from a range of $8.70 to $8.80 to a range of $8.90 to $9.
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for some more detail."

I'll be brief as I've got just a couple of things to cover before we start the Q&A period.
As we've discussed throughout this year, we're seeing more of an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility this year than we have in the past. Still not material in the aggregate, but it's having a negative impact on some of our segments, particularly Combat Systems. 
As Phebe pointed out, the group's revenue has held steady over the first 9 months compared with last year but had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2014 to this year, the group's sales would have been up by 8% year-to-date. As Combat Systems shifts away from a heavy reliance on U.S. Military sales to an increasing level of international activity, we expect foreign currency fluctuations to continue to be a part of the group's story.
Moving on to interest expense. The net expense in the quarter was $23 million versus $21 million in the third quarter of 2014. The slight increase is due to lower interest income as we've deployed over $1 billion this year from the balance sheet towards share repurchases and dividend payments. For the full year, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $85 million.
At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects a net debt position at just about breakeven, a total of $41 million debt in excess of cash. This compares to a net cash balance of about $660 million at the end of the second quarter, and that change, again, is due to the capital deployment activity in the quarter.
Our effective tax rate was 27.6% for the quarter, lower than we expected as a result of increased international earnings as well as favorable contract closeouts and other true-ups associated with the filing of our tax return. For the full year, reflecting our favorable performance to-date, we now expect an effective tax rate closer to 28%.
We funded our pension plans as expected in the quarter and continue to expect cash pension contributions for 2015 to be approximately $185 million.
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A."

And let me give you -- let me take this opportunity, I think, to give you a little bit of color and detail. I'm going to parse for you sort of the demand picture because I think I want to -- I want you all to understand the demand signals in their totality. So what I'm going to talk to you about is what we have seen so far this year, and I think this context is important. First, Gulfstream continues to perform well in the market. This was our strongest third order [ph] intake for -- in the last 4 years. And by the way, it follows the strongest second quarter intake that we had in 7 years last quarter. 
Second, our North American sales activity remains good. And this quarter, we saw some resurgence in the international market. Interestingly, with about half of our orders coming from ex U.S -- Asia-Pacific, Australia, Latin America, Mid-East. So nice broad order interests and order activity. 
Third, our book-to-bill, as you noted, is wholesome. And fourth, and I think this is also important to recall and understand, our firm backlog for this quarter is $13.6 billion. That's right around the median of our backlog total for 3 years. So what does that mean? It means that the backlog's been remarkably stable. And by the way, recall that our orders come with good deposits and strong contract terms, so they're rather sticky. So let me give you a little bit of color going forward. Our pipeline is good as it's been all year. And if you're interested in piece parts, constituents of the pipeline, it's heavily North American, which is wholesome. Public, private companies, high-net-worth individuals, and these are sophisticated buyers who are interested in fleet replacement and augmentation. 
So I think it's context that, that gives you a little bit of color on what we're seeing now. With all of that said, there are some non-macro headwinds. We had a competitor with white tails in the 450 and 550 space at very low prices. There are also 5 to 6 preowned 550s on the market that are less than 5 years old, and these newer airplanes are still under warranty. And for some customers, they can be competitive with our new offerings. So with all of that said, we remain pretty cautiously optimistic. I think I gave you a little bit more there, but I wanted you to understand how we're seeing the entire market because I think it's important to see it in its totality."

As is obvious from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.28 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.99 billion and income from continuing operations of $733 million. This is $",1224,"Good morning. As is obvious from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.28 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.99 billion and income from continuing operations of $733 million. This is $0.23 per share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.15 per share better than consensus.
Against the year-ago quarter, revenue is up $243 million or 3.1%; operating earnings are up $35 million, a 3.5% increase; and income from continuing operations is up $39 million, a 5.6% increase.
This quarter, operating earnings of $1,034,000,000 reflects 12.9% operating margin, consistent with the 12.9% operating margin of third quarter 2014. By the way, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that we have had both operating earnings and EBIT in excess of $1 billion.
Sequentially, revenue is up $112 million or 1.4%; operating earnings are down $47 million; and operating margin is down 80 basis points. Recall, however, that last quarter's earnings included a gain on the sale of our cyber commercial security business. Excluding that gain, the operating earnings for the quarter, rather similar.
On a year-to-date basis, revenue is up $1.17 billion, a 5.2% increase; operating earnings are up $320 million, a very strong 11.3% increase; and operating margins are up 80 basis points, once again reflecting our emphasis on continuous improvement in operations.
With respect to cash. We had $652 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. That is 89% of net income from continuing operations. We have $1.81 billion year-to-date, 82% of net income from continuing operations. You may recall that we received significant advanced payments on international orders last year and on commercial shipbuilding orders the year before. That cash is being deployed this year and next as we have previously advised you. 
We are also hampered by OWC growth at Gulfstream, which is the natural result of building test articles and preproduction build-up of parts and wings for the G500 and G600. All of the foregoing makes performance at 100% of net income this year and next problematic.
In the quarter, we purchased 7.15 million shares for over $1 billion. We have purchased approximately 19.3 million shares year-to-date for about $2.7 billion. This is consistent with our prior guidance to you that we would repurchase shares and pay dividends in amounts in excess of this year's free cash flow. To help you size that, we have spent $3,380,000,000 on share repurchases and dividends year-to-date compared to free cash flow of $1.81 billion. That is a delta of $1.57 billion. That delta is likely to grow in the fourth quarter.
As you can see from the charts attached to the press release, our very healthy backlog is holding nicely. Once again, there was a good intake of orders in all segments other than the Marine group, where we have received several multiyear orders in prior quarters. The Marine group has the largest backlog of all of our operating segments. 
We ended the quarter with total backlog for the company at $68.7 billion, down modestly from the end of last quarter.
Let me say a few words about each of our businesses -- business groups, and I'll start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another very good quarter. Revenue, earnings and margin are all up from the year-ago quarter as well as for the first 9 months of the year. The group reported sales of $2.34 billion, up from the third quarter of 2014 by $54 million or 2.4%. This represents the group's highest-ever revenue quarter.
Operating earnings increased $15 million or 3.6% to $426 million on an operating margin of 18.2%, a 20 basis point improvement on the year-ago quarter. By the way, this is the fifth consecutive quarter with operating earnings in excess of $400 million. 
On a sequential basis, the group experienced some margin compression from the first half but was nevertheless better than our expectations and guidance to you. We had good order intake in the group at 0.8:1 book-to-bill measured in dollar value of orders and 0.9:1 in number of units sold. The distribution of the orders is also attractive with the G650 and 650ER leading the way. Only 4 of the orders were from models not yet in production.
Much like the automobile industry, general business aviation market is increasingly North America focused with particularly strong interest from Fortune 500 companies. However, the G650 continues to see activity even in areas experiencing political or economic challenges. We had G650 orders in China, Japan, Brazil and Eastern Europe in the quarter. Our pipeline of projects and active sales discussions are good, so we are reasonably optimistic about order intake for the fourth quarter.
Next, Combat System. Combat had a very good quarter, with revenue of $1.35 billion, operating earnings of $218 million and a really strong 16.2% operating margin. However, margins are off somewhat against the third quarter 2014 when we enjoyed an operating margin that was 40 basis points higher. Compared to third quarter of 2014, revenue was off $50 million and earnings were off $14 million. Importantly, however, year-to-date revenue was flat against 2014; operating earnings are up $57 million or 9.6%; and operating margin is at 7 -- 15.7%, up 130 basis points. Combat Systems remains on course for a very strong year.
The Marine group's revenue was higher than 2014, both for the third quarter and for the first 9 months. Revenue in the quarter is up by $267 million, a 14.7% increase to $2.09 billion. Year-to-date, revenue has increased by $759 million or 14.4% to over $6 billion. The growth in both periods is attributable to the group's submarine programs, both construction, repair and engineering, and to a lesser degree, commercial ship construction activities. This is the strongest revenue quarter ever for the Marine group. 
Operating earnings at $181 million are up modestly compared to last year's quarter. The group's operating margins were down 60 basis points in the quarter and 50 basis points year-to-date as a result of mix shift and a onetime charge at NASSCO on a warranty item in the quarter. However, margins for the first 9 months of the year remain a respectable 9.2% and should improve a bit in the fourth quarter.
And finally, IS&T. They continue to outperform our revenue expectations. Revenue at $2.2 billion is off $28 million against last year's quarter but up $113 million or 1.7% year-to-date. Recall that we had initially expected a 5.5% revenue decline for the year, and instead, we're up almost 2%.
Operating earnings of $219 million are up $17 million or 8.4% compared to the third quarter of last year on the strength of a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. Year-to-date, operating earnings are up $100 million, a 17.5% increase on a 130 basis point improvement in operating margins. This is a very good news story with both revenue and operating margin higher than expected.
So what does all this mean as far as the year is concerned? While stronger-than-expected operating results in the quarter, a lower-than-planned tax rate and somewhat lower share count enable us to increase guidance for the year by $0.20. Our guidance goes from a range of $8.70 to $8.80 to a range of $8.90 to $9.
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for some more detail."

I'll be brief as I've got just a couple of things to cover before we start the Q&A period.
As we've discussed throughout this year, we're seeing more of an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility this year than we have in the past. Still not material in the aggregate, but it's having a negative impact on some of our segments, particularly Combat Systems. 
As Phebe pointed out, the group's revenue has held steady over the first 9 months compared with last year but had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2014 to this year, the group's sales would have been up by 8% year-to-date. As Combat Systems shifts away from a heavy reliance on U.S. Military sales to an increasing level of international activity, we expect foreign currency fluctuations to continue to be a part of the group's story.
Moving on to interest expense. The net expense in the quarter was $23 million versus $21 million in the third quarter of 2014. The slight increase is due to lower interest income as we've deployed over $1 billion this year from the balance sheet towards share repurchases and dividend payments. For the full year, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $85 million.
At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects a net debt position at just about breakeven, a total of $41 million debt in excess of cash. This compares to a net cash balance of about $660 million at the end of the second quarter, and that change, again, is due to the capital deployment activity in the quarter.
Our effective tax rate was 27.6% for the quarter, lower than we expected as a result of increased international earnings as well as favorable contract closeouts and other true-ups associated with the filing of our tax return. For the full year, reflecting our favorable performance to-date, we now expect an effective tax rate closer to 28%.
We funded our pension plans as expected in the quarter and continue to expect cash pension contributions for 2015 to be approximately $185 million.
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A."

And let me give you -- let me take this opportunity, I think, to give you a little bit of color and detail. I'm going to parse for you sort of the demand picture because I think I want to -- I want you all to understand the demand signals in their totality. So what I'm going to talk to you about is what we have seen so far this year, and I think this context is important. First, Gulfstream continues to perform well in the market. This was our strongest third order [ph] intake for -- in the last 4 years. And by the way, it follows the strongest second quarter intake that we had in 7 years last quarter. 
Second, our North American sales activity remains good. And this quarter, we saw some resurgence in the international market. Interestingly, with about half of our orders coming from ex U.S -- Asia-Pacific, Australia, Latin America, Mid-East. So nice broad order interests and order activity. 
Third, our book-to-bill, as you noted, is wholesome. And fourth, and I think this is also important to recall and understand, our firm backlog for this quarter is $13.6 billion. That's right around the median of our backlog total for 3 years. So what does that mean? It means that the backlog's been remarkably stable. And by the way, recall that our orders come with good deposits and strong contract terms, so they're rather sticky. So let me give you a little bit of color going forward. Our pipeline is good as it's been all year. And if you're interested in piece parts, constituents of the pipeline, it's heavily North American, which is wholesome. Public, private companies, high-net-worth individuals, and these are sophisticated buyers who are interested in fleet replacement and augmentation. 
So I think it's context that, that gives you a little bit of color on what we're seeing now. With all of that said, there are some non-macro headwinds. We had a competitor with white tails in the 450 and 550 space at very low prices. There are also 5 to 6 preowned 550s on the market that are less than 5 years old, and these newer airplanes are still under warranty. And for some customers, they can be competitive with our new offerings. So with all of that said, we remain pretty cautiously optimistic. I think I gave you a little bit more there, but I wanted you to understand how we're seeing the entire market because I think it's important to see it in its totality."
