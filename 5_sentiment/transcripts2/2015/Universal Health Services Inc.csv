Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014. 
During the conference call, Alan then I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend the careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. 
We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.
As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $5.42 for the year and $1.71 for the quarter. After adjusting for a reduction in malpractice reserves relating to prior years and the incentive income and expenses associated with the implementation of electronic health record applications at our acute care hospitals, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2014, was $1.51.
On a same facility basis, revenues from our Behavioral Health division increased 3.6% during the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted admissions and adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 6.8% and 2.8%, respectively, during the fourth quarter. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 3.2% during the fourth quarter of 2014 over the comparable prior year quarter.
We define operating margins as operating income or net revenues less salaries and wages and benefits and other operating expenses and supply expense divided by net revenues. Operating margins for behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year increased slightly to 28.0% during the quarter ended December 31, 2014, as compared to 27.7% during the comparable prior year period.
On a same facility basis in our acute care division, revenues increased 14.9% during the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted admissions increased 5.5% while revenue per adjusted admission increased 8.8%. 
On a same facility basis operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 18.1% during the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to 14.1% during the fourth quarter of 2013.
Our cash generated from operating activities increased to approximately $346 million during the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to $308 million during the fourth quarter of 2013.
Our cash generated from operating activities increased to approximately $1.04 billion during the full year of 2014 as compared to $884 million during 2013.
Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 56 days during the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to 57 days during the fourth quarter of 2013. At December 31, 2014, our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 47%.
During 2014, we opened a total of 602 new behavioral health beds, including 162 beds opened at 2 de novo hospitals and 440 beds opened at some of our busiest facilities. In addition, we already have approved projects to add approximately 550 new behavioral health beds and convert approximately 50 beds from residential treatment center to acute during 2015 and that number could grow as we continue to pursue opportunities to add and convert additional beds.
We spent $82 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2014 and $391 million during the full year of 2014.
During 2015, we expect to spend approximately $375 million to $400 million in capital expenditures, which includes expenditures for capital equipment, renovations, new projects at existing hospitals and construction of new facilities.
In conjunction with our share repurchase program that commenced during the third quarter of 2014, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 321,500 shares of our stock at an average price of slightly less than $102 per share.
Our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2015, is $6.15 to $6.55 per diluted share. The guidance range excludes the unfavorable $0.12 per diluted share of EHR, expected EHR impact expected during 2015 as described in our press release last night. This guidance range represents, an increase of approximately 6% to 13% over the adjusted net income attributable to UHS of $5.78 [ph] per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2014, as calculated on the Supplemental Schedule included in last night's press release.
During 2015, our net revenues are estimated to be approximately $8.7 billion to $8.8 billion, representing an increase of approximately 8% to 9% over our 2014 net revenues . Included in our estimated 2015 net revenues are revenues associated with the previously announced acquisition of Cygnet Health Care in the U.K. and a health insurance company in Nevada.
In addition, during the fourth quarter we acquired 46-bed behavioral health hospital located near Taunton in the United Kingdom. Alan and I are pleased to answer your questions at this time."

We called out the $11 million of Texas [indiscernible] in the press release, we also have spoken before about $4 million of California UPL that I know some of our peers have recognized as well in the fourth quarter. So if you adjust those things out, it probably brings the revenue growth down by a couple of hundred basis points, still by any measure, a very strong and robust revenue growth quarter. Our admission growth seems to be fairly consistent with our peers who have reported similar strong volumes. What seems to distinguish the UHS performance in the quarter was that really robust revenue intensity and revenue per unit per admission per day. I think a lot of that, Josh, was driven by strong surgical volumes we had both in- and outpatient surgical volume growth of approximately 5%. And for the first time I can remember in a long time, the inpatient growth actually was outpacing the outpatients. So I think that's what really drove some of that revenue intensity."

I will say, however, that I think our best guesstimate is that we've got, and I think again this is fairly consistent with what we understand that some of our peers have done but I've said, but I think in the acute care division, we assume that the ACA impact in 2015 will be about 6% to 7% of our overall earnings.

And I think we're in largely the same place as we're in now. Since then, we announced the Cygnet acquisition and dedicated about $335 million to that. But we continue to look for growth opportunities, both externally and internally in both of our business segments. We announced just in the call, a small acquisition in the U.K. We continue to look for other opportunities in the U.K. as well as other M&A opportunities in both behavioral and acute here in the U.S. and also continue to expand organically. I mentioned that the new behavioral beds that we've got online for next year. We've talked about our new acute-care hospital that we're building in Las Vegas so we've got a number of things going on. But I think we have also said that if we don't find sufficient sort of opportunities for external growth, we're also more than happy to continue to repurchase shares under the previously announced authorization. So I think from our perspective we're likely to pursue sort of all those avenues in 2015."

It certainly at least in the context of this conversation the near term being 2015, but I think the industry in general is becoming more and more positive about the idea that from a public policy perspective, that either legislatively or administratively there will be progress on this issue. As you know, there is a demonstration project that's part of the Affordable Care Act that lift the IMD exclusion in about a dozen states, and we were participating in some of the states in that project. We believe that the outcome and the data from that demo project will support the idea that a broader lifting of the exclusion makes sense from a public policy perspective in terms of access and cost. And again, as an industry we continue to lobby hard for that and that remains one of our main priorities again from a legislative/regulatory perspective. So we'll continue to work for it. We continue to feel that there's positive movement there, but I think it's difficult to predict with any sort of level of precision when there might be a substantive change."

But certainly feel that it would be difficult to replicate as you sort of suggest the sort of growth we saw in 2014. I think a good portion or a good reason for that is, while we were all meeting the company as well as our peers, we're focused on the potential ACA impact in '14. And I think we largely anticipated that correctly. We didn't really anticipate that benefit we were going to get from improving economies in the number of our markets, particularly in Texas, but also in Florida and California, et cetera. And I think as we look towards next year, we are cautious about, again, our ability to replicate that same level of growth. I think we feel like we'll continue to see improving economies in those markets for the most part. Now I will also add that I think in the last month or 2 we've gotten a little bit more cautious about the Texas economy specifically given the pressures from oil and gas prices. So -- and I think we've stepped back our projections in those markets, particularly. But other than that, again, I just think we are forecasting strong performance in '15 just not quite as robust as we saw in '14."

Other quarters not so much. So we continue to project the length of stay pressures will continue into '15, that's what our guidance reflects. I would say that I certainly noticed in the fourth quarter that some of the decline in length of stay that we experienced was self-imposed or self-executed, if you will, in the sense that I mentioned, to some degree, the conversion of residential beds to acute and we've been doing that for a while. And to the degree that we continue to do that, we will drive the length of stay down ourselves because the length of stay in our acute facilities is clearly lower than it is in our residential facilities. But I do think that's reflected in that stronger revenue per day that you saw in the fourth quarter. Because, obviously, as we shift beds and therefore, days and admission from residential to acute, we'll see a drop in length of stay but we ought to see a rise in revenue per day."

We have a couple of very strong surgical volume quarters in '14, the second quarter was really strong, the fourth quarter was really strong. I think even in retrospect, it's a little bit difficult for us to identify exactly why that was. So I will say that I think that 2015 guidance presumes a more modest sort of surgical experience then what we experienced certainly in Q4 and something that's more reflective of our full year experience. And to be fair, I think the year has started of at least in January, with kind of a more muted surgical volume. There was a lot of, at least, speculation in the back half of '14 that -- hospitals to some degree, would experience in surgeon volume at the end of the year given the increasing prevalence of high deductible plans and that really might influence patient behavior as people exhausted their co-patient deductibles late in the year and we'll take advantage of that. And I don't know if that's what really drove the dynamic we experienced, but we certainly have a real strong surgical quarter in Q4 and a little bit weaker as 2015 started. So we've at least been not inconsistent with that theory. So again, I think we've just been more kind of rational or muted about what our 2015 volumes should look like and I think, that's what's reflected in the guidance."

Obviously, I think in a lot of cases, economic census being overwhelmed or pressured by political considerations and I think we find those very hard to sort of measure and calculate. So we continue again in our state hospital associations and in other forums to work for expansion in those states and which we operate that have not expanded yet.

I think we basically felt like our payer mix strength, which, of course, I think at the end of the day, was really what drove the outsized performance of the, particularly the acute division in 2014. It really was relatively stable throughout the year. Now the character have changed some, in the sense that in the beginning of the year, the payer mix improvement was clearly more weighted to Medicaid -- more Medicaid patients and that is Medicaid patients, and I think was a function of Medicaid expansion in some of our large states like Nevada, like California and the District of Colombia. And then, in the back half of the year, we saw a bit more of a shift from the Medicaid impact to the commercial exchange impact, but just generally, I think the payer mix was -- the payer mix improvement was really a constant for us in 2014. And as I said, generally, a -- the biggest and primary driver of the really strong performance, and again, I think as we answered your question before about the guidance, I think we expect that, that payer mix improvement continues into 2015 and our guidance reflects that, but that it does not necessarily continue at the same rate. And certainly, one of the sort of muting dynamics that we have is that we don't have any new states as we just talked about at to participate in Medicaid expansion next year. So to some degree, the Medicaid improvement certainly levels off pretty considerably in '15."

I think of that -- let me answer the question in a couple of different ways I think, that in terms of signing patients up, like many, or I would probably speculate, like most of our peers, we've developed a pretty rigorous process to make sure that we have certified counselors in all of our facilities and that we're both proactively and reactively responding to patients who come to our facilities uninsured and trying to find the most effective and efficient way to get them insured, whether that's enrollment in Medicaid or through commercial exchange opportunity, would we are doing all those things. Now at the end of the day, I think as I said most hospitals are probably doing something similar. As far as the swings in charity and bad debt, I know I'm going to sound like a broken record when I say this, but we find it difficult even internally to explain some of the specific movements between those buckets. And I always make the point that as company, we analyze uncompensated care as sort of a single unified bucket, and we include bad debt, and charity care and uninsured discount. And again, I think if you look at those numbers on a combined basis, it reinforces the comment that I made before which is there's a significant decline in those numbers in 2014 throughout the year. And it's reflective of the ACA and improved economic benefits that we've already talked about."

I think the balance that we and all hospitals walk is trying to be reasonable about what is a reasonable level of income and assets for patients to qualify for charity care. So somebody comes in the hospital level with no insurance and a very low-income level and no assets and the general physician this made, based on the script is that there really is no point in making an effort to collect from this patients. I think your question is, why didn't you try and collect from as many patients as you possibly can? And I would answer in 2 ways. I mean, I think that one, from sort of the sort of a public policy perspective, we recognize that for people at a very low-income level with little assets, it really is just too much of a burden for them to pay some of these bills. And then secondly, I think from a business perspective, it's an effort that we have found can consume a fair amount of time and money and really yield very little. So again, we try and have a charity policy that I think is fairly consistent with industry that tries to walk that line and collects from people who really can't afford to pay but really doesn't try and collect from that portion of the population that can't."

And so I think those are the comments that you're thinking about. So in general I mean, we didn't make any specific cuts or assume specific cuts in Texas reimbursement, but just sort of step back our Texas earnings projections for next year a little bit and on a broad basis in expectation that we might feel some pressures in that economy in 2015 that we clearly did not feel in 2014."

Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014. During the conference call, Alan and I will be usin",825,"Good morning. Thank you. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014. 
During the conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend the careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. 
We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.
As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $5.42 for the year and $1.71 for the quarter. After adjusting for a reduction in malpractice reserves relating to prior years and the incentive income and expenses associated with the implementation of electronic health record applications at our acute care hospitals, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was $1.51.
On a same-facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 6.3% during the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted admissions and adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 6.8% and 2.8%, respectively, during the fourth quarter. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 3.2% during the fourth quarter of 2014 over the comparable prior year quarter.
We define operating margins as operating income or net revenues less salaries, wages and benefits, other operating expenses and supplies expense divided by net revenues. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year increased slightly to 28.0% during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 27.7% during the comparable prior year period.
On a same-facility basis, in our acute care division, revenues increased 14.9% during the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted admissions increased 5.5%, while revenue per adjusted admission increased 8.8%. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 18.1% during the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to 14.1% during the fourth quarter of 2013.
Our cash generated from operating activities increased to approximately $346 million during the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to $308 million during the fourth quarter of 2013. Our cash generated from operating activities increased to approximately $1.04 billion during the full year of 2014 as compared to $884 million during 2013.
Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 56 days during the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to 57 days during the fourth quarter of 2013. At December 31, 2014, our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 47%.
During 2014, we opened a total of 602 new behavioral health beds, including 162 beds opened at 2 de novo hospitals and 440 beds opened at some of our busiest facilities. In addition, we already have approved projects to add approximately 550 new behavioral health beds and convert approximately 50 beds from residential treatment center to acute during 2015, and that number could grow as we continue to pursue opportunities to add and convert additional beds.
We spent $82 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2014 and $391 million during the full year of 2014. During 2015, we expect to spend approximately $375 million to $400 million in capital expenditures, which includes expenditures for capital equipment, renovations, new projects at existing hospitals and construction of new facilities.
In conjunction with our share repurchase program that commenced during the third quarter of 2014, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 321,500 shares of our stock at an average price of slightly less than $102 per share.
Our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2015 is $6.15 to $6.55 per diluted share. The guidance range excludes the unfavorable $0.12 per diluted share of EHR expected -- EHR impact expected during 2015, as described in our press release last night. This guidance range represents an increase of approximately 6% to 13% over the adjusted net income attributable to UHS of $5.78 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2014, as calculated on the supplemental schedule included in last night's press release.
During 2015, our net revenues are estimated to be approximately $8.7 billion to $8.8 billion, representing an increase of approximately 8% to 9% over our 2014 net revenues . Included in our estimated 2015 net revenues are revenues associated with the previously announced acquisition of Cygnet Health Care in the U.K. and a health insurance company in Nevada.
In addition, during the fourth quarter, we acquired a 46-bed behavioral health hospital located near Taunton in the United Kingdom. 
Alan and I are pleased to answer your questions at this time."

We called out the $11 million of Texas DSRIP in the press release. We also have spoken before about $4 million of California UPL that I know some of our peers have recognized as well in the fourth quarter. So if you adjust those things out, it probably brings the revenue growth down by a couple of hundred basis points, still, by any measure, a very strong and robust revenue growth quarter. Our admission growth seemed to be fairly consistent with our peers who have reported similar strong volumes. What seems to distinguish the UHS performance in the quarter was that really robust revenue intensity and revenue per unit, per admission or per day. I think a lot of that, Josh, was driven by strong surgical volumes we had both in- and outpatient surgical volume growth of approximately 5%. And for the first time I can remember in a long time, the inpatient growth actually was outpacing the outpatient, so I think that's what really drove some of that revenue intensity."

I will say, however, that I think our best guesstimate is that we've got -- and I think, again, this is fairly consistent with what I understand some of our peers have said, but I think in the acute care division, we assume that the ACA impact in 2015 will be about 6% to 7% of our overall earnings.

And I think we're in largely the same place as we were then. And obviously, since then, we announced the Cygnet acquisition and dedicated about $335 million to that. But we continue to look for growth opportunities, both externally and internally, in both of our business segments. We announced just in the call a small acquisition in the U.K. We continue to look for other opportunities in the U.K. as well as other M&A opportunities in both behavioral and acute here in the U.S. and also continue to expand organically. I mentioned the new behavioral beds that we've got online for next year. We've talked about our new acute care hospital that we're building in Las Vegas, so we've got a number of things going on. But I think we have also said that if we don't find sufficient sort of opportunities for external growth, we're also more than happy to continue to repurchase shares under the previously announced authorization. So I think from our perspective, we're likely to pursue sort of all those avenues in 2015."

But I think the industry in general is becoming more and more positive about the idea that, from a public policy perspective, that either legislatively or administratively, there will be progress on this issue. As you know, there is a demonstration project that's part of the Affordable Care Act that lifts the IMD exclusion in about a dozen states, and we're participating in some of those states in that project. We believe that the outcome and the data from that demo project will support the idea that a broader lifting of the exclusion makes sense from a public policy perspective in terms of access and cost. And again, as an industry, we continue to lobby hard for that, and that remains one of our main priorities, again, from a legislative/regulatory perspective. So we'll continue to work for it. We continue to feel that there's positive movement there, but I think it's difficult to predict with any sort of level of precision when there might be a substantive change."

I think a good portion -- or a good reason for that is while we were all, meaning the company as well as our peers, we're focused on the potential ACA impact in '14. And I think we largely anticipated that correctly. We didn't really anticipate the benefit we were going to get from improving economies in a number of our other markets, particularly in Texas but also in Florida and California, et cetera. And I think as we look towards next year, we are cautious about, again, our ability to replicate that same level of growth. I think we feel like we'll continue to see improving economies in those markets for the most part. Now I will also add that I think in the last month or 2, we've gotten a little bit more cautious about the Texas economy, specifically given the pressures from oil and gas prices. And I think we've stepped back our projections in those markets, particularly. But other than that, again, I just think we are forecasting strong performance in '15, just not quite as robust as we saw in '14."

So we continue to project those length of stay pressures will continue into '15. That's what our guidance reflects. I will say that I certainly noticed in the fourth quarter that some of the decline in length of stay that we experienced was self-imposed or self-executed, if you will, in the sense that -- I mentioned, to some degree, the conversion of residential beds to acute, and we've been doing that for a while. And to the degree that we continue to do that, we will drive the length of stay down ourselves because the length of stay in our acute facilities is clearly lower than it is in our residential facilities. But I do think that's reflected in that stronger revenue per day that you saw in the fourth quarter because, obviously, as we shift beds and, therefore, days and admission from residential to acute, we'll see a drop in length of stay, but we ought to see a rise in revenue per day."

We had a couple of very strong surgical volume quarters in '14. The second quarter was really strong. The fourth quarter was really strong. I think even in retrospect, it's a little bit difficult for us to identify exactly why that was. So I will say that I think the 2015 guidance presumes a more modest sort of surgical experience than what we experienced certainly in Q4 and something that's more reflective of our full year experience. And to be fair, I think the year has started off, at least in January, with kind of a more muted surgical volume. There was a lot of, at least, speculation in the back half of '14 that hospitals, to some degree, would experience a surge in volume at the end of the year given the increasing prevalence of high-deductible plans and that, that really might influence patient behavior as people exhausted their co-pays and deductibles late in the year and would take advantage of that. And I don't know if that's what really drove the dynamic that we experienced, but we certainly had a real strong surgical quarter in Q4 and a little bit weaker as 2015 started. So we'd at least been not inconsistent with that theory. So again, I think we've just been more kind of rational or muted about what our 2015 volumes should look like, and I think that's what's reflected in the guidance."

I think we had a view really from the beginning of ACA implementation that in the long run, all states would ultimately participate in Medicaid expansion because it just made economic sense for them to do so. Obviously, I think in a lot of cases, economic sense is being overwhelmed or pressured by political considerations, and I think we find those very hard to sort of measure and calculate. So we continue, again, in our state hospital associations and in other forums to work for expansion in those states in which we operate that have not expanded yet. Again, don't expect anything necessarily to happen in '15.

I think we basically felt like our payer mix strength, which, of course, I think at the end of the day, was really what drove the outsized performance of the -- particularly of the acute division in 2014, really was relatively stable throughout the year. Now the character of it changed some in the sense that in the beginning of the year, the payer mix improvement was clearly more weighted to Medicaid -- more Medicaid patients and managed Medicaid patients and, I think, was a function of Medicaid expansion in some of our large states like Nevada, like California and the District of Columbia. And then in the back half of the year, we saw a bit more of a shift from the Medicaid impact to the commercial exchange impact. But just generally, I think the payer mix was -- the payer mix improvement was really a constant for us in 2014 and, as I said, generally, a -- the biggest and primary driver of the really strong performance. And again, I think as we answered -- an answer to your question before about the guidance, I think we expect that, that payer mix improvement continues into 2015, and our guidance reflects that, but that it does not necessarily continue at the same rate. And certainly, one of the sort of muting dynamics that we have is that we don't have any new states, as we just talked about, that will participate in Medicaid expansion next year. So to some degree, the Medicaid improvement certainly levels off pretty considerably in '15."

I think that -- let me answer the question in a couple of different ways. I mean, I think that in terms of signing patients up, like many or, I would probably speculate, most of our peers, we've developed a pretty rigorous process to make sure that we have certified counselors in all of our facilities and that we're both proactively and reactively responding to patients who come to our facilities uninsured and trying to find the most effective and efficient way to get them insured, whether that's enrollment in Medicaid or through the commercial exchange opportunity. We're doing all those things. Now at the end of the day, I think, as I said, most hospitals are probably doing something similar. As far as the swings in charity and bad debt, I know I'm going to sound like a broken record when I say this, but we find it difficult, even internally, to explain some of the specific movements between those buckets. And I always make the point that as company, we analyze uncompensated care as sort of a single unified bucket, and we include bad debt and charity care and uninsured discount. And again, I think if you look at those numbers on a combined basis, it reinforces the comment that I made before, which is there's been a significant decline in those numbers in 2014 throughout the year. And it's reflective of the ACA and improving economic dynamics that we've already talked about."

Am I not thinking about that right? Or would there be an initiative by sort of -- because I think in the past, you've talked about letting each of the individual hospitals kind of determine that.

So I think the balance that we and all hospitals walk is trying to be reasonable about what is a reasonable level of income and assets for a patient to qualify for charity care. So somebody comes in the hospital with no health insurance and a very low income level and no assets, and the general decision is made based on those criteria that there really is no point in making an effort to collect from those patients. I think your question is why don't you try and collect from as many patients as you possibly can, and I would answer in 2 ways. I mean, I think that, one, from sort of a -- just sort of public policy perspective, we recognize that for people at a very low income level with little assets, it really is just too much of a burden for them to pay some of these bills. And then secondly, I think from a business perspective, it's an effort that we have found can consume a fair amount of time and money and really yield very little. So again, we try and have a charity policy that, I think, is fairly consistent with the industry that tries to walk that line and collects from people who really can afford to pay but really doesn't try and collect from that portion of the population that really can't."

And so I think those are the comments that you're thinking about. So in general, I mean, we didn't make any specific cuts or assume specific cuts in Texas reimbursement but just sort of stepped back our Texas earnings projections for next year a little bit and, on a broad basis, in an expectation that we might feel some pressures in that economy in 2015 that we clearly did not feel in 2014."

I think that we have some dilution in -- I shouldn't say -- dilution is probably not the right word. But we had a big improvement in our Temecula market in '14. That facility opened late in '13. We had a fair amount of startup costs and startup losses, and now this year, we've been profitable. And so as a consequence, that was a big swing. We'll continue to improve in that Temecula market, but the improvement in '15 just is not going to be as great as it was in '14.

So yes, I think I will tell you in our own models, we continue to use a CapEx placeholder at about that same level."

Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014. 
During the conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend the careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. 
We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.
As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $5.42 for the year and $1.71 for the quarter. After adjusting for a reduction in malpractice reserves relating to prior years and the incentive income and expenses associated with the implementation of electronic health record applications at our acute care hospitals, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was $1.51.
On a same-facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 6.3% during the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted admissions and adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 6.8% and 2.8%, respectively, during the fourth quarter. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 3.2% during the fourth quarter of 2014 over the comparable prior year quarter.
We define operating margins as operating income or net revenues less salaries, wages and benefits, other operating expenses and supplies expense divided by net revenues. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year increased slightly to 28.0% during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 27.7% during the comparable prior year period.
On a same-facility basis, in our acute care division, revenues increased 14.9% during the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted admissions increased 5.5%, while revenue per adjusted admission increased 8.8%. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 18.1% during the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to 14.1% during the fourth quarter of 2013.
Our cash generated from operating activities increased to approximately $346 million during the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to $308 million during the fourth quarter of 2013. Our cash generated from operating activities increased to approximately $1.04 billion during the full year of 2014 as compared to $884 million during 2013.
Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 56 days during the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to 57 days during the fourth quarter of 2013. At December 31, 2014, our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 47%.
During 2014, we opened a total of 602 new behavioral health beds, including 162 beds opened at 2 de novo hospitals and 440 beds opened at some of our busiest facilities. In addition, we already have approved projects to add approximately 550 new behavioral health beds and convert approximately 50 beds from residential treatment center to acute during 2015, and that number could grow as we continue to pursue opportunities to add and convert additional beds.
We spent $82 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2014 and $391 million during the full year of 2014. During 2015, we expect to spend approximately $375 million to $400 million in capital expenditures, which includes expenditures for capital equipment, renovations, new projects at existing hospitals and construction of new facilities.
In conjunction with our share repurchase program that commenced during the third quarter of 2014, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 321,500 shares of our stock at an average price of slightly less than $102 per share.
Our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2015 is $6.15 to $6.55 per diluted share. The guidance range excludes the unfavorable $0.12 per diluted share of EHR expected -- EHR impact expected during 2015, as described in our press release last night. This guidance range represents an increase of approximately 6% to 13% over the adjusted net income attributable to UHS of $5.78 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2014, as calculated on the supplemental schedule included in last night's press release.
During 2015, our net revenues are estimated to be approximately $8.7 billion to $8.8 billion, representing an increase of approximately 8% to 9% over our 2014 net revenues. Included in our estimated 2015 net revenues are revenues associated with the previously announced acquisition of Cygnet Health Care in the U.K. and a health insurance company in Nevada.
In addition, during the fourth quarter, we acquired a 46-bed behavioral health hospital located near Taunton in the United Kingdom. 
Alan and I are pleased to answer your questions at this time."

We called out the $11 million of Texas DSRIP in the press release. We also have spoken before about $4 million of California UPL that I know some of our peers have recognized as well in the fourth quarter. So if you adjust those things out, it probably brings the revenue growth down by a couple of hundred basis points, still, by any measure, a very strong and robust revenue growth quarter. Our admission growth seemed to be fairly consistent with our peers who've reported similar strong volumes. What seems to distinguish the UHS performance in the quarter was that really robust revenue intensity and revenue per unit, per admission or per day. I think a lot of that, Josh, was driven by strong surgical volumes we had both in- and outpatient surgical volume growth of approximately 5%. And for the first time I can remember in a long time, the inpatient growth actually was outpacing the outpatient, so I think that's what really drove some of that revenue intensity."

I will say, however, that I think our best guesstimate is that we've got -- and I think, again, this is fairly consistent with what I understand some of our peers have said, but I think in the acute care division, we assume that the ACA impact in 2015 will be about 6% to 7% of our overall earnings.

And I think we're in largely the same place as we were then. And obviously, since then, we announced the Cygnet acquisition and dedicated about $335 million to that. But we continue to look for growth opportunities, both externally and internally, in both of our business segments. We announced just in the call a small acquisition in the U.K. We continue to look for other opportunities in the U.K. as well as other M&A opportunities in both behavioral and acute here in the U.S. and also continue to expand organically. I mentioned the new behavioral beds that we've got online for next year. We've talked about our new acute care hospital that we're building in Las Vegas, so we've got a number of things going on. But I think we have also said that if we don't find sufficient sort of opportunities for external growth, we're also more than happy to continue to repurchase shares under the previously announced authorization. So I think from our perspective, we're likely to pursue sort of all those avenues in 2015."

But I think the industry in general is becoming more and more positive about the idea that from a public policy perspective, that either legislatively or administratively, there will be progress on this issue. As you know, there is a demonstration project that's part of the Affordable Care Act that lifts the IMD exclusion in about a dozen states, and we're participating in some of those states in that project. We believe that the outcome and the data from that demo project will support the idea that a broader lifting of the exclusion makes sense from a public policy perspective in terms of access and cost. And again, as an industry, we continue to lobby hard for that, and that remains one of our main priorities, again, from a legislative/regulatory perspective. So we'll continue to work for it. We continue to feel that there's positive movement there, but I think it's difficult to predict with any sort of level of precision when there might be a substantive change."

I think a good portion -- or a good reason for that is while we were all, meaning the company as well as our peers, we're focused on the potential ACA impact in '14. And I think we largely anticipated that correctly. We didn't really anticipate the benefit we were going to get from improving economies in a number of our other markets, particularly in Texas but also in Florida and California, et cetera. And I think as we look towards next year, we are cautious about, again, our ability to replicate that same level of growth. I think we feel like we'll continue to see improving economies in those markets for the most part. Now I will also add that I think in the last month or 2, we've gotten a little bit more cautious about the Texas economy, specifically given the pressures from oil and gas prices. And I think we've stepped back our projections in those markets, particularly. But other than that, again, I just think we are forecasting strong performance in '15, just not quite as robust as we saw in '14."

So we continue to project those length of stay pressures will continue into '15. That's what our guidance reflects. I will say that I certainly noticed in the fourth quarter that some of the decline in length of stay that we experienced was self-imposed or self-executed, if you will, in the sense that -- I mentioned, to some degree, the conversion of residential beds to acute, and we've been doing that for a while. And to the degree that we continue to do that, we will drive the length of stay down ourselves because the length of stay in our acute facilities is clearly lower than it is in our residential facilities. But I do think that's reflected in that stronger revenue per day that you saw in the fourth quarter because, obviously, as we shift beds and, therefore, days and admissions from residential to acute, we'll see a drop in length of stay, but we ought to see a rise in revenue per day."

We had a couple of very strong surgical volume quarters in '14. The second quarter was really strong. The fourth quarter was really strong. I think even in retrospect, it's a little bit difficult for us to identify exactly why that was. So I will say that I think the 2015 guidance presumes a more modest sort of surgical experience than we experienced certainly in Q4 and something that's more reflective of our full year experience. And to be fair, I think the year has started off, at least in January, with kind of a more muted surgical volume. There was a lot of, at least, speculation in the back half of '14 that hospitals, to some degree, would experience a surge in volume at the end of the year given the increasing prevalence of high-deductible plans and that really might influence patient behavior as people exhausted their co-pays and deductibles late in the year and would take advantage of that. And I don't know if that's what really drove the dynamic that we experienced, but we certainly had a real strong surgical quarter in Q4 and a little bit weaker as 2015 started. So we'd at least been not inconsistent with that theory. So again, I think we've just been more kind of rational or muted about what our 2015 volumes should look like, and I think that's what's reflected in the guidance."

I think we have had a view really from the beginning of ACA implementation that in the long run, all states would ultimately participate in Medicaid expansion because it just made economic sense for them to do so. Obviously, I think in a lot of cases, economic sense is being overwhelmed or pressured by political considerations, and I think we find those very hard to sort of measure and calculate. So we continue, again, in our state hospital associations and in other forums to work for expansion in those states in which we operate that have not expanded yet. Again, don't expect anything necessarily to happen in '15.

I think we've basically felt like our payer mix strength, which, of course, I think at the end of the day, was really what drove the outsized performance of the -- particularly of the acute division in 2014, really was relatively stable throughout the year. Now the character of it changed some in the sense that in the beginning of the year, the payer mix improvement was clearly more weighted to Medicaid -- more Medicaid patients and managed Medicaid patients and, I think, was a function of Medicaid expansion in some of our large states like Nevada, like California and the District of Columbia. And then in the back half of the year, we saw a bit more of a shift from the Medicaid impact to the commercial exchange impact. But just generally, I think the payer mix was -- the payer mix improvement was really a constant for us in 2014 and, as I said, generally, a -- the biggest and primary driver of the really strong performance. And again, I think as we answered -- an answer to your question before about the guidance, I think we expect that, that payer mix improvement continues into 2015, and our guidance reflects that, but that it does not necessarily continue at the same rate. And certainly, one of the sort of muting dynamics that we have is that we don't have any new states, as we just talked about, that will participate in Medicaid expansion next year. So to some degree, the Medicaid improvement certainly levels off pretty considerably in '15."

I think that -- let me answer the question in a couple of different ways. I mean, I think that in terms of signing patients up, like many or, I would probably speculate, most of our peers, we've developed a pretty rigorous process to make sure that we have certified counselors in all of our facilities and that we're both proactively and reactively responding to patients who come to our facilities uninsured and trying to find the most effective and efficient way to get them insured, whether that's enrollment in Medicaid or through the commercial exchange opportunity. We're doing all those things. Now at the end of the day, I think, as I said, most hospitals are probably doing something similar. As far as the swings in charity and bad debt, I know I'm going to sound like a broken record when I say this, but we find it difficult, even internally, to explain some of the specific movements between those buckets. And I always make the point that as a company, we analyze uncompensated care as sort of a single unified bucket, and we include bad debt and charity care and uninsured discount. And again, I think if you look at those numbers on a combined basis, it reinforces the comment that I made before, which is there's been a significant decline in those numbers in 2014 throughout the year. And it's reflective of the ACA and improving economic dynamics that we've already talked about."

Even if you have to write it off, the pressure on the individual would ultimately then, perhaps, force them to consider getting on the roles via either exchanges and/or Medicaid versus just writing it off right up front. Am I not thinking about that right? Or would there be an initiative by sort of -- because I think in the past, you've talked about letting each of the individual hospitals kind of determine that. Would that make sense in terms of trying to even push that number lower?"

So I think the balance that we and all hospitals walk is trying to be reasonable about what is a reasonable level of income and assets for a patient to qualify for charity care. So somebody comes in the hospital with no health insurance and a very low income level and no assets, and the general decision is made based on those criteria that there really is no point in making an effort to collect from those patients. I think your question is why don't you try and collect from as many patients as you possibly can, and I would answer in 2 ways. I mean, I think that, one, from sort of a -- just sort of public policy perspective, we recognize that for people at a very low income level with little assets, it really is just too much of a burden for them to pay some of these bills. And then secondly, I think from a business perspective, it's an effort that we have found can consume a fair amount of time and money and really yield very little. So again, we try and have a charity policy that, I think, is fairly consistent with the industry that tries to walk that line and collects from people who really can afford to pay but really doesn't try and collect from that portion of the population that really can't."

And to be fair, I don't think we've seen, currently, a lot of softness in those markets but are just anticipating the possibility of such, given the fact that the Texas economy seems to be slowing. And again, I think we could see that softness in a number of ways through a slightly deteriorating payer mix or slightly lower volumes or through some pressure from the state, either in traditional Medicaid rates or some of the special reimbursement programs that we benefit from. And so I think those are the comments that you're thinking about. So in general, I mean, we didn't make any specific cuts or assume specific cuts in Texas reimbursement but just sort of stepped back our Texas earnings projections for next year a little bit and, on a broad basis, in an expectation that we might feel some pressures in that economy in 2015 that we clearly did not feel in 2014."

I think that we have some dilution in -- I shouldn't say -- dilution is probably not the right word. But we had a big improvement in our Temecula market in '14. That facility opened late in '13. We had a fair amount of startup costs and startup losses, and now this year, we've been profitable. And so as a consequence, that was a big swing. We'll continue to improve in that Temecula market, but the improvement in '15 just is not going to be as great as it was in '14.

During the conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts projections and forward-looking statements.  For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading on the section on risk factors and for those in this factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. We would like to highlight a couple of business trends before opening the call up to questions.
As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.73 for the quarter. After adjusting for the depreciation and amortization associated with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $1.78 for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. 
On the same facility basis in our acute care division, revenues increased 12.2% during the first quarter of 2015. The increase resulted primarily from a 5.7% increase in adjusted admissions and a 6.1% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 21.6% during the first quarter of 2015 from 19.2% during the first quarter of 2014.
On a same facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 6.3% during the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 6.0%. And adjusted patient days increased 2.6% over the prior year first quarter.
Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 3.7% during the first quarter of 2015 over the comparable prior year quarter. 
On a same facility basis, operating margins for our behavioral health division increased to 28.6% during the quarter ended March 31, 2015, as compared to 27.7% during the comparable prior year period.
Our cash provided by operating activities increased 39% to approximately $271 million during the first quarter of 2015 as compared to $195 million in the first quarter of 2014. 
Our accounts receivable days outstanding remained at 56 days during comparable first quarters of 2015 and 2014.
Our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization decreased to 44.6% at March 31, 2015, as compared to 48.6% at March 31, 2014.
During the first quarter of 2015, we spent $89 million on capital expenditures. During the quarter, we completed construction and opened 54 new beds in our acute care division and 148 new behavioral health beds at some of our busiest behavioral facilities. 
Alan and I will be pleased to answer your questions at this time."

Again, it strikes me that those percentages are probably still reasonably accurate in 2015 in terms of sort of geographically how the quarter looked. We had a very, very strong quarter in our Las Vegas market. Volumes are very strong in the Las Vegas market. We continue to see a full quarter's worth of benefit of the Medicaid expansion in Nevada, which is a Medicaid expansion state obviously. And so just real strong results in the Las Vegas market in Q1. Additionally, a very nice swing between years in our Temecula facility. I'll remind people that our Temecula was a start up in the first quarter of 2014. So it is ramping up quite nicely. And while I think a lot of that ramp is reflected in our guidance, it does provide a real nice tailwind year-to-year. So those are the 2 markets I would highlight. Obviously, I think when you posed a solid and as robust quarter as we did, you're going to have strong results pretty much through the portfolio that we did but at least I'd highlight those 2 markets."

So that's certainly driving a lot of the sort of acuity element of the revenue improvement. And then secondly, we just have that continued the payer mix improvement. We anticipated that 2015 would benefit from a full year of that enrollment that we saw occur, sort of incrementally throughout 2014.

So I think I wouldn't read the relatively modest repurchases in Q1 to be terribly meaningful in any regard. I'll repeat what we've said over the last few [ph] quarters since the buyback authorization in Q2 of 2014 was approved by the board, and that is we anticipate we're going to generate a significant amount of free cash. We're not really anxious to see our leverage levels go any lower than we were, when we established the share buyback. And while we continue to explore opportunities in the M&A space in both of the business segments, I think we feel comfortable we have the room to do most sized deals as well as share repurchases as well as continuing CapEx at the current levels.

Although, I'll repeat a comment that I made in the fourth quarter, and I think it continued into Q1, and that is that at least some of that length of stay decline, at least in the last few [ph] quarters, is self-imposed or self-manufactured in the sense that we continue to convert residential beds and residential services to acute beds and acute services. And when we do that, we are by definition lowering our length of stay because acute services length of stay is markedly lower than the residential length of stay is. So at least some element of the length of stay decline is intentional. And quite frankly, I think in our minds a positive development, in that we're replacing higher revenue beds with lower revenue beds. And I think that's partly what you see in the strong revenue growth, that seems a revenue growth of 6 plus-percent, which is clearly at the high end of our own expectations. As far as being able to identify the effect from parity, I think we always believe that it will be difficult to do. And I think we still believe that almost well not impossible to do. And that's because when we see a patient who has valid and legitimate insurance, we really don't sort of know the history of that insurance, to what degree benefit plan design has changed et cetera. I think the insurance company, the government might have better insight into that. What we are very focused on as a company and I think as an industry, is in making sure that, that parity rules and regulations, including some of the newer ones and some of the clarifications are being properly enforced, because I think we believe that there still are plans and that there's still executions of the plans that are not compliant and therefore, that there is sort of upside to us if we can ensure that, that compliance is met throughout the country."

And I think what it says is that managed care or Medicaid managed care organizations and other like organizations have to comply with parity as to our case, that under 21 population. So I think it's helpful not in a sort of a game changing way, but it's definitely helpful around the edges if you will. We are hopeful and continue to work as an industry for a more rational sort of approach to the IND exclusion. And that means I think we continue to lobby CMS and cooperate with their data-gathering activities to try and demonstrate that lifting the IND exclusion would be the correct thing to do for a public policy perspective. And we also continue to work on the legislative end of it, working with Congressman, working with legislators like Congressman Murphy who has a Bill out there that would eliminate the IND exclusion. So we're working on a number of fronts. I think, that lifting the IND exclusion would be a game changer. I think the continued modifications to the parity law and the parity rules are helpful, but the sort of end goal would be the lifting of the IND exclusion."

And I think during the several years of the recession beginning in 2009 for us as a company I think as an industry and extending well through 2013, we had sort of multiyear pressure from the recession, from uncompensated care, et cetera, which put a burden on our volumes. Our volumes were rather muted during that period. And our uncompensated care level just grew throughout that period. And then beginning in 2014, with the benefits of the Affordable Care Act providing insurance to millions of people who didn't have it before, as well as the improving economy, allowing people to go back to work and get reinsured, all that has been helpful in our market. I think because the decline was a multiyear decline, we always anticipated that the recovery would be a multiyear recovery. And we're certainly seeing that, where I would suggest either the second or the third year of the recovery in Las Vegas and the second year of recovery in a number of our other markets.

We see that in higher over time and higher use of temporary nurses. We see it to some degree in pressures, in terms of placing doctors. We've seen quite a bit of pressure frankly on the behavioral side and finding adequate number of psychiatrists in all of our facilities and that's put some pressure on use of physicians and that sort of thing.

I think we believe that, that process is definitely an evolutionary process. It is one that will take multiple years. Honestly, in the vast majority of our reimbursement remains fee-for-service reimbursement, although in some cases like in Medicare, there are quality components and elements of that, but it's still largely remains fee-for-service reimbursement. What we're doing are a number of things, both in terms of our relationship with our physicians and really trying to integrate with our physicians, particularly on the information technology side, to prepare for that move through kind of a more of a risk shifting environment with bundled payment and capitation, et cetera. We've talked, I think at some length, over the last few [ph] quarters over some other initiatives running the purchase in the middle of last year of health insurance company in Nevada to better prepare us again for that sort of risk-taking to allow us in certain selected markets and with certain selected products to go out there and have a provider sponsor product in certain of our markets.

Some of the growth for instance of beds that I mentioned in the my opening remarks, are beds at acute care hospitals, nonaffiliated acute care hospitals that we have opened in connection with newly sort of formed partnerships with acute care hospitals and we still think that a significant opportunity in the future. Now to be fair, those opportunities are relatively bite-size. We will get 30 beds at a time, or 50 or 70 beds at that time. We're not going to get thousands of thousands of beds at a single stroke.

Those, the percentages and the magnitude of that change differs a little bit from market-to-market. And it's a little challenging as I've suggested at the outset of the call, to kind of discretely identify to what degree those changes, those payer mix changes are being driven by the ACA and to what degree they're being driven by economic improvement or other factors. But I think our view is, as I said in an earlier response, that those trends, the ACA implementation, will continue this year and probably for at least one more year. And I think the economic improvement will likely continue. And then there are individual market efforts, which I think are also driving some of this improvement, and I think have been very successful.

For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend the careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. 
We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.
As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded -- reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.73 for the quarter. After adjusting for the depreciation and amortization expense associated with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $1.78 for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. 
On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, revenues increased 12.2% during the first quarter of 2015. The increase resulted primarily from a 5.7% increase in adjusted admissions and a 6.1% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 21.6% during the first quarter of 2015 from 19.2% during the first quarter of 2014.
On a same-facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 6.3% during the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 6.0%, and adjusted patient days increased 2.6% over the prior year first quarter. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 3.7% during the first quarter of 2015 over the comparable prior year quarter. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our behavioral health division increased to 28.6% during the quarter ended March 31, 2015, as compared to 27.7% during the comparable prior year period.
Our cash provided by operating activities increased 39% to approximately $271 million during the first quarter of 2015 as compared to $195 million in the first quarter of 2014. 
Our accounts receivable days outstanding remained at 56 days during comparable first quarters of 2015 and 2014.
Our ratio of debt to total capitalization decreased to 44.6% at March 31, 2015, as compared to 48.6% at March 31, 2014.
During the first quarter of 2015, we spent $89 million on capital expenditures. During the quarter, we completed construction and opened 54 new beds in our acute care division and 148 new behavioral health beds at some of our busiest behavioral facilities. 
Alan and I will be pleased to answer your questions at this time."

Again, it strikes me that those percentages are probably still reasonably accurate in 2015 in terms of sort of geographically how the quarter looked. We had a very, very strong quarter in our Las Vegas market. Volumes were very strong in the Las Vegas market. We continued to see a full quarter's worth of benefit of the Medicaid expansion in Nevada, which is a Medicaid expansion state obviously, and so just real strong results in the Las Vegas market in Q1. Additionally, a very nice swing between years in our Temecula facility. I'll remind people that our Temecula was a start-up in the first quarter of 2014, so it is ramping up quite nicely. And while I think a lot of that ramp is reflected in our guidance, it does provide a real nice tailwind year-to-year. So those are the 2 markets I would highlight. Obviously, I think when you post a solid and as robust a quarter as we did, you're going to have strong results pretty much through the portfolio and we did, but at least I'd highlight those 2 markets."

So that's certainly driving a lot of the sort of acuity element of the revenue improvement. And then secondly, we just have that continued payer mix improvement. We anticipated that 2015 would benefit from a full year of that enrollment that we saw occur sort of incrementally throughout 2014 and I think Q1 was a reflection of that, and again, particularly in places like Las Vegas, which had huge Medicaid expansion growth in '14.

So I think I wouldn't read the relatively modest repurchases in Q1 to be terribly meaningful in any regard. I'll repeat what we've said in the last few quarters since the buyback authorization in Q2 of 2014 was approved by the board, and that is we anticipate we're going to generate a significant amount of free cash. We're not really anxious to see our leverage levels go any lower than they were when we established the share buyback. And while we continue to explore opportunities in the M&A space in both of the business segments, I think we feel comfortable we have the room to do most sized deals as well as share repurchase as well as continuing CapEx at the current levels. So we're very comfortable that we can accomplish all those things and still maintain what in our minds is a comfortable leverage level."

So I think on the length-of-stay issue, we continue to see length-of-stay decline, although I'll repeat a comment that I made in the fourth quarter and I think it continued into Q1, and that is that at least some of that length-of-stay decline, at least in the last few quarters, is self-imposed or self-manufactured in the sense that we continue to convert residential beds and residential services to acute beds and acute services. And when we do that, we are, by definition, lowering our length of stay because acute services length of stay is markedly lower than the residential length of stay is. So at least some element of the length-of-stay decline is intentional, and quite frankly, I think in our minds a positive development in that we're replacing higher revenue beds with lower revenue beds and I think that's partly what you see in the strong revenue growth, that same-store revenue growth of 6 plus-percent, which is clearly at the high end of our own expectations. As far as being able to identify the effect from Parity, I think we always believe that would be difficult to do. And I think we still believe that almost -- well, not impossible to do and that's because when we see a patient who has valid and legitimate insurance, we really don't sort of know the history of that insurance, to what degree benefit plan design has changed, et cetera. I think the insurance companies or the government might have better insight into that. What we are very focused on as a company, I think, and as an industry is in making sure that the Parity rules and regulations, including some of the newer ones and some of the clarifications are being properly enforced because I think we believe that there still are plans and that there still is executions of the plans that are not compliant and therefore that there is sort of upside to us if we can ensure that compliance is met throughout the country."

But the nature of the business is such that when you have the really sort of strong revenue growth that we had in Q1, you are likely to see a significant amount of operating leverage. You did see that particularly in the acute division in Q1. If that revenue run rate does start to sort of modestly regress, as I suggested before that it might from the 12-plus percent we ran in Q1, it'd be a little bit challenging to generate quite as much leverage as we did.

The recent Parity clarifications that you mentioned I think are helpful for the nonadult population, the Medicaid population that's under age 21. And I think what it says is that managed care -- or Medicaid managed care organizations and other like organizations have to comply with Parity as to our case, that under 21 population. So I think it's helpful not in a sort of a game-changing way, but it's definitely helpful around the edges, if you will. We are hopeful and continue to work as an industry for a more rational sort of approach to the IMD exclusion and that means I think we continue to lobby CMS and cooperate with their data-gathering activities to try and demonstrate that lifting the IMD exclusion would be the correct thing to do from a public policy perspective. And we also continue to work on the legislative end of it, working with Congressman like -- working with legislators like Congressman Murphy who has a bill out there that would eliminate the IMD exclusion. So we're working on a number of fronts. I think that lifting the IMD exclusion would be a game changer.

Our volumes were rather muted during that period. And our uncompensated care level just grew throughout that period.

And as a consequence, we've seen this pretty robust expansion of margins, particularly on the acute side of the business. I think, from a cost perspective, you cited the things that we're certainly concerned about. As volumes grow, there is pressure on wages. We see that higher over time and higher use of temporary nurses. We see it, to some degree, in pressures in terms of placing doctors. We've seen quite a bit of pressure, frankly, on the behavioral side in finding an adequate number of psychiatrists in all of our facilities and that's put some pressure on use of locums, physicians and that sort of thing. But as I think we step back and look at it, I don't know that there's anything on sort of the cost landscape that we would describe or think about as a huge discrete drag.

We've talked, I think, at some length over the last few quarters about some of the initiatives surrounding the purchase in the middle of last year of a health insurance company in Nevada to better prepare us again for that sort of risk taking to allow us in certain selected markets and with certain selected products to go out there and have a provider-sponsored product in certain of our markets. So we're trying to move at just the right pace in our markets, not trying to get ahead of the curve, but also absolutely ensuring that we are nowhere behind the curve in terms of these changes that we know are coming in, certainly, at least the acute care space."

I mean I think that the -- I think what we would say is it's inevitable. I think that payers and I think public policymakers have determined that the real -- ultimately, they real way to control costs in the health care space is by a shift of risk from the consumer and the employer and the payer to -- excuse me, from the employer and the payer to the consumer and the provider. And so I think we're going there. And it's not necessarily, I think, on the surface a good or a bad thing. I think it's a good thing if you can react nimbly and flexibly to the changes and I think we're prepared to do that. So if you can be the one to have and put together a large network in our markets and deliver high-quality, low-cost care, efficient care in the markets, then I think it will be a good thing and I think we believe we're well positioned to do that."

So as a result, I think most of the larger -- and we're far and away the largest, but most of the larger consolidated providers are right now in growth mode as opposed to in a sale mode or in a divestiture mode. So we're competing for assets with a number of other providers. I do think there still are a lot of other providers out there to be acquired. Also, we have talked to a number of times about the opportunity for the 50% of beds or so or half of the days or admissions in the behavioral business that are currently serviced within acute care hospitals. So that's behavioral beds within acute care hospitals. Some of the growth, for instance, of beds that I mentioned in my opening remarks are beds at acute care hospitals, nonaffiliated acute care hospitals, that we have opened in connection with newly sort of formed partnerships with acute care hospitals and we still think that's a significant opportunity in the future. Now to be fair, those opportunities are relatively bite-sized. We will get 30 beds at a time or 50 or 70 beds at a time. We're not going to get thousands and thousands of beds at a single stroke. But the ultimate opportunity, I think, is enormous and as by far and away the largest provider of freestanding behavioral services in the country, I think we're very well positioned to take advantage of that."

At the same time, the market, much like it is here in the U.S., remains fragmented, and as a consequence, there are M&A opportunities and we're pursuing those and also doing all the same things that we're doing in the U.S., which, I think, you alluded to in your question where we're running, as I said, in response to a previous question at very high occupancy rates, that we're looking at adding beds to our facilities as we are here in the U.S. We're looking at building greenfield de novo projects and we'll continue to do all those things."

And so I think you'll still find a number of not-for-profit acute hospitals that find themselves financially challenged in a variety of ways. I think also, going back to Josh Raskin's question, I think a lot of not-for-profit hospitals look at the landscape of changing reimbursement and the challenges that presents and the need to be in a large network and find that they may not be able to check all the boxes. And I think they're looking for either partners or they're looking for some sort of sale arrangement that allows them to be -- to sort of be better positioned to move forward in the future. So we're talking with a number of not-for-profits about those sorts of opportunities. I think those sorts of opportunities are going to be there in the next few years. It's difficult to predict how and at what rate they'll develop and all we can do is respond to them as they develop, but we're certainly ready to do so and we certainly have the financial flexibility to do so."

For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend the careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. 
We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.
As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded -- reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.73 for the quarter. After adjusting for the depreciation and amortization expense associated with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $1.78 for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. 
On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, revenues increased 12.2% during the first quarter of 2015. The increase resulted primarily from a 5.7% increase in adjusted admissions and a 6.1% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 21.6% during the first quarter of 2015 from 19.2% during the first quarter of 2014.
On a same-facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 6.3% during the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 6.0%, and adjusted patient days increased 2.6% over the prior year first quarter. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 3.7% during the first quarter of 2015 over the comparable prior year quarter. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our behavioral health division increased to 28.6% during the quarter ended March 31, 2015, as compared to 27.7% during the comparable prior year period.
Our cash provided by operating activities increased 39% to approximately $271 million during the first quarter of 2015 as compared to $195 million in the first quarter of 2014. 
Our accounts receivable days outstanding remained at 56 days during comparable first quarters of 2015 and 2014.
Our ratio of debt to total capitalization decreased to 44.6% at March 31, 2015, as compared to 48.6% at March 31, 2014.
During the first quarter of 2015, we spent $89 million on capital expenditures. During the quarter, we completed construction and opened 54 new beds in our acute care division and 148 new behavioral health beds at some of our busiest behavioral facilities. 
Alan and I will be pleased to answer your questions at this time."

Again, it strikes me that those percentages are probably still reasonably accurate in 2015 in terms of sort of geographically how the quarter looked. We had a very, very strong quarter in our Las Vegas market. Volumes were very strong in the Las Vegas market. We continued to see a full quarter's worth of benefit of the Medicaid expansion in Nevada, which is a Medicaid expansion state obviously, and so just real strong results in the Las Vegas market in Q1. Additionally, a very nice swing between years in our Temecula facility. I'll remind people that our Temecula was a start-up in the first quarter of 2014, so it is ramping up quite nicely. And while I think a lot of that ramp is reflected in our guidance, it does provide a real nice tailwind year-to-year. So those are the 2 markets I would highlight.

So I think I wouldn't read the relatively modest repurchases in Q1 to be terribly meaningful in any regard. I'll repeat what we've said in the last few quarters since the buyback authorization in Q2 of 2014 was approved by the board, and that is we anticipate we're going to generate a significant amount of free cash. We're not really anxious to see our leverage levels go any lower than they were when we established the share buyback.

And when we do that, we are, by definition, lowering our length of stay, because acute services length of stay is markedly lower than the residential length of stay is. So at least some element of the length-of-stay decline is intentional, and quite frankly, I think in our minds a positive development in that we're replacing higher revenue beds with lower revenue beds (sic) and I think that's partly what you see in the strong revenue growth, that same-store revenue growth of 6 plus-percent; which is clearly at the high end of our own expectations. As far as being able to identify the effect from Parity, I think we always believe that would be difficult to do. And I think we still believe that almost well nigh impossible to do and that's because when we see a patient who has valid and legitimate insurance, we really don't sort of know the history of that insurance, to what degree benefit plan design has really changed, et cetera. I think the insurance companies or the government might have better insight into that. What we are very focused on as a company, I think, and as an industry is in making sure that the Parity rules and regulations, including some of the newer ones and some of the clarifications are being properly enforced because I think we believe that there still are plans and that there still is executions of plans that are not compliant and therefore that there is sort of upside to us if we can ensure that compliance is met throughout the country."

And I think what it says is that managed care -- or Medicaid managed care organizations and other like organizations have to comply with Parity as to in our case, that under 21 population. So I think it's helpful not in a sort of a game-changing way, but it's definitely helpful around the edges, if you will. We are hopeful and continue to work as an industry for a more rational sort of approach to the IMD exclusion and that means I think we continue to lobby CMS and cooperate with their data-gathering activities to try and demonstrate that lifting the IMD exclusion would be the correct thing to do from a public policy perspective. And we also continue to work on the legislative end of it, working with Congressmen like -- working with legislators like Congressman Murphy who has a bill out there that would eliminate the IMD exclusion.

Look, I think, again, as a company and as an industry, we really did a significant amount of belt-tightening and kind of real structural reviews of our cost structure during those years of the recession when our revenues were really challenged. And I think that left us in a very good position beginning in 2014 when the trends -- the revenue trends reversed themselves and revenue growth began anew, and earnestly. And as a consequence, we've seen this pretty robust expansion of margins, particularly on the acute side of the business. I think, from a cost perspective, you cited the things that we're certainly concerned about. As volumes grow, there is pressure on wages. We see that in higher over time and higher use of temporary nurses. We see it, to some degree, in pressures in terms of placing doctors. We've seen quite a bit of pressure, frankly, on the behavioral side in finding an adequate number of psychiatrists in all of our facilities and that's put some pressure on use of locums, physicians and that sort of thing. But as I think we step back and look at it, I don't know that there's anything on sort of the cost landscape that we would describe or think about as a huge discrete threat. Rather, it's always the challenge that as the business grows, you want to just make sure that you remain efficient. And I think our operators have been doing that for the last 1.5 years or so, have been doing a very good job of that."

I think we believe that, that process is definitely an evolutionary process. It is one that will take multiple years. Honestly, the vast majority of our reimbursement remains fee-for-service reimbursement, although in some cases like in Medicare, there are quality components and elements of that, but it still largely remains fee-for-service reimbursement. What we're doing are a number of things, both in terms of our relationship with our physicians and really trying to integrate with our physicians, particularly on the information technology side, to prepare for that move to kind of more of a risk shifting environment with bundled payments and capitation, et cetera. We've talked, I think, at some length over the last few quarters about some of the initiatives surrounding the purchase in the middle of last year of a health insurance company in Nevada to better prepare us, again, for that sort of risk taking to allow us in certain selected markets and with certain selected products to go out there and have a provider-sponsored product in certain of our markets. So we're trying to move at just the right pace in our markets, not trying to get ahead of the curve, but also absolutely ensuring that we are nowhere behind the curve in terms of these changes that we know are coming in, certainly, at least the acute care space."

So we're competing for assets with a number of other providers. I do think there still are a lot of other providers out there to be acquired. Also, we have talked a number of times about the opportunity for the 50% of beds or so or half of the days or admissions in the behavioral business that are currently serviced within acute care hospitals. So that's behavioral beds within acute care hospitals. Some of the growth, for instance, of beds that I mentioned in my opening remarks are beds at acute care hospitals, nonaffiliated acute care hospitals, that we have opened in connection with newly sort of formed partnerships with acute care hospitals and we still think that's a significant opportunity in the future. Now to be fair, those opportunities are relatively bite-sized. We will get 30 beds at a time or 50 or 70 beds at a time. We're not going to get thousands and thousands of beds at a single stroke. But the ultimate opportunity, I think, is enormous and as far and away the largest provider of freestanding behavioral services in the country, I think we're very well positioned to take advantage of that."

Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015.
During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in those forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of this section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015.
We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.
As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.80 for the quarter. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health record applications at our acute care hospitals as disclosed on the Supplemental Schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased approximately 20% to $186.6 million or $1.85 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2015, as compared to $155.6 million or $1.55 per diluted share during the second quarter of last year.
On a same-facility basis in our acute division, revenues during the second quarter of 2015 increased 8.4% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 5.7% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year, and a 3.2% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. 
On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 19.8% during the second quarter of 2015 from 18.7% during the second quarter of 2014.
On a same-facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 5.1% during the second quarter of 2015 as compared to the second quarter of 2014. During this year second quarter as compared to last year's adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased to 4.2% and adjusted patient days increased 0.6%.
Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 4.1% during the second quarter of 2015 over the comparable prior-year quarter.
Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 28.5% and 28.4% during the quarters ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
For the 6 months ended June 30, 2015, our cash provided by operating activities increased approximately 16% [ph] to $532 million over the $458 million generated during the comparable 6-month period of 2014. Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased slightly to 54 days during the second quarter of 2015, as compared to 53 days during the second quarter of 2014. 
At June 30, 2015, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization decreased to 42.8% as compared to 47.0% at June 30, 2014. We spent $81 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2015 and $171 million during the first six months of 2015.
Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first six months of 2015, we are increasing our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2015, to $6.75 to $7.15 per diluted share. This revised guidance, which excludes the expected electronic health records impact for the year represents an increase of approximately 9% to 10% from the previously provided range of $6.15 to $6.55 per diluted share. This guidance range, which is subject to certain conditions including those set forth on last night's earnings release, also excludes the impact of future items if applicable that are nonrecurring or nonoperational in nature including items such as, but not limited to: Gains on sales on assets of businesses; cost related to extinguishment of debt; reserves for settlement, legal judgments and losses; impairments of long-lived assets; impact of share repurchases and other material amounts that may be reflected in our financial statements that relate to prior periods.
We would be pleased to answer your questions at this time."

So the 3 plus-percent increase in revenue per adjusted admission was somewhat lower than we ran in the first quarter, but still very much within our expectations. I think it continues to be driven mostly by an improved payer mix, less uninsured patients. Clearly our total uncompensated care declined for the quarter as it has for the last 6 quarters now. But we're also, I think in the second quarter had a pretty difficult comparison with the second quarter of last year. So we were getting -- we were pleased with that 3-plus-percent revenue per unit growth. A lot of it being driven by increased government business, Medicaid -- more Medicaid patients as a result of the continued Medicaid expansion in those states that are participating, and also an increase Medicare utilization, which we reported as well in the first quarter of last year. Not sure I have a terribly insightful explanation for that, but some of the managed-care companies reported a similar dynamic. But we definitely saw increase Medicare compensation in a factor as well. So all of those factors contributed to the revenue per unit growth."

So I think to some degree, we have the view is going to be sustain that level of growth. We obviously will work hard to do so and are focused on doing it. But I think to be realistic about it and I think the way that we crafted our by guidance for the balance of the year, we presume that, that growth slows some. And I was speaking with somebody last night and made the point that look, if we think acute same-store revenue growth is 3% or 3.5% in the back half of the year, if you would ask us about a year ago or I think ask just about anybody observing the acute care business, would've been pleased that sort of growth. I think we're looking for that volume growth to moderate some in the back half of the year. Although we will certainly work hard to maintain what we've experienced in the first half."

So I would sort of echo many of the statements that we made in Q1, which is we still see length of stay declining some, although we also believe that some of that decline is kind of self-imposed or self-initiated as we convert more beds from residential to acute. So -- which I think is reflected in the fact that even though we have lower length of stay and lower patient days, we have a higher revenue per day. The 4-plus-percent revenue per day growth is I think among the best that we've seen in some time, and again, I think is reflective of our efforts to convert from residential to acute beds."

I think your comment is well taken in the sense that I think when you have almost 6% same-store adjusted admission growth and over 8% same-store revenue growth in the acute division, you're basically, I think I have to assume and I think will be correct to assume, that there's pretty strong performance across the portfolio. It would be difficult if there were to post those kind of numbers. On the other hand, what we did in Q1 was we called out the performance of the Vegas market and Riverside County market in California. Those 2 markets, again, I would say outperformed the divisional averages in Q2. And that includes sort of to your question that Temecula facility, which has been open for about 1.5 years, maybe a little longer at this point. But I think what's really impressive about that Riverside County market is not only Temecula doing a little bit better than it did last year, probably not a surprises it's ramping up, but our other hospitals in that market are also doing better, so that's a really strong market in addition to the Vegas market, which continues to outperform and I think that's also within our expectations to the sense that through several years of the recession, we talked about the drag from the Vegas market was for us. We were so used to it being an outperforming market that the difficulties and the high unemployment of that market was a real struggle for us. But as the market has improved and as unemployment has dropped in the Las Vegas market from like 6.5% from the high 15% at the height of the recession, I think our business has in turn improved both volume-wise and payer mix wise and so we see that. The flip side is the Texas market was a little bit slower. I can, I think that's a relative term, it's the low. As positive volume growth, but in terms of OR, or different geographies, it's probably performing under the average whereas Vegas and California were performing over the average."

And maybe just switching gears for a follow-up on this site business side. Since the first quarter, there's been this proposed rule at CMS mainly the Medicaid managed care, but it does incorporate some language around partially alleviating the IMD inclusion that's impacted your site business. Can you give us a little flavor of what the impact of that would be if it goes ahead and gets implemented? And any thoughts on timing on when we might see that actually happen?"

Well as you suggest, that was issued, I believe, at the beginning -- sort of early June, if I'm remembering correctly. And as a consequence, CMS can't issue a finalized rule until early August and then that's sort of the earliest they can do, if they can certainly do it after that. What the rule will do and I think it was pressed for quite frankly by the managed Medicaid companies, is it would allow those companies to contract with whoever they chose based on certain conditions, but they would be able to contract for adult Medicaid patients regardless of the IMD exclusion rule. So we certainly believe that if that rule is finalized in anything close to the form that it was proposed and depending on when it is effective, we will certainly get a benefit from that. Difficult for us to quantify what that benefit is because we've never had those patients really before. So it's mostly guesstimate work at this point. But we're certainly looking forward to the final rule being issued and starting to contract with those managed Medicaid companies for their adult Medicaid patients. We view that as a nice potential tailwind for where this business. So we're anxiously awaiting for the issuance of this rule."

We have what we call our Patriot Support program, and that is a program that is fairly widespread throughout the division. So in terms of service lines, I think we touch on most of them and continue to look for ways to expand them. Autism is another one that we've clearly emphasized more in the last few years.

I mean, and I suspect my answer will still be on satisfaction for you Chris, in the sense that I think what we've be said for a while is we assume that the growth in our Medicaid patient base utilization is related at least in large part to Medicaid expansion. We see it quite clearly, most dramatically in those states, Nevada, California, the District of Columbia, that have participated in Medicaid expansion. Although as others have noted, we've seen Medicaid utilization increases in our nonexpansion states as well. I guess the most people refer to that as the woodwork effect. And we certainly have seen that as well. Some of the commercial growth clearly comes from expansion patients. That's the trickiest part for us. It has not always been easy for us to identify exactly who is a commercial-exchange patient and who is just a regular commercial patient. So that's where I think wv always felt was the greatest level of imprecision. And then as I said in the last couple of quarters, we've clearly seen an increase in our Medicare utilization, which is difficult for us, quite frankly, to attribute either to the ACA impact or quite frankly to economic improvement only because historically, our Medicare utilization has been relatively insensitive to that, those sort of factors.

I would say at the end of the day, we acquired a company that had roughly $170 million $180 million of revenues, and $40 million of EBITDA, something like that. So it's not a terribly material part of our behavioral business or consolidated results at the moment, but we also viewed it as a platform for growth. We've already, in the short time we've owned them, announced small acquisition and a number of bed expansion opportunities, both kind of de novo facilities as well as incremental bed expansions in existing facilities.

And not to be repetitive, but I think we struggled ourselves with exactly what is driving the improvement. I would say again, what makes us confident about raising guidance after the first half of the year is simply the acute care performance, which clearly was an outperformance in the first half, it's really based on the strong revenue growth. And I think that strong revenue growth is particularly driven by this 5.7% increase in adjusted admissions, which honestly is well above what we were guiding to and what we were budgeting for when the year began. And as I sort of suggested to my answer to Paula, I think that's the sort of trickiest variable from our perspective as we think about the back half of the year. We certainly believe that acute care demand will continue. It will be strong whether it would be quite as strong as the 5.7% again I'm going to make the point is really at the high end of our historical trends, not just us as a company, but as an industry. Whether that can continue, I'm not and again, we've tempered a little bit in our guidance. But I think that's what's really driving the confidence here is that the strong, very consistent performance in the first half of the year, and especially in Q2 when I think the comparisons were far more difficult."

So we always look at our Medicare and Medicaid blocks of business in total and we look at them as both the managed portion and the traditional portion, in part because they certainly owe a continuing shift of patients from the traditional Medicaid and Medicare programs to the managed Medicare and Medicaid programs. So if I were to answer the question directly like that, I would say no. Clearly, the increase in Medicare utilization is coming from an increase in Medicare advantage patients. But I don't know that, that's all that meaningful because clearly, there are just more Medicare Advantage patients today than there were a year ago or 2 years ago, whatever. But overall, we're seeing a more total Medicare and total Medicaid patient that to me is the more meaningful dynamic. In terms of who those patients are and what's driving them, as we review our service lines, as we review our surgical alliance, et cetera, we see strength really across the board, orthopedics, cardiology, oncology, and all the service lines that are traditional sort of Medicare intensive service lines. So I wouldn't point to a particular procedure or diagnosis, et cetera that's really driving this strength. I think it's pretty much across the board."

We have seen in an earlier question or in response to an earlier question, I said that our Texas markets have performed a little bit more modestly than some of our other markets, like Vegas and California. So I don't know if that's the economic impact of a slightly slowing economy. Honestly, Texas is a big state and we're only in a handful of markets in this state. So I don't know whether our performance of our experience is necessary reflective of what's going on more broadly. But for us at least Texas has slowed a little bit.

And I think one of the things in the industry will point out is that it may not necessarily be or the most appropriate way to look at this may not simply be on the service line business, that I think when an insurer in a market gets increased commercialized and increased Medicare lives at the same time that increases their market power in the market, even though there might be 2 different service lines. So I think the industry as a whole will make those points as the government reviews these transactions. And I certainly am not smart enough to know how that's going to play out. I think for us, individually, we tend to look at these things very much in a market-by-market basis. We have spent and have focused a lot of our internal efforts over the last decade or 2 at enhancing and increasing our market positions in all of our markets, both acute and behavioral care. Not that we necessarily had a view that this is there with insurance industry would sort out, but we had a view that, look, we would need as much market power as possible to deal with payers of every stripe, government or private payers. So I think in general we're fairly comfortable with the market positions and market share percentages that we have in most of our markets. So in a very specific UHS sense, I don't know that we have any grave concerns about this payear consolidation dynamic. But I think as a provider, generally, we think that the payer consolidation will provide some limits and some restrictions on consumer choice and consumer cost, et cetera."

We think that's a very important strategy. We'll continue to do that.

For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in those forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015.
We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.
As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.80 for the quarter. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health record applications at our acute care hospitals, as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased approximately 20% to $186.6 million or $1.85 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2015 as compared to $155.6 million or $1.55 per diluted share during the second quarter of last year.
On a same-facility basis in our acute division, revenues during the second quarter of 2015 increased 8.4% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 5.7% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 3.2% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 19.8% during the second quarter of 2015 from 18.7% during the second quarter of 2014.
On a same-facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 5.1% during the second quarter of 2015 as compared to the second quarter of 2014. During this year's second quarter as compared to last year, adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased to 4.2% and adjusted patient days increased 0.6%. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 4.1% during the second quarter of 2015 over the comparable prior year quarter.
Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 28.5% and 28.4% during the quarters ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
For the 6 months ended June 30, 2015, our cash provided by operating activities increased approximately 16% to $532 million over the $458 million generated during the comparable 6-month period of 2014. Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased slightly to 54 days during the second quarter of 2015 as compared to 53 days during the second quarter of 2014.
At June 30, 2015, our ratio of debt to total capitalization decreased to 42.8% as compared to 47.0% at June 30, 2014. We spent $81 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2015 and $171 million during the first six months of 2015.
Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first 6 months of 2015, we are increasing our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2015, to $6.75 to $7.15 per diluted share. This revised guidance, which excludes the expected electronic health records impact for the year, represents an increase of approximately 9% to 10% from the previously provided range of $6.15 to $6.55 per diluted share. This guidance range, which is subject to certain conditions including those set forth in last night's earnings release, also excludes the impact of future items, if applicable, that are nonrecurring or nonoperational in nature including items such as, but not limited to: gains on sales of assets and businesses; cost related to extinguishment of debt; reserves for settlements; legal judgments and law suits; impairments of long-lived assets; impact of share repurchases; and other material amounts that may be reflected in our financial statements that relate to prior periods.

So the 3-plus percent increase in revenue per adjusted admission was somewhat lower than we ran in the first quarter but still very much within our expectations. I think it continues to be driven mostly by an improved payer mix, less uninsured patients. Clearly, our total uncompensated care declined for the quarter as it has for the last 6 quarters now, but we also, I think, in the second quarter had a pretty difficult comparison with the second quarter of last year. So we're -- again, we're pleased with that 3-plus percent revenue per unit growth. A lot of it being driven by increased government business, Medicaid -- more Medicaid patients as a result of the continued Medicaid expansion in those states that are participating and also increased Medicare utilization, which we reported as well in the first quarter of last year. Not sure I have a terribly insightful explanation for that, but I know that some of the managed care companies have reported a similar dynamic, but we definitely saw increased Medicare utilization in the quarter as well. So all of those factors, I think, contributed to the acute care revenue per unit growth."

So I would sort of echo many of the statements that we made in Q1, which is we still see length of stay declining some, although we also believe that some of that decline is kind of self-imposed or self-initiated as we convert more beds from residential to acute. So -- and which I think is reflected in the fact that even though we have lower length of stay and lower patient days, we have a higher revenue per day. The 4-plus percent revenue per day growth is, I think, among the best that we've seen in some time and again, I think, is reflective of our efforts to convert from residential to acute beds."

So I think your comment is well taken in the sense that I think when you have almost 6% same-store adjusted admission growth and over 8% same-store revenue growth in the acute division, you're basically -- I think I have to assume, and I think it will be correct to assume that there's pretty strong performance across the portfolio. It'd be difficult if there weren't to post those kind of numbers. On the other hand, what we did in Q1 was we called out the performance of the Vegas market and the Riverside County market in California. Those 2 markets again, I would say, outperformed the divisional averages in Q2. And that includes sort of, to your question, that Temecula facility which has been open for about 1.5 years, maybe a little longer at this point. But I think what's really impressive about that Riverside County market is not only Temecula is doing quite a bit better than it did last year, probably not a surprise, and so we're just ramping up, but our other hospitals in that market are also doing better. So that's a really strong market in addition to the Vegas market, which continues to outperform. And I think that's also within our expectations in the sense that through several years of the recession, we talked about what a drag the Vegas market was for us. It was -- we were so used to it being an outperforming market that the difficulties and the high unemployment in that market were a real struggle for us. But as the market has improved and as unemployment has dropped in the Las Vegas market to like 6.5% from the high 15% at the height of the recession, I think our business has in turn improved both volume-wise and payer mix-wise, and so we see that. The flip side is, I think, the Texas market was a little bit slower. Again, I think that's a relative term. It's still up. It still has positive volume growth. But in terms of our different geographies, it's probably performing under the average, whereas Vegas and California are performing over the average."

And as a consequence, CMS can't issue a finalized rule until early August and has -- that's sort of the earliest they could do it. They can certainly do it after that. What the rule would do, and I think it was pressed for, quite frankly, by the managed Medicaid companies, is it would allow those companies to contract with whoever they chose based on certain conditions, but they would be able to contract for adult Medicaid patients regardless of the IMD exclusion rule. So we certainly believe that if that rule is finalized in anything close to the form that it was proposed, and depending on when it is effective, we will certainly get a benefit from that. Difficult for us to quantify what that benefit is because we've never had those patients really before. So it's mostly guesstimate work at this point, but we're certainly looking forward to the final rule being issued and starting to contract with those managed Medicaid companies for their adult Medicaid patients. We view that as a nice potential tailwind for this business. So we're anxiously awaiting the issuance of the rule."

I mean -- and I suspect my answer will still be unsatisfactory for you, Chris, in the sense that -- I think what we have said for a while is that look, we assume that the growth in our Medicaid patient base and utilization is related at least, in large part, to Medicaid expansion. We see it quite clearly most dramatically in those states, Nevada, California, the District of Columbia, that have participated in Medicaid expansion. Although as others have noted, we have seen Medicaid utilization increases in our nonexpansion states as well. I guess, most people refer to that as the woodwork effect, and we certainly have seen that as well. Some of the commercial growth clearly comes from expansion patients. That's the trickiest part for us. It has not always been easy for us to identify exactly who is a commercial exchange patient and who is just a regular commercial patient. So that's where I think we have always felt was the greatest level of imprecision. And then as I said in the last couple of quarters, we have clearly seen an increase in our Medicare utilization, which is difficult for us, quite frankly, to attribute either to the ACA impact or, quite frankly, to economic improvement only because historically, our Medicare utilization has been relatively insensitive to that -- those sort of factors. But that's kind of where we have seen our payer mix go."

We've been extremely pleased because I think they're now operating at close to 90%. And so while we didn't think there was a tremendous opportunity for improvement. Based on our short period of ownership, that's already experienced some fairly significant incremental improvement that has been very beneficial. I will say that -- look, at the end of the day, we acquired a company that had a roughly $170 million, $180 million of revenues and $40 million of EBITDA, something like that. So it's not a terribly material part of our behavioral business or certainly of our consolidated results at the moment, but we also viewed it as a platform for growth. We have already, in the short time we've owned them, announced small acquisition and a number of bed expansion opportunities, both kind of de novo facilities as well as incremental bed expansions in existing facilities. So I think it is turning out to be everything that we expected it would be and maybe more. And the hope is that it continues to be a platform for growth in the future and that we will continue to expand both the existing facilities as well as find other opportunities to acquire streams of EBITDA in that market."

I would say again, what makes us confident about raising guidance after the first half of the year is simply the acute care performance, which clearly was an outperformance in the first half, it's really based on the strong revenue growth. And I think that strong revenue growth is really driven by this 5.7% increase in adjusted admissions, which honestly, is well above what we were guiding to and what we were budgeting for when the year began. And as I sort of suggested in my answer to Paula, I think that's the sort of trickiest variable from our perspective as we think about the back half of the year. We certainly believe that our acute care demand will continue. It will be strong. Whether it will be quite as strong as the 5.7%, which again, I'm going to make the point, it's really at the very high end of our historical trends, not just us as a company, but us as an industry.

But I don't know that, that's all that meaningful because clearly, there are just more Medicare Advantage patients today than there were a year ago or 2 years ago, whatever. But the overall -- we're seeing more total Medicare and total Medicaid patients, that to me is the meaningful dynamic. In terms of who those patients are and what's driving them, as we review our service lines, as we review our surgical lines, et cetera, we see strength really across the board: orthopedics, cardiology, oncology, and all the service lines that are traditional sort of Medicare-intensive service lines.

And I think one of the things the industry will point out is that it may not necessarily be -- the most appropriate way to look at this may not simply be on a service line business that, I think, when an insurer in a market gets increased commercial lives and increased Medicare lives at the same time, that increases their market power in the market, even though there might be 2 different service lines. So I think the industry as a whole will make those points as the government reviews these transactions. And I certainly am not smart enough to know how that's going to play out. I think for us, individually, we tend to look at these things very much on a market-by-market basis. We have spent and have focused a lot of our internal efforts over the last decade or 2 at enhancing and increasing our market positions in all of our markets, both acute and behavioral care. Not that we necessarily had a view that this is the way the insurance industry would sort out, but we had a view that -- look, we would need as much market power as possible to deal with payers of every stripe, both government or private payers. And so I think in general, we're fairly comfortable with the market positions and market share percentages that we have in most of our markets.

There are other markets like Las Vegas where in general, the market has not seen a lot of physician employment for a variety of reasons. So we'll see. I mean, we continue to do what we think is the most appropriate competitive thing in every market. We definitely have a view that physician integration is going to be more and more important as time goes on, and we certainly are doing what we can in that regard. In some cases employing physicians; in many cases, working with physicians to integrate our information technologies. We think that's a very important strategy. We'll continue to do that, but we'll also continue to be judicious about it because at the end of the day, we think that most hospitals lose money on owned-physician practices.

Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services' results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015.
During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in those forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015.
We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.
As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.80 for the quarter. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health record applications at our acute care hospitals, as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased approximately 20% to $186.6 million or $1.85 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2015 as compared to $155.6 million or $1.55 per diluted share during the second quarter of last year.
On a same-facility basis in our acute division, revenues during the second quarter of 2015 increased 8.4% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 5.7% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 3.2% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 19.8% during the second quarter of 2015 from 18.7% during the second quarter of 2014.
On a same-facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 5.1% during the second quarter of 2015 as compared to the second quarter of 2014. During this year's second quarter as compared to last year, adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased to 4.2% and adjusted patient days increased 0.6%. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 4.1% during the second quarter of 2015 over the comparable prior year quarter.
Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 28.5% and 28.4% during the quarters ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
For the 6 months ended June 30, 2015, our cash provided by operating activities increased approximately 16% to $532 million over the $458 million generated during the comparable 6-month period of 2014. Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased slightly to 54 days during the second quarter of 2015 as compared to 53 days during the second quarter of 2014.
At June 30, 2015, our ratio of debt to total capitalization decreased to 42.8% as compared to 47.0% at June 30, 2014. We spent $81 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2015 and $171 million during the first six months of 2015.
Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first 6 months of 2015, we are increasing our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2015, to $6.75 to $7.15 per diluted share. This revised guidance, which excludes the expected electronic health records impact for the year, represents an increase of approximately 9% to 10% from the previously provided range of $6.15 to $6.55 per diluted share. This guidance range, which is subject to certain conditions including those set forth in last night's earnings release, also excludes the impact of future items, if applicable, that are nonrecurring or nonoperational in nature including items such as, but not limited to: gains on sales of assets and businesses; cost related to extinguishment of debt; reserves for settlements; legal judgments and law suits; impairments of long-lived assets; impact of share repurchases; and other material amounts that may be reflected in our financial statements that relate to prior periods.
We would be pleased to answer your questions at this time."

So the 3-plus percent increase in revenue per adjusted admission was somewhat lower than we ran in the first quarter but still very much within our expectations. I think it continues to be driven mostly by an improved payer mix, less uninsured patients. Clearly, our total uncompensated care declined for the quarter as it has for the last 6 quarters now, but we also, I think, in the second quarter had a pretty difficult comparison with the second quarter of last year. So we're -- again, we're pleased with that 3-plus percent revenue per unit growth. A lot of it being driven by increased government business, Medicaid -- more Medicaid patients as a result of the continued Medicaid expansion in those states that are participating and also increased Medicare utilization, which we reported as well in the first quarter of last year. Not sure I have a terribly insightful explanation for that, but I know that some of the managed care companies have reported a similar dynamic, but we definitely saw increased Medicare utilization in the quarter as well. So all of those factors, I think, contributed to the acute care revenue per unit growth."

But I think to be realistic about it and I think in the way that we crafted our by guidance for the balance of the year, we presume that, that growth slows some. And I was speaking with somebody last night and made the point that -- look, if we think acute care same-store revenue growth is 3% or 3.5% in the back half of the year, if you would ask us that a year ago or I think ask just about anybody observing the acute care business, they would have been pleased with that sort of growth.

So I would sort of echo many of the statements that we made in Q1, which is we still see length of stay declining some, although we also believe that some of that decline is kind of self-imposed or self-initiated as we convert more beds from residential to acute. So -- and which I think is reflected in the fact that even though we have lower length of stay and lower patient days, we have a higher revenue per day. The 4-plus percent revenue per day growth is, I think, among the best that we've seen in some time and again, I think, is reflective of our efforts to convert from residential to acute beds."

So I think your comment is well taken in the sense that I think when you have almost 6% same-store adjusted admission growth and over 8% same-store revenue growth in the acute division, you're basically -- I think have to assume, and I think it will be correct to assume that there's pretty strong performance across the portfolio. It'd be difficult if there weren't to post those kind of numbers. On the other hand, what we did in Q1 was we called out the performance of the Vegas market and the Riverside County market in California. Those 2 markets again, I would say, outperformed the divisional averages in Q2. And that includes sort of, to your question, the Temecula facility which has been open for about 1.5 years, maybe a little longer at this point. But I think what's really impressive about that Riverside County market is not only Temecula is doing quite a bit better than it did last year, probably not a surprise, and so we're just ramping up, but our other hospitals in that market are also doing better. So that's a really strong market in addition to the Vegas market, which continues to outperform. And I think that's also within our expectations in the sense that through several years of the recession, we talked about what a drag the Vegas market was for us. It was -- we were so used to it being an outperforming market that the difficulties and the high unemployment in that market were a real struggle for us. But as the market has improved and as unemployment has dropped in the Las Vegas market to like 6.5% from the high of 15% at the height of the recession, I think our business has in turn improved both volume-wise and payer mix-wise, and so we see that. The flip side is, I think, the Texas market was a little bit slower. Again, I think that's a relative term. It's still up. It still has positive volume growth. But in terms of our different geographies, it's probably performing under the average, whereas Vegas and California are performing over the average."

And as a consequence, CMS can't issue a finalized rule until early August and has -- that's sort of the earliest they could do it. They can certainly do it after that. What the rule would do, and I think it was pressed for, quite frankly, by the managed Medicaid companies, is it would allow those companies to contract with whoever they chose based on certain conditions, but they would be able to contract for adult Medicaid patients regardless of the IMD exclusion rule. So we certainly believe that if that rule is finalized in anything close to the form that it was proposed, and depending on when it is effective, we will certainly get a benefit from that. Difficult for us to quantify what that benefit is because we've never had those patients really before. So it's mostly guesstimate work at this point, but we're certainly looking forward to the final rule being issued and starting to contract with those managed Medicaid companies for their adult Medicaid patients. We view that as a nice potential tailwind for this business. So we're anxiously awaiting the issuance of the rule."

I mean -- and I suspect my answer will still be unsatisfactory for you, Chris, in the sense that -- I think what we have said for a while is that look, we assume that the growth in our Medicaid patient base and utilization is related at least, in large part, to Medicaid expansion. We see it quite clearly most dramatically in those states, Nevada, California, the District of Columbia, that have participated in Medicaid expansion. Although as others have noted, we have seen Medicaid utilization increases in our nonexpansion states as well. I guess, most people refer to that as the woodwork effect, and we certainly have seen that as well. Some of the commercial growth clearly comes from expansion patients. That's the trickiest part for us. It has not always been easy for us to identify exactly who is a commercial exchange patient and who is just a regular commercial patient. So that's where I think we have always felt was the greatest level of imprecision. And then as I said in the last couple of quarters, we have clearly seen an increase in our Medicare utilization, which is difficult for us, quite frankly, to attribute either to the ACA impact or, quite frankly, to economic improvement only because historically, our Medicare utilization has been relatively insensitive to that -- those sort of factors.

We've been extremely pleased because I think they're now operating at close to 90%. And so while we didn't think there was a tremendous opportunity for improvement. Based on our short period of ownership, have already experienced some fairly significant incremental improvement that has been very beneficial. I will say that -- look, at the end of the day, we acquired a company that had a roughly $170 million, $180 million of revenues and $40 million of EBITDA, something like that. So it's not a terribly material part of our behavioral business or certainly of our consolidated results at the moment, but we also viewed it as a platform for growth. We have already, in the short time we've owned them, announced small acquisition and a number of bed expansion opportunities, both kind of de novo facilities as well as incremental bed expansions in existing facilities. So I think it is turning out to be everything that we expected it would be and maybe more. And the hope is that it continues to be a platform for growth in the future and that we will continue to expand both the existing facilities as well as find other opportunities to acquire streams of EBITDA in that market."

And not to be repetitive, but I think we struggle ourselves with exactly what is driving the improvement. I would say again, what makes us confident about raising guidance after the first half of the year is simply the acute care performance, which clearly was an outperformance in the first half, it's really based on the strong revenue growth. And I think that strong revenue growth is really driven by this 5.7% increase in adjusted admissions, which honestly, is well above what we were guiding to and what we were budgeting for when the year began. And as I sort of suggested in my answer to Paula, I think that's the sort of trickiest variable from our perspective as we think about the back half of the year. We certainly believe that our acute care demand will continue. It will be strong. Whether it will be quite as strong as the 5.7%, which again, I'm going to make the point, is really at the very high end of our historical trends, not just us as a company, but us as an industry. Whether that can continue, I'm not clear, and again, we've tempered a little bit in our guidance. But I think that's what's really driving the confidence here is that strong, very consistent performance in the first half of the year and especially in Q2 when I think the comparisons were far more difficult."

So if I were to answer the question directly like that, I would say no. Clearly, the increase in Medicare utilization is coming from an increase in Medicare Advantage patients. But I don't know that, that's all that meaningful because clearly, there are just more Medicare Advantage patients today than there were a year ago or 2 years ago, whatever. But the overall -- we're seeing more total Medicare and total Medicaid patients, that to me is the meaningful dynamic. In terms of who those patients are and what's driving them, as we review our service lines, as we review our surgical lines, et cetera, we see strength really across the board: orthopedics, cardiology, oncology, and all the service lines that are traditional sort of Medicare-intensive service lines.

I think first of all, I think the industry, the provider industry, broadly will, I think, raise questions about the lack of competitiveness or diminution in competitiveness that these transactions might drive. And I think one of the things the industry will point out is that it may not necessarily be -- the most appropriate way to look at this may not simply be on a service line business that, I think, when an insurer in a market gets increased commercial lives and increased Medicare lives at the same time, that increases their market power in the market, even though they might be 2 different service lines. So I think the industry as a whole will make those points as the government reviews these transactions. And I certainly am not smart enough to know how that's going to play out. I think for us, individually, we tend to look at these things very much on a market-by-market basis. We have spent and have focused a lot of our internal efforts over the last decade or 2 at enhancing and increasing our market positions in all of our markets, both acute and behavioral care. Not that we necessarily had a view that this is the way the insurance industry would sort out, but we had a view that -- look, we would need as much market power as possible to deal with payers of every stripe, both government and private payers. And so I think in general, we're fairly comfortable with the market positions and market share percentages that we have in most of our markets. So in a very specific UHS sense, I don't know that we have any grave concerns about this payer consolidation dynamic.

I mean, I don't think UHS sort of emphasizes it as we talk about the business as much as some of our peers, but it doesn't mean that we have not employed physicians. I think we view physician employment the way we view a lot of our market strategies and market development and business development strategies in that they are very market-specific. So there are some markets in which we have a significant amount of physician employment. McAllen is one. Texoma is another. There are other markets like Las Vegas where in general, the market has not seen a lot of physician employment for a variety of reasons. So we'll see. I mean, we continue to do what we think is the most appropriate competitive thing in every market. We definitely have a view that physician integration is going to be more and more important as time goes on, and we certainly are doing what we can in that regard. In some cases employing physicians; in many cases, working with physicians to integrate our information technologies. We think that's a very important strategy. We'll continue to do that, but we'll also continue to be judicious about it because at the end of the day, we think that most hospitals lose money on owned-physician practices. And obviously, that's an end result that if we can avoid, we'd prefer to avoid."

Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015. 
During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. 
For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2015.
We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.
As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS of $1.48 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2015. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with implementation of electronic health record applications at our acute care hospitals, as well as the other items attributable to last year's third quarter as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased approximately 13% to $155.3 million or $1.53 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to $137.5 million or $1.36 per diluted share during the third quarter of last year.
On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, revenues during the third quarter of 2015 increased 7.2% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 5.1% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. 
On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute hospitals decreased to 15.4% during the third quarter of 2015 from 17.1% during the third quarter of 2014.
As expected, net revenue growth slowed in the third quarter from the unprecedented levels we have been experiencing in the first half of the year. Surgical volumes moderated a bit and uncompensated care volumes ticked up as well. At the same time, there was a measurable increase in nursing cost all contributing to the margin declines.
On a same-facility basis, net revenues on our behavioral health division increased 5% during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to the third quarter of 2014.
During this year's third quarter as compared to last year's, adjusted admissions and adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year each increased 1.6%. 
Revenue per adjusted admission and adjusted patient day each rose 3.1% during the third quarter of 2015 over the comparable prior year quarter.
Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 27.5% and 27.6% during the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 respectively.
For the 9 months ended September 30, 2015, our net cash provided by operating activities increased approximately 16% [ph] to $796 million over the $690 million generated during the comparable 9-month period of 2014.
Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased slightly to 55 days during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to 56 days during the third quarter of 2014.
At September 30, 2015, our ratio of debt to total capitalization decreased to 42.8% as compared to 48.9% at September 30, 2014.
We spent $99 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2015 and $270 [ph] million during the first 9 months of 2015.
In connection with our previously announced $400 million stock repurchase program, we repurchased 543,380 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $72 million during the third quarter of this year. Since inception of the program through September 30, 2015, we have repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $166 million and had a remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $234 million as of the end of the third quarter.
In August 2015 we acquired 4 behavioral health facilities with 305 beds located in the U.K. This acquisition increases our behavioral health presence in the U.K. to 21 facilities consisting of approximately 1,100 beds. 
In October 2015, we completed the acquisition of Foundations Recovery Network. Through this acquisition, we have added 4 inpatient facilities consisting of 322 beds as well as 8 outpatient centers. In addition, there are over 140 expansion beds in progress for Foundation as well.
Foundation is one of the premier names in addiction treatment is focused on treating adults with co-occurring addiction and mental health disorders through an evidenced-based integrated treatment model in residential and outpatient settings. 
Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first 9 months of 2015, we're revising our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $6.75 to $7.05 per diluted share. This revised guidance, which excludes the expected electronic health records impact for the year maintains the lower end of the previously provided range of $6.75 to $7.15 per diluted share and decreases the upper end of the range by approximately 1%. 
Alan and I are pleased to answer your questions at this time."

Just from an order of magnitude, I think the impact of the increase in temporary nurse cost was similar to the uncompensated care impact that is in the neighborhood of 50 basis points. Obviously, it is a trend that has been mentioned by a number of our peers as well, which is not necessarily something we were aware of during the quarter. I think from our perspective, we continue to have and generate very substantial acute care demand as reflected in our growing admissions, very helpfully growing admissions. And as a result, that is contributing to a need for more employees, particularly nurses. And honestly, I think we're just not filling those positions as quickly and as efficiently and expeditiously as we would hope. To some degree, I think we probably underestimated the need for new nurses as demand has remained as strong as it has. As we look forward and project sort of solving this issue or solving the problem, I think we view it as definitely a fixable problem and one that we will address in the fourth quarter and begin to make progress in the fourth quarter and certainly begin to really solve the issue by the beginning of next year as we fill those vacant positions. The feedback that I get from our hospitals when we talk to them is that they can fill those positions. They're sort of redoubling their efforts to do so. So we're fairly confident that we'll address that issue in the near future."

Obviously, we're talking about 330 beds out of a total of 20,000. But I think we think that the foundation acquisition very nicely complements our existing addiction businesses. We probably have 8 or 9 dedicated addiction facilities in our portfolio today, as well as the fact that we offer addiction services in many of our other behavioral  facilities as well. And we think that the foundations model, as well as the foundations model in terms of patient treatment as well as their model for patient capture is one that we'll have relevance for us throughout our other addiction businesses. And quite frankly, in some of our other lines of business as well, things like eating disorders, et cetera. So 140 beds that are in the Q for Foundations are both additions to existing facilities as well as some de novo development. I think they're all likely to be completed within the 12-month cycle and we continue to look for other opportunities to expand that business as well as other elements of our behavioral business."

So I think the acute care volume growth, we talked a little bit about this in general in the first half of the year saying that the strongest performing markets were Las Vegas, Nevada and Southern California. And as I mentioned before, I think our Texas markets and particularly South Texas markets have lagged a little bit over the last few quarters. And I think all those same trends were present in Q3 as well. In terms of the revised guidance and how that acute care growth fits into that, again we revised that guidance at the end of the second quarter. We talked about the fact that the first half of the year, acute care revenue growth of 10% was unlikely to be sustainable. It was sort of unprecedented in the history, not only of the company, but of the acute care industry. And we thought that revenues in the back half of the year and frankly going forward would likely moderate to levels more like 6.5%, 7%. And that's certainly what happened in Q3. And I think our revised guidance, taking off the very top end of the guidance, was simply an acknowledgment that those acute care revenues had moderated and would likely continue to do so in that I think we had said to get to the high end of that range, we have to sustain those 10% or so revenue growth levels. And I think the revision at the top end of the range was just an acknowledgment that, that was very unlikely."

There just weren't nurses out there. Didn't matter what we were willing to pay. There was enormous pressure on wages. I will tell you that the current environment just doesn't have the same feel to it. Certainly, this issue of increased use of temporary nurses is not unique to us. Other companies have reported it as well. So it seems to be a bit more systemic issue. But it also, based on the feedback that we're getting from our hospitals, is one that remains fixable.

So you said 50 basis points from the temporary staffing and then another 50 from the uncompensated care costs. So what else was driving -- putting the margins to be under so much pressure given that the top line growth was so strong?"

I think it's worth pointing the comparison, the acute care comparison in context, we ran over 17% margins in the third quarter of 2014. And those margins and the EBITDA that the acute care business generated in the third quarter of 2014 was almost a doubling of what it had run in the previous year. And the 17% margin, I think, was probably the best margin we've ever run in the third quarter in that division. So the comparison was extremely difficult. And even though I think your point is a valid one and well taken, and that is that under normal circumstances, if we generate 7% growth, revenue growth in the acute division, we would expect to have margin expansion. And I believe that's what we will expect in the future. In the third quarter, there were a couple of extenuating circumstances which we have discussed already. But I think it's just that extenuating circumstances as opposed to sort of fundamental changes in the model. I think our general sense is that at these very healthy revenue levels and that's what I think we take away from the quarter as the most important message, we believe that in the future we will be able to generate the margin expansion that we've come to expect at those levels."

I think that commercial volume increase in the third quarter was only like 3% or 4%. Still good but a deceleration from where we've seen.

I think if we're seeing any pressure on physician staffing, I think it tends to be on the behavioral side. We've mentioned this once or twice before. At least in some specific markets, it's been difficult for us to hire the appropriate number of psychiatrists. And that's been a bit of a drag both to the degree that we can -- we don't have sufficient numbers of psychiatrists. We see our volumes pressured a little bit. Behavioral admissions were a little bit soft in Q3. And I think as I look around the portfolio, there were a market or 2 where I would attribute some of that softness to a shortage of physicians. Also to the degree that we're using temporary physicians that pushes our operating expense up in the behavioral division and you'll see that in the Q a little bit. You see the specific pressure on our operating expenses in behavioral, again, around the margins at least. On the acute side, it's a good question exactly why this problem is sort of bubbling up at the moment, Josh. My sense is that to some degree, there has been a bit of a skepticism out in the field that the really strong volumes that we've been generating were going to continue. And I think there's always a bit of hesitancy to hire nurses when you're not sure if volume strength will continue. So I think that may have been. I think there may have been some unnecessary skepticism about the need for those nurses, but I think that's now become clear. Turn over has an increase for us. I know some of our peers have mentioned that. We're constantly trying to drive turn over rates down, and I'm not sure that we're terribly successful in driving them down. But I'd certainly think that they have been stable for us. And then finally, this idea that there is a lot of these alternate care providers, [indiscernible] providers etc. I think in our markets at least, the numbers of those source of providers and the amount of people they're hiring is relatively immaterial. So it doesn't seem to me to be the item that's really driving this."

We're not able to attribute that increase to specifically to commercial exchange patients or subscribers, not being able to make their premium payments. We're not really able to subscribe or ascribe the increase in anything in particular. And I think that our sort of outlook on this is we'll wait and see. We'll try and gather more data as another month or 2 passes and do a better job of trying to figure out what's going on. I realized that there is a lot of pressure on folks all over to try and figure this out immediately. I will say this -- at the end of the day, even with the increase in bad debt and uncompensated care pressure, we generated 7.2% acute care revenue growth in the quarter. And if somebody had asked me a year ago whether I would take that, I would've taken that offer. And in an instant I'll take it again next quarter if presented to me. So I appreciate the fact that there's a lot of focus on this increase in uncompensated care. But I think sometimes, we're looking at the glass in the wrong way.

In the third quarter, we sort of returned back to where we had been the last few year's where outpatient surgeries are growing faster than inpatient, although both continue to grow at a decent pace.

These patients are being treated, for the most part, in existing acute care facilities today. And we have work to do to, I think, communicate with those acute care facilities and see if there is an opportunity. And this is really a market by market effort to cooperate with them. And see if those patients can be treated in sort of a more efficient way, mutually efficient way for both the acute care hospital and for us. We also have to work with the managed Medicaid companies to negotiate rates. I don't view that as a big hurdle, but something that has to be done. So there are a few steps that have to be taken once the rule does become effective. So at the moment, it's certainly impossible to predict what the impact on 2016 might be at this point."

I think the traditional seasonality of the business has been distorted over the last couple of years with the implementation of ACA, with Medicaid expansion in some of our big states, with commercial enrollment, commercial exchange enrollment. With the dynamic in the fourth quarter, people exhausting co-pays and deductibles and having elective procedures done in the fourth quarter and that becoming more of an issue as co-pays and deductibles become a bigger part of the overall landscape. But I think the one sort of constant in all that is the third quarter has sort of traditionally been the weakest quarter. Honestly, when I saw our third quarter results a few weeks ago before anyone else had commented on theirs, I generally thought they were kind of a slightness that I attributed mostly to seasonality. I'm not actually sure having seen what people have said. I really feel like that's a wholly different. I mean, again, we're -- I'm back to the idea of feeling pretty good about a quarter in which we -- lots of our surgeons and physicians are on vacation. Lots of our patients are on vacation. Elective procedures are usually down pretty significantly in the quarter. And we still grew our revenue by over 7%. I'm still feeling pretty good about the fundamental performance of that acute division."

Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services' results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015. 
During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. 
For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2015.
We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.
As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS of $1.48 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2015. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health record applications at our acute care hospitals, as well as the other items attributable to last year's third quarter as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased approximately 13% to $155.3 million or $1.53 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to $137.5 million or $1.36 per diluted share during the third quarter of last year.
On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, revenues during the third quarter of 2015 increased 7.2% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 5.1% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year, and a 3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. 
On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute hospitals decreased to 15.4% during the third quarter of 2015 from 17.1% during the third quarter of 2014.
As expected, net revenue growth slowed in the third quarter from the unprecedented levels we have been experiencing in the first half of the year. Surgical volumes moderated a bit and uncompensated care volumes ticked [ph] up as well. At the same time, there was a measurable increase in temporary nursing costs, all contributing to the margin decline.
On a same-facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 5% during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to the third quarter of 2014.
During this year's third quarter as compared to last year's adjusted admissions and adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year, each increased 1.6%. 
Revenue per adjusted admission and adjusted patient day, each rose 3.1% during the third quarter of 2015 over the comparable prior year quarter.
Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 27.5% and 27.6% during the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 respectively.
For the 9 months ended September 30, 2015, our net cash provided by operating activities increased approximately 16% to $796 million over the $690 million generated during the comparable 9-month period of 2014.
Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased slightly to 55 days during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to 56 days during the third quarter of 2014.
At September 30, 2015, our ratio of debt to total capitalization decreased to 42.8% as compared to 48.9% at September 30, 2014.
We spent $99 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2015 and $270 million during the first 9 months of 2015.
In connection with our previously announced $400 million stock repurchase program, we repurchased 543,380 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $72 million during the third quarter of this year. Since inception of the program through September 30, 2015, we have repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $166 million and had a remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $234 million as of the end of the third quarter.
In August 2015, we acquired 4 behavioral health facilities with 305 beds located in the U.K. This acquisition increases our behavioral health presence in the U.K. to 21 facilities consisting of approximately 1,100 beds. 
In October 2015, we completed the acquisition of Foundations Recovery Network. Through this acquisition, we have added 4 inpatient facilities consisting of 322 beds as well as 8 outpatient centers. In addition, there are over 140 expansion beds in progress for Foundation as well.
Foundations, one of the premier names in addiction treatment, is focused on treating adults with co-occurring addiction and mental health disorders through an evidence-based integrated treatment model in residential and outpatient settings. 
Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first 9 months of 2015, we're revising our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2015, to $6.75 to $7.05 per diluted share. This revised guidance, which excludes the expected electronic health records impact for the year, maintains the lower end of the previously provided range of $6.75 to $7.15 per diluted share, and decreases the upper end of the range by approximately 1%. 
Alan and I are pleased to answer your questions at this time."

Just from an order of magnitude, I think the impact of the increase in temporary nurse cost was similar to the uncompensated care impact that is in the neighborhood of 50 basis points. Obviously, it is a trend that has been mentioned by a number of our peers as well, which is not necessarily something we were aware of during the quarter. I think from our perspective, we continue to have and generate very substantial acute care demand as reflected in our growing admissions, very helpfully growing admissions, and as a result, that is contributing to a need for more employees, particularly nurses. And honestly, I think we're just not filling those positions as quickly and as efficiently and expeditiously as we would hope. To some degree, I think, we probably underestimated the need for new nurses as demand has remained as strong as it has. As we look forward and project sort of solving this issue or solving the problem, I think we view it as definitely a fixable problem and one that we will address in the fourth quarter, and begin to make progress in the fourth quarter and certainly begin to really solve the issue by the beginning of next year as we fill those vacant positions. The feedback that I get from our hospitals when we talk to them is that they can't [ph] fill those positions. They're -- this is a sort of redoubling their efforts to do so, and so we're fairly confident that we'll address that issue in the near future."

We probably have 8 or 9 dedicated addiction facilities in our portfolio today, as well as the fact that we offer addiction services in many of our other behavioral facilities as well. And we think that the Foundations model, as well as the -- the Foundations model in terms of patient treatment as well as their model for patient capture is one that we'll have relevance for us throughout our other addiction businesses. And quite frankly, in some of our other lines of business as well, things like eating disorders, et cetera. So the 140 beds that are in the queue for Foundations are both additions to existing facilities as well as some de novo development. I think they're all likely to be completed within the 12-month cycle, and we continue to look for other opportunities as well to expand that business as well as other elements of our behavioral business."

I think all those same trends were present in Q3 as well. In terms of the revised guidance and how that acute care growth fits into that, again, we revised that guidance at the end of the second quarter. We talked about the fact that the first half of the year, acute care revenue growth of 10% was unlikely to be sustainable. It was sort of unprecedented in the history, not only of the company, but of the acute care industry. And we thought that revenues in the back half of the year and frankly going forward would likely moderate to levels more like 6.5%, 7% and that's certainly what happened in Q3. And I think our revised guidance, taking off the very top end of the guidance, was simply an acknowledgment that those acute care revenues had moderated and would likely continue to do so, and that, I think, we had to say that to get to the high end of that range, we have to sustain those 10% or so revenue growth levels. And I think, the revision at the top end of the range was just an acknowledgment that, that was very unlikely."

I will tell you that the current environment just doesn't have the same feel to it. Certainly, this issue of increased use of temporary nurses is not unique to us.

I think if we're seeing any pressure on physician staffing, I think it tends to be on the behavioral side. We've mentioned this, I think, once or twice before. At least in some specific markets, it's been difficult for us to hire the appropriate number of psychiatrists, and that's been a bit of a drag both to the degree that we can't -- we don't add sufficient numbers of psychiatrists. We'll see our volumes pressured a little bit. Behavioral admissions were a little bit soft in Q3. And I think as I look around the portfolio, there were a market or 2 where I would attribute some of that softness to a shortage of physicians. Also to the degree that we're using temporary physicians that pushes our operating expense up in the behavioral division, and you'll see that in the queue a little bit when you'll see the specific pressure on our operating expenses in behavioral, again, around the margins at least. On the acute side, it's a good question. You know exactly why this problem is sort of bubbling up at the moment, Josh. My sense is that to some degree, there has been a bit of a skepticism out in the field that the really strong volumes that we've been generating were going to continue. And I think there's always a bit of hesitancy to hire nurses when you're not sure if volume strength will continue. So I think that may have been it. I think there may have been some unnecessary skepticism about the need for those nurses, but I think that's now become clear. Turnover hasn't increased for us. I know some of our peers have mentioned that. We're constantly trying to drive turnover rates down, and I'm not sure that we're terribly successful in driving them down. But I'd certainly think that they have been stable for us. And then finally, this idea that there is a lot of these sort of alternate care providers, FED [ph] providers, et cetera. I think in our markets at least, the numbers of those source of providers and the amount of people they're hiring is relatively immaterial.

We're not able to attribute that increase to specifically to commercial exchange patients or subscribers, not being able to make their premium payments. We're not really able to subscribe or ascribe the increase to anything in particular. And I think that our sort of outlook on this is we'll wait and see. We'll try and gather more data as another month or 2 passes, and do a better job of trying to figure out what's going on. I realized that there is a lot of pressure on folks all over to try and figure this out immediately. I will say this at the end of the day, even with the increase in bad debt and uncompensated care pressure, we generated 7.2% acute care revenue growth in the quarter. And if somebody had asked me year ago whether I would take that, I would've taken that offer in an instant, and I'll take it again next quarter if presented to me. So I appreciate the fact that there's a lot of focus on this increase in uncompensated care, but I think sometimes, we're looking at the glass in the wrong way. I mean, this glass is half full in my mind when acute care revenues are growing by 7.2% over the prior year."

We continue to see observation patients being quoted with frequency, but I do think we're lapping some of that.

With the dynamic in the fourth quarter, people exhausting co-pays and deductibles, and having elective procedures done in the fourth quarter and that becoming more of an issue as co-pays and deductibles become a bigger part of the overall landscape. But I think the one sort of constant in all that is the third quarter has sort of traditionally been the weakest quarter. Honestly, when I saw our third quarter results a few weeks ago before anyone else had commented on theirs, I generally thought they were kind of a slightness that I attributed mostly to seasonality. I'm not actually sure that having seen what other people have said. I really feel like that's a wholly different. I mean, again, we're -- I'm back to the idea of feeling pretty good about a quarter in which we -- lots of our surgeons and physicians are on vacation, lots of our patients are on vacation, elective procedures are usually down pretty significantly in the quarter. And we still grew our revenue by over 7%. I'm still feeling pretty good about the fundamental performance of that acute division."

Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services' results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015. 
During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. 
For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2015.
We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.
As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS of $1.48 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2015. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health record applications at our acute care hospitals, as well as the other items attributable to last year's third quarter as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased approximately 13% to $155.3 million or $1.53 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to $137.5 million or $1.36 per diluted share during the third quarter of last year.
On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, revenues during the third quarter of 2015 increased 7.2% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 5.1% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year, and a 3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. 
On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute hospitals decreased to 15.4% during the third quarter of 2015 from 17.1% during the third quarter of 2014.
As expected, net revenue growth slowed in the third quarter from the unprecedented levels we have been experiencing in the first half of the year. Surgical volumes moderated a bit and uncompensated care volumes ticked up as well. At the same time, there was a measurable increase in temporary nursing costs, all contributing to the margin decline.
On a same-facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 5% during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to the third quarter of 2014.
During this year's third quarter as compared to last year's adjusted admissions and adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year, each increased 1.6%. 
Revenue per adjusted admission and adjusted patient day, each rose 3.1% during the third quarter of 2015 over the comparable prior year quarter.
Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 27.5% and 27.6% during the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
For the 9 months ended September 30, 2015, our net cash provided by operating activities increased approximately 16% to $796 million over the $690 million generated during the comparable 9-month period of 2014.
Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased slightly to 55 days during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to 56 days during the third quarter of 2014.
At September 30, 2015, our ratio of debt to total capitalization decreased to 42.8% as compared to 48.9% at September 30, 2014.
We spent $99 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2015 and $270 million during the first 9 months of 2015.
In connection with our previously announced $400 million stock repurchase program, we repurchased 543,380 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $72 million during the third quarter of this year. Since inception of the program through September 30, 2015, we have repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $166 million and had a remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $234 million as of the end of the third quarter.
In August 2015, we acquired 4 behavioral health facilities with 305 beds located in the U.K. This acquisition increases our behavioral health presence in the U.K. to 21 facilities, consisting of approximately 1,100 beds. 
In October 2015, we completed the acquisition of Foundations Recovery Network. Through this acquisition, we have added 4 inpatient facilities consisting of 322 beds as well as 8 outpatient centers. In addition, there are over 140 expansion beds in progress for Foundation as well.
Foundations, one of the premier names in addiction treatment, is focused on treating adults with co-occurring addiction and mental health disorders through an evidence-based integrated treatment model in residential and outpatient settings. 
Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first 9 months of 2015, we're revising our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2015, to $6.75 to $7.05 per diluted share. This revised guidance, which excludes the expected electronic health records impact for the year, maintains the lower end of the previously provided range of $6.75 to $7.15 per diluted share, and decreases the upper end of the range by approximately 1%. 
Alan and I are pleased to answer your questions at this time."

Obviously, it is a trend that has been mentioned by a number of our peers as well, which is not necessarily something we were aware of during the quarter. I think from our perspective, we continue to have and generate very substantial acute care demand as reflected in our growing admissions, very helpfully growing admissions, and as a result, that is contributing to a need for more employees, particularly nurses. And honestly, I think we're just not filling those positions as quickly and as efficiently and expeditiously as we would hope. And to some degree, I think, we probably underestimated the need for new nurses as demand has remained as strong as it has. As we look forward and project sort of solving this issue or solving the problem, I think we view it as definitely a fixable problem and one that we will address in the fourth quarter, and begin to make progress in the fourth quarter and certainly begin to really solve the issue by the beginning of next year as we fill those vacant positions. The feedback that I get from our hospitals when we talk to them is that they can fill those positions. They're -- this is a sort of redoubling their efforts to do so, and so we're fairly confident that we'll address that issue in the near future."

We talked about the fact that the first half of the year, acute care revenue growth of 10% was unlikely to be sustainable. It was sort of unprecedented in the history, not only of the company, but of the acute care industry. And we thought that revenues in the back half of the year and frankly going forward would likely moderate to levels more like 6.5%, 7% and that's certainly what happened in Q3. And I think our revised guidance, taking off the very top end of the guidance was simply an acknowledgment that those acute care revenues had moderated and would likely continue to do so, and that, I think, we had to say that to get to the high end of that range, we have to sustain those 10% or so revenue growth levels.

I think if we're seeing any pressure on physician staffing, I think it tends to be on the behavioral side. We've mentioned this, I think, once or twice before. At least in some specific markets, it's been difficult for us to hire the appropriate number of psychiatrists, and that's been a bit of a drag both to the degree that we can't -- if we don't add sufficient numbers of psychiatrists we'll see our volumes pressured a little bit. Behavioral admissions were a little bit soft in Q3. And I think as I look around the portfolio, there were a market or 2 where I would attribute some of that softness to a shortage of physicians. Also to the degree that we're using temporary physicians that pushes our operating expense up in the behavioral division, you'll see that in the queue a little bit when you'll see the specific pressure on our operating expenses in behavioral, again, around the margins at least. On the acute side, it's a good question. You know exactly why this problem is sort of bubbling up at the moment, Josh? My sense is that to some degree, there has been a bit of a skepticism out in the field that the really strong volumes that we've been generating were going to continue. And I think there's always a bit of hesitancy to hire nurses when you're not sure if volume strength will continue. So I think that may have been it. I think there may have been some unnecessary skepticism about the need for those nurses, but I think that's now become clear. Turnover hasn't increased for us. I know some of our peers have mentioned that. We're constantly trying to drive our turnover rates down, and I'm not sure that we're terribly successful in driving them down. But I'd certainly think that they have been stable for us. And then finally, this idea that there is a lot of these sort of alternate care providers, FEP providers, et cetera. I think in our markets, at least, the numbers of those source of providers and the amount of people they're hiring is relatively immaterial.

Other than a couple of anecdotal examples that we've been able to gather, we're really not able to generate sort of any measurable data that would suggest we're seeing that in sort of large volumes. We'll continue to watch that. Again, Gary, I'm going to repeat a comment I made a little bit ago. I think sometimes it can be a mistake to draw really broad conclusions about 1 quarter's worth of metrics. We try -- we're exploring and we certainly dive into these numbers when we see them. But none of these other explanations, at least for us, seem to be terribly obvious or explanations that we could really prove out."

They continue to pursue opportunities that include building new beds at existing hospitals, doing some de novo development, and doing some small acquisition work and looking at acquisitions of various sizes.

I mean, what I said was that the increase in uncompensated care was most evident in the South Texas market, and that's true. But I don't want to leave the impression that it was completely limited. We saw an uptick in uncompensated care in other markets as well. I mean, again, I think you're asking the question that Gary asked. maybe a little bit differently. We're not able to attribute that increase to specifically to commercial exchange patients or subscribers, not being able to make their premium payments. We're not really able to subscribe or ascribe the increase to anything in particular. And I think that our sort of outlook on this is we'll wait and see. We'll try and gather more data as another month or 2 passes, and do a better job of trying to figure out what's going on. I realized that there is a lot of pressure on folks all over to try and figure this out immediately. I will say this at the end of the day, even with the increase in bad debt and uncompensated care pressure, we generated 7.2% acute care revenue growth in the quarter. And if somebody had asked me year ago whether I would take that, I would've taken that offer in an instant, and I'll take it again next quarter if it's presented to me. So I appreciate the fact that there's a lot of focus on this increase in uncompensated care, but I think sometimes, we're looking at the glass in the wrong way. I mean, this glass is half full in my mind when acute care revenues are growing by 7.2% over the prior year."

We continue to see observation patients being quoted with frequency, but I do think we're lapping some of that. And that makes sense only because all the other explanations that usually offer for increased volumes, the ACA impact or the economic impact, are generally not relevant to the Medicare population.

These patients are being treated for the most part in existing acute care facilities today. And we have work to do to, I think, communicate with those acute care facilities and see if there is an opportunity. And this is really a market-by-market effort to cooperate with them and see if those patients can be treated in sort of a more efficient way, mutually efficient way for both the acute care hospital and for us. We also have to work with the managed Medicaid companies to negotiate rates. I don't view that as a big hurdle, but something that has to be done.

With the dynamic in the fourth quarter, people exhausting co-pays and deductibles, and having elective procedures done in the fourth quarter and that becoming more of an issue as co-pays and deductibles become a bigger part of the overall landscape. But I think the one sort of constant in all that is the third quarter has sort of traditionally been the weakest quarter. Honestly, when I saw our third quarter results a few weeks ago before anyone else had commented on theirs, I generally thought they were kind of a slightness that I attributed mostly to seasonality. I'm not actually sure that having seen what other people have said. I really feel like that's a wholly different. I mean, again, we're -- I'm back to the idea of feeling pretty good about a quarter in which we -- lots of our surgeons and physicians are on vacation, lots of our patients are on vacation, elective procedures are usually down pretty significantly in the quarter. And we still grew our revenue by over 7%. I'm still feeling pretty good about the fundamental performance of that acute division."

Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services' results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015. 
During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. 
For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2015.
We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.
As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS of $1.48 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2015. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health record applications at our acute care hospitals as well as the other items attributable to last year's third quarter as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased approximately 13% to $155.3 million or $1.53 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to $137.5 million or $1.36 per diluted share during the third quarter of last year.
On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, revenues during the third quarter of 2015 increased 7.2% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 5.1% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year, and a 3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. 
On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute hospitals decreased to 15.4% during the third quarter of 2015 from 17.1% during the third quarter of 2014.
As expected, net revenue growth slowed in the third quarter from the unprecedented levels we have been experiencing in the first half of the year. Surgical volumes moderated a bit and uncompensated care volumes ticked up as well. At the same time, there was a measurable increase in temporary nursing costs, all contributing to the margin decline.
On a same-facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 5% during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to the third quarter of 2014.
During this year's third quarter as compared to last year's adjusted admissions and adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year, each increased 1.6%. 
Revenue per adjusted admission and adjusted patient day, each rose 3.1% during the third quarter of 2015 over the comparable prior year quarter.
Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 27.5% and 27.6% during the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
For the 9 months ended September 30, 2015, our net cash provided by operating activities increased approximately 16% to $796 million over the $690 million generated during the comparable 9-month period of 2014.
Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased slightly to 55 days during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to 56 days during the third quarter of 2014.
At September 30, 2015, our ratio of debt to total capitalization decreased to 42.8% as compared to 48.9% at September 30, 2014.
We spent $99 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2015 and $270 million during the first 9 months of 2015.
In connection with our previously announced $400 million stock repurchase program, we repurchased 543,380 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $72 million during the third quarter of this year. Since inception of the program through September 30, 2015, we have repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $166 million and had a remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $234 million as of the end of the third quarter.
In August 2015, we acquired 4 behavioral health facilities with 305 beds located in the U.K. This acquisition increases our behavioral health presence in the U.K. to 21 facilities, consisting of approximately 1,100 beds. 
In October 2015, we completed the acquisition of Foundations Recovery Network. Through this acquisition, we have added 4 inpatient facilities consisting of 322 beds as well as 8 outpatient centers. In addition, there are over 140 expansion beds in progress for Foundation as well.
Foundations, one of the premier names in addiction treatment, is focused on treating adults with co-occurring addiction and mental health disorders through an evidence-based integrated treatment model in residential and outpatient settings. 
Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first 9 months of 2015, we're revising our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2015, to $6.75 to $7.05 per diluted share. This revised guidance, which excludes the expected electronic health records impact for the year, maintains the lower end of the previously provided range of $6.75 to $7.15 per diluted share, and decreases the upper end of the range by approximately 1%.

Obviously, it is a trend that has been mentioned by a number of our peers as well, which is not necessarily something we were aware of during the quarter. I think from our perspective, we continue to have and generate very substantial acute care demand as reflected in our growing admissions, very helpfully growing admissions, and as a result, that is contributing to a need for more employees, particularly nurses. And honestly, I think we're just not filling those positions as quickly and as efficiently and expeditiously as we would hope. And to some degree, I think, we probably underestimated the need for new nurses as demand has remained as strong as it has. As we look forward and project sort of solving this issue or solving the problem, I think we view it as definitely a fixable problem and one that we will address in the fourth quarter, and begin to make progress in the fourth quarter and certainly begin to really solve the issue by the beginning of next year as we fill those vacant positions. The feedback that I get from our hospitals when we talk to them is that they can fill those positions. They're -- this is a sort of redoubling their efforts to do so, and so we're fairly confident that we'll address that issue in the near future."

I think all those same trends were present in Q3 as well. In terms of the revised guidance and how that acute care growth fits into that, again, we revised that guidance at the end of the second quarter. We talked about the fact that the first half of the year, acute care revenue growth of 10% was unlikely to be sustainable. It was sort of unprecedented in the history, not only of the company, but of the acute care industry. And we thought that revenues in the back half of the year and frankly going forward would likely moderate to levels more like 6.5%, 7% and that's certainly what happened in Q3. And I think our revised guidance, taking off the very top end of the guidance was simply an acknowledgment that those acute care revenues had moderated and would likely continue to do so, and that, I think, we had to say that to get to the high end of that range, we have to sustain those 10% or so revenue growth levels.

I will tell you that the current environment just doesn't have the same feel to it. Certainly, there's an issue of increased use of temporary nurses is not unique to us.

So what's causing that need for temporary labor? Has there just been more turnover and you're not sort of filling those roles? Any sense of where these nurses and clinicians are getting hired? Are they going to nontraditional channels at this point? And then if you could also comment any position, compensation or recruitment issues within that labor? Or is this really all just nursing?"

I think if we're seeing any pressure on physician staffing, I think it tends to be on the behavioral side. We've mentioned this, I think, once or twice before. At least in some specific markets, it's been difficult for us to hire the appropriate number of psychiatrists, and that's been a bit of a drag both to the degree that we can't -- if we don't add sufficient numbers of psychiatrists we'll see our volumes pressured a little bit. Behavioral admissions were a little bit soft in Q3. And I think as I look around the portfolio, there were a market or 2 where I would attribute some of that softness to a shortage of physicians. Also to the degree that we're using temporary physicians that pushes our operating expense up in the behavioral division, you'll see that in the queue a little bit when you'll see the specific pressure on our operating expenses in behavioral, again, around the margins at least. On the acute side, it's a good question. You know exactly why this problem is sort of bubbling up at the moment, Josh? My sense is that to some degree, there has been a bit of a skepticism out in the field that the really strong volumes that we've been generating were going to continue. And I think there's always a bit of hesitancy to hire nurses when you're not sure if volume strength will continue. So I think that may have been it. I think there may have been some unnecessary skepticism about the need for those nurses, but I think that's now become clear. Turnover hasn't increased for us. I know some of our peers have mentioned that. We're constantly trying to drive our turnover rates down, and I'm not sure that we're terribly successful in driving them down. But I'd certainly think that they have been stable for us. And then finally, this idea that there is a lot of these sort of alternate care providers, FEP providers, et cetera. I think in our markets, at least, the numbers of those source of providers and the amount of people they're hiring is relatively immaterial. So it doesn't seem to me to be the item that's really driving this."

We're not able to attribute that increase to specifically to commercial exchange patients or subscribers, not being able to make their premium payments. We're not really able to subscribe or ascribe the increase to anything in particular. And I think that our sort of outlook on this is we'll wait and see. We'll try and gather more data as another month or 2 passes, and do a better job of trying to figure out what's going on. I realized that there is a lot of pressure on folks all over to try and figure this out immediately. I will say this at the end of the day, even with the increase in bad debt and uncompensated care pressure, we generated 7.2% acute care revenue growth in the quarter. And if somebody had asked me year ago whether I would take that, I would've taken that offer in an instant, and I'll take it again next quarter if it's presented to me. So I appreciate the fact that there's a lot of focus on this increase in uncompensated care, but I think sometimes, we're looking at the glass in the wrong way.

During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such",879,"Good morning. Thank you. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services' results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015. 
During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2015.
We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS of $1.48 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2015. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health record applications at our acute care hospitals as well as the other items attributable to last year's third quarter as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased approximately 13% to $155.3 million or $1.53 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to $137.5 million or $1.36 per diluted share during the third quarter of last year.
On a same facility basis in our acute care division, revenues during the third quarter of 2015 increased 7.2% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 5.1% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year, and a 3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute hospitals decreased to 15.4% during the third quarter of 2015 from 17.1% during the third quarter of 2014.
As expected, net revenue growth slowed in the third quarter from the unprecedented levels we had been experiencing in the first half of the year. Surgical volumes moderated a bit and uncompensated care volumes ticked up as well. At the same time, there was a measurable increase in temporary nursing costs, all contributing to the margin decline.
On a same facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 5% during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to the third quarter of 2014. During this year's third quarter as compared to last year's adjusted admissions and adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year, each increased 1.6%. 
Revenue per adjusted admission and adjusted patient day each rose 3.1% during the third quarter of 2015 over the comparable prior year quarter. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 27.5% and 27.6% during the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
For the 9 months ended September 30, 2015, our net cash provided by operating activities increased approximately 16% to $796 million over the $690 million generated during the comparable 9-month period of 2014. Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased slightly to 55 days during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to 56 days during the third quarter of 2014.
At September 30, 2015, our ratio of debt to total capitalization decreased to 42.8% as compared to 48.9% at September 30, 2014. We spent $99 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2015 and $270 million during the first 9 months of 2015.
In connection with our previously announced $400 million stock repurchase program, we repurchased 543,380 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $72 million during the third quarter of this year. Since inception of the program through September 30, 2015, we have repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $166 million and had a remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $234 million as of the end of the third quarter.
In August 2015, we acquired 4 behavioral health facilities with 305 beds located in the U.K. This acquisition increases our behavioral health presence in the U.K. to 21 facilities, consisting of approximately 1,100 beds. 
In October 2015, we completed the acquisition of Foundations Recovery Network. Through this acquisition, we have added 4 inpatient facilities consisting of 322 beds as well as 8 outpatient centers. In addition, there are over 140 expansion beds in progress for Foundation as well. Foundations, one of the premier names in addiction treatment, is focused on treating adults with co-occurring addiction and mental health disorders through an evidence-based integrated treatment model in residential and outpatient settings. 
Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first 9 months of 2015, we're revising our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2015, to $6.75 to $7.05 per diluted share. This revised guidance, which excludes the expected electronic health records impact for the year, maintains the lower end of the previously provided range of $6.75 to $7.15 per diluted share, and decreases the upper end of the range by approximately 1%. 
Alan and I are pleased to answer your questions at this time."

So I -- just from an order of magnitude, I think that the impact of the increase in temporary nurse costs was similar to the uncompensated care impact that is in the neighborhood of 50 basis points. Obviously, it is a trend that has been mentioned by a number of our peers as well, which is not necessarily something we were aware of during the quarter. I think from our perspective, we continue to have and generate very substantial acute care demand as reflected in our growing admissions, very helpfully growing admissions. And as a result, that is contributing to a need for more employees, particularly nurses. And honestly, I think we're just not filling those positions as quickly and as efficiently and expeditiously as we would hope. And to some degree, I think we probably underestimated the need for new nurses as demand has remained as strong as it has. As we look forward and project sort of solving this issue or solving the problem, I think we view it as definitely a fixable problem and one that we will address in the fourth quarter and begin to make progress in the fourth quarter and certainly begin to really solve the issue by the beginning of next year as we fill those vacant positions. The feedback that I get from our hospitals when we talk to them is that they can fill those positions. They're sort of redoubling their efforts to do so and -- so we're fairly confident that we'll address that issue in the near future."

Obviously, we're talking about 330 beds out of a total of 20,000. But I think we think that the Foundation acquisition very nicely complements our existing addiction businesses. We probably have 8 or 9 dedicated addiction facilities in our portfolio today as well as the fact that we offer addiction services in many of our other behavioral facilities as well. And we think that the Foundations model as well as the -- the Foundations model in terms of patient treatment as well as their model for patient capture is one that will have relevance for us throughout our other addiction businesses and, quite frankly, in some of our other lines of business as well, things like eating disorders, et cetera. So the 140 beds that are in the queue for Foundations are both additions to existing facilities as well as some de novo development. I think they're all likely to be completed within the 12-month cycle, and we continue to look for other opportunities as well to expand that business as well as other elements of our behavioral business."

And as I mentioned before, I think our Texas markets and particularly our South Texas markets have lagged a little bit over the last few quarters. I think all those same trends were present in Q3 as well. In terms of the revised guidance and how that acute care growth fits into that, again, we revised that guidance at the end of the second quarter. We talked about the fact that the first half of the year, acute care revenue growth of 10% was unlikely to be sustainable. It was sort of unprecedented in the history, not only of the company, but of the acute care industry. And we thought that revenues in the back half of the year and frankly going forward would likely moderate to levels more like 6.5%, 7% and that's certainly what happened in Q3. And I think our revised guidance, taking off the very top end of the guidance was simply an acknowledgment that those acute care revenues had moderated and would likely continue to do so. And that, I think we had said that to get to the high end of that range, we'd have to sustain those 10% or so revenue growth levels. And I think the revision at the top end of the range was just an acknowledgment that, that was very unlikely."

There just weren't nurses out there. It didn't matter what we were willing to pay. There was enormous pressure on wages. I will tell you that the current environment just doesn't have the same feel to it. Certainly this issue of an increased use of temporary nurses is not unique to us. Other companies have reported it as well, so it seems to be a bit more systemic issue. But it also, based on the feedback that we're getting from our hospitals, is one that remains fixable. I mean, they're hiring nurses. They're hiring nurses at sort of within our current wage scale, et cetera.

And the 17% margin, I think, was probably the best margin we've ever run in the third quarter in that division. So the comparison was extremely difficult. And even though I think your point is a valid one and well taken, and that is that under normal circumstances, if we generate 7% growth -- revenue growth in the acute division, we would expect to have margin expansion. And I believe that that's what we will expect in the future. In the third quarter, there were a couple of extenuating circumstances which we've discussed already. But I think it is just that it's extenuating circumstances as opposed to sort of fundamental changes in the model. I think our general sense is that at these very healthy revenue levels and that's what I think we take away from the quarter as the most important message, we believe that in the future we will be able to generate the margin expansion that we've come to expect at those levels."

You're right that the South Texas markets, McAllen, Laredo, are not markets that are heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry. They're not markets where the sort of broader economic metrics like unemployment seem to be deteriorating in any meaningful way. So the increase in uncompensated care is a bit of a head scratcher in those markets. And I think a lot of times, it's a mistake to draw broad conclusions from one quarter's worth of results in a particular market.

I think on the -- if we're seeing any pressure on physician staffing, I think it tends to be on the behavioral side. We've mentioned this, I think, once or twice before. At least in some specific markets, it's been difficult for us to hire the appropriate number of psychiatrists. And that's been a bit of a drag both to the degree that we can't -- we don't have sufficient number of psychiatrist, we'll see our volumes pressured a little bit. Behavioral admissions were a little bit soft in Q3. And I think as I look around the portfolio, there are a market or 2 where I would attribute some of that softness to a shortage of physicians. Also, to the degree that we're using temporary physicians, that pushes our operating expense up in the behavioral division, you'll see that in the Q a little bit when you'll see the specific pressure on our operating expenses in behavioral, again, around the margins at least. On the acute side, it's a good question. You know exactly why this problem is sort of bubbling up at the moment, Josh. My sense is that to some degree, there has been a bit of a skepticism out in the field that the really strong volumes that we've been generating, we're going to continue. And I think there's always a bit of hesitancy to hire nurses when you're not sure if volume strength will continue. So I think that may have been it. I think there may have been some unnecessary skepticism about the need for those nurses, but I think that's now become clear. Turnover hasn't increased for us. I know some of our peers have mentioned that. We're constantly trying to drive turnover rates down. And I'm not sure that we're terribly successful in driving them down, but I certainly think that they have been stable for us. And then finally, this idea that there's a lot of these sort of alternate care providers -- FED providers, et cetera. I think in our markets, at least, the numbers of those sorts of providers and the amount of people they're hiring is relatively immaterial. So it doesn't seem to me to be the item that's really driving this."

I mean what I said was that the increase in uncompensated care was most evident in the South Texas market, and that's true. But I don't want to leave the impression that it was completely limited. We saw an uptick in uncompensated care in some other markets as well. I mean, again, I think you're asking the question that Gary asked maybe a little bit differently. We're not able to attribute that increase to -- specifically to commercial exchange patients or subscribers not being able to make their premium payments. We're not really able to subscribe or ascribe the increase to anything in particular. And I think that our sort of outlook on this is we'll wait and see. We'll try and gather more data as another month or 2 passes, and do a better job of trying to figure out what's going on. I realize that there is a lot of pressure on folks all over to try and figure this out immediately. I will say this, at the end of the day, even with the increase in bad debt and uncompensated care pressure, we generated 7.2% acute care revenue growth in the quarter. And if somebody had asked me a year ago whether I would take that, I would've taken that offer in an instant, and I'll take it again next quarter, if presented to me. So I appreciate the fact that there is a lot of focus on this increase in uncompensated care, but I think sometimes we're looking at the glass in the wrong way.

And I think, as you suggest, probably an explanation for the strength in Medicare volumes is the idea that some of the weakness that we saw a year ago as a result of this shift from inpatients to observation patients, has anniversaried a bit. We continue to see observation patients being coded with frequency, but I do think we're lapping some of that.

I would say that generally the adjusted admission number for uninsured doesn't vary greatly from the admission number just because we don't have the large component of outpatient revenue that we have for our regular admissions. It's basically ER revenue is the bulk of the outpatient revenue that we have, so there's usually not a huge difference."

For years, you've been earning less in the third quarter, more in the fourth quarter. Anything just about physician behavior, vacation, employment, benefit design? I just don't know why we should sit here and conclude that flat growth off of a year where your EBITDA expanded 85% is really a problem, especially with this volume. So I feel like a lot of this is an overreaction. But I don't know, I'm just kind of curious. As you scan the landscape and see what's going on, everyone's missing for different reasons right now. I'm just curious if you have any sort of perspective on what you think is occurring."

I mean I think that the traditional seasonality of the business has been distorted over the last couple of years with the implementation of ACA, with Medicaid expansion in some of our big states, with commercial enrollment -- commercial exchange enrollment. With the, I think, the dynamic in the fourth quarter of people exhausting co-pays and deductibles, and having elective procedures done in the fourth quarter and that becoming more of an issue as co-pays and deductibles become a bigger part of the overall landscape. But I think the one sort of constant in all that is the third quarter has sort of traditionally been the weakest quarter. Honestly, when I saw our third quarter results a few weeks ago before anyone else had commented on theirs, I generally thought they were kind of a slight miss that I attributed mostly to seasonality. I'm not actually sure that -- having seen what other people have said, I really feel like that's wholly different. I mean, again, I think we're -- I'm back to the idea of feeling pretty good about a quarter in which we -- lots of our surgeons and physicians are on vacation, lots of our patients are on vacation, elective procedures are usually down pretty significantly in the quarter, and we still grew our revenue by over 7%. I'm still feeling pretty good about the fundamental performance of that acute division."
