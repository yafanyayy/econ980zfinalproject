As announced earlier today, Garmin recorded fourth quarter revenue growth of 6% and strong gross margin performance, which contributed to another quarter of pro forma EPS growth. Outdoor, fitness, aviation and",1880,"Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin recorded fourth quarter revenue growth of 6% and strong gross margin performance, which contributed to another quarter of pro forma EPS growth. Outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine revenues increased 23% on a combined basis, which more than offset an 11% decline in automobile. The non-automobile segments represented 58% of our revenue in the holiday quarter. Gross margins improved year-over-year to 54%, driven by the revenue mix shifting towards our higher-margin segments and due to the recognition of higher-margin revenues that were previously deferred. Operating margin declined slightly to 22%, as we made significant investments in advertising. These investments were consistent with our strategy to grow our share in the activity tracker market through higher consumer awareness and improved representation at retail.
Looking briefly at our full year performance. We delivered 4 consecutive quarters of revenue growth and strong margin performance, resulting in pro forma EPS growth of 18%. On a combined basis, our growth segments contributed over $1.6 billion in revenue for the year or 57% of the total and generated 69% of our operating income. Gross and operating margins improved to 56% and 24%, respectively, allowing us to generate over $3 of pro forma EPS for the first time since 2009. This is a major accomplishment made possible by our growth initiatives and the dedication of Garmin associates around the world. For the full year, we returned over $600 million to shareholders via our quarterly dividend and share repurchase program in 2014.
Next, I'll review each of our business segments highlighting 2014 performance, our 2015 outlook and a brief summary of long-term, strategic initiatives. Starting first in the fitness segment. We recorded year-over-year revenue growth of 60%. Activity trackers led the way, but our core categories of cycling and running also delivered impressive results. Though competition is intense in this high-growth area, our portfolio of differentiated products delivered stable growth and operating margin of 63% and 34%, respectively. For the full year, we secured approximately 15% share in the highly competitive activity tracker market. We believe this is a significant accomplishment, especially considering the short time we've been in the market. And this one we can build upon in 2015 and beyond. 2015, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 25% on top of the impressive growth of 2014. At CES, we introduced the vívofit 2 and the vívoactive, expanding our family of products targeting the activity tracker market. The vívoactive is a smartwatch for the active consumer, combining smart alerts and daily activity tracking with key features for runners, cyclists and golfers. The vívoactive is expendable through our Connect IQ open API, which will be discussed shortly. This product won numerous awards at CES and was praised for its versatility, ultrathin form factor and long battery life, which differentiates it from the rest of the market. We also introduced the vívofit 2, which featured a backlit display, audible alerts and an exciting collection of band options that will appeal to a broad range of consumers. We are encouraged by the recent performance of the fitness segment, and we look forward to another exciting year of new product introductions and growth.
Looking beyond 2015. We believe that numerous opportunities exist within the fitness and wellness domain, and we will continue to pursue these as global consumers become increasingly health conscious. We will focus on delivering innovative products in the market, offering a complete experience, compelling form factors, wireless connectivity and sensors. We will deliver a best-in-class experience to our Garmin Connect Community with support for broad range of activities, social networking, coaching and partnerships with companies like Strada and My Fitness We will expand on the essential nature of our products through third-party apps offered via Connect IQ. The screen capture is depicted here to illustrate a few very unique applications being designed for active lifestyle customers.
Finally, we will target additional share in the growing activity tracking market by delivering industry-leading utility and form factors that meet the needs of a diverse set of consumers.
Looking next to outdoor. We recorded year-over-year revenue growth of 4%. Wearables, dog tracking and training and action cameras contributed to this growth. The outdoor segment continue to generate strong growth in operating margins in 2014 at 62% and 35%, respectively. This represented a slight decline in margins compared to 2013 due to product mix and advertising investment. However, we expect the margin profile for outdoor to stabilize in 2015. Exiting 2014, we recognize that the segment was not as strong as we had hoped as we faced headwinds due to unfavorable dynamics in the golf industry and the maturing nature of the handheld market and our niche status in the action camera market. Looking at 2015, we expect growth in wearables, dog tracking and training and action cameras to be offset by declines in our traditional handheld business and ongoing negative trends industry-wide in golf. Despite these trends, we're excited about the recent product introductions with Fenix 3 and the epix, which were also well received at CES. And we expect to introduce more new products as the year progresses.
Beyond 2015, we will focus on new opportunities in adjacent markets and product categories to further expand our addressable market, as we have successfully done in the past. We will make additional investments in the growth areas of wearables and action cameras to broaden our product line and drive market share gains. We will support these initiatives with appropriate advertising and sponsorships like the recently announced partnership with Red Bull, featuring [indiscernible] as the official action camera Red Bull Air Race World Championships. In addition, we will utilize Connect IQ to enhance utility and differentiate our unique product portfolio.
Turning next aviation. We recorded year-over-year revenue growth of 14%, driven by strength in both OEM and aftermarket product categories. Operating income increased 22% for the year, ahead of revenue growth, as both gross and operating margins improved. In 2014, we launched Garmin avionics on additional Part 25 aircraft, and this trend will continue in 2015. For the 11th consecutive year, Garmin was ranked #1 in avionics product support by Professional Pilot Magazine. And as many of you know, this world-class support is a key ingredient for success in the aviation market, and particularly so on the demanding Part 25 aircraft category. I congratulate our team on earning this award once again, which is a testament to the amazing way in which we care for customers. 2015, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 10% in the aviation segment with growth in both OEM and aftermarket product categories. We will continue to support numerous partners in the completion of aircraft and helicopter certifications. In early January, Garmin and Gulfstream announced that Garmin will be providing the certified ADS-B solution for the G150 model aircraft. We are pleased to add Gulfstream to our growing list of OEM partners.
Longer term, our aviation growth initiatives are focused on continued development of our G3000, G5000 and G5000H platforms with OEM partners, which is the foundation for long-term market share expansion, identifying aftermarket opportunities, as well as commercial-off-the-shelf opportunities within the military and government sectors that leverage our core capabilities, developing unique technologies that address gaps in our product portfolio, and finally capitalizing opportunities created by the FAA's transformational National Airspace System and other global initiatives and mandates.
Moving next to marine. We reported year-over-year revenue growth of 11%, including our second half acquisition of Fusion. Gross margin was steady at 52%, while operating margins improved to 11%. The pricing environment in marine electronics remains highly competitive, which has pressured segment profitability. Despite challenge, we posted improved operating margins and our operating profit grew 42% over the previous year. For 2015, we're targeting revenue growth of approximately 10% in the marine segment, driven by recent product introductions and a full year contribution of Fusion. We will remain focused on gaining market share while managing costs and driving efficiencies through improved long-term profitability. In the long term, our objectives include increasing our market share in recreational boating, with specific emphasis on opportunities in the fishing and sailing markets. We will capitalize acquisitions made in recent years to further diversify our product portfolio. In addition, we plan to grow our OEM market share, leveraging our full range of products including radar, sonar, autopilot and entertainment systems. As previously mentioned, we will execute the discipline to improve our profitability in our marine business over the long term.
And looking finally at the automobile segment. Revenues declined 5% for the full year, as lower PND revenues were partially offset by market share gains, growth in OEM and contributions from deferred revenue. According to our estimates, we held approximately 45% market share in 2014 on a global basis and achieved 86% share in the fourth quarter in the U.S. market, representing yet another quarter of market share gain. Though industry headwinds were challenging, segment margins improved due to the contribution of deferred revenue, and we generated over $215 million [ph] of operating income for the year. We secured additional OEM relationships in 2014, including the announcement with Honda on the Civic and CR-V in specific geographies. Looking at 2015, we expect the PND market to continue along its current trajectory, and we also expect to recognize less deferred revenue versus the prior year. These factors lead to a forecasted revenue decline of approximately 15%. We will focus on market share leadership and maximizing profitability in PNDs, as we have successfully done for many years. We believe we will continue to gain momentum in the expanding infotainment market as customers embrace increasing levels of in-dash technology and OEM search for partners that can deliver unique value to the market. Beyond 2015, we'll focus on expanding our auto OEM business through additional program wins, delivering innovative in-vehicle technology in both aftermarket and OEM applications, managing the profitability of the segment, as the PND market continues to decline and capitalizing our niche opportunities in areas such as motorcycle, over-the-road trucking and RV.
Well, as you can see, we are excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2015. However, in addition to the market headwinds I've highlighted, we also face significant revenue headwinds in the near term due to the rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar. With this in mind, we're projecting revenues of approximately $2.9 billion with stable gross margins at 56%. We are projecting operating income of approximately $675 million, with operating margins of approximately 23%, as we continue to grow our R&D investment and mange other expenses in line with revenues. Factoring in an anticipated effective tax rate of 16% to 17%, 2015 pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $3.10 or flat compared to 2014. Note that the FX situation negatively impacted our revenue and EPS guidance by about 300 basis points. Given the strength of our 2014 results, we will propose an increased dividend at our upcoming annual meeting, and we will participate in share repurchases as market conditions warrant. We believe these actions will result in strong returns for shareholders over the long term.
So that concludes my remarks. Doug will now walk through our Q4 and full year financials in more detail. Doug?"

I'll then move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement, taxes and 2015 guidance. We posted revenue of $803 million for the fourth quarter, representing a 6% increase year-over-year, even with headwinds created by the weakening of the euro. Gross margin was strong at 54%. The 170 basis point increase from prior year, driven by segment mix and favorable impact from deferred revenue. Operating income grew by 2% to $176 million. Operating margin was 22%, a decrease of 80 basis points from the prior year. This result of gross margin favorability of 170 basis points has more than offset by operating expense growth of 15% or $33 million due to increased spending in both advertising and research and development. Pro forma effective tax rate of 19%, adjustments for the foreign currency gain or tax benefit from our lease of material reserves, our pro forma EPS was $0.77. This represents a 1% increase year-over-year. We shipped 5.1 million units during the quarter, up 14% [ph] from 4.5 million last year. Total company average selling price of $157 per unit, down 7% from $169 in the prior quarter, primarily due to fitness product mix.
Looking at full year results. We posted revenue of $2.87 billion for the year, representing 9% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was strong at 56%. A 240 basis point increase from prior year, driven by segment mix and a favorable impact from deferred revenue. Operating income increased 20% to $691 million compared to $574 million in 2013. Operating margin was 24%, an increase of 230 basis points from prior year. This was a result of gross margin favorability of 240 basis points that was slightly offset by operating expense growth of 10% or $81 million due to increased spending in both advertising and research and development. 2014 pro forma effective tax rate was approximately 17%, which was in line with 2013. After adjusting for foreign currency loss, a tax impact of the intercompany restructuring and a tax benefit from release of material reserves, our pro forma EPS was $3.10. This represents an 18% increase year-over-year. Units shipped were up 9% from 15.2 million units delivered during the year.
Next, we'll review how our fourth quarter revenue breaks down by segment. We experienced growth in the 3 of our 5 segments led by fitness, with a 70% growth. Within the chart of this page, the automobile segment represent a 42% of our total revenue during the fourth quarter 2014, down from 49% in the prior year. Fitness grew to 25% of revenue in the current period compared to 16% in the prior year. These charts illustrate our profitability mix my segment. Our non-auto segments delivered 68% of operating income in the quarter, flat to the prior year quarter. Drilling down on year-over-year gross margin, total company gross margin improved to 54% due to positive segment mix and improved margins in automobile. Aviation and marine posted the only sizable gross margin declines. Both were negatively impacted by product mix. As Cliff discussed, marine was further pressured due to competitive pricing dynamics. Total operating margin was 22%, down slightly from the prior quarter due to increased advertising spend offsetting a strong gross margin performance.
Looking briefly at full year metrics. Revenue contribution for 2014 shifted away from the auto/mobile, which represented 43% of our total revenue during 2014, down from 49% in the prior year. Fitness grew to 20% of revenue for the full year compared to 14% in the prior year. We generated 69% [ph] of operating income in our non-automobile segments during 2014.
As previously mentioned, fourth quarter operating expense increased by $33 million or 15%, while increasing 250 basis points as a percent of sales. Research and development increased $9 million and 50 [ph] basis points to 12.6% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation and grow our engineering workforce, increasing resources focused primarily on aviation, fitness and outdoor. Our advertising expense increased $19 million over the prior year quarter and represented 6.7% of sales, a 210 basis point increase. Additional spending was focused primarily on fitness to support new product categories. We will continue manage our advertising cost by segment with a near-term focus on market share growth in wearables.
SG&A was up $4 million compared to the prior year quarter, decreasing 10 basis points as a percent of sales to 12.3%. We continue to manage these costs closely to an operating leverage when possible.
We ended the quarter with cash, marketable securities of almost $2.8 billion. Accounts receivable increased both sequentially and year-over-year to $570 million as a result of the higher holiday sales volume in 2014. Our inventory balance decreased to $420 million as a sequential basis [indiscernible] closes fourth quarter as we exited the stronger holiday quarter prepared for a seasonally lower first quarter. Year-over-year, we're maintaining adequate inventory level to support new product categories with sufficient supply of raw materials. We continue to generate strong free cash flow across our business with $127 million generated in the fourth quarter and $528 million for the full year. Through our dividend and stock repurchase activity during 2014, we've turned over $600 million of cash to our shareholders.
Our pro forma effective tax rate for fourth quarter 2014 was 19.1% compared to 20% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Pro forma tax rate in the fourth quarter 2014 excludes a tax benefit from material release of reserves. The pro forma effective tax rate decline was driven by the favorable impact with approval of a 2014 R&D tax credit, which was largely offset by unfavorable income mix by tax jurisdiction resulting from foreign currency fluctuations, as well as reduced tax incentives in Taiwan. There's no material change in our full year pro forma effective tax rate between 2013, 2014. We expect our full year tax rate in 2015 to be between 16% and 17%, relatively consistent with prior years. We announced this morning the plan to seek shareholder approval for increased dividend beginning with the June 2015 calendar quarter. Proposal was $0.51 per share per quarter or $2.04 annually, increase from our current quarterly rate of $0.48 per share. We also announced the Board of Directors authorized the company to repurchase up to $300 million of the company shares as the market and business conditions warrant through December 31, 2016.
Let's review our 2015 guidance and further highlight that we anticipate growth in 3 segments in 2015, expect our non-auto segments represent over 60% of our revenue in 2015. As outlined in our guidance, we will continue to invest in 2015 for long-term growth opportunities across the entire business, positioning us to continue to generate significant shareholder returns. Darren, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

As announced earlier today, Garmin recorded fourth quarter revenue growth of 6% and strong gross margin performance, which contributed to another quarter of pro forma EPS growth. Outdoor, fitness, aviation and",1902,"Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin recorded fourth quarter revenue growth of 6% and strong gross margin performance, which contributed to another quarter of pro forma EPS growth. Outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine revenues increased 23% on a combined basis, which more than offset an 11% decline in automobile. The non-automobile segments represented 58% of our revenue in the holiday quarter. 
Gross margins improved year-over-year to 54%, driven by the revenue mix shifting towards our higher-margin segments and due to the recognition of higher-margin revenues that were previously deferred. Operating margin declined slightly to 22%, as we made significant investments in advertising. These investments were consistent with our strategy to grow our share in the activity tracker market through higher consumer awareness and improved representation at retail.
Looking briefly at our full year performance. We delivered 4 consecutive quarters of revenue growth and strong margin performance, resulting in pro forma EPS growth of 18%. On a combined basis, our growth segments contributed over $1.6 billion in revenue for the year or 57% of the total and generated 69% of our operating income. Gross and operating margins improved to 56% and 24%, respectively, allowing us to generate over $3 of pro forma EPS for the first time since 2009. This is a major accomplishment made possible by our growth initiatives and the dedication of Garmin associates around the world. For the full year, we returned over $600 million to shareholders via our quarterly dividend and share repurchase program in 2014.
So next, I'll review each of our business segments highlighting 2014 performance, our 2015 outlook and a brief summary of long-term, strategic initiatives. Starting first in the fitness segment. We recorded year-over-year revenue growth of 60%. Activity trackers led the way, but our core categories of cycling and running also delivered impressive results. Though competition is intense in this high-growth area, our portfolio of differentiated products delivered stable growth and operating margin of 63% and 34%, respectively. 
For the full year, we secured approximately 15% share in the highly competitive activity tracker market. We believe this is a significant accomplishment, especially considering the short time we've been in the market, and is one we can build upon in 2015 and beyond. 
2015, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 25% on top of the impressive growth of 2014. At CES, we introduced the vívofit 2 and the vívoactive, expanding our family of products targeting the activity tracker market. The vívoactive is a smartwatch for the active consumer, combining smart alerts and daily activity tracking with key features for runners, cyclists and golfers. The vívoactive is expendable through our Connect IQ open API, which will be discussed shortly. This product won numerous awards at CES and was praised for its versatility, ultra-thin form factor and long battery life, which differentiates it from the rest of the market. 
We also introduced the vívofit 2, which features a backlit display, audible alerts and an exciting collection of band options that will appeal to a broad range of consumers. We are encouraged by the recent performance of the fitness segment, and we look forward to another exciting year of new product introductions and growth.
Looking beyond 2015. We believe that numerous opportunities exist within the fitness and wellness domain, and we will continue to pursue these as global consumers become increasingly health conscious. We will focus on delivering innovative products in the market, offering a complete experience via compelling form factors, wireless connectivity and sensors. We will deliver a best-in-class experience to our Garmin Connect Community with support for a broad range of activities, social networking, coaching and partnerships with companies like Strava and myfitnesspal. We will expand on the essential nature of our products through third-party apps offered via Connect IQ. The screen capture is depicted here to illustrate a few of the unique applications being designed for our active lifestyle customers.
And finally, we will target additional share in the growing activity tracking market by delivering industry-leading utility and form factors that meet the needs of a diverse set of consumers.
Looking next to outdoor. We recorded year-over-year revenue growth of 4%. Wearables, dog tracking and training and action cameras contributed to this growth. The outdoor segment continued to generate strong growth in operating margins in 2014 at 62% and 35%, respectively. This represented a slight decline in margins compared to 2013 due to product mix and advertising investment. However, we expect the margin profile for outdoor to stabilize in 2015. 
Exiting 2014, we recognize that the segment was not as strong as we had hoped, as we faced headwinds due to unfavorable dynamics in the golf industry and mature nature of the handheld market and our niche status in the action camera market. Looking at 2015, we expect growth in wearables, dog tracking and training and action cameras to be offset by declines in our traditional handheld business and ongoing negative trends industry-wide in golf. Despite these trends, we're excited about recent product introductions with fenix 3 and the epix, which were also well received at CES. And we expect to introduce more new products as the year progresses.
Beyond 2015, we will focus on new opportunities in adjacent markets and product categories to further expand our addressable market, as we have successfully done in the past. We will make additional investments in the growth areas of wearables and action cameras to broaden our product line and drive market share gains. We will support these initiatives with appropriate advertising and sponsorships like the recently announced partnership with Red Bull, featuring the VIRB Elite as the official action camera of the Red Bull Air Race World Championships. In addition, we will utilize Connect IQ to enhance utility and differentiate our unique product portfolio.
Turning next to aviation. We recorded year-over-year revenue growth of 14%, driven by strength in both OEM and aftermarket product categories. Operating income increased 22% for the year, ahead of revenue growth, as both gross and operating margins improved. In 2014, we launched Garmin avionics on additional Part 25 aircraft, and this trend will continue in 2015. 
For the 11th consecutive year, Garmin was ranked #1 in avionics product support by Professional Pilot Magazine. And as many of you know, this world-class support is a key ingredient for success in the aviation market and particularly so on the demanding Part 25 aircraft category. I congratulate on our team on earning this award once again, which is a testament to the amazing way in which we care for our customers. In 2015, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 10% in the aviation segment with growth in both OEM and aftermarket product categories. We will continue to support numerous partners in the completion of aircraft and helicopter certifications. 
In early January, Garmin and Gulfstream announced that Garmin will be providing the certified ADS-B solution for the G115 -- G150 model aircraft. We are pleased to add Gulfstream to our growing list of OEM partners.
Longer term, our aviation growth initiatives are focused on continued development of our G3000, G5000 and G5000H platforms with OEM partners, which is the foundation for long-term market share expansion, identifying aftermarket opportunities as well as commercial off-the-shelf opportunities within the military and government sectors that leverage our core capabilities, developing unique technologies that address gaps in our product portfolio and finally, capitalizing on opportunities created by the FAA's transformation of the National Airspace System and other global initiatives and mandates.
Moving next to marine. We reported year-over-year revenue growth of 11%, including our second half acquisition of Fusion. Gross margin was steady at 52%, while operating margins improved to 11%. The pricing environment in marine electronics remains highly competitive, which has pressured segment profitability. Despite this challenge, we posted improved operating margins, and our operating profit grew 42% over the previous year. 
For 2015, we're targeting revenue growth of approximately 10% in the marine segment, driven by recent product introductions and a full year contribution of Fusion. We will remain focused on gaining market share, while managing costs and driving efficiencies to improve long-term profitability. 
In the long term, our objectives include increasing our market share in recreational boating with specific emphasis on opportunities in the fishing and sailing markets. We will capitalize on acquisitions made in recent years to further diversify our product portfolio. In addition, we plan to grow our OEM market share by leveraging our full range of products including chartplotters, radar, sonar, autopilot and the entertainment systems. As previously mentioned, we will execute the discipline to improve our profitability of our marine business over the long term.
And looking finally at the automobile segment. Revenues declined 5% for the full year, as lower PND revenues were partially offset by market share gains, growth in OEM and contributions from deferred revenue. According to our estimates, we held approximately 45% market share in 2014 on a global basis and achieved 86% share in the fourth quarter in the U.S. market, representing yet another quarter of market share gain. Though industry headwinds were challenging, segment margins improved due to the contribution of deferred revenue, and we generated over $215 million of operating income for the year. We secured additional OEM relationships in 2014, including the announcement with Honda on the Civic and CR-V in specific geographies. 
Looking at 2015, we expect the PND market to continue along its current trajectory, and we also expect to recognize less deferred revenue versus the prior year. These factors lead to a forecasted revenue decline of approximately 15%. We will focus on market share leadership and maximizing profitability in PNDs, as we have successfully done for many years. We believe we will continue to gain momentum in the expanding infotainment market, as customers embrace increasing levels of in-dash technology and OEM search for partners that can deliver unique value to the market. 
Beyond 2015, we'll focus on expanding our auto OEM business through additional program wins, delivering innovative in-vehicle technology in both aftermarket and OEM applications, managing the profitability of the segment as the PND market continues to decline and capitalizing our niche opportunities in areas such as motorcycle, over-the-road trucking and RV.
Well, as you can see, we are excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2015. However, in addition to the market headwinds I've highlighted, we also face significant revenue headwinds in the near term due to the rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar. With this in mind, we are projecting revenues of approximately $2.9 billion with stable gross margins at 56%. We are projecting operating income of approximately $675 million with operating margins of approximately 23%, as we continue to grow our R&D investment and manage other expenses in line with revenues. 
Factoring in an anticipated effective tax rate of 16% to 17%, 2015 pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $3.10 or flat compared to 2014. Note that the FX situation negatively impacted our revenue and EPS guidance by about 300 basis points. Given the strength of our 2014 results, we will propose an increased dividend at our upcoming annual meeting, and we will participate in share repurchases as market conditions warrant. We believe these actions will result in strong returns for shareholders over the long term.
So that concludes my remarks. Doug will now walk through our Q4 and full year financials in more detail. Doug?"

I'll then move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement, taxes and 2015 guidance. We posted revenue of $803 million for the fourth quarter, representing a 6% increase year-over-year even with headwinds created by the weakening of the euro. 
Gross margin was strong at 54%. The 170 basis point increase from prior year, driven by segment mix and favorable impact from deferred revenue. Operating income grew by 2% to $176 million. Operating margin was 22%, a decrease of 80 basis points from the prior year. This result of gross margin favorability of 170 basis points has more than offset by operating expense growth of 15% or $33 million due to increased spending in both advertising and research and development. 
With the pro forma effective tax rate of 19% adjustments for the foreign currency gain or tax benefit from our lease of material reserves, pro forma EPS was $0.77. This represents a 1% increase year-over-year. We shipped 5.1 million units during the quarter, up 14% from 4.5 million last year. Total company average selling price was $157 per unit, down 7% from $169 in the prior quarter, primarily due to fitness product mix.
Looking at full year results. We posted revenue of $2.87 billion for the year, representing a 9% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was strong at 56%. A 240 basis point increase from prior year, driven by segment mix and a favorable impact from deferred revenue. 
Operating income increased 20% to $691 million compared to $574 million in 2013. Operating margin was 24%, an increase of 230 basis points from prior year. This was a result of gross margin favorability of 240 basis points that was slightly offset by operating expense growth of 10% or $81 million due to increased spending in both advertising and research and development. For 2014 pro forma effective tax rate was approximately 17%, which was in line with 2013. After adjusting for foreign currency loss, a tax impact of the intercompany restructuring and a tax benefit from release of material reserves, our pro forma EPS was $3.10. This represents an 18% increase year-over-year. Units shipped were up 9% from 15.2 million units delivered during the year.
Next, we'll review how our fourth quarter revenue breaks down by segment. We experienced growth in 3 of our 5 segments led by fitness with a 70% growth. Looking at the chart on this page, the automobile segment represent a 42% of our total revenue during the fourth quarter 2014, down from 49% in the prior year. Fitness grew to 25% of revenue in the current period compared to 16% in the prior year. These charts illustrate our profitability mix by segment. Our non-auto segments delivered 68% of operating income in the quarter, flat to the prior year quarter. Drilling down on year-over-year gross margin, total company gross margin improved to 54% due to positive segment mix and improved margins in automobile. 
Aviation and marine posted the only sizable gross margin declines, both were negatively impacted by product mix. And as Cliff discussed, marine was further pressured to the competitive pricing dynamics. Total operating margin was 22%, down slightly from the prior quarter due to increased advertising spend offsetting a strong gross margin performance.
Looking briefly at full year metrics. Revenue contribution for 2014 shifted away from the automobile, segment, which represented 43% of our total revenue during 2014, down from 49% in the prior year. Fitness grew to 20% of revenue for the full year compared to 14% in the prior year. We generated 69% of operating income in our non-automobile segments during 2014.
As previously mentioned, fourth quarter operating expense increased by $33 million or 15%, while increasing 250 basis points as a percent of sales. Research and development increased $9 million year-over-year and 50 basis points to 12.6% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation and grow our engineering workforce, increasing resources focused primarily on aviation, fitness and outdoor. Our advertising expense increased $19 million over the prior year quarter and represented 6.7% of sales, a 210 basis point increase. Additional spending was focused primarily on fitness to support new product categories. We will continue to manage our advertising cost by segment with a near-term focus on market share growth in wearables.
SG&A was up $4 million compared to the prior year quarter, decreasing 10 basis points as a percent of sales to 12.3%. We continue to manage these costs closely to an operating leverage when possible.
We ended the quarter with cash, marketable securities of almost $2.8 billion. Accounts receivable increased both sequentially and year-over-year to $570 million as a result of the higher holiday sales volume in 2014. Our inventory balance decreased to $420 million on a sequential basis that closes fourth quarter, as we exited a stronger holiday quarter prepared for the seasonally lower first quarter. Year-over-year, we are maintaining adequate inventory levels to support new product categories with sufficient supply of raw materials. We continue to generate strong free cash flow across our business with $127 million generated during the fourth quarter and $528 million for the full year. Through our dividend and stock repurchase activity during 2014, we returned over $600 million of cash to our shareholders.
Our pro forma effective tax rate for fourth quarter 2014 was 19.1% compared to 20% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Pro forma tax rate in the fourth quarter 2014 excludes a tax benefit from material release of the reserves. Pro forma effective tax rate decline was driven by the favorable impact with approval of a 2014 R&D tax credit, which was largely offset by unfavorable income mix by tax jurisdiction resulting from foreign currency fluctuations, as well as reduced tax incentives in Taiwan. There's no material change in our full year pro forma effective tax rate between 2013 and 2014. We expect our full year tax rate in 2015 to be between 16% and 17%, relatively consistent with prior years. 
We announced this morning that we'd plan to seek shareholder approval for increased dividend beginning with the June 2015 calendar quarter. Proposal was $0.51 per share per quarter or $2.04 annually, increase from our current quarterly rate of $0.48 per share. We also announced that the Board of Directors authorized the company to repurchase up to $300 million of the company shares as market and business conditions warrant through December 31, 2016.
Let's review our 2015 guidance. I'd like to further highlight that we anticipate growth in 3 segments in 2015, expect our non-auto segments represent over 60% of our revenue in 2015. As highlighted in our guidance, we will continue to invest in 2015 for long-term growth opportunities across the entire business, positioning us to continue to generate significant shareholder returns.

As announced earlier today, Garmin recorded fourth quarter revenue growth of 6% and strong gross margin performance, which contributed to another quarter of pro forma EPS growth. Outdoor, Fitness, Aviation and",1901,"Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin recorded fourth quarter revenue growth of 6% and strong gross margin performance, which contributed to another quarter of pro forma EPS growth. Outdoor, Fitness, Aviation and Marine revenues increased 23% on a combined basis, which more than offset an 11% decline in Auto/Mobile. The non-Auto/Mobile segments represented 58% of our revenue in the holiday quarter. 
Gross margins improved year-over-year to 54%, driven by the revenue mix shifting towards our higher-margin segments and due to the recognition of higher-margin revenues that were previously deferred. Operating margin declined slightly to 22% as we made significant investments in advertising. These investments were consistent with our strategy to grow our share in the activity tracker market through higher consumer awareness and improved representation at retail.
Looking briefly at our full year performance. We delivered 4 consecutive quarters of revenue growth and strong margin performance, resulting in pro forma EPS growth of 18%. On a combined basis, our growth segments contributed over $1.6 billion in revenue for the year or 57% of the total and generated 69% of our operating income. Gross and operating margins improved to 56% and 24%, respectively, allowing us to generate over $3 of pro forma EPS for the first time since 2009. This is a major accomplishment made possible by our growth initiatives and the dedication of Garmin associates around the world. For the full year, we returned over $600 million to shareholders via our quarterly dividend and share repurchase program in 2014.
So next, I'll review each of our business segments highlighting 2014 performance, our 2015 outlook and a brief summary of long-term strategic initiatives. Starting first in the fitness segment. We recorded year-over-year revenue growth of 60%. Activity trackers led the way, but our core categories of cycling and running also delivered impressive results. Though competition is intense in this high-growth area, our portfolio of differentiated products delivered stable gross and operating margin of 63% and 34%, respectively. 
For the full year, we secured approximately 15% share in the highly competitive activity tracker market. We believe this is a significant accomplishment, especially considering the short time we've been in the market, and is one we can build upon in 2015 and beyond. 
2015, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 25% on top of the impressive growth of 2014. At CES, we introduced the vívofit 2 and the vívoactive, expanding our family of products targeting the activity tracker market. The vívoactive is a smartwatch for the active consumer, combining smart alerts and daily activity tracking with key features for runners, cyclists and golfers. The vívoactive is expandable through our Connect IQ open API, which will be discussed shortly. This product won numerous awards at CES and was praised for its versatility, ultra-thin form factor and long battery life, which differentiates it from the rest of the market. 
We also introduced the vívofit 2, which features a backlit display, audible alerts and an exciting collection of band options that will appeal to a broad range of consumers. We are encouraged by the recent performance of the fitness segment, and we look forward to another exciting year of new product introductions and growth.
Looking beyond 2015. We believe that numerous opportunities exist within the fitness and wellness domain, and we will continue to pursue these as global consumers become increasingly health conscious. We will focus on delivering innovative products in the market, offering a complete experience via compelling form factors, wireless connectivity and sensors. We will deliver a best-in-class experience to our Garmin Connect community with support for a broad range of activities, social networking, coaching and partnerships with companies like Strava and myfitnesspal. We will expand on the essential nature of our products through third-party apps offered via Connect IQ. The screen capture is depicted here to illustrate a few of the unique applications being designed for our active lifestyle customers.
And finally, we will target additional share in the growing activity tracking market by delivering industry-leading utility and form factors that meet the needs of a diverse set of consumers.
Looking next to Outdoor. We recorded year-over-year revenue growth of 4%. Wearables, dog tracking and training and action cameras contributed to this growth. The outdoor segment continued to generate strong gross and operating margins in 2014 at 62% and 35%, respectively. This represented a slight decline in margins compared to 2013 due to product mix and advertising investment. However, we expect the margin profile for Outdoor to stabilize in 2015. 
Exiting 2014, we recognize that the segment was not as strong as we had hoped, as we faced headwinds due to unfavorable dynamics in the golf industry and mature nature of the handheld market and our niche status in the action camera market. Looking at 2015, we expect growth in wearables, dog tracking and training and action cameras to be offset by declines in our traditional handheld business and ongoing negative trends industry-wide in golf. Despite these trends, we're excited about recent product introductions with fenix 3 and the epix, which were also well received at CES. And we expect to introduce more new products as the year progresses.
Beyond 2015, we will focus on new opportunities in adjacent markets and product categories to further expand our addressable market, as we have successfully done in the past. We will make additional investments in the growth areas of wearables and action cameras to broaden our product line and drive market share gains. We will support these initiatives with appropriate advertising and sponsorships like the recently announced partnership with Red Bull, featuring the VIRB Elite as the official action camera of the Red Bull Air Race World Championships. In addition, we will utilize Connect IQ to enhance utility and differentiate our unique product portfolio.
Turning next to Aviation. We recorded year-over-year revenue growth of 14%, driven by strength in both OEM and aftermarket product categories. Operating income increased 22% for the year, ahead of revenue growth, as both gross and operating margins improved. In 2014, we launched Garmin avionics on additional Part 25 aircraft, and this trend will continue in 2015. 
For the 11th consecutive year, Garmin was ranked #1 in avionics product support by Professional Pilot magazine. And as many of you know, this world-class support is a key ingredient for success in the aviation market and particularly so on the demanding Part 25 aircraft category. I congratulate on our team on earning this award once again, which is a testament to the amazing way in which we care for our customers. In 2015, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 10% in the Aviation segment with growth in both OEM and aftermarket product categories. We will continue to support numerous partners in the completion of aircraft and helicopter certifications. 
In early January, Garmin and Gulfstream announced that Garmin will be providing the certified ADS-B solution for the G115 -- G150 model aircraft. We are pleased to add Gulfstream to our growing list of OEM partners.
Longer term, our Aviation growth initiatives are focused on continued development of our G3000, G5000 and G5000H platforms with OEM partners, which is the foundation for long-term market share expansion; identifying aftermarket opportunities as well as commercial off-the-shelf opportunities within the military and government sectors that leverage our core capabilities; developing unique technologies that address gaps in our product portfolio; and finally, capitalizing on opportunities created by the FAA's transformation of the National Airspace System and other global initiatives and mandates.
Moving next to Marine. We reported year-over-year revenue growth of 11%, including our second half acquisition of Fusion. Gross margin was steady at 52%, while operating margins improved to 11%. The pricing environment in marine electronics remains highly competitive, which has pressured segment profitability. Despite this challenge, we posted improved operating margins, and our operating profit grew 42% over the previous year. 
For 2015, we're targeting revenue growth of approximately 10% in the Marine segment, driven by recent product introductions and a full year contribution of Fusion. We will remain focused on gaining market share, while managing costs and driving efficiencies to improve long-term profitability. 
In the long term, our objectives include increasing our market share in recreational boating with specific emphasis on opportunities in the fishing and sailing markets. We will capitalize on acquisitions made in recent years to further diversify our product portfolio. In addition, we plan to grow our OEM market share by leveraging our full range of products including chartplotters, radar, sonar, autopilot and entertainment systems. As previously mentioned, we will execute the discipline to improve our profitability of our Marine business over the long term.
And looking finally at the Auto/Mobile segment. Revenues declined 5% for the full year, as lower PND revenues were partially offset by market share gains, growth in OEM and contributions from deferred revenue. According to our estimates, we held approximately 45% market share in 2014 on a global basis and achieved 86% share in the fourth quarter in the U.S. market, representing yet another quarter of market share gain. Though industry headwinds were challenging, segment margins improved due to the contribution of deferred revenue, and we generated over $215 million of operating income for the year. We secured additional OEM relationships in 2014, including the announcement with Honda on the Civic and CR-V in specific geographies. 
Looking at 2015, we expect the PND market to continue along its current trajectory, and we also expect to recognize less deferred revenue versus the prior year. These factors lead to a forecasted revenue decline of approximately 15%. We will focus on market share leadership and maximizing profitability in PNDs as we have successfully done for many years. We believe we will continue to gain momentum in the expanding infotainment market, as customers embrace increasing levels of in-dash technology and OEM search for partners that can deliver unique value to the market. 
Beyond 2015, we'll focus on expanding our auto OEM business through additional program wins, delivering innovative in-vehicle technology in both aftermarket and OEM applications, managing the profitability of the segment as the PND market continues to decline and capitalizing our niche opportunities in areas such as motorcycle, over-the-road trucking and RV.
Well, as you can see, we are excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2015. However, in addition to the market headwinds I've highlighted, we also face significant revenue headwinds in the near term due to the rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar. With this in mind, we are projecting revenues of approximately $2.9 billion with stable gross margins at 56%. We are projecting operating income of approximately $675 million with operating margins of approximately 23%, as we continue to grow our R&D investment and manage other expenses in line with revenues. 
Factoring in an anticipated effective tax rate of 16% to 17%, 2015 pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $3.10 or flat compared to 2014. Note that the FX situation negatively impacted our revenue and EPS guidance by about 300 basis points. Given the strength of our 2014 results, we will propose an increased dividend at our upcoming annual meeting, and we will participate in share repurchases as market conditions warrant. We believe these actions will result in strong returns for shareholders over the long term.
So that concludes my remarks. Doug will now walk through our Q4 and full year financials in more detail. Doug?"

I'd like to begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results. I'll then move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement, taxes and 2015 guidance. We posted revenue of $803 million for",1152,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results. I'll then move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement, taxes and 2015 guidance. We posted revenue of $803 million for the fourth quarter, representing a 6% increase year-over-year even with headwinds created by the weakening of the euro. 
Gross margin was strong at 54%, the 170 basis point increase from prior year driven by segment mix and favorable impact from deferred revenue. Operating income grew by 2% to $176 million. Operating margin was 22%, a decrease of 80 basis points from the prior year. This result of gross margin favorability of 170 basis points has more than offset by operating expense growth of 15% or $33 million due to increased spending in both advertising and research and development. 
With a pro forma effective tax rate of 19%, adjustments for the foreign currency gain or tax benefit from our lease of material reserves, pro forma EPS was $0.77. This represents a 1% increase year-over-year. We shipped 5.1 million units during the quarter, up 14% from 4.5 million last year. Total company average selling price was $157 per unit, down 7% from $169 in the prior quarter, primarily due to fitness product mix.
Looking at full year results. We posted revenue of $2.87 billion for the year, representing a 9% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was strong at 56%, a 240 basis point increase from prior year, driven by segment mix and a favorable impact from deferred revenue. 
Operating income increased 20% to $691 million compared to $574 million in 2013. Operating margin was 24%, an increase of 230 basis points from the prior year. This was a result of gross margin favorability of 240 basis points that was slightly offset by operating expense growth of 10% or $81 million due to increased spending in both advertising and research and development. For 2014, pro forma effective tax rate was approximately 17%, which was in line with 2013. After adjusting for foreign currency loss, a tax impact of the intercompany restructuring and a tax benefit from release of material reserves, our pro forma EPS was $3.10. This represents an 18% increase year-over-year. Units shipped were up 9% from 15.2 million units delivered during the year.
Next, we'll review how our fourth quarter revenue breaks down by segment. We experienced growth in 3 of our 5 segments led by fitness with a 70% growth. Looking at the charts on this page, the Auto/Mobile segment represent 42% of our total revenue during the fourth quarter 2014, down from 49% in the prior year. Fitness grew to 25% of revenue in the current period compared to 16% in the prior year. These charts illustrate our profitability mix by segment. Our non-auto segments delivered 68% of operating income in the quarter, flat to the prior year quarter. Drilling down on year-over-year gross margin, total company gross margin improved to 54% due to positive segment mix and improved margins in Auto/Mobile. 
Aviation and Marine posted the only sizable gross margin declines. Both were negatively impacted by product mix. And as Cliff discussed, Marine was further pressured due to competitive pricing dynamics. Total operating margin was 22%, down slightly from the prior quarter due to increased advertising spend offsetting a strong gross margin performance.
Looking briefly at full year metrics. Revenue contribution for 2014 shifted away from the Auto/Mobile segment, which represented 43% of our total revenue during 2014, down from 49% in the prior year. Fitness grew to 20% of revenue for the full year compared to 14% in the prior year. We generated 69% of operating income in our non-automobile segments during 2014.
As previously mentioned, fourth quarter operating expense increased by $33 million or 15%, while increasing 250 basis points as a percent of sales. Research and development increased $9 million year-over-year and 50 basis points to 12.6% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation and grow our engineering workforce, increasing resources focused primarily on Aviation, Fitness and Outdoor. Our advertising expense increased $19 million over the prior year quarter and represented 6.7% of sales, a 210 basis point increase. Additional spending was focused primarily on Fitness to support new product categories. We will continue to manage our advertising cost by segment with a near-term focus on market share growth in wearables.
SG&A was up $4 million compared to the prior year quarter, decreasing 10 basis points as a percent of sales to 12.3%. We continue to manage these costs closely to get an operating leverage when possible.
We ended the quarter with cash, marketable securities of almost $2.8 billion. Accounts receivable increased both sequentially and year-over-year to $570 million as a result of the higher holiday sales volume in 2014. Our inventory balance decreased to $420 million on a sequential basis that closes fourth quarter, as we exited a stronger holiday quarter prepared for the seasonally lower first quarter. Year-over-year, we are maintaining adequate inventory levels to support new product categories with sufficient supply of raw materials. We continue to generate strong free cash flow across our business with $127 million generated during the fourth quarter and $528 million for the full year. Through our dividend and stock repurchase activity during 2014, we returned over $600 million of cash to our shareholders.
Our pro forma effective tax rate for fourth quarter 2014 was 19.1% compared to 20% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Pro forma tax rate in the fourth quarter 2014 excludes a tax benefit from material release of the reserves. Pro forma effective tax rate decline was driven by the favorable impact with approval of a 2014 R&D tax credit, which was largely offset by unfavorable income mix by tax jurisdiction resulting from foreign currency fluctuations, as well as reduced tax incentives in Taiwan. There's no material change in our full year pro forma effective tax rate between 2013 and 2014. We expect our full year tax rate in 2015 to be between 16% and 17%, relatively consistent with prior years. 
We announced this morning that we'd plan to seek shareholder approval for an increased dividend beginning with the June 2015 calendar quarter. Proposal was $0.51 per share per quarter or $2.04 annually, increase from our current quarterly rate of $0.48 per share. We also announced that the Board of Directors authorized the company to repurchase up to $300 million of the company shares as market and business conditions warrant through December 31, 2016.
Quick review our 2015 guidance. I'd like to further highlight that we anticipate growth in 3 segments in 2015, expect our non-auto segments represent over 60% of our revenue in 2015. As highlighted in our guidance, we will continue to invest in 2015 for long-term growth opportunities across the entire business, positioning us to continue to generate significant shareholder returns.

As announced earlier this morning, Garmin recorded solid first quarter revenue and margin performance. Consolidated revenue was flat year-over-year in what is typically a seasonally weak quarter. Revenue from",977,"Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier this morning, Garmin recorded solid first quarter revenue and margin performance. Consolidated revenue was flat year-over-year in what is typically a seasonally weak quarter. Revenue from Aviation, Fitness, Marine and Outdoor grew 9% on a combined basis. These segments contributed 63% of total revenue and 80% of the operating profit in the first quarter. Gross margin improved year-over-year to 59%, while operating margin came in at 19%. A slight reduction in operating margin from the prior year reflects continued investments in advertising and R&D. The stronger U.S. dollar has created a headwind for most businesses including ours. We estimate that recent currency movements reduce our revenue by approximately $38 million, and operating income was reduced by approximately $11 million. As everyone can appreciate, these are meaningful amounts that would have otherwise resulted in growth for our business. Please note that our pro forma calculations do not account for these factors, but we wanted to mention it for clarity. 
Strong margins combined at the lower effective tax rate resulted in $0.55 of pro forma EPS in the quarter, which is flat on a year-over-year basis. We are maintaining the guidance we issued earlier in the year as our performance, thus far, is consistent with our expectations. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'll walk through a few highlights for each business segment. 
Beginning with the Fitness segment. Revenue grew 31% on a year-over-year basis with strong contributions from activity trackers, multisport and cycling products. We delivered growth in operating margins of 63% and 26%, respectively. Operating margin was lower on a year-over-year basis, reflecting an increase in R&D and advertising investments during the quarter, as planned. As you are aware, the Fitness market is highly competitive and, thus, requires additional R&D investments in order to bring innovations to market faster. In addition, we are deliberately investing in our point-of-sale presence as we roll out new products and prepare the way for our spring advertising campaign. 
In cycling, we announced the Vector 2 and 2S, our latest pedal-based power solutions. These new Vectors simplify the installation process and deliver cycling metrics that are useful for improving cycling efficiency. Fitness has been an exciting growth driver for our business in recent quarters, and we believe there are more opportunities to capture. We are well positioned with our current product breadth and depth, and we'll continue to invest for future growth and expansion. 
Looking at Outdoor. Revenues declined 10%, which fell short of our expectations as the currency situation disproportionately impacted both Fitness and Outdoor due to the geographic revenue profile of these segments. Additionally, we experienced some supply constraints, which affected our results. Despite these headwinds, growth and operating margins remained strong in the segment at 66% and 31%, respectively, allowing us to deliver operating income growth on lower revenue. 
Finally, on Outdoor, we announced the X and XE and all new family of action cameras. These cameras deliver a unique, immersive experience through G-Metrix, which adds insightful context to any video. In addition, our updated mobile application provides the ability to create, edit and publish videos on-the-go. We're excited about the capabilities of these new cameras and believe they offer unique differentiators from which we can grow in the category. 
Turning next Aviation. We posted revenue growth of 2% as we face a more challenging comparable from Q1 2014 when the segment grew 19%. While growth and operating margins remained strong, operating profit declined on a year-over-year basis due to R&D growth, supporting future revenue opportunities. During the quarter, we announced enhancements our ADS-B product offerings, our current line up offers the most comprehensive set of solutions across a range of price points and categories. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on modernization mandates around the globe, which are rapidly approaching. 
We continue to support numerous OEM partners in the development and certification of multiple aircraft and helicopter platforms, which will result in future growth opportunities when these platforms each the market. 
Looking next to Marine. Revenue grew 7% in the quarter, driven by the recent acquisition of Fusion. Our organic business was relatively flat on a year-over-year basis as we started delivering our new products in the latter part of the quarter. Profitability improved in the first quarter, which resulted in operating income growth of 20% for the segment. Our industry activity remains below historical levels we recognized that innovation is essential to deliver long-term improvements in market share and profitability. We will continue to invest in the category to deliver compelling innovation to recreational marine market. 
In our Auto segment, revenues were down 11% in the quarter, with PND industry volumes declining in line with expectations. On a year-over-year basis, advertise revenue declined creating a headwind as it's correlated to the underlying business. As we have mentioned before, the segment delivered solid profitability as we continue to experience gains in global market share on the strength of our product portfolio. As indicated in our February guidance, we expect the markets to decline 10% to 15% on a global basis during the year. We will focus on growth opportunities in OEM, trucks, RVs, dash cameras and other specialty automotive products to partially offset lower consumer PND volumes. 
Finally, I want highlight the recent introduction of [indiscernible] which is the first PND to offer advance alerts such as forward collision and lane departure warnings. nüvi cam also includes an integrated dash camera to save video images whenever a crash or user-initiated event occurs. We are excited to deliver these advanced features to the PND market, and we anticipate offering similar products to OEM customers in the future. 
So that concludes my remarks for the morning. Doug will now walk us through our Q1 financials in more detail. Doug?"

I'd like to briefly review our financial results and then move to summary comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We posted revenue of $585 million for the quarter, a pro forma net income of $106 milli",696,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly review our financial results and then move to summary comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We posted revenue of $585 million for the quarter, a pro forma net income of $106 million. Pro forma EPS was $0.55 per share, excluding the FX loss. During the quarter, we face significant exposure foreign currency fluctuations, which resulted in a revenue headwind of $38 million or 6.5% of revenue. Taking into consideration the benefits, FX negatively impacted EPS for the quarter approximately $0.05 or 9% of pro forma EPS. In addition, amortization of deferred revenue is now a year-over-year headwind, negatively impacted revenue by $14 million, pro forma EPS approximately by $0.05. Excluding these headwinds, revenue growth would have been 9%, pro forma EPS growth of 18%. Gross margin was strong at 59%, a 210 basis points increase from prior year, driven by favorable segment and product mix. Operating margin was 19%, a 150 basis point decrease from the prior year. We look at operating expenses by category on a later slide. 
Our effective tax rate decreased to 12.3% in the current quarter compared to 16.6% in the prior year due to an improved income outlook for 2015 as compared to our outlook at the end of Q1 2014. We still anticipate a full year tax rate of 16% to 17%. The first quarter tax rate was positively impacted at least a $5 million of tax reserves a percentage of lower pretax income. In the quarter, we shipped over 3 million units, a 22% increase. Reduced average selling price in the quarter were due to product mix, FX, reduced contribution from deferred revenue. I don't see any significant price reductions on like-for-like products. 
Next, we look at how our first quarter revenue breaks down by segment. The other segment represented 37% of our total Q1 2015 revenue compared to 42% in Q1 2014. We continue to diversify our revenue base with growth in Fitness, Marine, and Aviation. 
I'd like to now briefly discuss gross margin, which increased to 59% as segments and product mix was favorable during the quarter. Looking at year-over-year changes by segment. Outdoor marine posted significant improvement to reduce discounting and favorable product mix. That is gross margin declined slightly to 63%, remained strong with a full portfolio products continue to perform well. Total corporate operating margin was 19% as operating expense growth outpaced revenue growth. Excluding the headwinds from FX, amortization of deferred revenue, operating margin would have been flat. 
Next, we look at operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses increased by $22 million or 10%. This is a 360 basis point increase as a percent of sales. Research and development increased $10 million year-over-year and 160 basis points to 18.1% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation and grow engineering workforce and increasing resources focused primarily Aviation, Fitness and Outdoor. Our advertising expense increased $3 million for the prior year quarter, represented 4% of sales, 50 basis point increase. This spending is focused on Fitness, investments in point-of-sale presence with key retailers to produce long-term revenue results in preparation for the launch of spring wearables advertising campaign. This saves us $9 million compared to prior quarter, freezing 150 basis points as a percent of sales to 16.9%. Increased spending is driven primarily by legal costs, IT expenses and product support costs that customer base continues to grow rapidly. 
Just a few quick highlights from the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $2.7 billion. Cash receivable decreased sequentially to $426 million [ph] following a holiday quarter. Our inventory balance increased to $470 million as we have build inventory level to support the launch of new product categories in preparation for the seasonally stronger second quarter. We continue to generate strong free cash flow across our business of $64 million generated from the first quarter 2015. In the quarter, we paid dividends of $92 million, repurchased $16 million of company stock but $284 million remains for purchase for December 2016.

As announced earlier this morning, Garmin reported solid first quarter revenue and margin performance. Consolidated revenue was flat year-over-year in what is typically a seasonally weak quarter. Revenue from",985,"Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier this morning, Garmin reported solid first quarter revenue and margin performance. Consolidated revenue was flat year-over-year in what is typically a seasonally weak quarter. Revenue from aviation, fitness, marine and outdoor grew 9% on a combined basis. These segments contributed 63% of total revenue and 80% of the operating profit in the first quarter.
Gross margin improved year-over-year to 59% while operating margin came in at 19%. A slight reduction in the operating margin from the prior year reflects continued investments in advertising and R&D. The stronger U.S. dollar has created a headwind for most businesses including ours. We estimate that recent currency movements reduce our revenue by approximately $38 million and operating income was reduced by approximately $11 million.
As everyone can appreciate, these are meaningful amounts that would have otherwise resulted in growth for our business. Please note that our pro forma calculations do not account for these factors, but we wanted to mention it for clarity.
Strong margins combined with the lower effective tax rate resulted in $0.55 of pro forma EPS in the quarter, which is flat on a year-over-year basis. We are maintaining the guidance we issued earlier in the year as our performance, thus far, is consistent with our expectations. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'll walk through a few highlights for each business segment.
Beginning with the fitness segment. Revenue grew 31% on a year-over-year basis with strong contributions from activity trackers, multisport and cycling products. We delivered gross and operating margins of 63% and 26%, respectively. Operating margin was lower on a year-over-year basis, reflecting an increase in R&D and advertising investments during the quarter as planned.
As you are aware, the fitness market is highly competitive and thus, requires additional R&D investments in order to bring innovations to market faster. In addition, we are deliberately investing in our point-of-sale presence as we roll out new products and prepare the way for our spring advertising campaign.
In cycling, we announced the Vector 2 and 2S, our latest pedal-based power solutions. These new Vectors simplify the installation process and deliver advanced cycling metrics that are useful for improving cycling efficiency.
Fitness has been an exciting growth driver for our business in recent quarters and we believe there are more opportunities to capture. We are well positioned with our current product breadth and depth, and we'll continue to invest for future growth and expansion. 
Looking at outdoor. Revenues declined 10%, which fell short of our expectations as the currency situation disproportionately impacted both fitness and outdoor due to the geographic revenue profile of these segments. Additionally, we experienced some supply constraints, which affected our results. Despite these headwinds, gross and operating margins remained strong in the segment at 66% and 31% respectively, allowing us to deliver operating income growth on lower revenue.
Finally, on outdoor, we announced the VIRB X and XE, an all-new family of action cameras. These cameras deliver a unique, immersive experience through G-Metrix, which adds insightful context to any video. In addition, our updated VIRB mobile application provides the ability to create, edit and publish videos on the go. We are excited about the capabilities of these new cameras and believe they offer unique differentiators from which we can grow in the category.
Turning next to aviation. We posted revenue growth of 2% as we faced a more challenging comparable from Q1 2014 when the segment grew 19%. While gross and operating margins remained strong, operating profit declined on a year-over-year basis due to R&D growth, supporting future revenue opportunities.
During the quarter, we announced enhancements to our ADS-B product offerings, our current lineup offers the most comprehensive set of solutions across a range of price points and aircraft categories. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on modernization mandates around the globe which are rapidly approaching. We continue to support numerous OEM partners in the development and certification of multiple aircraft and helicopter platforms, which will result in future growth opportunities when these platforms reach the market.
Looking next to marine. Revenue grew 7% in the quarter driven by the recent acquisition of Fusion. Our organic business was relatively flat on a year-over-year basis as we started delivering our new products in the latter part of the quarter. Profitability improved in the first quarter, which resulted in operating income growth of 20% for the segment.
While industry activity remains below historical levels, we recognize that innovation is essential to deliver long-term improvements in market share and profitability. We will continue to invest in the category to deliver compelling innovation to the recreational marine market.
In our auto segment, revenues were down 11% in the quarter, with PND industry volumes declining in line with expectations. On a year-over-year basis, amortized revenue declined, creating a headwind that's not correlated to the underlying business. As we have mentioned before, the segment delivers solid profitability as we continue to experience gains in global market share on the strength of our product portfolio.
As indicated on our February guidance, we expect the market to decline 10% to 15% on a global basis during the year. We will focus on growth opportunities in OEM, trucks, RVs, dash cameras and other specialty automotive products to partially offset lower consumer PND volumes.
Finally, I want highlight the recent introduction of nüvicam which is the first PND to offer advanced alerts such as forward collision and lane departure warnings. nüvicam also includes an integrated dash camera that saves video images whenever a crash or user-initiated event occurs. We are excited to deliver these advanced features to the PND market, and we anticipate offering similar products to OEM customers in the future.
So that concludes my remarks for the morning. Doug will now walk us through our Q1 financials in more detail. Doug?"

I'd like to briefly review our financial results then move to summary comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement.We posted revenue of $585 million for the quarter with pro forma net income of $106 millio",710,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly review our financial results then move to summary comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement.
We posted revenue of $585 million for the quarter with pro forma net income of $106 million. Pro forma EPS was $0.55 per share, excluding the FX loss. In the quarter, we faced significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations which resulted in a revenue headwind of $38 million or 6.5% of revenue.
Taking into consideration the offsetting benefits, FX negatively impacted EPS for the quarter approximately $0.05 or 9% of pro forma EPS. In addition, amortization of deferred revenue is now a year-over-year headwind, negatively impacted revenue by $14 million, pro forma EPS by approximately $0.05.
Excluding these headwinds, revenue growth would have been 9%, pro forma EPS growth of 18%. Gross margin was strong at 59%, a 210 basis points increase from prior year, driven by favorable segment and product mix. Operating margin was 19%, a 150 basis point decrease from the prior year. We will look at operating expenses by category on a later slide.
Our effective tax rate decreased to 12.3% in the current quarter compared to 16.6% in the prior year due to an improved income mix outlook for 2015 as compared to our outlook at the end of Q1 2014. We still anticipate a full year tax rate of 16% to 17%. The first quarter tax rate was positively impacted at least of $5 million of tax reserves, a percentage of lower pretax income.
In the quarter, we shipped over 3 million units, a 22% increase. Reduced average selling price in the quarter was due to product mix, FX, reduced contribution from deferred revenue. And I don't see any significant price reductions on like-for-like products.
Next, we'll look at how our first quarter revenue breaks down by segment. The auto segment represented 37% of our total Q1 2015 revenue compared to 42% in Q1 2014. We continue to diversify our revenue base with growth in fitness, marine and aviation.
I'd like to now briefly discuss gross margin which increased to 59% as segment and product mix was favorable during the quarter. Looking at year-over-year changes by segment, outdoor and marine posted significant improvement with reduced discounting and favorable product mix. Fitness gross margin declined slightly to 63%, remained strong with a full portfolio of products continuing to perform well. Total corporate operating margin was 19% as operating expense growth outpaced revenue growth. Excluding the headwinds from FX, amortization of deferred revenue, operating margin would have been flat.
Next, we'll look at operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses increased by $22 million or 10%. This is a 360 basis point increase as a percent of sales. Research and development increased $10 million year-over-year and 160 basis points to 18.1% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation and grow our engineering workforce and increasing resources focused primarily on aviation, fitness and outdoor.
Our advertising expense increased $3 million for the prior year quarter, represented 4.7% of sales, a 50 basis point increase. Additional spending was focused on fitness, investments in point-of-sale presence with key retailers to produce long-term revenue results and in preparation for the launch of spring wearables advertising campaign. SG&A was up $9 million compared to the prior quarter, increasing 150 basis points as a percent of sales to 16 9%. Increased spending was driven primarily by legal costs, IT expenses and product support costs as our customer base continues to grow rapidly.
Just a few quick highlights from the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $2.7 billion. Cash receivable decreased sequentially to $426 million following a holiday quarter. Our inventory balance increased to $470 million as we have built the inventory level to support the launch of the new product categories in preparation for the seasonally stronger second quarter.
We continue to generate strong free cash flow across our business with $64 million generated during the first quarter of 2015. In the quarter, we paid dividends of $92 million, repurchased $16 million of company stock with $284 million remaining for purchase through December 2016.
This concludes our formal remarks. Ashley, can you open the line for Q&A?"

As announced earlier this morning, Garmin reported solid first quarter revenue and margin performance. Consolidated revenue was flat year-over-year in what is typically a seasonally weak quarter. Revenue from",985,"Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier this morning, Garmin reported solid first quarter revenue and margin performance. Consolidated revenue was flat year-over-year in what is typically a seasonally weak quarter. Revenue from aviation, fitness, marine and outdoor grew 9% on a combined basis. These segments contributed 63% of total revenue and 80% of the operating profit in the first quarter.
Gross margin improved year-over-year to 59% while operating margin came in at 19%. A slight reduction in the operating margin from the prior year reflects continued investments in advertising and R&D. The stronger U.S. dollar has created a headwind for most businesses, including ours. We estimate that recent currency movements reduced our revenue by approximately $38 million and operating income was reduced by approximately $11 million.
As everyone can appreciate, these are meaningful amounts that would have otherwise resulted in growth for our business. Please note that our pro forma calculations do not account for these factors, but we wanted to mention it for clarity.
Strong margins combined with the lower effective tax rate resulted in $0.55 of pro forma EPS in the quarter, which is flat on a year-over-year basis. We are maintaining the guidance we issued earlier in the year as our performance, thus far, is consistent with our expectations. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'll walk through a few highlights for each business segment.
Beginning with the fitness segment. Revenue grew 31% on a year-over-year basis with strong contributions from activity trackers, multisport and cycling products. We delivered gross and operating margins of 63% and 26%, respectively. Operating margin was lower on a year-over-year basis, reflecting an increase in R&D and advertising investments during the quarter, as planned.
As you are aware, the fitness market is highly competitive and thus, requires additional R&D investments in order to bring innovations to market faster. In addition, we are deliberately investing in our point-of-sale presence as we roll out new products and prepare the way for our spring advertising campaign.
In cycling, we announced the Vector 2 and 2S, our latest pedal-based power solutions. These new Vectors simplify the installation process and deliver advanced cycling metrics that are useful for improving cycling efficiency.
Fitness has been an exciting growth driver for our business in recent quarters, and we believe there are more opportunities to capture. We are well positioned with our current product breadth and depth, and we'll continue to invest for future growth and expansion. 
Looking at outdoor. Revenues declined 10%, which fell short of our expectations as the currency situation disproportionately impacted both fitness and outdoor due to the geographic revenue profile of these segments. Additionally, we experienced some supply constraints, which affected our results. Despite these headwinds, gross and operating margins remained strong in the segment at 66% and 31%, respectively, allowing us to deliver operating income growth on lower revenue.
Finally, on outdoor, we announced the VIRB X and XE, an all-new family of action cameras. These cameras deliver a unique, immersive experience through G-Metrix, which adds insightful context to any video. In addition, our updated VIRB mobile application provides the ability to create, edit and publish videos on the go. We are excited about the capabilities of these new cameras and believe they offer unique differentiators from which we can grow in the category.
Turning next to aviation. We posted revenue growth of 2% as we faced a more challenging comparable from Q1 2014, when the segment grew 19%. While gross and operating margins remained strong, operating profit declined on a year-over-year basis due to R&D growth supporting future revenue opportunities.
During the quarter, we announced enhancements to our ADS-B product offerings, our current lineup offers the most comprehensive set of solutions across a range of price points and aircraft categories. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on modernization mandates around the globe, which are rapidly approaching. We continue to support numerous OEM partners in the development and certification of multiple aircraft and helicopter platforms, which will result in future growth opportunities when these platforms reach the market.
Looking next at marine. Revenue grew 7% in the quarter, driven by the recent acquisition of Fusion. Our organic business was relatively flat on a year-over-year basis as we started delivering our new products in the latter part of the quarter. Profitability improved in the first quarter, which resulted in operating income growth of 20% for the segment.
While industry activity remains below historical levels, we recognize that innovation is essential to deliver long-term improvements in market share and profitability. We will continue to invest in the category to deliver compelling innovation to the recreational marine market.
In our auto segment, revenues were down 11% in the quarter, with PND industry volumes declining in line with expectations. On a year-over-year basis, amortized revenue declined, creating a headwind that's not correlated to the underlying business. As we have mentioned before, the segment delivers solid profitability as we continue to experience gains in global market share on the strength of our product portfolio.
As indicated on our February guidance, we expect the market to decline 10% to 15% on a global basis during the year. We will focus on growth opportunities in OEM, trucks, RVs, dash cameras and other specialty automotive products to partially offset lower consumer PND volumes.
Finally, I want highlight the recent introduction of nüvicam, which is the first PND to offer advanced alerts such as forward collision and lane departure warnings. nüvicam also includes an integrated dash camera that saves video images whenever a crash or user-initiated event occurs. We are excited to deliver these advanced features to the PND market, and we anticipate offering similar products to OEM customers in the future.
So that concludes my remarks for the morning. Doug will now walk us through our Q1 financials in more detail. Doug?"
598655,290054118,797391,"Garmin Ltd., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly review our financial results, then move to summary comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement.We posted revenue of $585 million for the quarter with pro forma net income of $106 milli",703,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly review our financial results, then move to summary comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement.
We posted revenue of $585 million for the quarter with pro forma net income of $106 million. Pro forma EPS was $0.55 per share, excluding the FX loss. In the quarter, we faced significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, which resulted in a revenue headwind of $38 million or 6.5% of revenue.
Taking into consideration the offsetting benefits, FX negatively impacted EPS for the quarter approximately $0.05 or 9% of pro forma EPS. In addition, amortization of deferred revenue is now a year-over-year headwind, negatively impacted revenue by $14 million, pro forma EPS by approximately $0.05.
Excluding these headwinds, revenue growth would have been 9%, pro forma EPS growth of 18%. Gross margin was strong at 59%, a 210-basis-point increase from prior year, driven by favorable segment and product mix. Operating margin was 19%, a 150-basis-point decrease from the prior year. We will look at operating expenses by category on a later slide.
Our effective tax rate decreased to 12.3% in the current quarter compared to 16.6% in the prior year due to an improved income mix outlook for 2015 as compared to our outlook at the end of Q1 2014. We still anticipate a full year tax rate of 16% to 17%. The first quarter tax rate was positively impacted at least [ph] of $5 million of tax reserves as a percentage of lower pretax income.
In the quarter, we shipped over 3 million units, a 22% increase. Reduced average selling price in the quarter was due to product mix, FX, reduced contribution from deferred revenue. And I don't see any [ph] significant price reductions on like-for-like products.
Next, we'll look at how our first quarter revenue breaks down by segment. The auto segment represented 37% of our total Q1 2015 revenue compared to 42% in Q1 2014. We continue to diversify our revenue base with growth in fitness, marine and aviation.
I'd like to now briefly discuss gross margin, which increased to 59%, as segment and product mix was favorable during the quarter. Looking at year-over-year changes by segment, outdoor and marine posted significant improvement with reduced discounting and favorable product mix. Fitness gross margin declined slightly to 63%, but remained strong with a full portfolio of products continuing to perform well. Total corporate operating margin was 19% as operating expense growth outpaced revenue growth. Excluding the headwinds from FX, amortization of deferred revenue, operating margin would have been flat.
Next, we'll look at operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses increased by $22 million or 10%. This is a 360-basis-point increase as a percent of sales. Research and development increased $10 million year-over-year and 160 basis points to 18.1% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation and grow our engineering workforce and increasing resources focused primarily on aviation, fitness and outdoor.
Our advertising expense increased $3 million over the prior-year quarter, represented 4.7% of sales, a 50-basis-point increase. Additional spending was focused on fitness, investments in point-of-sale presence with key retailers to produce long-term revenue results and in preparation for the launch of spring wearables advertising campaign. SG&A was up $9 million compared to the prior quarter, increasing 150 basis points as a percent of sales to 16.9%. Increased spending was driven primarily by legal costs, IT expenses and product support costs as our customer base continues to grow rapidly.
Just a few quick highlights from the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $2.7 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $426 million following a holiday quarter. Our inventory balance increased to $470 million as we have built the inventory level to support the launch of new product categories in preparation for the seasonally stronger second quarter.
We continue to generate strong free cash flow across our business with $64 million generated during the first quarter of 2015. In the quarter, we paid dividends of $92 million, repurchased $16 million of company stock with $284 million remaining for purchase through December 2016.
This concludes our formal remarks. Ashley, can you open the line for Q&A?"

598655,306138858,841040,"Garmin Ltd., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As previously announced, Garmin reported second quarter revenue, which was down only slightly year-over-year despite significant downward pressure caused by a stronger U.S. dollar.

As previously announced, Garmin reported second quarter revenue, which was down only slightly year-over-year despite significant downward pressure caused by a stronger U.S. dollar. In the quarter, we shipped over 4 million units, representing an 8% increase over the prior year. Unfavorable currency movements continue to impact many global companies, and we are no exception. We estimate that unfavorable currency movements reduce revenue by approximately $59 million in the quarter, which affected revenue growth, margins and EPS. Note that our pro forma calculations do not account for these factors, but we offer this commentary to highlight the underlying strength of our business. 
Revenue from Aviation, Fitness, Marine and Outdoor grew 11% on a combined basis. These segments contributed 61% of the total revenue and 73% of the operating profit in the second quarter. Gross margin was 54% and operating margin came in at 22%. The reduction in margins from the prior year reflects a combination of factors, including downward pressure from unfavorable currency movements, the more competitive pricing environment and continued investments in advertising and R&D. These factors, combined with a higher effective tax rate, resulted in GAAP and pro forma EPS of $0.72 in the quarter. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'll provide a few comments on each business segment. 
Beginning with the Fitness revenue segment. Revenue grew 5% on a year-over-year basis, which is lower than both first quarter and the year-ago quarter. Looking closer, prior year growth reflected significant sell-in activity due to new product launches, which were not repeated in 2015. Additionally, as I mentioned last time, currency headwinds disproportionately impacted us in Outdoor due to the geographical revenue mix. In summary, while the growth rate slowed in the second quarter, we believe that the underlying foundation in this segment is solid. Growth in operating margins were 56% and 21%, respectively. Gross margin was impacted by unfavorable currency movements and product mix shifting towards lower-margin products, while operating margin was further impacted by increased R&D and advertising investments, which we believe position us for long-term success. 
In the second quarter, we began deliveries of the 400 225 [ph] which incorporates risk-based heart rate. We were pleased with the initial demand for this exciting new running watch. Finally, we introduced an exciting range of cycling products that offer new utility for enhanced performance and safety for the cycling community. 
Looking at Outdoor. Revenue grew 4% due to improved product supply and strong demand for our wearable devices. Growth in operating margins were relatively stable, allowing us to deliver operating income growth of 6%. While gross margin was comparable to last year, it was negatively impacted in the second quarter of 2014 due to an inventory reserve. As I just mentioned, our wearable devices have performed well in 2015, and our flagship product is fenix 3. This device appeals to a broad range of customers from those looking for multiple features to those who are more interested in [indiscernible] We see growth opportunities in the Outdoor wearable category, and we are making additional investments to capitalize on the opportunity. 
During the quarter, we introduced touchscreen technology into our best-selling eTrex series. In addition, we introduced a new model of our Rino Communicator product series. We expect these products will perform well in the back half of 2015. 
Turning next to Aviation. We posted revenue growth of 5%, driven growth in aftermarket sales. While growth and operating margins remain strong at 73% and 27%, respectively, operating profit declined slightly on a year-over-year basis due to R&D investments supporting future revenue opportunities. Last quarter, the General Aviation manufacturers Association reported the deliveries of new aircraft sales 15%, led by a 19% drop in aircraft deliveries. In addition, deliveries of helicopters saw 18%. Despite this near-term weakness, we continue to see long-term opportunities in the market and are supporting numerous OEM partners in the development and certification of multiple aircraft and helicopter platforms. 
Looking next to Marine. Revenue grew 41% in the quarter, driven by the strength of our 2015 product line up and contributions from our fusion range entertainment efficient, which was acquired in July of 2014. These strong results far exceed industry trends and demonstrate that we are gaining market share with our new combos and game-changing technology like the [indiscernible] sonar imaging system. 
In the Auto segment, revenues were down 15% in the quarter, with PND industry volumes declining in line with expectations. On a year-over-year basis, camera revenue declined creating a headwind that was not correlated to the underlying business. We believe that our market share is stable in the U.S. and has increased in Europe. As we've highlighted in prior quarters, we continue to focus on growth opportunities in OEM, trucks, RVs, gas, cameras and other specialty automotive products to partially offset lower consumer PND volumes. In the quarter, we expanded our truck portfolio with the introduction of the dezl cam, which is a premium all-in-one trucking navigator with an integrated  dash camera. The dezl cam also offers important truck reading and warning features that provide significant utility and value to the trucking community. 
Having passed the halfway point for 2015, we're updating our full year guidance. We continue to anticipate revenues of approximately $2.9 billion, which is unchanged from previous guidance despite the approximately $116 million of negative currency impact due to the stronger U.S. dollar. Our growth outlook has been adjusted in Marine and Aviation where we now expect 15% and 5% growth, respectively. Prior estimates were 10% for both segments. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 54% to 55%, down slightly from previous guidance due to unfavorable currency movements and in anticipation of competitive pricing dynamics in the back half of the year. We expect operating margin to be in the range of 20% to 21%, which include the additional R&D and advertising investment as outlined earlier. Finally, we anticipate pro forma EPS of approximately $2.65, which also reflects a higher anticipated tax rate for the full year. While it's disappointing to provide downward revisions our guidance, we believe the underlying business trends remain positive, and our investment in R&D and advertising are expected to result in new revenue opportunities and long-term growth. 
So that concludes my remarks for the morning. Doug will walk us through additional details on the financial results. Doug?"
598655,306138858,841040,"Garmin Ltd., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly review our financial results and move to summary comments and the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We've posted revenue of $774 million for the quarter with GAAP and pro forma net income of",766,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly review our financial results and move to summary comments and the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We've posted revenue of $774 million for the quarter with GAAP and pro forma net income of $138 million. Our GAAP and pro forma EPS was $0.72 per share. During the quarter, we faced significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, which resulted in a revenue headwind of $59 million or 7.6% of revenue. In addition, deferred revenue and amortization is a year-over-year headwind negatively impacted revenue by $12 million. Gross margin declined to 54%, a 300 basis points decrease from prior year. Operating margin was 22%, a 660 basis point decrease from the prior year. Finally, the effective tax rate increased to 20.6% in the current quarter compared to 12.8% in the prior year. This create further earnings pressure of $0.07. We'll discuss gross margin, operating expenses and effective tax rate in more detail later. 
Next, we will look at our second quarter revenue breaks down by segment. The Auto segment represent a 39% of our total second quarter 2015 revenue compared to 45% of second quarter of 2014. We continue to diversify our revenue base, with marine increasing to 13% and fitness increasing to 21% of total second quarter 2015 revenue. 
I'd like to discuss gross margin next, which decreased to 54%, driven largely by the currency headwind, which reduced revenues by $59 million on a constant currency basis. Looking at year-over-year material changes by segment. Auto was negatively impacted by the FX reduced revenues and reduced contribution from amortization of high-margin deferred revenue and cost. Fitness gross margin declined due to the FX reduced revenues, competitive pricing dynamics and product mix shifting toward activity trucker category in the current quarter. Outdoor gross margin was flat year-over-year as the impact of FX reduced revenues was offset by the prior year inventory reserve accrual. Marine gross margin was down slightly, but the currency impact on revenue was largely offset by positive product mix due to accessible introduction for 2015 lineup of products. Total corporate operating margin was 22%, as operating expense growth outpaced revenue growth. 
Looking next to operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses decreased by $27 million or 12%. This is a 360 basis point increase as a percent of sales. Research and development increased $11 million year-over-year, 150 basis points to 14.1% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation with increasing resources focused primarily on Aviation, Fitness and Outdoor. Our advertising expense increased $11 million from the prior year quarter and represented 5.9% of sales, 140 basis point increase. Additional spending was focused on Fitness and Marine with investments in media, point-of-sale presence with key retailers and co-op advertising. SG&A was up $5 million compared to the prior quarter, increasing 70 basis points as a percent of sales to 12.6%. Increased spending was driven primarily by legal cost, IT expenses and product support cost as our customer base continues to grow rapidly. 
Just a few quick highlights from balance the sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $502 million, following the seasonally stronger second quarter. Our inventory balance decreased to $458 million as we exited the seasonally strong second quarter remains higher than 2014 to support new product categories. In the second quarter of 2015, we generated free cash flow of $64 million after adjusting for the $183 million tax payment associated with our intercompany restructuring, which was initiated in 2014. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $92 million and repurchased $41 million of company stock with $243 million remaining for purchase through December 2016. 
Finally, I did mentioned previously, our effective tax rate increased to 20.6% in the current quarter compared to 12.8% in the second quarter of 2014. The increased tax rate was primarily a result of a forecasted income mix by tax jurisdiction, which negatively impacted by the overall reduction in forecast taxable income that result in catch-up expense in the first quarter. In addition, the current year release of tax reserves associated with the expiration of stature limitations was $1.6 million compared to $5.2 million in the prior year. Our full year effective tax rate is now expected to be 18% to 19% due to change in income mix by tax jurisdiction. Consistent with last year, the full year effective tax rate forecast assumed a passage of the R&D tax credit. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Amanda, could you please open the lines for Q&A?"

The market is growing rapidly, and so consequently, the opportunity is there, and so we feel like it's the right time to invest in those things. Historically, we've always scaled our investments according to the market opportunities, so we will continue to do that in this market as well. And in terms of cross-product functionality, I'm not quite sure I understand exactly what your question is. Maybe you could elaborate a little bit more on that."

As previously announced, Garmin reported second quarter revenue, which was down only slightly year-over-year despite a significant downward pressure caused by a stronger U.S. dollar. In the quarter, we shipped",1078,"Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As previously announced, Garmin reported second quarter revenue, which was down only slightly year-over-year despite a significant downward pressure caused by a stronger U.S. dollar. In the quarter, we shipped over 4 million units representing an 8% increase over the prior year. Unfavorable currency movements continue to impact many global companies, and we are no exception. We estimate that unfavorable currency movements reduce revenue by approximately $59 million in the quarter, which affected revenue growth, margins and EPS. Note that our pro forma calculations do not account for these factors, but we offer this commentary to highlight the underlying strength of our business. 
Revenue from Aviation, Fitness, Marine and Outdoor grew 11% on a combined basis. These segments contributed 61% of the total revenue and 73% of the operating profit in the second quarter. Gross margin was 54%, and operating margin came in at 22%. The reduction in margins from the prior year reflects a combination of factors including downward pressure from unfavorable currency movements, the more competitive pricing environment and continued investments in advertising and R&D. These factors, combined with a higher effective tax rate, resulted in GAAP and pro forma EPS of $0.72 in the quarter. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'll provide a few comments on each business segment. 
Beginning with the Fitness segment. Revenue grew 5% on a year-over-year basis, which is lower than both first quarter and the year ago quarter. Looking closer, prior year growth reflected significant sell-in activity due to new product launches, which were not repeated in 2015. Additionally, as I mentioned last time, currency headwinds disproportionately impact Fitness and Outdoor due to the geographical revenue mix. 
In summary, while the growth rate slowed in the second quarter, we believe that the underlying foundation in this segment is solid. 
Growth in operating margins were 56% and 21%, respectively. Gross margin was impacted by unfavorable currency movements and product mix shifting towards lower-margin products, while operating margin was further impacted by increased R&D and advertising investments, which we believe position us for long-term success. 
In the second quarter, we began deliveries of the Forerunner 225, which incorporates risk-based heart rate. We were pleased with the initial demand for this exciting new running watch. Finally, we introduced an exciting range of cycling products that offer new utility for enhanced performance and safety for the cycling community. 
Looking at Outdoor. Revenue grew 4% due to improved product supply and strong demand for our wearable devices. Growth in operating margins were relatively stable allowing us to deliver operating income growth of 6%. While gross margin was comparable to last year, it was negatively impacted in the second quarter of 2014 due to an inventory reserve. 
As I just mentioned, our wearable devices have performed well in 2015, and our flagship product is the fenix 3. This device appeals to a broad range of customers from those looking for multisport features to those who are more interested in style. We see growth opportunities in the Outdoor wearable category, and we are making additional investments to capitalize on the opportunity. 
During the quarter, we introduced touchscreen technology into our best-selling eTrex series. In addition, we introduced a new model of our Rino communicator product series. We expect these products will perform well in the back half of 2015. 
Turning next to Aviation. We posted revenue growth of 5% driven by growth in aftermarket sales. While growth and operating margins remain strong at 73% and 27%, respectively, operating profit declined slightly on a year-over-year basis due to R&D investments supporting future revenue opportunities. 
Last quarter, the General Aviation Manufacturers Association reported that deliveries of new aircraft sell 15% led by a 19% drop in piston aircraft deliveries. In addition, deliveries of helicopters sell 18%. Despite this near-term weakness, we continue to see long-term opportunities in the market and are supporting numerous OEM partners in the development and certification of multiple aircraft and helicopter platforms. 
Looking next to Marine. Revenue grew 41% in the quarter driven by the strength of our 2015 product lineup and contributions from our FUSION Marine Entertainment division, which was acquired in July of 2014. These strong results far exceed industry trends and demonstrate that we are gaining market share with our new chartplatter combos and game-changing technology like our Panoptix real-time sonar imaging system. 
In the Auto segment, revenues were down 15% in the quarter, with PND industry volumes declining in line with expectations. On a year-over-year basis, camera size revenue declined creating a headwind that was not correlated to the underlying business. We believe that our market share is stable in the U.S. and has increased in Europe. 
As we've highlighted in prior quarters, we continue to focus on growth opportunities in OEM, trucks, RVs, gas cameras and other specialty automotive products to partially offset lower consumer PND volumes. 
In the quarter, we expanded our truck portfolio with the introduction of the dezl cam, which is a premium all-in-one trucking navigator with an integrated  dash camera. The dezl cam also offers important truck routing and warning features that provide significant utility and value to the trucking community. 
Having passed the halfway point for 2015, we're updating our full year guidance. We continue to anticipate revenues of approximately $2.9 billion, which is unchanged from previous guidance despite the approximately $116 million of negative currency impact due to the stronger U.S. dollar. Our growth outlook has been adjusted in Marine and Aviation where we now expect 15% and 5% growth, respectively. Prior estimates were 10% for both segments. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 54% to 55%, down slightly from previous guidance due to unfavorable currency movements and in anticipation of competitive pricing dynamics in the back half of the year. We expect operating margin to be in the range of 20% to 21%, which include the additional R&D and advertising investments as outlined earlier. Finally, we anticipate pro forma EPS of approximately $2.65, which also reflects a higher anticipated tax rate for the full year. While it's disappointing to provide downward revisions to our guidance, we believe that the underlying business trends remain positive, and our investment in R&D and advertising are expected to result in new revenue opportunities and long-term growth. 
So that concludes my remarks for the morning. Doug will walk us through additional details on the financial results. Doug?"
598655,306138858,841238,"Garmin Ltd., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly review our financial results and move to summary comments and the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We've posted revenue of $774 million for the quarter with GAAP and pro forma net income o",762,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly review our financial results and move to summary comments and the balance sheet and cash flow statement. 
We've posted revenue of $774 million for the quarter with GAAP and pro forma net income of $138 million. Our GAAP and pro forma EPS was $0.72 per share. During the quarter, we faced significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, which resulted in a revenue headwind of $59 million or 7.6% of revenue. In addition, deferred revenue and amortization is a year-over-year headwind, negatively impacted revenue by $12 million. Gross margin declined to 54%, a 300-basis-point decrease from prior year. Operating margin was 22%, a 660-basis-point decrease from the prior year. Finally, the effective tax rate increased to 20.6% in the current quarter compared to 12.8% in the prior year. This created further earnings pressure of $0.07. We'll discuss gross margin, operating expenses and effective tax rate in more detail later. 
Next, we will look at our second quarter revenue breaks down by segment. The Auto segment represent a 39% of our total second quarter 2015 revenue compared to 45% in the second quarter of 2014. We continue to diversify our revenue base with Marine increasing to 13% and Fitness increasing to 21% in our total second quarter 2015 revenue. 
I'd like to discuss gross margin next, which decreased to 54% driven largely by the currency headwind, which reduced revenues by $59 million on a constant currency basis. 
Looking at year-over-year material changes by segment. Auto was negatively impacted by the FX reduced revenues and reduced contribution from amortization of high-margin deferred revenue and cost. Fitness gross margin declined due to the FX reduced revenues, competitive pricing dynamics and product mix shifting toward activity tracker category in the current quarter. Outdoor gross margin was flat year-over-year as the impact of the FX reduced revenues was offset by the prior year inventory reserve accrual. Marine gross margin was down slightly, but the currency impact on revenue was largely offset by positive product mix due to accessible introduction of our 2015 lineup of products. Total corporate operating margin was 22%, as operating expense growth outpaced revenue growth. 
Looking next to operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses increased  by $27 million or 12%. This is a 360-basis-point increase as a percent of sales. Research and development increased $11 million year-over-year, 150 basis points to 14.1% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation with increasing resources focused primarily on Aviation, Fitness and Outdoor. Our advertising expense increased $11 million from the prior year quarter and represented 5.9% of sales, 140-basis-point increase. Additional spending was focused on Fitness and Marine with investments in media, point-of-sale presence with key retailers and co-op advertising. SG&A was up $5 million compared to the prior quarter increasing 70 basis points as a percent of sales to 12.6%. Increased spending was driven primarily by legal cost, IT expenses and product support cost as our customer base continues to grow rapidly. 
Just a few quick highlights from balance the sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $502 million following the seasonally stronger second quarter. Our inventory balance decreased to $458 million as we exited the seasonally strong second quarter. It remains higher than 2014 supporting new product categories. During the second quarter of 2015, we generated free cash flow of $64 million after adjusting for the $183 million tax payment associated with our intercompany restructuring, which was initiated in 2014. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $92 million and repurchased $41 million of company stock with $243 million remaining for purchase through December 2016. 
Finally, as I mentioned previously, our effective tax rate increased to 20.6% in the current quarter compared to 12.8% in the second quarter of 2014. The increased tax rate was primarily a result of forecasted income mix by tax jurisdiction, which is negatively impacted by the overall reduction in forecasted taxable income that result in catch-up expense for the first quarter. In addition, the current year release of tax reserves associated with the expiration of statute limitations was $1.6 million compared to $5.2 million in the prior year. Our full year effective tax rate is now expected to be 18% to 19% due to change in income mix by tax jurisdiction. Consistent with last year, the full year effective tax rate forecast assumed a passage of the R&D tax credit. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Amanda, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

As previously announced, Garmin reported second quarter revenue, which was down only slightly year-over-year despite significant downward pressure caused by a stronger U.S. dollar. In the quarter, we shipped o",1074,"Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As previously announced, Garmin reported second quarter revenue, which was down only slightly year-over-year despite significant downward pressure caused by a stronger U.S. dollar. In the quarter, we shipped over 4 million units, representing an 8% increase over the prior year. Unfavorable currency movements continue to impact many global companies, and we are no exception. We estimate that unfavorable currency movements reduced revenue by approximately $59 million in the quarter, which affected revenue growth, margins and EPS. Note that our pro forma calculations do not account for these factors, but we offer this commentary to highlight the underlying strength of our business.
Revenue from Aviation, Fitness, Marine and Outdoor grew 11% on a combined basis. These segments contributed 61% of the total revenue and 73% of the operating profit in the second quarter. Gross margin was 54%, and operating margin came in at 22%. The reduction in margins from the prior year reflects a combination of factors, including downward pressure from unfavorable currency movements, a more competitive pricing environment and continued investments in advertising and R&D. These factors, combined with a higher effective tax rate, resulted in GAAP and pro forma EPS of $0.72 in the quarter. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'll provide a few comments on each business segment. 
Beginning with the Fitness segment. Revenue grew 5% on a year-over-year basis, which is slower than both first quarter and the year ago quarter. Looking closer, prior year growth reflected significant sell-in activity due to new product launches, which were not repeated in 2015. Additionally, as I mentioned last time, currency headwinds disproportionately impact Fitness and Outdoor due to the geographical revenue mix.
In summary, while the growth rate slowed in the second quarter, we believe that the underlying foundation in this segment is solid. 
Gross and operating margins were 56% and 21%, respectively. Gross margin was impacted by unfavorable currency movements and product mix shifting towards lower-margin products, while operating margin was further impacted by increased R&D and advertising investments, which we believe position us for long-term success. 
In the second quarter, we began deliveries of the Forerunner 225, which incorporates wrist-based heart rate. We are pleased with the initial demand for this exciting new running watch. Finally, we introduced an exciting range of cycling products that offer new utility for enhanced performance and safety for the cycling community. 
Looking at Outdoor. Revenue grew 4% due to improved product supply and strong demand for our wearable devices. Gross and operating margins were relatively stable, allowing us to deliver operating income growth of 6%. While gross margin was comparable to last year, it was negatively impacted in the second quarter of 2014 due to an inventory reserve. 
As I just mentioned, our wearable devices have performed well in 2015, and our flagship product is the fenix 3. This device appeals to a broad range of customers, from those looking for multisport features to those who are more interested in style. We see growth opportunities in the Outdoor wearable category, and we are making additional investments to capitalize on the opportunity. 
During the quarter, we introduced touchscreen technology into our best-selling eTrex series. In addition, we introduced a new model of our Rino communicator product series. We expect these products will perform well in the back half of 2015. 
Turning next to Aviation. We posted revenue growth of 5% driven by growth in aftermarket sales. While gross and operating margins remained strong at 73% and 27%, respectively, operating profit declined slightly on a year-over-year basis due to R&D investments supporting future revenue opportunities. 
Last quarter, the General Aviation Manufacturers Association reported that deliveries of new aircraft fell 15%, led by a 19% drop in piston aircraft deliveries. In addition, deliveries of helicopters fell 18%. Despite this near-term weakness, we continue to see long-term opportunities in the market and are supporting numerous OEM partners in the development and certification of multiple aircraft and helicopter platforms.
Looking next at Marine. Revenue grew 41% in the quarter, driven by the strength of our 2015 product lineup and contributions from our FUSION Marine Entertainment division, which was acquired in July of 2014. These strong results far exceed industry trends and demonstrate that we are gaining market share with our new chartplatter combos and game-changing technology like our Panoptix real-time sonar imaging system. 
In the Auto segment, revenues were down 15% in the quarter, with PND industry volumes declining in line with expectations. On a year-over-year basis, amortized revenue declined, creating a headwind that was not correlated to the underlying business. We believe that our market share is stable in the U.S. and has increased in Europe.
As we've highlighted in prior quarters, we continue to focus on growth opportunities in OEM, trucks, RVs, dash cameras and other specialty automotive products to partially offset lower consumer PND volumes.
In the quarter, we expanded our truck portfolio with the introduction of the dezlCam, which is a premium all-in-one trucking navigator with an integrated  dash camera. The dezlCam also offers important truck routing and warning features that provide significant utility and value to the trucking community. 
Having passed the halfway point for 2015, we're updating our full year guidance. We continue to anticipate revenues of approximately $2.9 billion, which is unchanged from previous guidance, despite the approximately $116 million of negative currency impact due to the stronger U.S. dollar. Our growth outlook has been adjusted in Marine and Aviation, where we now expect 15% and 5% growth, respectively. Prior estimates were 10% for both segments. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 54% to 55%, down slightly from previous guidance due to unfavorable currency movements and in anticipation of competitive pricing dynamics in the back half of the year. We expect operating margin to be in the range of 20% to 21%, which include the additional R&D and advertising investments as outlined earlier. Finally, we anticipate pro forma EPS of approximately $2.65, which also reflects a higher anticipated tax rate for the full year. While it's disappointing to provide downward revision to our guidance, we believe that the underlying business trends remain positive, and our investments in R&D and advertising are expected to result in new revenue opportunities and long-term growth. 
So that concludes my remarks for the morning. Doug will walk us through additional details on the financial results. Doug?"
598655,306138858,841409,"Garmin Ltd., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly review our financial results, then move to summary comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement.

I'd like to briefly review our financial results, then move to summary comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. 
We've posted a revenue of $774 million for the quarter, with GAAP and pro forma net income of $138 million. Our GAAP and pro forma EPS was $0.72 per share. During the quarter, we faced significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, which resulted in a revenue headwind of $59 million or 7.6% of revenue. In addition, deferred revenue amortization was a year-over-year headwind, negatively impacted revenue by $12 million. Gross margin declined to 54%, a 300-basis-point decrease from prior year. Operating margin was 22%, a 660-basis-point decrease from the prior year. Finally, the effective tax rate increased to 20.6% in the current quarter compared to 12.8% in the prior year. This created further earnings pressure of $0.07. We'll discuss gross margin, operating expenses and effective tax rate in more detail later.
Next, we will look at our second quarter revenue breaks down by segment. The Auto segment represented 39% of our total second quarter 2015 revenue compared to 45% in the second quarter of 2014. We continue to diversify our revenue base, with Marine increasing to 13% and Fitness increasing to 21% of our total second quarter 2015 revenue.
I'd like to discuss gross margin next, which decreased to 54%, driven largely by the currency headwind, which reduced revenues by $59 million on a constant currency basis.
Looking at year-over-year material changes by segment. Auto was negatively impacted by the FX reduced revenues and reduced contribution from amortization of high-margin deferred revenue and cost. Fitness gross margin declined due to the FX reduced revenues, competitive pricing dynamics and product mix shifting toward the activity tracker category in the current quarter. Outdoor gross margin was flat year-over-year as the impact of the FX reduced revenues was offset by the prior year inventory reserve accrual. Marine gross margin was down slightly as the currency impact on revenue was largely offset by positive product mix due to accessible introduction of our 2015 lineup of products. Total corporate operating margin was 22%, as operating expense growth outpaced revenue growth. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses increased by $27 million or 12%. This is a 360-basis-point increase as a percent of sales. Research and development increased $11 million year-over-year, 150 basis points to 14.1% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation, with increasing resources focused primarily on Aviation, Fitness and Outdoor. Our advertising spent increased $11 million from the prior year quarter and represented 5.9% of sales, 140-basis-point increase. Additional spending was focused on Fitness and Marine, with investments in media, point-of-sale presence with key retailers and co-op advertising. SG&A was up $5 million compared to the prior quarter, increasing 70 basis points as a percent of sales to 12.6%. Increased spending was driven primarily by legal costs, IT expenses and product support costs as our customer base continues to grow rapidly. 
Just a few quick highlights from the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $502 million following the seasonally stronger second quarter. Our inventory balance decreased to $458 million as we exited the seasonally strong second quarter but remains higher than 2014 to support new product categories. During the second quarter of 2015, we generated free cash flow of $64 million after adjusting for the $183 million tax payment associated with our intercompany restructuring, which was initiated in 2014. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $92 million and repurchased $41 million of company stock, with $243 million remaining for purchase through December 2016. 
Finally, as I mentioned previously, our effective tax rate increased to 20.6% in the current quarter compared to 12.8% in the second quarter of 2014. The increased tax rate was primarily a result of forecasted income mix by tax jurisdictions, which is negatively impacted by the overall reduction in forecasted taxable income and the result in [ph] catch-up expense for the first quarter. In addition, the current year release of tax reserves associated with the expiration of statute limitations was $1.6 million compared to $5.2 million in the prior year. Our full year effective tax rate is now expected to be 18% to 19% due to the change in income mix by tax jurisdiction. Consistent with last year, the full year effective tax rate forecast assumed the passage of the R&D tax credit. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Amanda, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

First, I wondered if you could talk, if not exact numbers, maybe qualitatively in terms of the Outdoor business. What percentage of that should we think about as being wearables at this point versus handheld? And then on the Auto segment, the operating margins are down quite a bit year-over-year, although still well into the double-digits. I'm just wondering as we look out the next year or 2 in that segment, if it were to continue to decline, at what point do you put your foot in the sand and kind of say, ""We're not willing to run this segment below a certain operating margin target""?"

As previously announced, Garmin reported third quarter revenue decreased [ph] 4% year-over-year. Aviation, fitness, marine and outdoor contributed 61% of total revenues and 75% of the operating profit in the third quarter. We continue to see our revenue base diversify broadly across our business segments.
Gross margin was 53%, and operating margin came in at 18.5%. The reduction in margins from the prior year reflects a combination of factors, including downward pressure from unfavorable currency movements and more competitive pricing environment, particularly in the fitness market; and continued investments in advertising and R&D. These factors, combined with a higher effective tax rate, resulted in pro forma EPS of $0.51 in the quarter.
Throughout the year, we have highlighted that the strong U.S. dollar created revenue headwinds in geographies with weaker currencies. In contrast, unit deliveries were up 4% for the quarter and 10% for the year due to the contribution of income growth statements. While our primary yardstick is financial performance, we are encouraged by the underlying trends reflected in unit growth.
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'll provide a few comments on each business segment.
Beginning with the fitness segment. Revenue grew 23% on a year-over-year basis with the sequential acceleration driven by strength in activity trackers, multisport and cycling products. It's interesting to note, the currency headwind disproportionately impacted fitness segment due to geographical revenue mix. These headwinds softened revenue growth, while unit deliveries have remained strong. We believe this indicates that the underlying business case remains sound. Gross and operating margins were 54% and 19%, respectively. Gross margin was impacted by unfavorable currency movements and competitive dynamics in the market. Operating margin was impacted by increased spending in R&D and global advertising. We believe these investments are strategically important in order to maximize the opportunity in this high-growth segment.
We recently introduced a new family of Forerunner products, which includes 3 models, the Forerunner 230, 235 and 630. Notably, the Forerunner 235 is our first wearable to incorporate Garmin Elevate technology. Garmin Elevate is a wrist-based heart rate sensor we specifically developed to serve a broad range of use cases from all-day heart rate tracking to intense workouts. All of the new Forerunners are compatible with our Connect IQ application framework, enabling users to personalize their watches with a host of interesting watch faces, custom data fields and useful applications developed by third parties.
We also recently introduced an exciting new activity tracker called vívosmart HR, which also features Garmin Elevate technology for all-day heart rate tracking and activity intensity monitoring. Garmin Elevate technology combines with an always-on display and smart notifications, makes the vívosmart HR one of the most capable activity trackers available on the market. To support these products and many others, we released a major update of Garmin Connect mobile. This update features a completely new user interface, making it easy to view important activity information at a glance and providing even more customization to fit individual needs. All of these new products are shipping now, and we will soon launch a major new advertising campaign to support sales during the upcoming holiday shopping season.
Looking at outdoor. Revenue declined 5% year-over-year as the revenue mix shifted to geographies with weaker currencies. Growth in operating margins were stable sequentially but declined year-over-year, driven primarily by currency weakness and product mix.
The Fenix 3 has been an exciting success story this year. During the quarter, we expanded the available choices for Fenix 3 with new color and material options in time for the holiday shopping season.
Turning next to aviation. Revenue declined 5% as the industry has been impacted by lower oil prices and soft market volatility. Gross and operating margins remained strong, 74% and 25%, respectively, though operating margin declined on a year-over-year basis due to R&D growth supporting future revenue opportunities. While the industry slowdown is disappointing, we remain confident in our improving position in the business jet category and look forward to completing development and certification of additional aircraft platforms, as previously announced. We remain confident in our market position and the opportunities for long-term growth.
Looking next at marine. Revenue was flat in the third quarter as the boating season ended and we passed the first anniversary of the July 2014 acquisition of Fusion. Gross and operating margin improved as the mix shifted to new products with higher margin profiles. Our investment in innovation has resulted in increased market share and industry-wide recognition. Garmin was recently honored as a Manufacturer of the Year by the National Marine Electronics Association. We also won 4 product-specific awards in the autopilot, multifunction display and smartphone applications categories. We intend to build on this momentum in the coming year with additional innovation and market share gains.
In the auto segment, revenues were down 14% in the quarter, driven by the secular decline in the PND market as expected. However, our worldwide market share remains stable and strong. The PND market is an important part of our business, and we remain focused on delivering a superior in-vehicle experience. The most recent example is babyCam, which was announced earlier this month. babyCam is a backseat monitoring system that streams wireless video to compatible Garmin PNDs. This system provides front-seat passengers the ability to safely monitor the well-being of other passengers or cargo or [indiscernible]
As previously announced, we have updated our full year guidance and now anticipate revenues of approximately $2.8 billion, which includes approximately $185 million of negative currency impact due to the stronger U.S. dollar. Our revenue outlook has been adjusted in fitness, outdoor and aviation, which are the segments most impacted by the economic and competitive factors mentioned previously. We expect gross margin to be approximately 53.5%, down slightly from previous guidance, due to unfavorable geographic revenue mix and competitive pricing dynamics in the fitness segment. Due to the revenue and gross margin revisions, we now expect operating margin to be approximately 18.5%. Finally, we anticipate pro forma EPS of approximately $2.25, which also reflects the higher anticipated tax rate for the full year. While it's disappointing to revise our guidance, we believe that the underlying business trends remain positive and our investments in R&D and advertising will create long-term opportunities.
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'd like to briefly review our financial results and then move to summary comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We posted revenue of $680 million for the quarter, pro forma net income of $97 million.",599,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly review our financial results and then move to summary comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We posted revenue of $680 million for the quarter, pro forma net income of $97 million. Pro forma EPS was $0.51 per share. During the quarter, we faced significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, which resulted in a revenue headwind of $52 million or 7% of revenue. Gross margin declined 53%, a 310 basis point decrease from prior year. Operating margin was 18.5%, a 640 basis point decrease from the prior year. Finally, the effective tax rate increased to 27.7% in the current quarter compared to a pro forma rate of 21% in the prior year. This created earnings pressure of $0.05 per share. We will discuss gross margin, operating expenses and effective tax rate in more detail later.
Next, we'll look at third quarter revenue by segment. The auto segment represented 39% of our total Q3 2015 revenue compared to 44% in the third quarter 2014. We continue to diversify our revenue base, with fitness increasing to 21% our total Q3 2015 revenue.
Next, I'd like to discuss gross margin. This decrease to 53.3%, driven largely by the currency headwind, reduced revenue by $52 million in constant-currency basis as well as pricing dynamics in the fitness segment. Total corporate operating margin was 18.5% due to gross margin pressure and increased R&D investment.
Looking next at operating expenses. Third quarter operating expense increased by $14 million or 6%. This is a 330 basis point increase in percent of sales. Research and development increased $7 million year-over-year or 150 basis points to 15.6% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused primarily on aviation, fitness and outdoor, where we see long-term growth opportunities. Our advertising expense increased $4 million from the prior year quarter and represented 5.4% of sales, a 70 basis point increase. Additional spending was focused on fitness with investments in media, point-of-sale presence with key retailers and cooperative advertising. SG&A was up $3 million compared to the prior quarter, increasing 100 basis points as percent of sales to 13.8%. Increased spending was driven primarily by IT expenses and product support causes as our customer base continues to grow rapidly.
Just a few quick highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable increased both sequentially and year-over-year to $432 million. Our inventory balance increased to $503 million to prepare for the fourth quarter to launch a number of new products simultaneously. During the third quarter 2015, we generated free cash flow of $124 million. Also in the quarter, we paid dividends of $97 million and repurchased $51 million of company stock, with $192 million remaining for purchase in December 2016.
Finally, as I mentioned previously, effective tax rate increased to 27.7% in the current quarter compared to a pro forma rate of 21% in the third quarter 2014. Increased tax rate was primarily the result of forecasted income mix by tax jurisdiction, which is negatively impacted by the overall reduction in forecast of taxable income, which resulted in catch-up expense for the first half of 2015. Our full year effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 21.5% due to the change in income mix by tax jurisdiction. Consistent with last year, the full year effective tax rate forecast assumes a passage of the R&D tax credit.

So our approach would be to plan our 2016 based on, of course, how we view the markets towards the end of this year. In terms of the revisions and kind of commenting on where we're at, I think our situation with the currency is not so much an issue of lower demand or lower quantities, but it really is pressure on the revenue side and the translation of currency. We've had some particularly strong results in some of those currency-effected areas, which is actually a good problem to have. But from the pricing point of view, it's very difficult to change the pricing in a short-term basis. So we're doing what we can in the short term to increase prices where we have some ability to do that. It's a longer-term solution. It's really with products, new products and innovation."

As previously announced, Garmin reported third quarter revenue decreased 4% year-over-year. Aviation, fitness, marine and outdoor contributed 61% of total revenues and 75% of the operating profit in the third",1072,"Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As previously announced, Garmin reported third quarter revenue decreased 4% year-over-year. Aviation, fitness, marine and outdoor contributed 61% of total revenues and 75% of the operating profit in the third quarter. We continue to see our revenue base diversify broadly across our business segments.
Gross margin was 53%, and operating margin came in at 18.5%. The reduction in margins from the prior year reflects a combination of factors, including downward pressure from unfavorable currency movements; a more competitive pricing environment, particularly in the fitness market; and continued investments in advertising and R&D. These factors, combined with a higher effective tax rate, resulted in pro forma EPS of $0.51 in the quarter.
Throughout the year, we have highlighted that the strong U.S. dollar created revenue headwinds in geographies with weaker currencies. In contrast, unit deliveries were up 4% for the quarter and 10% for the year due to the contribution from growth segments. While our primary yardstick is financial performance, we are encouraged by the underlying trends reflected in unit growth.
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'll provide a few comments on each business segment. Beginning with the fitness segment. Revenue grew 23% on a year-over-year basis, with the sequential acceleration driven by strength in activity trackers, multisport and cycling products. It's interesting to note that currency headwinds disproportionately impacted fitness segment due to the geographical revenue mix. These headwinds have softened revenue growth while unit deliveries have remained strong. We believe this indicates that the underlying business case remains sound. 
Gross and operating margins were 54% and 19%, respectively. Gross margin was impacted by unfavorable currency movements and competitive dynamics in the market. Operating margin was impacted by increased spending in R&D and global advertising. We believe these investments are strategically important in order to maximize the opportunity in this high-growth segment.
We recently introduced a new family of Forerunner products, which includes 3 models, the Forerunner 230, 235 and 630. Notably, the Forerunner 235 is our first wearable to incorporate Garmin Elevate technology. Garmin Elevate is a wrist-based heart rate sensor we specifically developed to serve a broad range of use cases from all-day heart rate tracking to intense workouts. All of the new Forerunners are compatible with our Connect IQ application framework, enabling users to personalize their watches with a host of interesting watch faces, custom data fields and useful applications developed by third parties.
We also recently introduced an exciting new activity tracker called vívosmart HR, which also features Garmin Elevate technology for all-day heart rate tracking and activity intensity monitoring. Garmin Elevate technology, combined with an always-on display and smart notifications, makes the vívosmart HR one of the most capable activity trackers available on the market. 
To support these products and many others, we have released a major update of Garmin Connect Mobile. This update features a completely new user interface, making it easy to view important activity information at a glance and providing even more customizations to fit individual needs. All of these new products are shipping now, and we will soon launch a major new advertising campaign to support sales during the upcoming holiday shopping season.
Looking at outdoor. Revenue declined 5% year-over-year as the revenue mix shifted to geographies with weaker currencies. Gross and operating margins were stable sequentially but declined year-over-year, driven primarily by currency weakness and product mix. The fenix 3 has been an exciting success story this year. During the quarter, we expanded the available choices for fenix 3 with new color and material options in time for the holiday shopping season.
Turning next to aviation. Revenue declined 5% as the industry has been impacted by lower oil prices and soft market volatility. Gross and operating margins remained strong, 74% and 25%, respectively, though operating margin declined on a year-over-year basis due to R&D growth supporting future revenue opportunities. While the industry slowdown is disappointing, we remain confident in our improving position in the business jet category and look forward to completing development and certification of additional aircraft platforms, as previously announced. We remain confident in our market position and the opportunities for long-term growth.
Looking next at marine. Revenue was flat in the third quarter as the boating season ended and we passed the first anniversary of the July 2014 acquisition of FUSION. Gross and operating margins improved as the mix shifted to new products with higher margin profiles. Our investment in innovation has resulted in increased market share and industry-wide recognition. Garmin was recently honored as Manufacturer of the Year by the National Marine Electronics Association. We also won 4 product-specific awards in the autopilot, multifunction display and smartphone applications categories. We intend to build on this momentum in the coming year with additional innovation and market share gains.
In the auto segment, revenues were down 14% in the quarter, driven by the secular decline of the PND market, as expected. However, our worldwide market share remains stable and strong. The PND market is an important part of our business, and we remain focused on delivering a superior in-vehicle experience. The most recent example is babyCam, which was announced earlier this month. babyCam is a backseat monitoring system that streams wireless video to compatible Garmin PNDs. This system provides front-seat passengers the ability to safely monitor the well-being of other passengers or cargo at a glance. 
As previously announced, we have updated our full year guidance and now anticipate revenues of approximately $2.8 billion, which includes approximately $185 million of negative currency impact due to the stronger U.S. dollar. Our revenue outlook has been adjusted in fitness, outdoor and aviation, which are the segments most impacted by the economic and competitive factors mentioned previously. We expect gross margin to be approximately 53.5%, down slightly from previous guidance, due to unfavorable geographic revenue mix and competitive pricing dynamics in the fitness segment. 
Due to the revenue and gross margin revisions, we now expect operating margin to be approximately 18.5%. Finally, we anticipate pro forma EPS of approximately $2.25, which also reflects the higher anticipated tax rate for the full year. While it's disappointing to revise our guidance, we believe that the underlying business trends remain positive and our investments in R&D and advertising will create long-term opportunities.
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"
598655,314119867,883867,"Garmin Ltd., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly review our financial results and then move to summary comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We posted revenue of $680 million for the quarter and pro forma net income of $97 milli",608,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly review our financial results and then move to summary comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We posted revenue of $680 million for the quarter and pro forma net income of $97 million. Pro forma EPS was $0.51 per share. During the quarter, we faced significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, which resulted in a revenue headwind of $52 million or 7% of revenue. 
Gross margin declined to 53%, a 310 basis point decrease from prior year. Operating margin was 18.5%, a 640 basis point decrease from the prior year. Finally, the effective tax rate increased to 27.7% in the current quarter compared to a pro forma rate of 21% in the prior year. This created earnings pressure of $0.05 per share. We'll discuss gross margin, operating expenses and effective tax rate in more detail later.
Next, we'll look at third quarter revenue by segment. The auto segment represented 39% of our total Q3 2015 revenue compared to 44% in the third quarter 2014. We continue to diversify our revenue base, with fitness increasing to 21% of our total Q3 2015 revenue.
Next, I'd like to discuss gross margin. This decrease to 53.3%, driven largely by the currency headwind, which reduced revenue by $52 million on a constant-currency basis, as well as pricing dynamics in the fitness segment. Total corporate operating margin was 18.5% due to gross margin pressure and increased R&D investment.
Looking next at operating expenses. Third quarter operating expense increased by $14 million or 6%. This is a 330 basis point increase as a percent of sales. Research and development increased $7 million year-over-year or 150 basis points to 15.6% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused primarily on aviation, fitness and outdoor, where we see long-term growth opportunities. 
Our advertising expense increased $4 million from the prior year quarter and represented 5.4% of sales, a 70 basis point increase. Additional spending was focused on fitness with investments in media, point-of-sale presence with key retailers and cooperative advertising. SG&A was up $3 million compared to the prior quarter, increasing 100 basis points as a percent of sales to 13.8%. Increased spending was driven primarily by IT expenses and product support causes as our customer base continues to grow rapidly.
Just a few quick highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable decreased both sequentially and year-over-year to $432 million. Our inventory balance increased to $503 million to prepare for the fourth quarter when we launch a number of new products simultaneously. During the third quarter of 2015, we generated free cash flow of $124 million. Also in the quarter, we paid dividends of $97 million and repurchased $51 million of company stock, with $192 million remaining for purchase through December 2016.
Finally, as I mentioned previously, our effective tax rate increased to 27.7% in the current quarter compared to a pro forma rate of 21% in the third quarter 2014. Increased tax rate was primarily the result of forecasted income mix by tax jurisdiction, which is negatively impacted by the overall reduction in forecast of taxable income and resulted in catch-up expense for the first half of 2015. Our full year effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 21.5% due to the change in income mix by tax jurisdiction. Consistent with last year, the full year effective tax rate forecast assumes a passage of the R&D tax credit.
This concludes our formal remarks. Jonathan, can you please open the line for Q&A."

Thanks, James. In terms of 2016, it's certainly too early to comment. But I would say that this fourth quarter is obviously very crucial in terms of gauging the overall market, and we believe that at this point, we have a very strong product lineup that will read a lot into our plans for 2016. So our approach would be to plan our 2016 based on, of course, how we view the market towards the end of this year. In terms of the revisions and kind of commenting on where we're at, I think our situation with the currency is not so much an issue of lower demand or lower quantities, but it really is pressure on the revenue side and the translation of currency. We've had some particularly strong results in some of those currency-affected areas, which is actually a good problem to have. But from the pricing point of view, it's very difficult to change the pricing in a short-term basis, so we're doing what we can in the short term to increase prices where we have some ability to do that. But the longer-term solution is really with products, new products and innovation."

598655,314119867,883948,"Garmin Ltd., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As previously announced, Garmin reported third quarter revenue decreased 4% year-over-year. Aviation, fitness, marine and outdoor contributed 61% of total revenues and 75% of the operating profit in the third",1072,"Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As previously announced, Garmin reported third quarter revenue decreased 4% year-over-year. Aviation, fitness, marine and outdoor contributed 61% of total revenues and 75% of the operating profit in the third quarter. We continue to see our revenue base diversify broadly across our business segments.
Gross margin was 53%, and operating margin came in at 18.5%. The reduction in margins from the prior year reflects a combination of factors, including downward pressure from unfavorable currency movements; a more competitive pricing environment, particularly in the fitness market; and continued investments in advertising and R&D. These factors, combined with a higher effective tax rate, resulted in pro forma EPS of $0.51 in the quarter.
Throughout the year, we have highlighted that the strong U.S. dollar created revenue headwinds in geographies with weaker currencies. In contrast, unit deliveries were up 4% for the quarter and 10% for the year due to the contribution from growth segments. While our primary yardstick is financial performance, we are encouraged by the underlying trends reflected in unit growth.
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'll provide a few comments on each business segment. Beginning with the fitness segment. Revenue grew 23% on a year-over-year basis, with the sequential acceleration driven by strength in activity trackers, multisport and cycling products. It's interesting to note that currency headwinds disproportionately impacted fitness segment due to the geographical revenue mix. These headwinds have softened revenue growth while unit deliveries have remained strong. We believe this indicates that the underlying business case remains sound. 
Gross and operating margins were 54% and 19%, respectively. Gross margin was impacted by unfavorable currency movements and competitive dynamics in the market. Operating margin was impacted by increased spending in R&D and global advertising. We believe these investments are strategically important in order to maximize the opportunity in this high-growth segment.
We recently introduced a new family of Forerunner products, which includes 3 models, the Forerunner 230, 235 and 630. Notably, the Forerunner 235 is our first wearable to incorporate Garmin Elevate technology. Garmin Elevate is a wrist-based heart rate sensor we specifically developed to serve a broad range of use cases from all-day heart rate tracking to intense workouts. All of the new Forerunners are compatible with our Connect IQ application framework, enabling users to personalize their watches with a host of interesting watch faces, custom data fields and useful applications developed by third parties.
We also recently introduced an exciting new activity tracker called vívosmart HR, which also features Garmin Elevate technology for all-day heart rate tracking and activity intensity monitoring. Garmin Elevate technology, combined with an always-on display and smart notifications, makes the vívosmart HR one of the most capable activity trackers available on the market. 
To support these products and many others, we have released a major update of Garmin Connect Mobile. This update features a completely new user interface, making it easy to view important activity information at a glance and providing even more customizations to fit individual needs. All of these new products are shipping now, and we will soon launch a major new advertising campaign to support sales during the upcoming holiday shopping season.
Looking at outdoor. Revenue declined 5% year-over-year as the revenue mix shifted to geographies with weaker currencies. Gross and operating margins were stable sequentially but declined year-over-year, driven primarily by currency weakness and product mix. The fenix 3 has been an exciting success story this year. During the quarter, we expanded the available choices for fenix 3 with new color and material options in time for the holiday shopping season.
Turning next to aviation. Revenue declined 5% as the industry has been impacted by lower oil prices and soft market volatility. Gross and operating margins remained strong, 74% and 25%, respectively, though operating margin declined on a year-over-year basis due to R&D growth supporting future revenue opportunities. While the industry slowdown is disappointing, we remain confident in our improving position in the business jet category and look forward to completing development and certification of additional aircraft platforms, as previously announced. We remain confident in our market position and the opportunities for long-term growth.
Looking next at marine. Revenue was flat in the third quarter as the boating season ended and we passed the first anniversary of the July 2014 acquisition of FUSION. Gross and operating margins improved as the mix shifted to new products with higher margin profiles. Our investment in innovation has resulted in increased market share and industry-wide recognition. Garmin was recently honored as Manufacturer of the Year by the National Marine Electronics Association. We also won 4 product-specific awards in the autopilot, multifunction display and smartphone applications categories. We intend to build on this momentum in the coming year with additional innovation and market share gains.
In the auto segment, revenues were down 14% in the quarter, driven by the secular decline of the PND market, as expected. However, our worldwide market share remains stable and strong. The PND market is an important part of our business, and we remain focused on delivering a superior in-vehicle experience. The most recent example is babyCam, which was announced earlier this month. babyCam is a backseat monitoring system that streams wireless video to compatible Garmin PNDs. This system provides front-seat passengers the ability to safely monitor the well-being of other passengers or cargo at a glance. 
As previously announced, we have updated our full year guidance and now anticipate revenues of approximately $2.8 billion, which includes approximately $185 million of negative currency impact due to the stronger U.S. dollar. Our revenue outlook has been adjusted in fitness, outdoor and aviation, which are the segments most impacted by the economic and competitive factors mentioned previously. We expect gross margin to be approximately 53.5%, down slightly from previous guidance, due to unfavorable geographic revenue mix and competitive pricing dynamics in the fitness segment. 
Due to the revenue and gross margin revisions, we now expect operating margin to be approximately 18.5%. Finally, we anticipate pro forma EPS of approximately $2.25, which also reflects the higher anticipated tax rate for the full year. While it's disappointing to revise our guidance, we believe that the underlying business trends remain positive and our investments in R&D and advertising will create long-term opportunities.
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"
598655,314119867,883948,"Garmin Ltd., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly review our financial results and then move to summary comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We posted revenue of $680 million for the quarter and pro forma net income of $97 milli",608,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly review our financial results and then move to summary comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We posted revenue of $680 million for the quarter and pro forma net income of $97 million. Pro forma EPS was $0.51 per share. During the quarter, we faced significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, which resulted in a revenue headwind of $52 million or 7% of revenue. 
Gross margin declined to 53%, a 310 basis point decrease from prior year. Operating margin was 18.5%, a 640 basis point decrease from the prior year. Finally, the effective tax rate increased to 27.7% in the current quarter compared to a pro forma rate of 21% in the prior year. This created earnings pressure of $0.05 per share. We'll discuss gross margin, operating expenses and effective tax rate in more detail later.
Next, we'll look at third quarter revenue by segment. The auto segment represented 39% of our total Q3 2015 revenue compared to 44% in the third quarter 2014. We continue to diversify our revenue base, with fitness increasing to 21% of our total Q3 2015 revenue.
Next, I'd like to discuss gross margin. This decrease to 53.3%, driven largely by the currency headwind, which reduced revenue by $52 million on a constant-currency basis, as well as pricing dynamics in the fitness segment. Total corporate operating margin was 18.5% due to gross margin pressure and increased R&D investment.
Looking next at operating expenses. Third quarter operating expense increased by $14 million or 6%. This is a 330 basis point increase as a percent of sales. Research and development increased $7 million year-over-year or 150 basis points to 15.6% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused primarily on aviation, fitness and outdoor, where we see long-term growth opportunities. 
Our advertising expense increased $4 million from the prior year quarter and represented 5.4% of sales, a 70 basis point increase. Additional spending was focused on fitness with investments in media, point-of-sale presence with key retailers and cooperative advertising. SG&A was up $3 million compared to the prior quarter, increasing 100 basis points as a percent of sales to 13.8%. Increased spending was driven primarily by IT expenses and product support causes as our customer base continues to grow rapidly.
Just a few quick highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable decreased both sequentially and year-over-year to $432 million. Our inventory balance increased to $503 million to prepare for the fourth quarter when we launch a number of new products simultaneously. During the third quarter of 2015, we generated free cash flow of $124 million. Also in the quarter, we paid dividends of $97 million and repurchased $51 million of company stock, with $192 million remaining for purchase through December 2016.
Finally, as I mentioned previously, our effective tax rate increased to 27.7% in the current quarter compared to a pro forma rate of 21% in the third quarter 2014. Increased tax rate was primarily the result of forecasted income mix by tax jurisdiction, which is negatively impacted by the overall reduction in forecast of taxable income and resulted in catch-up expense for the first half of 2015. Our full year effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 21.5% due to the change in income mix by tax jurisdiction. Consistent with last year, the full year effective tax rate forecast assumes a passage of the R&D tax credit.
This concludes our formal remarks. Jonathan, can you please open the line for Q&A."

I wanted to ask a couple of larger bigger-picture questions. As you -- as we're going to the end of this year and we start to think about 2016, how are you thinking about the appropriate levels of investment into efforts like fitness bands, et cetera? Clearly, that has your -- that hasn't done as well as you would have thought, and you're still hopeful there and looking to invest. But when do you think about starting to rationalize better or reevaluate that first? And second, I guess, is more of a backwards-looking question. But as we've gone through this year, we've seen you revise your expectations related to -- and the impacts from exchange rates a few times. First, it was just on the pure translation, and then later, it's been on demand. How are you feeling about where we're at from that perspective? And do you think that the lower levels of demand, given the higher pricing of the U.S. dollar, persist into next -- into 2016? Or do you need to make pricing adjustments to address that better going into next year?"

Thanks, James. In terms of 2016, it's certainly too early to comment. But I would say that this fourth quarter is obviously very crucial in terms of gauging the overall market, and we believe that at this point, we have a very strong product lineup that will read a lot into our plans for 2016. So our approach would be to plan our 2016 based on, of course, how we view the market towards the end of this year. In terms of the revisions and kind of commenting on where we're at, I think our situation with the currency is not so much an issue of lower demand or lower quantities, but it really is pressure on the revenue side and the translation of currency. We've had some particularly strong results in some of those currency-affected areas, which is actually a good problem to have. But from the pricing point of view, it's very difficult to change the pricing in a short-term basis, so we're doing what we can in the short term to increase prices where we have some ability to do that. But the longer-term solution is really with products, new products and innovation."

598655,314119867,884850,"Garmin Ltd., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As previously announced, Garmin reported third quarter revenue decreased 4% year-over-year. Aviation, fitness, marine and outdoor contributed 61% of total revenues and 75% of the operating profit in the third",1072,"Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. As previously announced, Garmin reported third quarter revenue decreased 4% year-over-year. Aviation, fitness, marine and outdoor contributed 61% of total revenues and 75% of the operating profit in the third quarter. We continue to see our revenue base diversify broadly across our business segments.
Gross margin was 53%, and operating margin came in at 18.5%. The reduction in margins from the prior year reflects a combination of factors, including downward pressure from unfavorable currency movements; a more competitive pricing environment, particularly in the fitness market; and continued investments in advertising and R&D. These factors, combined with a higher effective tax rate, resulted in pro forma EPS of $0.51 in the quarter.
Throughout the year, we have highlighted that the strong U.S. dollar created revenue headwinds in geographies with weaker currencies. In contrast, unit deliveries were up 4% for the quarter and 10% for the year due to the contribution from growth segments. While our primary yardstick is financial performance, we are encouraged by the underlying trends reflected in unit growth.
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'll provide a few comments on each business segment. Beginning with the fitness segment. Revenue grew 23% on a year-over-year basis, with the sequential acceleration driven by strength in activity trackers, multisport and cycling products. It's interesting to note that currency headwinds disproportionately impacted fitness segment due to the geographical revenue mix. These headwinds have softened revenue growth while unit deliveries have remained strong. We believe this indicates that the underlying business case remains sound. 
Gross and operating margins were 54% and 19%, respectively. Gross margin was impacted by unfavorable currency movements and competitive dynamics in the market. Operating margin was impacted by increased spending in R&D and global advertising. We believe these investments are strategically important in order to maximize the opportunity in this high-growth segment.
We recently introduced a new family of Forerunner products, which includes 3 models, the Forerunner 230, 235 and 630. Notably, the Forerunner 235 is our first wearable to incorporate Garmin Elevate technology. Garmin Elevate is a wrist-based heart rate sensor we specifically developed to serve a broad range of use cases from all-day heart rate tracking to intense workouts. All of the new Forerunners are compatible with our Connect IQ application framework, enabling users to personalize their watches with a host of interesting watch faces, custom data fields and useful applications developed by third parties.
We also recently introduced an exciting new activity tracker called vívosmart HR, which also features Garmin Elevate technology for all-day heart rate tracking and activity intensity monitoring. Garmin Elevate technology, combined with an always-on display and smart notifications, makes the vívosmart HR one of the most capable activity trackers available on the market. 
To support these products and many others, we have released a major update of Garmin Connect Mobile. This update features a completely new user interface, making it easy to view important activity information at a glance and providing even more customizations to fit individual needs. All of these new products are shipping now, and we will soon launch a major new advertising campaign to support sales during the upcoming holiday shopping season.
Looking at outdoor. Revenue declined 5% year-over-year as the revenue mix shifted to geographies with weaker currencies. Gross and operating margins were stable sequentially but declined year-over-year, driven primarily by currency weakness and product mix. The fenix 3 has been an exciting success story this year. During the quarter, we expanded the available choices for fenix 3 with new color and material options in time for the holiday shopping season.
Turning next to aviation. Revenue declined 5% as the industry has been impacted by lower oil prices and soft market volatility. Gross and operating margins remained strong, 74% and 25%, respectively, though operating margin declined on a year-over-year basis due to R&D growth supporting future revenue opportunities. While the industry slowdown is disappointing, we remain confident in our improving position in the business jet category and look forward to completing development and certification of additional aircraft platforms, as previously announced. We remain confident in our market position and the opportunities for long-term growth.
Looking next at marine. Revenue was flat in the third quarter as the boating season ended and we passed the first anniversary of the July 2014 acquisition of FUSION. Gross and operating margins improved as the mix shifted to new products with higher margin profiles. Our investment in innovation has resulted in increased market share and industry-wide recognition. Garmin was recently honored as Manufacturer of the Year by the National Marine Electronics Association. We also won 4 product-specific awards in the autopilot, multifunction display and smartphone applications categories. We intend to build on this momentum in the coming year with additional innovation and market share gains.
In the auto segment, revenues were down 14% in the quarter, driven by the secular decline of the PND market, as expected. However, our worldwide market share remains stable and strong. The PND market is an important part of our business, and we remain focused on delivering a superior in-vehicle experience. The most recent example is babyCam, which was announced earlier this month. babyCam is a backseat monitoring system that streams wireless video to compatible Garmin PNDs. This system provides front-seat passengers the ability to safely monitor the well-being of other passengers or cargo at a glance. 
As previously announced, we have updated our full year guidance and now anticipate revenues of approximately $2.8 billion, which includes approximately $185 million of negative currency impact due to the stronger U.S. dollar. Our revenue outlook has been adjusted in fitness, outdoor and aviation, which are the segments most impacted by the economic and competitive factors mentioned previously. We expect gross margin to be approximately 53.5%, down slightly from previous guidance, due to unfavorable geographic revenue mix and competitive pricing dynamics in the fitness segment. 
Due to the revenue and gross margin revisions, we now expect operating margin to be approximately 18.5%. Finally, we anticipate pro forma EPS of approximately $2.25, which also reflects the higher anticipated tax rate for the full year. While it's disappointing to revise our guidance, we believe that the underlying business trends remain positive and our investments in R&D and advertising will create long-term opportunities.
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"
598655,314119867,884850,"Garmin Ltd., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly review our financial results and then move to summary comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We posted revenue of $680 million for the quarter and pro forma net income of $97 milli",608,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly review our financial results and then move to summary comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We posted revenue of $680 million for the quarter and pro forma net income of $97 million. Pro forma EPS was $0.51 per share. During the quarter, we faced significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, which resulted in a revenue headwind of $52 million or 7% of revenue. 
Gross margin declined to 53%, a 310 basis point decrease from prior year. Operating margin was 18.5%, a 640 basis point decrease from the prior year. Finally, the effective tax rate increased to 27.7% in the current quarter compared to a pro forma rate of 21% in the prior year. This created earnings pressure of $0.05 per share. We'll discuss gross margin, operating expenses and effective tax rate in more detail later.
Next, we'll look at third quarter revenue by segment. The auto segment represented 39% of our total Q3 2015 revenue compared to 44% in the third quarter 2014. We continue to diversify our revenue base, with fitness increasing to 21% of our total Q3 2015 revenue.
Next, I'd like to discuss gross margin. This decrease to 53.3%, driven largely by the currency headwind, which reduced revenue by $52 million on a constant-currency basis as well as pricing dynamics in the fitness segment. Total corporate operating margin was 18.5% due to gross margin pressure and increased R&D investment.
Looking next at operating expenses. Third quarter operating expense increased by $14 million or 6%. This is a 330 basis point increase as a percent of sales. Research and development increased $7 million year-over-year or 150 basis points to 15.6% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused primarily on aviation, fitness and outdoor, where we see long-term growth opportunities. 
Our advertising expense increased $4 million from the prior year quarter and represented 5.4% of sales, a 70 basis point increase. Additional spending was focused on fitness with investments in media, point-of-sale presence with key retailers and cooperative advertising. SG&A was up $3 million compared to the prior quarter, increasing 100 basis points as a percent of sales to 13.8%. Increased spending was driven primarily by IT expenses and product support causes as our customer base continues to grow rapidly.
Just a few quick highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of over $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable decreased both sequentially and year-over-year to $432 million. Our inventory balance increased to $503 million to prepare for the fourth quarter when we launch a number of new products simultaneously. During the third quarter of 2015, we generated free cash flow of $124 million. Also in the quarter, we paid dividends of $97 million and repurchased $51 million of company stock, with $192 million remaining for purchase through December 2016.
Finally, as I mentioned previously, our effective tax rate increased to 27.7% in the current quarter compared to a pro forma rate of 21% in the third quarter 2014. Increased tax rate was primarily the result of forecasted income mix by tax jurisdiction, which is negatively impacted by the overall reduction in forecast of taxable income and resulted in catch-up expense for the first half of 2015. Our full year effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 21.5% due to the change in income mix by tax jurisdiction. Consistent with last year, the full year effective tax rate forecast assumes a passage of the R&D tax credit.
This concludes our formal remarks. Jonathan, can you please open the line for Q&A."

I wanted to ask a couple of larger bigger-picture questions. As you -- as we're going to the end of this year and we start to think about 2016, how are you thinking about the appropriate levels of investment into efforts like fitness bands, et cetera? Clearly, that has your -- that hasn't done as well as you would have thought, and you're still hopeful there and looking to invest. But when do you think about starting to rationalize better or reevaluate that first? And second, I guess, is more of a backwards-looking question. But as we've gone through this year, we've seen you revise your expectations related to -- and the impacts from exchange rates a few times. First, it was just on the pure translation, and then later, it's been on demand. How are you feeling about where we're at from that perspective? And do you think that the lower levels of demand, given the higher pricing of the U.S. dollar, persist into next -- into 2016? Or do you need to make pricing adjustments to address that better going into next year?"

Thanks, James. In terms of 2016, it's certainly too early to comment. But I would say that this fourth quarter is obviously very crucial in terms of gauging the overall market, and we believe that at this point, we have a very strong product lineup that will read a lot into our plans for 2016. So our approach would be to plan our 2016 based on, of course, how we view the market towards the end of this year. In terms of the revisions and kind of commenting on where we're at, I think our situation with the currency is not so much an issue of lower demand or lower quantities, but it really is pressure on the revenue side and the translation of currency. We've had some particularly strong results in some of those currency-affected areas, which is actually a good problem to have. But from the pricing point of view, it's very difficult to change the pricing in a short-term basis, so we're doing what we can in the short term to increase prices where we have some ability to do that. But the longer-term solution is really with products, new products and innovation."

In terms of FX, we aren't really at a pricing disadvantage because of FX. It doesn't make our prices higher, but it makes it -- the impact is on the revenue we recognize in U.S. dollars once the currencies are translated. So that's really the factor. And the other thing I would mention is that the overall fitness market, it also includes running. And the running market dynamics have changed in the past year due to the advent of the wrist-based heart rate being a key feature that customers want, and consequently, our product line, until we started introducing our products, the Forerunner 225 and now 235, have been a little softer in the market because of the absence of that feature."

In terms of the growth on a constant currency, we kind of headlined our overall situation on a consolidated basis, but we haven't been focusing on that on the individual segments. We feel like the situation is going to quickly clear as we exit the year because, if you remember, the currency took a major nosedive, the international currencies did, around the first of the year. So a lot has changed between then and now because we're introducing new products. We're adjusting pricing. And so the comment about constant currency, things start to get a little bit intermingled and difficult to isolate. In terms of advertising, we are spending at a higher level strategically in fitness, and we will continue to do so in the future in order to take advantage of the opportunities.

We view our -- all of our segments as strategic components of our overall portfolio, and it's something that we aren't considering. In terms of portfolio shaping, I'm assuming what you mean by that is the strategic direction of our product portfolio. And that is something that we review on a regular basis with our board, and it's something that we review internally on a constant basis within our company with each segment."

And it wasn't clear to me if there was sort of anything new -- any new elements to the plan, if you've made any sort of strategic decisions as far as how you're going to approach the market based on the recent downturn. Or is it kind of more of the keep investing in new products and new adjacencies and go after the market? I just wanted to know if there's anything new or different in maybe the way you're approaching the market based on the recent results."

I think the recent results are obviously challenging because, on the financial yardstick point of view, we, of course, are experiencing pressure. But as I mentioned in my comments on the unit side of things, our unit deliveries are up, and we're seeing success in markets around the world. So it really isn't a time for us to strategically peel back on some of those things. In fact, it's probably a time to increase so that we can create more innovation out there and, over the long term, as I mentioned before, be able to reset the pricing in the market around new products and new innovation."
