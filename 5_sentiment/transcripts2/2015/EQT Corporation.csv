If you read in press release this morning, EQT announced 2014 adjusted earnings of $3.40 per diluted share compared to $1.97 per diluted share in 2013. High-level story for their, as well as the fourth quarter was very strong volume growth and overall lower unit cash cost. Notably, production volumes were 26% higher than last year and midstream gathering volumes were up 27%. As a result, adjusted EQT earnings, EPS and operating cash flow for 2014 were all up considerably over 2013 by any measure, although both years were impacted by some unusual items that should be considered when interpreting and comparing results. I will touch on a couple of these items in my comments, but I do refer you to our non-GAAP reconciliations in today's release for more details.
Also adjusted operating cash flow of $1.4 billion in 2014 was up considerably at 19% higher than 2013. As I mentioned, we have several unusual items impacting earnings during 2014. In the second quarter, EQT completed an exchange of our Nora assets with Range Resources Corporation for 73,000 net acres in the Permian basin. We did record a $34 million gain at the time on that transaction.
In the fourth quarter of 2014, EQT recognized a pretax impairment charges of $162 million on our Ohio Utica Shale properties, where estimated ultimate recoveries or EURs, were significantly our expectations. And also, a $105 million impairment on our Permian Basin properties as a result of the decline in prices.
Also in the fourth quarter, EQT contributed $20 million to our charitable foundation. 
Fourth quarter 2014 adjusted earnings were $0.96 per diluted share, that compares to adjusted EPS of $0.39 in the fourth quarter 2013, a significantly higher production in midstream volumes, once again, drove results. Adjusted operating cash flow at EQT was $390 million in the fourth quarter compared to $314 million for the fourth quarter of 2013.
Our operational performance continue to be outstanding in the fourth quarter with 33% higher production volumes and then the fourth quarter 2013.
We also realized 40% higher gathering volumes than last year and continued low per unit operating cost in both businesses. 
Finally, in the fourth quarter, effective tax rate was actually negative as the full year 2014 effective tax rate of approximately 30% ended up lower than the 33% which we had applied for the first 3 quarters of 2014. The lower full year rate resulted from several factors including some state tax planning that was implemented in the fourth quarter. The continuing impact of blending and the growing nontaxable EQM partnership earnings are consolidated with EQT. And low pretax income as a result of the impairments in the fourth quarter.
Now moving on to a brief discussion of results by business segment, I will limit my discussion to the full year results as the explanations for the full year, for the most part, apply to the fourth quarter us well.
So starting with EQT production operating results. As has been the case for many years, not a big story in '14 that EQT production was a growth in sales of produced natural gas. As I mentioned, the growth rate was 26% higher for the year, driven by sales from our Marcellus wells. 2014 was our fifth straight year of more than 25% sales volume growth.
The EQT average realized sales price was relatively flat at $4.16 per Mcfe, and 14 -- about $0.04 lower than it was in 2013. For segment reporting purposes, of that $4.16 per Mcfe realized by EQT Corporation, $3.23 was allocated to EQT Production with the remaining $0.93 to EQT Midstream.
The majority of this $0.93 at Midstream is for gathering which averaged $0.73 per Mcfe.
I'd like to summarize a few changes that we made to our price reconciliation table which should help in understanding the buildup of our realized price which excludes noncash impacts. First, we applied the processing deduction directly to the liquid sales rather than average industry reductions across all gas and liquids volumes.
And secondly, we moved the BTU uplift to the natural gas sale section of the table to reflect the fact that on average, our gas has a higher BTU content than the NYMEX, primarily as a result of ethane as methane. Because of that higher BTU level, we realized a higher price per Mcf at NYMEX, which is reflected on the table.
And then finally, we added an average differential line. The average differentials include the impact of local basis, recovery received from selling some of our natural gas into higher-priced markets, recoveries from the resale of unused capacity and the impact of cash settle basis swaps. With these changes better explain the sales price that we received for our gas.
For the full year, total operating expenses at EQT production were 600 -- $867 million, excluding the impairment charges of 9% higher year-over-year.
Absolute DDNA, SG&A, LOE and production taxes were all higher. Again, consistent with the significant production growth. 
Let me walk to the Midstream business. Operating income here was up 17% year-over-year, namely as a result of the continued growth, gathered volumes and the subsequent entries in gathering total operating revenues. Transition net revenues also increased by almost 41% year-over-year as a result of an increase in current truck capacity.
Net operating expenses at midstream were about 17% higher year-over-year. And that again was consistent with the growth in the midstream business.
Finally, our standard liquidity update, we closed the year in a great liquidity position with 0 net short term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $950 million in cash on the balance sheet. And that excludes cash on hand at EQM. Based on current commodity prices, we forecast approximately $1 billion in operating cash flow for 2015 at EQT. And that is again, excluding the non-controlling interest portion of adjusted EQM EBITDA.
So we expect to fund our roughly $2 billion, 2015 CapEx forecast and excluding EQM without expected cash flow and current cash on hand.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Schlotterbeck to discuss the reduction in our CapEx forecast, as well as today's [indiscernible]"
269924,279349422,755498,"EQT Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","EQT Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phil. As you read in today's press release, we are lowering our 2015 CapEx budget by $450 million or 18% in response to the current economic environment. This consists of $425 million in EQT Production and $25 million in EQT Midstream. Of the $",625,"Thank you, Phil. As you read in today's press release, we are lowering our 2015 CapEx budget by $450 million or 18% in response to the current economic environment. This consists of $425 million in EQT Production and $25 million in EQT Midstream. Of the $425 million, reductions at EQT Production, $400 million is related to reductions in our drilling and completion budgets. We're reducing our Permian program to 5 wells, which will require to hold our acreage. And in the Marcellus, we are narrowing our focus to the highest return Marcellus development areas. And the remaining $25 million reduction is in G&G and facilities expenditures.
This cuts don't assume any service cost deflation. When we expect to significant terms cost reductions, we are currently in negotiations with all of our suppliers and do not want to forecast specific savings until those negotiations are concluded.
Moving onto our dry gas Utica well. As you know, we spud this stream country well in November. During the drilling of the curve, we encountered higher-than-expected reservoir pressures. Based on the pressures observed, we needed to significantly increase our mud weight. However, the mud system on the rig is not rated high enough for what's required to continue drilling. Therefore, we are now bringing with a higher-rated mud system which has caused us to be behind our original schedule. We expect that rig to be on location toward the end of February. But despite this minor timing setback, we continued to be excited and optimistic about our dry gas Utica potential beneath our acreage.
Finally, I'd like to discuss our observe report. This morning, we announced year and 2014 total proved reserves of 10.7 Tcfe, with a 2.7 Tcfe or 29% higher than the previous year and represents a reserve replacement ratio of 590%. Extension and discovery's totaled 3.3 Tcfe, which included 939 Bcfe of crude reserves from 220 wells that were unproved in 2013, but they were drilled and completed in 2014.
This is consistent with the company's history of continuing to expand its footprint and develop areas that we believe to be economic even when they do not meet the SEC's definition of proved reserves.
Another piece of the 3.3 Tcfe of extension is discoveries was 1.4 Tcfe of previously probable and possible reserves that we plan to drill over the next 5 years that were moved to proved undeveloped due to expansion of the geographic area classified as proved, longer planned laterals and approved acres.
Additionally, 954 Bcfe from new locations, primarily as a result of acreage additions were booked as PPD reserves.
And one final comment on proved reserves, 790 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves were converted to crude developed in 2014 as a result of our drilling and completion program.
Our 3P reserves, or the total of proof, probably, and possible reserves increased 6.4 Tcfe to 42.8 Tcfe an 18% increase over the prior year. This increase was mostly in the Marcellus and does not include any dry Utica.
And finally, we are adjusting our guidance for our DDNA rate for 2015 to reflect the finalized reserve report. We now estimate our pre-unit DDNA to be $1.17 per Mcfe or $0.05 lower than 2014.
Also as you see in our 10-K that we expect to file next week, our after-tax PV-10 were $4.8 billion, 22% higher than last year, driven by the increase in crude reserves. This reflects a NYMEX price, calculating in accordance with the SEC requirements, that was $0.70 per deck of term higher than in 2013. However, a decrease in regional basis of $0.71 per dekatherms led to an effective wellhead price that was $0.01 lower than last year.
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Porges for his comments."

Given the straightforward results for the fourth quarter, I will limit my prepared remarks to a discussion of our 2 announcements back on December 8, our 2015 operational forecast and our intent to form a second master limited partnershi",1008,"Thank you, Steve. Given the straightforward results for the fourth quarter, I will limit my prepared remarks to a discussion of our 2 announcements back on December 8, our 2015 operational forecast and our intent to form a second master limited partnership or MLP. As you know, this is our first conference call since we've made those investments and we thought it might be some interest in hearing and elaborate on those topics as both pertain to our contemplated activities in 2015.
Let's cover the MLP first. Our intent with this new vehicle is that it will own EQT's general partner or GP interest in EQT Midstream Partners or EQM, including the incentive distribution rights. And it will also own the $21 million EQM common units that are owned by EQT. EQT will be the general partner of the new MLP. And as a result, EQT will continue to operate all MLPs. A distinct advantage as we execute on our development plans.
Once EQM's 2014 Form 10-K is filed and the results are Incorporated into the draft prospectus, we intend to file that document, the S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission during the first quarter. This will begin the process of review by the SEC in response by us, so we hope to be ready for an IPO by about mid-year. But the timing will depend upon that review process.
We do not believe that the rapidly growing GP cash flows are being fairly valued in the EQT stock price. As we reviewed our alternative to rectify that situation, we concluded that he wanted to be ago that was publicly traded, fair vote tax attributes such as those offered by an MLP.
Retains effective operational control by EQT as long as that seems optimal. And that would allow a tax efficient separation from EQT should we decide to affect one in the future. To be clear, we do believe there are significant operational synergies between a measurement upstream business during this time of rapid growth. Recognize for this period, we'll not continue indefinitely and we need to be quite comfortable but the chosen structure will not include tax separation should that become desirable.
It's tied to the announcement. We've received a few offline questions as to why we chose the MLP structure over the structure known as UP C. We did give the latter structure a significant consideration that concluded that the age of a significant portion of the EQM assets precluded favorable tax treatment offered by the UPC. Also, we concluded after much in depth discussion tax experts that a tax efficient separation with every bit is feasible for a standard MLP as for NFC.
Moving on to our operational forecast for 2015. You have read about the specific statistics in the December release and revision in today's earnings release and heard more about this just now from Stephen. What I would like to add in the discussion is more about our thought process, especially as how it relates to our financial situation in philosophy. As Phil mentioned, we ended 2014 with $950 million in cash at the EQT level and investment-grade rating from the 3 major rating agencies. 0 drawn on a $1.5 billion unsecured revolver, $200 million of midstream EBITDA still owned by EQT Corp. Our plan to drop our Northernwest Virginia gathering assets to EQM at 2015 and proceeds expected from the previously discussed GP IPO. In that context, when we announced our budget in December, we were comfortable with a CapEx estimate that was about $1.2 billion higher than the operating cash flow estimate for 2015.
Frankly, my expectation was that the GP IPO proceeds would not be touched any of that. That money would remain in the bank account as of the end of 2015.
Since that time, the 2015 NYMEX trip for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs has declined significantly. Using current prices, we estimate that our operating cash flow for 2015 will be approximately $300 million less than we anticipated at the time of the release in December. As a result, we decided to lower our activity level to more than match a decline in operating cash flow.
So if things play out as planned, we expect and 2015 with significant cash on hand, nothing drawn on the revolver, et cetera. In other words, with distribution, where current expectation is that we will be in a better position from a financial liquidity perspective than we expected at the time of December release.
In times of financial stress such as the some of the think the prudent approach is to be conservative financially. Whatever happens over the course of the rest of this year from a financial perspective, quicker recovery or slower recovery, the presence or absence of opportunities created by overextended Pierce, et cetera, we believe we are better off with cash in hand, strong credit position and strong equity position.
In my opinion, it is too early in the cycle for us to know how this will play out. But no matter what happens, we are confident that having a strong balance sheet will create shareholder value. At the least, we feel good to know that we already have clear line of sight for finding robust value accretive drilling programs this year as well as at least the next couple of years.
I believe that our strong balance sheet will differentiate EQT during this low price environment as we will be able to continue to efficiently and profitably develop our acreage over a multiyear period and emerge from the cycle stronger than when we entered it.
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by intelligently accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on doing what we can to increase the value of your shares. We look forward to continue to execute in our commitment to our shareholders and appreciates of your continued support. 
And with that, I'd like to turn back over to Pat."

I mean, that's part of the benefit of having cut back more than cash flow would have dictated that we needed to.

Currently, quits market, that's flip flopped a little bit. So the southwestern PA dry gas area is back on top with northern West Virginia close second. But pretty much pulling back everywhere else. So yes, to see counties no drilling and some of the step outlaws we were doing, especially some of the trade areas of West Virginia is where we are cutting back."

A high-level story for the year as well as the fourth quarter",1042,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in press release this morning, EQT announced 2014 adjusted earnings of $3.40 per diluted share compared to $1.97 per diluted share in 2013. A high-level story for the year as well as the fourth quarter was a very strong volume growth and overall lower unit cash cost. Notably, Production volumes were 26% higher than last year and Midstream gathering volumes were up by 27%. As a result, adjusted EQT earnings, EPS and operating cash flow for 2014 were all up considerably over 2013 by any measure, although both years were impacted by some unusual items that should be considered when interpreting and comparing results. I will touch on a couple of these items in my comments, but I do refer you to our non-GAAP reconciliations in today's release for more details.
Also, adjusted operating cash flow of $1.4 billion in 2014 was up considerably at 19% higher than 2013.
As I mentioned, we have several unusual items impacting earnings during 2014. In the second quarter, EQT completed an exchange of our Nora assets with Range Resources Corporation for 73,000 net acres in the Permian basin. We did record a $34 million gain at the time on that transaction.
In the fourth quarter of 2014, EQT recognized a pretax impairment charges of $162 million on our Ohio Utica shale properties, where estimated ultimate recoveries, or EURs, were significantly grew our expectations; and also, a $105 million impairment on our Permian basin properties as a result of the decline in prices.
Also in the fourth quarter, EQT contributed $20 million to our charitable foundation.
Fourth quarter 2014 adjusted earnings were $0.96 per diluted share. That compares to adjusted EPS of $0.39 in the fourth quarter 2013. A significantly higher Production and Midstream volumes, once again, drove results.
Adjusted operating cash flow at EQT was $390 million in the fourth quarter compared to $314 million for the fourth quarter of 2013.
Our operational performance continued to be outstanding in the fourth quarter with 33% higher Production volumes than the fourth quarter 2013. We also realized 40% higher gathering volumes than last year and continued low per unit operating cost in both businesses.
Finally, in the fourth quarter, effective tax rate was actually negative as the full year 2014 effective tax rate of approximately 30% ended up lower than the 33%, which we had applied to the first 3 quarters of 2014. The lower full year rate resulted from several factors, including some state tax planning that was implemented in the fourth quarter. The continuing impact of blending and the growing nontaxable EQM partnership earnings are consolidated with EQT and low pretax income as a result of the impairments in the fourth quarter.
Now moving on to a brief discussion of results by business segment. I will limit my discussion to the full year results as the explanations for the full year, for the most part, apply to the fourth quarter as well.
So starting with EQT Production operating results. As has been the case for many years, the big story in '14 at EQT Production was the growth in sales of produced natural gas. As I mentioned, the growth rate was 26% higher for the year, driven by sales from our Marcellus wells. 2014 was our fifth straight year of more than 25% sales volume growth.
The EQT average realized sales price was relatively flat at $4.16 per Mcfe, and 14 -- about $0.04 lower than it was in 2013. For segment reporting purposes, of that $4.16 per Mcfe realized by EQT Corporation, $3.23 was allocated to EQT Production with the remaining $0.93 to EQT Midstream. The majority of this $0.93 at Midstream is for gathering, which averaged $0.73 per Mcfe.
I'd like to summarize a few changes that we made to our price reconciliation table, which should help in understanding the buildup of our realized price, which excludes noncash impacts. First, we applied the processing deduction directly to the liquid sales rather than averaging those deductions across all gas and liquids volumes.
And secondly, we moved the Btu uplift to the natural gas sale section of the table to reflect the fact that on average, our gas has a higher Btu content than the NYMEX spec, primarily as a result of ethane that is sold as methane. Because of that higher Btu value, we realized a higher price per Mcf at NYMEX, which is reflected on the table.
And then finally, we added an average differential line. The average differentials include the impact of local basis, recoveries received from selling some of our natural gas into higher-priced markets, recoveries from the resale of unused capacity and the impact of cash settled basis swaps. With these changes, it better explains the sales price that we received for our gas.
For the full year, total operating expenses at EQT Production were 600 -- $867 million, excluding the impairment charges of 9% higher year-over-year.
Absolute DD&A, SG&A, LOE and production taxes were all higher, again, consistent with the significant production growth.
Moving now to the Midstream business. Operating income here was up 17% year-over-year, mainly as a result of the continued growth on gathered volumes and the subsequent entries in gathering total operating revenues. Transmission net revenues also increased by almost 41% year-over-year as a result of an increase in firm-contracted capacity.
Net operating expenses at Midstream were about 17% higher year-over-year, and that, again, was consistent with the growth in the Midstream business.
Finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the year in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $950 million in cash on the balance sheet, and that excludes cash on hand at EQM. Based on current commodity prices, we forecast approximately $1 billion in operating cash flow for 2015 at EQT, and that is, again, excluding the noncontrolling interest portion of adjusted EQM EBITDA.
So we expect to fund our roughly $2 billion, 2015 CapEx forecast, again, excluding EQM, without expected cash flow and current cash on hand.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Schlotterbeck to discuss the reduction in our CapEx forecast as well as today's income [ph] release."

As you read in today's press release, we were lowering our 2015 CapEx budget by $450 million or 18% in response to the current economic environment. This consists of $425 million in EQT Production and $25 million in EQT Midstream. Of the",627,"Thank you, Phil. As you read in today's press release, we were lowering our 2015 CapEx budget by $450 million or 18% in response to the current economic environment. This consists of $425 million in EQT Production and $25 million in EQT Midstream. Of the $425 million reductions at EQT Production, $400 million is related to reductions in our drilling and completions budgets. We're reducing our Permian program to 5 wells, which were required to hold our acreage. And in the Marcellus, we are narrowing our focus to our highest-return Marcellus development areas. And the remaining $25 million reduction is in G&G and facilities expenditures.
These cuts do not assume any service cost deflation. While we expect to realize significant service cost reductions, we are currently in negotiations with all of our suppliers and do not want to forecast specific savings until those negotiations are concluded.
Moving on to our dry gas Utica well. As you know, we spud this county [ph] well in November. During the drilling of the curve, we encountered higher-than-expected reservoir pressures. Based on the pressures observed, we needed to significantly increase our mud weight. However, the mud system on the rig is not rated high enough for what's required to continue drilling. Therefore, we are now bringing in a rig with a higher-rated mud system, which has caused us to be behind our original schedule. We expect that rig to be on location toward the end of February. But despite this minor timing setback, we continue to be excited and optimistic about our dry gas Utica potential beneath our acreage.
Finally, I'd like to discuss our reserve report. This morning, we announced year-end 2014 total proved reserves of 10.7 Tcfe, with a 2.4 Tcfe or 29% higher than the previous year and represents a reserve replacement ratio of 590%. Extensions in discoveries totaled 3.3 Tcfe, which included 939 Bcfe of crude reserves from 220 wells that were unproved in 2013, but they were drilled and completed in 2014. This is consistent with the company's history of continuing to expand its footprint and develop areas that we believe to be economic even when they do not meet the SEC's definition of proved reserves.
Another piece of the 3.3 Tcfe of extensions in discoveries was 1.4 Tcfe of previously probable and possible reserves that we plan to drill over the next 5 years that were moved to proved undeveloped due to expansion of the geographic area classified as proved, longer-planned laterals and improved papers.
Additionally, 954 Bcfe from new locations, primarily as a result of acreage additions, were booked as PUD reserves.
And one final comment on proved reserves, 790 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves were converted to crude developed in 2014 as a result of our drilling and completion program.
Our 3P reserves, or the total of proved, probable, and possible reserves, increased 6.4 Tcfe to 42.8 Tcfe, an 18% increase over the prior year. This increase was mostly in the Marcellus and does not include any dry Utica.
And finally, we are adjusting our guidance for our DD&A rate for 2015 to reflect the finalized reserve report. We now estimate our per unit DD&A to be $1.17 per Mcfe or $0.05 lower than 2014.
Also, as you see in our 10-K that we expect to file next week, our after-tax PV-10 was $4.8 billion, 22% higher than last year, driven by the increase in crude reserves. This reflects a NYMEX price calculating in accordance with the SEC requirements that was $0.70 per dekatherm higher than in 2013. However, a decrease in regional basis of $0.71 per dekatherm led to an effective wellhead price that was $0.01 lower than last year.
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Porges for his comments."
269924,279349422,755945,"EQT Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","EQT Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Steve. Given the straightforward results for the fourth quarter, I will limit my prepared remarks to a discussion of our 2 announcements back on December 8, our 2015 operational forecast and our intent to form a second master limited partnershi",1013,"Thank you, Steve. Given the straightforward results for the fourth quarter, I will limit my prepared remarks to a discussion of our 2 announcements back on December 8, our 2015 operational forecast and our intent to form a second master limited partnership, or MLP. As you know, this is our first conference call since we've made those investments, and we thought there might be some interest in hearing us elaborate on those topics as both pertain to our contemplated activities in 2015.
Let's cover the MLP first. Our intent with this new vehicle is that it will own EQT's general partner, or GP, interest in EQT Midstream Partners, or EQM, including the incentive distribution rights. And it will also own the $21 million EQM common units that are owned by EQT. EQT will be the general partner of the new MLP. And as a result, EQT will continue to operate both MLPs, a distinct advantage as we execute on our development plans.
Once EQM's 2014 Form 10-K is filed and the results are incorporated into the draft prospectus, we intend to file that document, the S-1, with the Securities and Exchange Commission during the first quarter. This will begin the iterative process of review by the SEC in response by us, so we hope to be ready for an IPO by about midyear, but the timing will depend upon that review process.
We do not believe that the rapidly growing GP cash flows are being fairly valued in the EQT stock price. As we reviewed our alternative to rectify that situation, we concluded that we wanted to be a goal [ph] that was publicly traded; had favorable tax attributes, such as those offered by an MLP; retains effective operational control by EQT, as long as that seems optimal; and that would allow a tax-efficient separation from EQT should we decide to affect one in the future. To be clear, we do believe there are significant operational synergies between a midstream and upstream business during this time of rapid growth. We recognize that this period will not continue indefinitely, and we need to be quite comfortable, but the chosen structure would not preclude a tax-efficient separation should that become desirable.
As tied to the announcement, we received a few offline questions as to why we chose the MLP structure over the structure known as Up-C. We did give that latter structure significant consideration but concluded that the age of a significant portion of the EQM assets precluded favorable tax treatment offered by the Up-C structure. Also, we concluded after much in-depth discussion with tax experts that a tax-efficient separation was every bit is feasible for a standard MLP as for an Up-C.
Moving on to our operational forecast for 2015. You have read about the specific statistics in the December release and revisions in today's earnings release and heard more about this just now from Steve. What I would like to add in the discussion is more about our thought process, especially how it relates to our financial situation in philosophy.
As Phil mentioned, we ended 2014 with $950 million in cash at the EQT level and investment-grade rating from the 3 major rating agencies: 0 drawn on a $1.5 billion unsecured revolver; $200 million of Midstream EBITDA still owned by EQT Corp; our plan to drop our Northern West Virginia gathering assets to EQM in 2015; and proceeds expected from the previously discussed GP IPO. In that context, when we announced our budget in December, we were comfortable with a CapEx estimate that was about $1.2 billion higher than our operating cash flow estimate for 2015. Frankly, my expectation was that the GP IPO proceeds would not be touched in any of that. That money would remain in the bank account as of the end of 2015.
Since that time, the 2015 NYMEX strip for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs has declined significantly. Using current prices, we estimate that our operating cash flow for 2015 will be approximately $300 million less than we anticipated at the time of that release in December. As a result, we decided to lower our activity level to more than match the decline in operating cash flow. So if things play out as planned, we expect to end 2015 with significant cash on hand, nothing drawn on the revolver, et cetera. In other words, with this revision, our current expectation is that we will be in a better position from a financial liquidity perspective than we expected at the time of the December release.
In times of financial stress such as these, we think the prudent approach is to be conservative financially. Whatever happens over the course of the rest of this year from a financial perspective, quicker recovery or slower recovery, the presence or absence of opportunities created by overextended peers, et cetera, we believe we are better off with cash on hand, strong credit position and strong equity position.
In my opinion, it is too early in the cycle for us to know how this will play out. But no matter what happens, we are confident that having a strong balance sheet will create shareholder value. At the least, to feel good to know that we already have clear line of sight for funding robust, value-accretive drilling programs this year as well as, at least, the next couple of years.
I believe that our strong balance sheet will differentiate EQT during this low-price environment, as we will be able to continue to efficiently and profitably develop our acreage over a multiyear period and emerge from the cycle stronger than when we entered it.
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by intelligently accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on doing what we can to increase the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat."

That it's fast. It's practical and yet, midstream [indiscernible] commitment to support mid-20% growth for over the next couple of years, obviously, is the one that's changed since then. But I was just wondering if you could provide any update to the longer-term growth outlook and the reduction '15 CapEx, and whether you could provide a range of sensitivities such as at $4 gas, we can grow mid-20s. But with at $3 gas, I think it's more prudent to target a mid-teens growth rate."

It is fair to say that if we spend less, then the growth rates will be a little bit less. But frankly, we would still think that they would have approached the levels that we have talked about previously if the strip remains what it is at. I mean, it's -- at the current strip, you're probably looking -- you might be looking at more like mid to high teens for the next couple of years, but we have tried to position ourselves so that we could ramp up, as Steve mentioned, pretty quickly if need be. I mean, that's part of the benefit of having cut back more than cash flow would have dictated that we needed to. But we haven't really run through a variety of sensitivities in this kind of volatile market to give you a good answer to your question about what the growth rate would be at different NYMEX prices. Over the course of the next couple of months, we probably will run through those types of sensitivities, and certainly, we'll share those as we do."

As you read in press release this morning, EQT announced 2014 adjusted earnings of $3.40 per diluted share compared to $1.97 per diluted share in 2013. A high-level story for the year as well as the fourth quarter",1043,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in press release this morning, EQT announced 2014 adjusted earnings of $3.40 per diluted share compared to $1.97 per diluted share in 2013. A high-level story for the year as well as the fourth quarter was a very strong volume growth and overall lower unit cash cost. Notably, Production volumes were 26% higher than last year and Midstream gathering volumes were up by 27%. As a result, adjusted EQT earnings, EPS and operating cash flow for 2014 were all up considerably over 2013 by any measure, although both years were impacted by some unusual items that should be considered when interpreting and comparing results. I will touch on a couple of these items in my comments, but I do refer you to our non-GAAP reconciliations in today's release for more details.
Also, adjusted operating cash flow of $1.4 billion in 2014 was up considerably at 19% higher than 2013.
As I mentioned, we have several unusual items impacting earnings during 2014. In the second quarter, EQT completed an exchange of our Nora assets with Range Resources Corporation for 73,000 net acres in the Permian basin. We did record a $34 million gain at the time on that transaction.
In the fourth quarter of 2014, EQT recognized pretax impairment charges of $162 million on our Ohio Utica shale properties, where estimated ultimate recoveries, or EURs, were significantly below our expectations; and also, a $105 million impairment on our Permian basin properties as a result of the decline in oil prices.
Also in the fourth quarter, EQT contributed $20 million to our charitable foundation.
Fourth quarter 2014 adjusted earnings were $0.96 per diluted share. That compares to adjusted EPS of $0.39 in the fourth quarter 2013. A significantly higher Production and Midstream volumes, once again, drove results.
Adjusted operating cash flow at EQT was $390 million in the fourth quarter compared to $314 million for the fourth quarter of 2013.
Our operational performance continued to be outstanding in the fourth quarter with 33% higher Production volumes than the fourth quarter 2013. We also realized 40% higher gathering volumes than last year and continued low per unit operating cost in both businesses.
Finally, in the fourth quarter, effective tax rate was actually negative as the full year 2014 effective tax rate of approximately 30% ended up lower than the 33%, which we had applied to the first 3 quarters of 2014. The lower full year rate resulted from several factors, including some state tax planning that was implemented in the fourth quarter. The continuing impact of blending and the growing nontaxable EQM partnership earnings are consolidated with EQT and low pretax income as a result of the impairments in the fourth quarter.
Now moving on to a brief discussion of results by business segment. I will limit my discussion to the full year results as the explanations for the full year, for the most part, apply to the fourth quarter as well.
So starting with EQT Production operating results. As has been the case for many years, now the big story in '14 at EQT Production was the growth in sales of produced natural gas. As I mentioned, the growth rate was 26% higher for the year, driven by sales from our Marcellus wells. 2014 was our fifth straight year of more than 25% sales volume growth.
The EQT average realized sales price was relatively flat at $4.16 per Mcfe, and 14 -- about $0.04 lower than it was in 2013. For segment reporting purposes, of that $4.16 per Mcfe realized by EQT Corporation, $3.23 was allocated to EQT Production with the remaining $0.93 to EQT Midstream. The majority of this $0.93 at Midstream is for gathering, which averaged $0.73 per Mcfe.
I'd like to summarize a few changes that we made to our price reconciliation table, which should help in understanding the buildup of our realized price, which excludes noncash impacts. First, we applied the processing deduction directly to the liquid sales rather than averaging those deductions across all gas and liquids volumes.
And secondly, we moved the Btu uplift to the natural gas sale section of the table to reflect the fact that on average, our gas has a higher Btu content than the NYMEX spec, primarily as a result of ethane that is sold as methane. Because of that higher Btu value, we realized a higher price per Mcf at NYMEX, which is reflected on the table.
And then finally, we added an average differential line. The average differentials include the impact of local basis, recoveries received from selling some of our natural gas into higher-priced markets, recoveries from the resale of unused capacity and the impact of cash settled basis swaps. With these changes, it better explains the sales price that we received for our gas.
For the full year, total operating expenses at EQT Production were 600 -- $867 million, excluding the impairment charges of 9% higher year-over-year.
Absolute DD&A, SG&A, LOE and production taxes were all higher, again, consistent with the significant production growth.
Moving now to the Midstream business. Operating income here was up 17% year-over-year, mainly as a result of the continued growth on gathered volumes and the subsequent entries in gathering total operating revenues. Transmission net revenues also increased by almost 41% year-over-year as a result of an increase in firm-contracted capacity.
Net operating expenses at Midstream were about 17% higher year-over-year, and that, again, was consistent with the growth in the Midstream business.
Finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the year in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $950 million in cash on the balance sheet, and that excludes cash on hand at EQM. Based on current commodity prices, we forecast approximately $1 billion in operating cash flow for 2015 at EQT, and that is, again, excluding the noncontrolling interest portion of adjusted EQM EBITDA.
So we expect to fund our roughly $2 billion, 2015 CapEx forecast, again, excluding EQM, with that expected cash flow and current cash on hand.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Schlotterbeck to discuss the reduction in our CapEx forecast as well as today's reserve release."

As you read in today's press release, we were lowering our 2015 CapEx budget by $450 million or 18% in response to the current economic environment.

As you read in today's press release, we were lowering our 2015 CapEx budget by $450 million or 18% in response to the current economic environment. This consists of $425 million in EQT Production and $25 million in EQT Midstream. Of the $425 million reductions at EQT Production, $400 million is related to reductions in our drilling and completions budgets. We're reducing our Permian program to 5 wells, which were required to hold our acreage. And in the Marcellus, we are narrowing our focus to our highest-return Marcellus development areas. And the remaining $25 million reduction is in G&G and facilities expenditures.
These cuts do not assume any service cost deflation. While we expect to realize significant service cost reductions, we are currently in negotiations with all of our suppliers and do not want to forecast specific savings until those negotiations are concluded.
Moving on to our dry gas Utica well. As you know, we spud this county [ph] well in November. During the drilling of the curve, we encountered higher-than-expected reservoir pressures. Based on the pressures observed, we needed to significantly increase our mud weight. However, the mud system on the rig is not rated high enough for what's required to continue drilling. Therefore, we are now bringing in a rig with a higher-rated mud system, which has caused us to be behind our original schedule. We expect that rig to be on location toward the end of February. But despite this minor timing setback, we continue to be excited and optimistic about our dry gas Utica potential beneath our acreage.
Finally, I'd like to discuss our reserve report. This morning, we announced year-end 2014 total proved reserves of 10.7 Tcfe, with a 2.4 Tcfe or 29% higher than the previous year and represents a reserve replacement ratio of 590%. Extensions in discoveries totaled 3.3 Tcfe, which included 939 Bcfe of crude reserves from 220 wells that were unproved in 2013, but they were drilled and completed in 2014. This is consistent with the company's history of continuing to expand its footprint and develop areas that we believe to be economic even when they do not meet the SEC's definition of proved reserves.
Another piece of the 3.3 Tcfe of extensions in discoveries was 1.4 Tcfe of previously probable and possible reserves that we plan to drill over the next 5 years that were moved to proved undeveloped due to expansion of the geographic area classified as proved, longer-planned laterals and improved type curves.
Additionally, 954 Bcfe from new locations, primarily as a result of acreage additions, were booked as PUD reserves.
And one final comment on proved reserves, 790 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves were converted to crude developed in 2014 as a result of our drilling and completion program.
Our 3P reserves, or the total of proved, probable, and possible reserves, increased 6.4 Tcfe to 42.8 Tcfe, an 18% increase over the prior year. This increase was mostly in the Marcellus and does not include any dry Utica.
And finally, we are adjusting our guidance for our DD&A rate for 2015 to reflect the finalized reserve report. We now estimate our per unit DD&A to be $1.17 per Mcfe or $0.05 lower than 2014.
Also, as you see in our 10-K that we expect to file next week, our after-tax PV-10 was $4.8 billion, 22% higher than last year, driven by the increase in crude reserves. This reflects a NYMEX price calculating in accordance with the SEC requirements that was $0.70 per dekatherm higher than in 2013. However, a decrease in regional basis of $0.71 per dekatherm led to an effective wellhead price that was $0.01 lower than last year.
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Porges for his comments."

Given the straightforward results for the fourth quarter, I will limit my prepared remarks to a discussion of our 2 announcements back on December 8, our 2015 operational forecast and our intent to form a second master limited partnershi",1012,"Thank you, Steve. Given the straightforward results for the fourth quarter, I will limit my prepared remarks to a discussion of our 2 announcements back on December 8, our 2015 operational forecast and our intent to form a second master limited partnership, or MLP. As you know, this is our first conference call since we've made those announcements, and we thought there might be some interest in hearing us elaborate on those topics as both pertain to our contemplated activities in 2015.
Let's cover the MLP first. Our intent with this new vehicle is that it will own EQT's general partner, or GP, interest in EQT Midstream Partners, or EQM, including the incentive distribution rights. And it will also own the $21 million EQM common units that are owned by EQT. EQT will be the general partner of the new MLP. And as a result, EQT will continue to operate both MLPs, a distinct advantage as we execute on our development plans.
Once EQM's 2014 Form 10-K is filed and the results are incorporated into the draft prospectus, we intend to file that document, the S-1, with the Securities and Exchange Commission during the first quarter. This will begin the iterative process of review by the SEC in response by us, so we hope to be ready for an IPO by about midyear, but the timing will depend upon that review process.
We do not believe that the rapidly growing GP cash flows are being fairly valued in the EQT stock price. As we reviewed our alternatives to rectify that situation, we concluded that we wanted to be a vehicle that was publicly traded; had favorable tax attributes, such as those offered by an MLP; retains effective operational control by EQT, as long as that seems optimal; and that would allow a tax-efficient separation from EQT should we decide to affect one in the future. To be clear, we do believe there are significant operational synergies between a midstream and upstream business during this time of rapid growth. We recognize that this period will not continue indefinitely, and we need to be quite comfortable, but the chosen structure would not preclude a tax-efficient separation should that become desirable.
As tied to the announcement, we received a few offline questions as to why we chose the MLP structure over the structure known as Up-C. We did give that latter structure significant consideration but concluded that the age of a significant portion of the EQM assets precluded favorable tax treatment offered by the Up-C structure. Also, we concluded after much in-depth discussion with tax experts that a tax-efficient separation was every bit as feasible for a standard MLP as for an Up-C.
Moving on to our operational forecast for 2015. You have read about the specific statistics in the December release and revisions in today's earnings release and heard more about this just now from Steve. What I would like to add in the discussion is more about our thought process, especially how it relates to our financial situation and philosophy.
As Phil mentioned, we ended 2014 with $950 million in cash at the EQT level and investment-grade rating from the 3 major rating agencies: 0 drawn on a $1.5 billion unsecured revolver; $200 million of Midstream EBITDA still owned by EQT Corp; our plan to drop our Northern West Virginia gathering assets to EQM in 2015; and proceeds expected from the previously discussed GP IPO. In that context, when we announced our budget in December, we were comfortable with a CapEx estimate that was about $1.2 billion higher than our operating cash flow estimate for 2015. Frankly, my expectation was that the GP IPO proceeds would not be touched in any of that. That money would remain in the bank account as of the end of 2015.
Since that time, the 2015 NYMEX strip for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs has declined significantly. Using current prices, we estimate that our operating cash flow for 2015 will be approximately $300 million less than we anticipated at the time of that release in December. As a result, we decided to lower our activity level to more than match the decline in operating cash flow. So if things play out as planned, we expect to end 2015 with significant cash on hand, nothing drawn on the revolver, et cetera. In other words, with this revision, our current expectation is that we will be in a better position from a financial liquidity perspective than we expected at the time of the December release.
In times of financial stress such as these, we think the prudent approach is to be conservative financially. Whatever happens over the course of the rest of this year from a financial perspective, quicker recovery or slower recovery, the presence or absence of opportunities created by overextended peers, et cetera, we believe we are better off with cash on hand, strong credit position and strong equity position.
In my opinion, it is too early in the cycle for us to know how this will play out. But no matter what happens, we are confident that having a strong balance sheet will create shareholder value. At the least, it feels good to know that we already have clear line of sight for funding robust, value-accretive drilling programs this year as well as, at least, the next couple of years.
I believe that our strong balance sheet will differentiate EQT during this low-price environment, as we will be able to continue to efficiently and profitably develop our acreage over a multiyear period and emerge from the cycle stronger than when we entered it.
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by intelligently accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on doing what we can to increase the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat."

I mean, it's -- at the current strip, you're probably looking -- you might be looking at more like mid to high teens for the next couple of years, but we have tried to position ourselves so that we could ramp up, as Steve mentioned, pretty quickly if need be. I mean, that's part of the benefit of having cut back more than cash flow would have dictated that we needed to. But we haven't really run through a variety of sensitivities in this kind of volatile market to give you a good answer to your question about what the growth rate would be at different NYMEX prices. Over the course of the next couple of months, we probably will run through those types of sensitivities, and certainly, we'll share those as we do."

A high-level story for the year as well as the fourth quarter",1043,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in press release this morning, EQT announced 2014 adjusted earnings of $3.40 per diluted share compared to $1.97 per diluted share in 2013. A high-level story for the year as well as the fourth quarter was a very strong volume growth and overall lower unit cash cost. Notably, Production volumes were 26% higher than last year and Midstream gathering volumes were up by 27%. As a result, adjusted EQT earnings, EPS and operating cash flow for 2014 were all up considerably over 2013 by any measure, although both years were impacted by some unusual items that should be considered when interpreting and comparing results. I will touch on a couple of these items in my comments, but I do refer you to our non-GAAP reconciliations in today's release for more details.
Also, adjusted operating cash flow of $1.4 billion in 2014 was up considerably at 19% higher than 2013.
As I mentioned, we have several unusual items impacting earnings during 2014. In the second quarter, EQT completed an exchange of our Nora assets with Range Resources Corporation for 73,000 net acres in the Permian basin. We did record a $34 million gain at the time on that transaction.
In the fourth quarter of 2014, EQT recognized pretax impairment charges of $162 million on our Ohio Utica shale properties, where estimated ultimate recoveries, or EURs, were significantly below our expectations; and also, a $105 million impairment on our Permian basin properties as a result of the decline in oil prices.
Also in the fourth quarter, EQT contributed $20 million to our charitable foundation.
Fourth quarter 2014 adjusted earnings were $0.96 per diluted share. That compares to adjusted EPS of $0.39 in the fourth quarter 2013. A significantly higher Production and Midstream volumes, once again, drove results.
Adjusted operating cash flow at EQT was $390 million in the fourth quarter compared to $314 million for the fourth quarter of 2013.
Our operational performance continued to be outstanding in the fourth quarter with 33% higher Production volumes than the fourth quarter 2013. We also realized 40% higher gathering volumes than last year and continued low per unit operating cost in both businesses.
Finally, in the fourth quarter, effective tax rate was actually negative as the full year 2014 effective tax rate of approximately 30% ended up lower than the 33%, which we had applied to the first 3 quarters of 2014. The lower full year rate resulted from several factors, including some state tax planning that was implemented in the fourth quarter. The continuing impact of blending and the growing nontaxable EQM partnership earnings are consolidated with EQT and low pretax income as a result of the impairments in the fourth quarter.
Now moving on to a brief discussion of results by business segment. I will limit my discussion to the full year results as the explanations for the full year, for the most part, apply to the fourth quarter as well.
So starting with EQT Production operating results. As has been the case for many years, now the big story in '14 at EQT Production was the growth in sales of produced natural gas. As I mentioned, the growth rate was 26% higher for the year, driven by sales from our Marcellus wells. 2014 was our fifth straight year of more than 25% sales volume growth.
The EQT average realized sales price was relatively flat at $4.16 per Mcfe, and 14 -- about $0.04 lower than it was in 2013. For segment reporting purposes, of that $4.16 per Mcfe realized by EQT Corporation, $3.23 was allocated to EQT Production with the remaining $0.93 to EQT Midstream. The majority of this $0.93 at Midstream is for gathering, which averaged $0.73 per Mcfe.
I'd like to summarize a few changes that we made to our price reconciliation table, which should help in understanding the buildup of our realized price, which excludes noncash impacts. First, we applied the processing deduction directly to the liquid sales rather than averaging those deductions across all gas and liquids volumes.
And secondly, we moved the Btu uplift to the natural gas sale section of the table to reflect the fact that on average, our gas has a higher Btu content than the NYMEX spec, primarily as a result of ethane that is sold as methane. Because of that higher Btu value, we realized a higher price per Mcf at NYMEX, which is reflected on the table.
And then finally, we added an average differential line. The average differentials include the impact of local basis, recoveries received from selling some of our natural gas into higher-priced markets, recoveries from the resale of unused capacity and the impact of cash settled basis swaps. With these changes, it better explains the sales price that we received for our gas.
For the full year, total operating expenses at EQT Production were 600 -- $867 million, excluding the impairment charges of 9% higher year-over-year.
Absolute DD&A, SG&A, LOE and production taxes were all higher, again, consistent with the significant production growth.
Moving now to the Midstream business. Operating income here was up 17% year-over-year, mainly as a result of the continued growth on gathered volumes and the subsequent entries in gathering total operating revenues. Transmission net revenues also increased by almost 41% year-over-year as a result of an increase in firm-contracted capacity.
Net operating expenses at Midstream were about 17% higher year-over-year, and that, again, was consistent with the growth in the Midstream business.
Finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the year in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $950 million in cash on the balance sheet, and that excludes cash on hand at EQM. Based on current commodity prices, we forecast approximately $1 billion in operating cash flow for 2015 at EQT, and that is, again, excluding the noncontrolling interest portion of adjusted EQM EBITDA.
So we expect to fund our roughly $2 billion, 2015 CapEx forecast, again, excluding EQM, with that expected cash flow and current cash on hand.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Schlotterbeck to discuss the reduction in our CapEx forecast as well as today's reserve release."

As you read in today's press release, we were lowering our 2015 CapEx budget by $450 million or 18% in response to the current economic environment.

As you read in today's press release, we were lowering our 2015 CapEx budget by $450 million or 18% in response to the current economic environment. This consists of $425 million in EQT Production and $25 million in EQT Midstream. Of the $425 million reductions at EQT Production, $400 million is related to reductions in our drilling and completions budgets. We're reducing our Permian program to 5 wells, which were required to hold our acreage. And in the Marcellus, we are narrowing our focus to our highest-return Marcellus development areas. And the remaining $25 million reduction is in G&G and facilities expenditures.
These cuts do not assume any service cost deflation. While we expect to realize significant service cost reductions, we are currently in negotiations with all of our suppliers and do not want to forecast specific savings until those negotiations are concluded.
Moving on to our dry gas Utica well. As you know, we spud this county [ph] well in November. During the drilling of the curve, we encountered higher-than-expected reservoir pressures. Based on the pressures observed, we needed to significantly increase our mud weight. However, the mud system on the rig is not rated high enough for what's required to continue drilling. Therefore, we are now bringing in a rig with a higher-rated mud system, which has caused us to be behind our original schedule. We expect that rig to be on location toward the end of February. But despite this minor timing setback, we continue to be excited and optimistic about our dry gas Utica potential beneath our acreage.
Finally, I'd like to discuss our reserve report. This morning, we announced year-end 2014 total proved reserves of 10.7 Tcfe, with a 2.4 Tcfe or 29% higher than the previous year and represents a reserve replacement ratio of 590%. Extensions in discoveries totaled 3.3 Tcfe, which included 939 Bcfe of crude reserves from 220 wells that were unproved in 2013, but they were drilled and completed in 2014. This is consistent with the company's history of continuing to expand its footprint and develop areas that we believe to be economic even when they do not meet the SEC's definition of proved reserves.
Another piece of the 3.3 Tcfe of extensions in discoveries was 1.4 Tcfe of previously probable and possible reserves that we plan to drill over the next 5 years that were moved to proved undeveloped due to expansion of the geographic area classified as proved, longer-planned laterals and improved type curves.
Additionally, 954 Bcfe from new locations, primarily as a result of acreage additions, were booked as PUD reserves.
And one final comment on proved reserves, 790 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves were converted to crude developed in 2014 as a result of our drilling and completion program.
Our 3P reserves, or the total of proved, probable, and possible reserves, increased 6.4 Tcfe to 42.8 Tcfe, an 18% increase over the prior year. This increase was mostly in the Marcellus and does not include any dry Utica.
And finally, we are adjusting our guidance for our DD&A rate for 2015 to reflect the finalized reserve report. We now estimate our per unit DD&A to be $1.17 per Mcfe or $0.05 lower than 2014.
Also, as you see in our 10-K that we expect to file next week, our after-tax PV-10 was $4.8 billion, 22% higher than last year, driven by the increase in crude reserves. This reflects a NYMEX price calculating in accordance with the SEC requirements that was $0.70 per dekatherm higher than in 2013. However, a decrease in regional basis of $0.71 per dekatherm led to an effective wellhead price that was $0.01 lower than last year.
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Porges for his comments."

Given the straightforward results for the fourth quarter, I will limit my prepared remarks to a discussion of our 2 announcements back on December 8, our 2015 operational forecast and our intent to form a second master limited partnershi",1012,"Thank you, Steve. Given the straightforward results for the fourth quarter, I will limit my prepared remarks to a discussion of our 2 announcements back on December 8, our 2015 operational forecast and our intent to form a second master limited partnership, or MLP. As you know, this is our first conference call since we've made those announcements, and we thought there might be some interest in hearing us elaborate on those topics as both pertain to our contemplated activities in 2015.
Let's cover the MLP first. Our intent with this new vehicle is that it will own EQT's general partner, or GP, interest in EQT Midstream Partners, or EQM, including the incentive distribution rights. And it will also own the $21 million EQM common units that are owned by EQT. EQT will be the general partner of the new MLP. And as a result, EQT will continue to operate both MLPs, a distinct advantage as we execute on our development plans.
Once EQM's 2014 Form 10-K is filed and the results are incorporated into the draft prospectus, we intend to file that document, the S-1, with the Securities and Exchange Commission during the first quarter. This will begin the iterative process of review by the SEC in response by us, so we hope to be ready for an IPO by about midyear, but the timing will depend upon that review process.
We do not believe that the rapidly growing GP cash flows are being fairly valued in the EQT stock price. As we reviewed our alternatives to rectify that situation, we concluded that we wanted to be a vehicle that was publicly traded; had favorable tax attributes, such as those offered by an MLP; retains effective operational control by EQT, as long as that seems optimal; and that would allow a tax-efficient separation from EQT should we decide to affect one in the future. To be clear, we do believe there are significant operational synergies between a midstream and upstream business during this time of rapid growth. We recognize that this period will not continue indefinitely, and we need to be quite comfortable, but the chosen structure would not preclude a tax-efficient separation should that become desirable.
As tied to the announcement, we received a few offline questions as to why we chose the MLP structure over the structure known as Up-C. We did give that latter structure significant consideration but concluded that the age of a significant portion of the EQM assets precluded favorable tax treatment offered by the Up-C structure. Also, we concluded after much in-depth discussion with tax experts that a tax-efficient separation was every bit as feasible for a standard MLP as for an Up-C.
Moving on to our operational forecast for 2015. You have read about the specific statistics in the December release and revisions in today's earnings release and heard more about this just now from Steve. What I would like to add in the discussion is more about our thought process, especially how it relates to our financial situation and philosophy.
As Phil mentioned, we ended 2014 with $950 million in cash at the EQT level and investment-grade rating from the 3 major rating agencies: 0 drawn on a $1.5 billion unsecured revolver; $200 million of Midstream EBITDA still owned by EQT Corp; our plan to drop our Northern West Virginia gathering assets to EQM in 2015; and proceeds expected from the previously discussed GP IPO. In that context, when we announced our budget in December, we were comfortable with a CapEx estimate that was about $1.2 billion higher than our operating cash flow estimate for 2015. Frankly, my expectation was that the GP IPO proceeds would not be touched in any of that. That money would remain in the bank account as of the end of 2015.
Since that time, the 2015 NYMEX strip for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs has declined significantly. Using current prices, we estimate that our operating cash flow for 2015 will be approximately $300 million less than we anticipated at the time of that release in December. As a result, we decided to lower our activity level to more than match the decline in operating cash flow. So if things play out as planned, we expect to end 2015 with significant cash on hand, nothing drawn on the revolver, et cetera. In other words, with this revision, our current expectation is that we will be in a better position from a financial liquidity perspective than we expected at the time of the December release.
In times of financial stress such as these, we think the prudent approach is to be conservative financially. Whatever happens over the course of the rest of this year from a financial perspective, quicker recovery or slower recovery, the presence or absence of opportunities created by overextended peers, et cetera, we believe we are better off with cash on hand, strong credit position and strong equity position.
In my opinion, it is too early in the cycle for us to know how this will play out. But no matter what happens, we are confident that having a strong balance sheet will create shareholder value. At the least, it feels good to know that we already have clear line of sight for funding robust, value-accretive drilling programs this year as well as, at least, the next couple of years.
I believe that our strong balance sheet will differentiate EQT during this low-price environment, as we will be able to continue to efficiently and profitably develop our acreage over a multiyear period and emerge from the cycle stronger than when we entered it.
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by intelligently accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on doing what we can to increase the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat."

Adjusted operating cash flow attributab",772,"Thanks, Pat. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.08, which represents a 20% decrease from adjusted EPS in the first quarter 2014. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT also decreased by about 16% to $386 million for the quarter. 
We had another very solid operational quarter, including record produce natural gas sales and record gathering volumes in Midstream. Our high-level story for the first quarter were strong volume growth more than offset by lower realized prices. Our pricing was significantly below last year. Our average differential was better than expected, offsetting some of the impact of lower prices. This came primarily as a result of moving gas in higher price Northeast market in the first quarter 2015. 
As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results, and EQT recorded $47.7 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest or $0.31 per diluted share in the first quarter 2015 as compared to $18.7 million or $0.12 per diluted share in the first quarter 2014. This increase also had an impact on the effective tax rate in the quarter, which was around 20% and they have been lower than some of you expected. That is a function of both the increasing noncontrolling interest portion of EQM, which is not tax affected as well as Production income, income which is tax affected being a smaller piece of the overall pie versus last year as a result of lower commodity prices. 
Other than that, the first quarter was very straightforward and I will keep my remarks fairly brief. The story in the quarter at EQT Production continues to be growth in sales of produce natural gas. Production sales growth in the recently completed quarter was 37% higher than the first the first quarter oh 2014. NGL volumes were also higher, 71% higher than last year, accounting for 9% of our total volumes. However, as I mentioned, the lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The realized price at EQT Production was $2.77 per Mcf equivalent compared to $4.50 per Mcf equivalent last year. And you will find the components of the price differences in the tables in this morning's press release. 
Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $316.4 million or $81.2 million higher quarter-over-quarter. In March, we decided to suspend drilling in the Permian basin as projected economics continued to deteriorate. There are several expenses in the first quarter related to that decision as well as the lower commodity prices in general. In SG&A, we recognized $11 million of expenses related to discontinued drilling, including rig termination costs, a write-down of some well casing inventory and operating well impairment. Exploration expense was also higher and includes $11 million of noncash lease impairments. 
Shifting back to operating results. Higher DD&A expense accounted for $40 million as an increase in total operating expenses and was driven by volume growth, but partially offset by a lower average depletion rate in 2015. Transportation and processing expenses were $15 million higher than last year, and you should note that these expenses were previously presented as revenue deductions in EQT Production's results. And as you would expect, recorded EQT Production revenues are higher as well to reflect that in the presentation. LOE, including Production taxes, was essentially flat compared to last year. 
Moving on to the Midstream business. Operating income here was up 56%. This is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity-based transmission revenue. Gathering net operating revenues increased by 44% to $129 million, and gathering volumes increased by about 47%. Transmission net revenues increased by $20 million or 38% as additional fund capacity was added over the past year mostly in the second quarter 2014. Storage marketing and other net operating revenues were down slightly about $1.4 million lower in the first quarter. Total operating expenses at Midstream were $11 million higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of continuing growth in our Midstream business. On a per-unit basis, however, gathering and compression expense was down 32% [ph] as a result of volumes growing much faster than expected. 
Just a brief note on liquidity. EQT currently has $1.6 billion of cash on hand and not including EQM and full availability under EQT's $1.5 billion credit facility. So we remain in a great liquidity position to accomplish our goals for the foreseeable future. Our current estimate of 2015 EQT operating cash flow adjusted to excluding the noncontrolling interest portion of EQM's cash flow is $900 million. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Steve Schlotterbeck."

As you read in today's press release, we are lowering our 2015 CapEx forecast by $150 million to reflect the midpoint of our negotiated service cost reductions that we published on our March analyst presentation. Based on these reduced service costs, we expect our average cost per well to be between 10% and 15% less than last year. If weak commodity prices persist, we believe there could be more opportunities to cut cost, but for now, we think 10% to 15% is a reasonable expectation. 
Also, in response to oil prices, we decided to suspend drilling in the Permian Basin because it already reduced to grow the minimum number of wells to hold certain leases. As a result, we will reduce our development rates to approximately 700 Wolfcamp acres [indiscernible] only a tough decision that leases expire, but we think in this environment, that's a prudent economic decision. 
Moving on to our dry gas Utica well. As you know, we spud this County well in November. During the drilling of the we incurred higher-than-expected revenue pressures, and based on the pressures observed, we needed to significantly increase our rate, which required a larger rig. To deploy the larger rig in March and completed the drilling of the well with a final lateral length of 3,300 feet. We're currently running some reservoir testing expect to begin fracking in early June. Despite this timing setback, we continue to be excited and optimistic about the dry gas Utica potential beneath our acreage. Upon completion of the Greene County well, we plan to drill a deep Utica well in West Virginia this year. Since we still have not any results from our first well, we will not speculate about those results, but we will provide you with updates as we learn more. 
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Porges for his comments."

This means the new vehicle, whose New York Stock Exchange symbol is expected to be EQGP, will own EQT's general partner or GP interest, including the content distribution rights, and they will also own the 22 million EQM limited partner units owned by EQT. On February 12, we filed the initial draft S-1 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We received comments from the SEC on the draft and incorporated them into a revised s-1, which was filed on April 1. This is through a process reviewed by the SEC in response by oh, so we cannot accurately predict the timing of a final S-1, but we reiterate our hope to be ready for Initial Public Offering of EQGP by about midyear. 
Now for an update on the Mountain value pipeline or MVP. In the first quarter, MVP announced the addition of WGL holdings and Vega Energy Partners, our EGL subsidiary to the joint venture. As we have previously discussed, this project will be built and operated by EQT Midstream Partners. EQM's ownership internet interest in the JV is 55%, [indiscernible] 35% and WGL and subsidiaries own 10%. In addition to their ownership stake, WGL will be a shipper on the pipeline has also agreed to purchase 500 million cubic feet per day of natural gas priced at Transco station 165. We believe this further validates the demand markets desire to access the abundant Marcellus and Utica supply resource. EQT shareholders will benefit in 2 ways from this project. First, they will provide EQT Production access to one of the fastest-growing gas consumption markets in the United States; and second, it will provide cash flow growth at the MLP, which adds the value of our GP LP interest. 
In conclusion, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by intelligently accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We have a very strong balance sheet, which will allow us to continue to be focused on doing what we can to increase the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat Kane again."

I would say a few of our contracts have been backdated a little bit, but for the most part, most of them have been point forward from the time we negotiated the lower cost so most of that is prospective. The one line item I will comment on in the opposite direction is our rig cost, our day rates. Most of our rigs are under longer-term contracts. They don't expire this year, so we have relatively little leverage in that area. So our lack of leverage is reflected in that 10% to 15% estimate. If soft prices continue into next year and the year after, we'll be in a position to benefit from lower rig cost, but for now, we're not. I think our plan right now regarding redeployment of that capital is to keep it on the balance sheet. We think in this low price environment and the growth rates we're expecting, we're pretty good spot and don't feel compelled just because we'll have some extra money to run out and spend it just because we have it.

As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.08, which represents a 20% decrease from adjusted EPS in the first quarter 2014. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT also decreased by about 16% to $386 million for the quarter. 
We had another very solid operational quarter, including record produce natural gas sales and record gathering volumes in Midstream. Our high-level story for the first quarter were strong volume growth more than offset by lower realized prices. Our pricing was significantly below last year. Our average differential was better than expected, offsetting some of the impact of lower prices. This came primarily as a result of moving gas to higher price Northeast markets in the first quarter 2015. 
As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results, and EQT recorded $47.7 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest or $0.31 per diluted share in the first quarter 2015 as compared to $18.7 million or $0.12 per diluted share in the first quarter 2014. This increase also had an impact on the effective tax rate in the quarter, which was around 20%, and they have been lower than some of you expected. That is a function of both the increasing noncontrolling interest portion of EQM which is not tax affected, as well as Production income, which is tax affected being a smaller piece of the overall pie versus last year as a result of lower commodity prices. 
Other than that, the first quarter was very straightforward, and I will keep my remarks fairly brief. The story in the quarter at EQT Production continues to be growth in sales of produced natural gas. Production sales growth in the recently completed quarter was 37% higher than the first the first quarter of 2014. NGL volumes were also higher, 71% higher than last year, accounting for 9% of our total volumes. However, as I mentioned, the lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The realized price at EQT Production was $2.77 per Mcf equivalent compared to $4.50 per Mcf equivalent last year. And you will find the detail of components of the price differences in the tables in this morning's press release. 
Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $316.4 million or $81.2 million higher quarter-over-quarter. In March, we decided to suspend drilling in the Permian basin as projected economics continued to deteriorate. There are several expenses in the first quarter related to that decision as well as to lower commodity prices in general. In SG&A, we recognized $11 million of expenses related to discontinued drilling, including rig termination costs, a write-down of some well casing inventory and operating well impairments. Exploration expense was also higher and includes $11 million of noncash lease impairments. 
Shifting back to operating results. Higher DD&A expense accounted for $40 million of the increase in total operating expenses and was driven by volume growth but partially offset by a lower average depletion rate in 2015. Transportation and processing expenses were $15 million higher than last year, and you should note that these expenses were previously presented as revenue deductions in EQT Production's results. And as you would expect, recorded EQT Production revenues are higher as well to reflect that in the presentation. LOE, including production taxes, was essentially flat compared to last year. 
Moving on to the Midstream business. Operating income here was up 56%. This is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity-based transmission revenue. Gathering net operating revenues increased by 44% to $129 million, and gathering volumes increased by about 47%. Transmission net revenues increased by $20 million or 38% as additional fund capacity was added over the past year, mostly in the second quarter 2014.  Storage marketing and other net operating revenues were down slightly about $1.4 million lower in the first quarter. Total operating expenses at Midstream were $11 million higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of continuing growth in our Midstream business. On a per-unit basis, however, gathering and compression expense was down 32% as a result of volumes growing much faster than expected. 
Just a brief note on liquidity. EQT currently has $1.6 billion of cash on hand and not including EQM and full availability under EQT's $1.5 billion credit facility. So we remain in a great liquidity position to accomplish our goals for the foreseeable future. Our current estimate of 2015 EQT operating cash flow adjusted to exclude the noncontrolling interest portion of EQM's cash flow is $900 million. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Steve Schlotterbeck."

As you read in today's press release, we are lowering our 2015 CapEx forecast by $150 million to reflect the midpoint of our negotiated service cost reductions that we published in our March analyst presentation. Based on these reduced service costs, we expect our average cost per well to be between 10% and 15% less than last year. If weak commodity prices persist, we believe there could be more opportunities to cut costs, but for now, we think 10% to 15% is a reasonable expectation. 
Also in response to weak oil prices, we've decided to suspend drilling in the Permian Basin because it already reduced to grow the minimum number of wells to hold certain leases. As a result, we will reduce our development rates to approximately 700 offered Upper Wolfcamp acres. It's always a tough decision that leases expire, but we think in this environment, that's a prudent economic decision. 
Moving on to our dry gas Utica well. As you know, we spud this county well in November. During the drilling of the currently encountered higher-than-expected reservoir pressures, and based on the pressures observed, we needed to significantly increase our med way, which required a larger rig. To deploy the larger rig in March and completed the drilling of the well with a final lateral length of 3,300 feet, we're currently running some reservoir testing expect to begin fracking in early June. Despite this timing setback, we continue to be excited and optimistic about the dry gas Utica potential beneath our acreage. Upon completion of the Greene County well, we plan to drill a deep Utica well in West Virginia this year. Since we still have not any results from our first well, we will not speculate about those results, but we will provide you with updates as we learn more. 
I will now turn the call over to Dave Porges for his comments."

Let's cover the master limited partnership first, the new one. As we discussed in February, we decided to take public a new vehicle that will own all of EQT's interests in EQT Midstream Partners or EQM. This means the new vehicle, whose New York Stock Exchange symbol is expected to be EQGP, will own EQT's general partner or GP interest, including the intent of distribution rights, and they will also own the 22 million EQM limited partner units owned by EQT. On February 12, we filed the initial draft S-1 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We've received comments from the SEC on the draft and incorporated them into a revised S-1, which was filed on April 1. This is an iterative process of review by the SEC in response by us so we cannot accurately predict the timing of a final S-1, but we reiterate our hope to be ready for Initial Public Offering of EQGP by about midyear. 
Now for an update on the Mountain Valley Pipeline or MVP. In the first quarter, MVP announced the addition of WGL Holdings and Vega Energy Partners, our WGL subsidiary to the joint venture. As we have previously discussed, this project will be built and operated by EQT Midstream Partners. EQM's ownership internet interest in the JV is 55%, next to URA, 35% and WGL and subsidiaries owned, 10%. In addition to their ownership stake, WGL will be a shipper on the pipeline and has also agreed to purchase 500 million cubic feet per day of natural gas priced at Transco station 165. We believe this further validates the demand market's desire to access the abundant Marcellus and Utica supply resource. EQT shareholders will benefit in 2 ways from this project: First, it will provide EQT Production access to one of the fastest-growing gas consumption markets in the United States; and second, it will provide cash flow growth at the MLP, which adds to the value of our GP and LP interests. 
In conclusion, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by intelligently accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We have a very strong balance sheet which will allow us to continue to be focused on doing what we can to increase the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support.

I would say a few of our contracts have been backdated a little bit, but for the most part, most of them have been point forward from the time we negotiated the lower cost, so most of that is prospective. The one line item I will comment on in the opposite direction is our rig cost, our day rates. Most of our rigs are under longer-term contracts. They don't expire this year. So we have relatively little leverage in that area. So our lack of leverage is reflected in that 10% to 15% estimate. If soft prices continue into next year and the year after, we'll be in a position to benefit from lower rig cost, but for now, we're not.

We think in this low-price environment and the growth rates we're expecting, we're in pretty good spot and don't feel compelled just because we'll have some extra money to run out and spend it just because we have it. So for now, it'll stay on the balance sheet, and we'll revisit that periodically as commodity prices move."

It'll take is probably several wells to get the costs in line with where we they'll be long term. Maybe the one additional color I'll add that maybe is on the positive side, right now it's theory in our practice is on the proppant where -- first couple of wells, we're going to use ceramic proppant, which is quite a bit more expensive than sand. It looks like it's going to run about $100,000 per stage or $2.5 million per typical well to use ceramic versus sand. Our reservoir engineering at this point is suggesting that it might be possible to use sand in these wells. So that'll be something we're testing, probably not in these first 2 wells but in subsequent months.

As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.08, which represents a 20% decrease from adjusted EPS in the first quarter 2014. Adjusted operating cash flow attributab",767,"Thanks, Pat. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.08, which represents a 20% decrease from adjusted EPS in the first quarter 2014. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT also decreased by about 16% to $386 million for the quarter. 
We had another very solid operational quarter, including record produced natural gas sales and record gathering volumes in Midstream. Our high-level story for the first quarter was strong volume growth more than offset by lower realized prices. Our pricing was significantly below last year. Our average differential was better than expected, offsetting some of the impact of lower prices. This came primarily as a result of moving gas to higher priced Northeast markets in the first quarter 2015. 
As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results, and EQT recorded $47.7 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests or $0.31 per diluted share in the first quarter 2015 as compared to $18.7 million or $0.12 per diluted share in the first quarter 2014. This increase also had an impact on the effective tax rate in the quarter, which was around 20%, and they have been lower than some of you expected. That is a function of both the increasing noncontrolling interest portion of EQM, which is not tax affected, as well as Production income, which is tax affected being a smaller piece of the overall pie versus last year as a result of lower commodity prices. 
Other than that, the first quarter was very straightforward, and I will keep my remarks fairly brief. The story in the quarter at EQT Production continues to be growth in sales of produced natural gas. Production sales growth in the recently completed quarter was 37% higher than the first quarter of 2014. NGL volumes were also higher, 71% higher than last year, accounting for 9% of our total volumes. However, as I mentioned, the lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The realized price at EQT Production was $2.77 per Mcf equivalent compared to $4.50 per Mcf equivalent last year. And you will find the detailed components of the price differences in the tables in this morning's press release. 
Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $316.4 million or $81.2 million higher quarter-over-quarter. In March, we decided to suspend drilling in the Permian basin as projected economics continued to deteriorate. There are several expenses in the first quarter related to that decision as well as to lower commodity prices in general. In SG&A, we recognized $11 million of expenses related to discontinued drilling, including rig termination costs, a write-down of some well casing inventory and operating well impairments. Exploration expense was also higher and includes $11 million of noncash lease impairments. 
Shifting back to operating results. Higher DD&A expense accounted for $40 million of the increase in total operating expenses and was driven by volume growth, but partially offset by a lower average depletion rate in 2015. Transportation and processing expenses were $15 million higher than last year, and you should note that these expenses were previously presented as revenue deductions in EQT Production's results. And as you would expect, reported EQT Production revenues are higher as well to reflect that new presentation. LOE, including production taxes, was essentially flat compared to last year. 
Moving on to the Midstream business. Operating income here was up 56%. This is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity-based transmission revenue. Gathering net operating revenues increased by 44% to $129 million, as gathering volumes increased by about 47%. Transmission net revenues increased by $20 million or 38% as additional firm capacity was added over the past year, mostly in the second quarter 2014.  Storage, marketing and other net operating revenues were down slightly about $1.4 million lower in the first quarter. Total operating expenses at Midstream were $11 million higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of continuing growth in our Midstream business. On a per-unit basis, however, gathering and compression expense was down 31% as a result of volumes growing much faster than expected. 
Just a brief note on liquidity. EQT currently has $1.6 billion of cash on hand, not including EQM, and full availability under EQT's $1.5 billion credit facility. So we remain in a great liquidity position to accomplish our goals for the foreseeable future. Our current estimate of 2015 EQT operating cash flow adjusted to exclude the noncontrolling interest portion of EQM's cash flow is $900 million. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Steve Schlotterbeck."

As you read in today's press release, we are lowering our 2015 CapEx forecast by $150 million to reflect the midpoint of our negotiated service cost reductions that we published in our March analyst presentation. Based on these reduced service costs, we expect our average cost per well to be between 10% and 15% less than last year. If weak commodity prices persist, we believe there could be more opportunities to cut costs, but for now, we think 10% to 15% is a reasonable expectation. 
Also in response to weak oil prices, we've decided to suspend drilling in the Permian Basin which was already reduced to grow the minimum number of wells to hold certain leases. As a result, we will lose our development rights to approximately 700 Upper Wolfcamp acres. It's always a tough decision to let leases expire, but we think in this environment, that's a prudent economic decision. 
Moving on to our dry gas Utica well. As you know, we spud this Greene County well in November. During the drilling of the cur [ph] we encountered higher-than-expected reservoir pressures, and based on the pressures observed, we needed to significantly increase our mud weight, which required a larger rig. We deployed the larger rig in March and completed the drilling of the well with a final lateral length of 3,300 feet. We're currently running some reservoir tests and expect to begin fracking in early June. Despite this timing setback, we continue to be excited and optimistic about the dry gas Utica potential beneath our acreage. Upon completion of the Greene County well, we plan to drill a deep Utica well in Wetzel County, West Virginia this year. Since we still do not have any results from our first well, we will not speculate about those results, but we will provide you with updates as we learn more. 
I will now turn the call over to Dave Porges for his comments."

Let's cover the master limited partnership first, the new one. As we discussed in February, we decided to take public a new vehicle that will own all of EQT's interests in EQT Midstream Partners or EQM. This means the new vehicle, whose New York Stock Exchange symbol is expected to be EQGP, will own EQT's general partner or GP interest, including the intent of distribution rights, and it will also own the 22 million EQM limited partner units owned by EQT. On February 12, we filed the initial draft S-1 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We received comments from the SEC on the draft and incorporated them into a revised S-1, which was filed on April 1. This is an iterative process of review by the SEC and response by us so we cannot accurately predict the timing of a final S-1, but we reiterate our hope to be ready for an Initial Public Offering of EQGP by about midyear. 
Now for an update on the Mountain Valley Pipeline or MVP. In the first quarter, MVP announced the addition of WGL Holdings and Vega Energy Partners, a WGL subsidiary, to the joint venture. As we have previously discussed, this project will be built and operated by EQT Midstream Partners. EQM's ownership interest in the JV is 55%.  NextERA owns 35% and WGL and subsidiaries owns 10%. In addition to their ownership stake, WGL will be a shipper on the pipeline and has also agreed to purchase 500 million cubic feet per day of natural gas priced at Transco station 165. We believe this further validates the demand market's desire to access the abundant Marcellus and Utica supply resource. EQT shareholders will benefit in 2 ways from this project: First, it will provide EQT Production access to one of the fastest-growing gas consumption markets in the United States; and second, it will provide cash flow growth at the MLP, which adds to the value of our GP and LP interests. 
In conclusion, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by intelligently accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We have a very strong balance sheet which will allow us to continue to be focused on doing what we can to increase the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support.

I would say a few of our contracts have been backdated a little bit, but for the most part, most of them have been pulling forward from the time we negotiated the lower costs, so most of that is prospective. The one line item I will comment on in the opposite direction is our rig cost, our day rates. Most of our rigs are under longer-term contracts that don't expire this year. So we have relatively little leverage in that area. So our lack of leverage is reflected in that 10% to 15% estimate. If soft prices continue into next year and the year after, we'll be in a position to benefit from lower rig costs, but for now, we're not. I think our plan right now regarding redeployment of that capital is to keep it on the balance sheet. We think in this low-price environment and the growth rates we're expecting, we're in a pretty good spot and don't feel compelled, just because we'll have some extra money, to run out and spend it just because we have it.

So the mud cost will probably be a bit more expensive since we had to use heavier mud than we would have originally thought. I think everything else, over time, there will be a learning curve. It'll take us probably several wells to get the costs in line with where we think they'll be long term. Maybe the one additional color I'll add that maybe is on the positive side, although right now it's theory, not practice, is on the proppant where -- for our first couple of wells we're going to use ceramic proppant, which is quite a bit more expensive than sand. It looks like it's going to run about $100,000 per stage or $2.5 million per typical well to use ceramic versus sand. Our reservoir engineering at this point is suggesting that it might be possible to use sand in these wells. So that'll be something we're testing, probably not in these first 2 wells, but in subsequent wells. So that's some positive news from our end in terms of what the long-term development costs for deep Utica will be on our acreage."

As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.08, which represents a 20% decrease from adjusted EPS in the first quarter 2014. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT also decreased by about 16% to $386 million for the quarter. 
We had another very solid operational quarter, including record produced natural gas sales and record gathering volumes in Midstream. Our high-level story for the first quarter was strong volume growth more than offset by lower realized prices. Our pricing was significantly below last year. Our average differential was better than expected, offsetting some of the impact of lower prices. This came primarily as a result of moving gas to higher priced Northeast markets in the first quarter 2015. 
As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results, and EQT recorded $47.7 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests or $0.31 per diluted share in the first quarter 2015 as compared to $18.7 million or $0.12 per diluted share in the first quarter 2014. This increase also had an impact on the effective tax rate in the quarter, which was around 20%, and they have been lower than some of you expected. That is a function of both the increasing noncontrolling interest portion of EQM, which is not tax affected, as well as Production income, which is tax affected being a smaller piece of the overall pie versus last year as a result of lower commodity prices. 
Other than that, the first quarter was very straightforward, and I will keep my remarks fairly brief. The story in the quarter at EQT Production continues to be growth in sales of produced natural gas. Production sales growth in the recently completed quarter was 37% higher than the first quarter of 2014. NGL volumes were also higher, 71% higher than last year, accounting for 9% of our total volumes. However, as I mentioned, the lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The realized price at EQT Production was $2.77 per Mcf equivalent compared to $4.50 per Mcf equivalent last year. And you will find the detailed components of the price differences in the tables in this morning's press release. 
Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $316.4 million or $81.2 million higher quarter-over-quarter. In March, we decided to suspend drilling in the Permian basin as projected economics continued to deteriorate. There are several expenses in the first quarter related to that decision as well as to lower commodity prices in general. In SG&A, we recognized $11 million of expenses related to discontinued drilling, including rig termination costs, a write-down of some well casing inventory and operating well impairments. Exploration expense was also higher and includes $11 million of noncash lease impairments. 
Shifting back to operating results. Higher DD&A expense accounted for $40 million of the increase in total operating expenses and was driven by volume growth, but partially offset by a lower average depletion rate in 2015. Transportation and processing expenses were $15 million higher than last year, and you should note that these expenses were previously presented as revenue deductions in EQT Production's results. And as you would expect, reported EQT Production revenues are higher as well to reflect that new presentation. LOE, including production taxes, was essentially flat compared to last year. 
Moving on to the Midstream business. Operating income here was up 56%. This is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity-based transmission revenue. Gathering net operating revenues increased by 44% to $129 million, as gathering volumes increased by about 47%. Transmission net revenues increased by $20 million or 38% as additional firm capacity was added over the past year, mostly in the second quarter 2014. Storage, marketing and other net operating revenues were down slightly about $1.4 million lower in the first quarter. Total operating expenses at Midstream were $11 million higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of continuing growth in our Midstream business. On a per-unit basis, however, gathering and compression expense was down 31% as a result of volumes growing much faster than expected. 
Just a brief note on liquidity. EQT currently has $1.6 billion of cash on hand, not including EQM, and full availability under EQT's $1.5 billion credit facility. So we remain in a great liquidity position to accomplish our goals for the foreseeable future. Our current estimate of 2015 EQT operating cash flow adjusted to exclude the noncontrolling interest portion of EQM's cash flow is $900 million. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Steve Schlotterbeck."

As you read in today's press release, we are lowering our 2015 CapEx forecast by $150 million to reflect the midpoint of our negotiated service cost reductions that we published in our March analyst presentation. Based on these reduced service costs, we expect our average cost per well to be between 10% and 15% less than last year. If weak commodity prices persist, we believe there could be more opportunities to cut costs, but for now, we think 10% to 15% is a reasonable expectation. 
Also in response to weak oil prices, we've decided to suspend drilling in the Permian Basin which was already reduced to grow the minimum number of wells to hold certain leases. As a result, we will lose our development rights to approximately 700 Upper Wolfcamp acres. It's always a tough decision to let leases expire, but we think in this environment, that's a prudent economic decision. 
Moving on to our dry gas Utica well. As you know, we spud this Greene County well in November. During the drilling of the cur [ph] we encountered higher-than-expected reservoir pressures, and based on the pressures observed, we needed to significantly increase our mud weight, which required a larger rig. We deployed the larger rig in March and completed the drilling of the well with a final lateral length of 3,300 feet. We're currently running some reservoir tests and expect to begin fracking in early June. Despite this timing setback, we continue to be excited and optimistic about the dry gas Utica potential beneath our acreage. Upon completion of the Greene County well, we plan to drill a deep Utica well in Wetzel County, West Virginia this year. Since we still do not have any results from our first well, we will not speculate about those results, but we will provide you with updates as we learn more. 
I will now turn the call over to Dave Porges for his comments."

Let's cover the master limited partnership first, the new one. As we discussed in February, we decided to take public a new vehicle that will own all of EQT's interests in EQT Midstream Partners or EQM. This means the new vehicle, whose New York Stock Exchange symbol is expected to be EQGP, will own EQT's general partner or GP interest, including the intent of distribution rights, and it will also own the 22 million EQM limited partner units owned by EQT. On February 12, we filed the initial draft S-1 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We received comments from the SEC on the draft and incorporated them into a revised S-1, which was filed on April 1. This is an iterative process of review by the SEC and response by us so we cannot accurately predict the timing of a final S-1, but we reiterate our hope to be ready for an Initial Public Offering of EQGP by about midyear. 
Now for an update on the Mountain Valley Pipeline or MVP. In the first quarter, MVP announced the addition of WGL Holdings and Vega Energy Partners, a WGL subsidiary, to the joint venture. As we have previously discussed, this project will be built and operated by EQT Midstream Partners. EQM's ownership interest in the JV is 55%. NextERA owns 35% and WGL and subsidiaries owns 10%. In addition to their ownership stake, WGL will be a shipper on the pipeline and has also agreed to purchase 500 million cubic feet per day of natural gas priced at Transco station 165. We believe this further validates the demand market's desire to access the abundant Marcellus and Utica supply resource. EQT shareholders will benefit in 2 ways from this project: First, it will provide EQT Production access to one of the fastest-growing gas consumption markets in the United States; and second, it will provide cash flow growth at the MLP, which adds to the value of our GP and LP interests. 
In conclusion, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by intelligently accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We have a very strong balance sheet which will allow us to continue to be focused on doing what we can to increase the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support.

I think the -- because the biggest line item in our drilling costs is pumping services, that's what really drives that number more than anything. I would say a few of our contracts have been backdated a little bit, but for the most part, most of them have been pulling forward from the time we negotiated the lower costs, so most of that is prospective. The one line item I will comment on in the opposite direction is our rig cost, our day rates. Most of our rigs are under longer-term contracts that don't expire this year. So we have relatively little leverage in that area. So our lack of leverage is reflected in that 10% to 15% estimate. If soft prices continue into next year and the year after, we'll be in a position to benefit from lower rig costs, but for now, we're not. I think our plan right now regarding redeployment of that capital is to keep it on the balance sheet. We think in this low-price environment and the growth rates we're expecting, we're in a pretty good spot and don't feel compelled, just because we'll have some extra money, to run out and spend it just because we have it.

Maybe the one additional color I'll add that maybe is on the positive side, although right now it's theory, not practice, is on the proppant where -- for our first couple of wells we're going to use ceramic proppant, which is quite a bit more expensive than sand. It looks like it's going to run about $100,000 per stage or $2.5 million per typical well to use ceramic versus sand. Our reservoir engineering at this point is suggesting that it might be possible to use sand in these wells.

This call will be replayed for a 7-day period beginning at approximately 1:30 P.M. today. The telephone number for the replay is (719) 457-0820.
The confirmation code is 8682699. The call will also be replayed for 7 days on our website. 
To remind you, the results of the EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM; and EQGP Holdings, ticker EQGP, are consolidated in EQT's results. Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnerships conference call is at 11:30 AM today, which requires that we take the last question at 11:20. The dial-in number for that call is (913) 312-9034. The confirmation code is 2157781.
In just a moment, Phil will summarize EQT's results. Next, Steve will have a brief Utica update. Finally, Dave will provide preliminary thoughts on EQT's 2016 capital budget. Following the prepared remarks, Dave, Phil, Randy and Steve will be available to answer your questions.
I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and under risk factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the SEC and available on our website.
Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such financial measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Before turning the call over to Phil, I will walk you through one of the non-GAAP reconciliations that caused some confusion last quarter, specifically, Production adjusted net operating revenue presented on Page 7 of today's release. This number is used as the basis for calculating our average realized sales price as presented on the price reconciliation including -- included in this morning's release. The average realized price is calculated by dividing the adjusted net operating revenue by total sales volumes.
There is a non-capitalization in the release that I will briefly explain. We are making 2 adjustments to EQT Production total operating revenues as reported on the segment page in order to provide you with operating revenues excluding the noncash impact of derivatives and the net of transportation and processing costs. 
With respect to derivatives, adjustments for nontax derivative activity have been a subject of SEC comments over the past couple of years. As a result, in accordance with what appears to be the SEC's preference in this area, we adjust of noncash activity in 3 steps. First, we backout all gains and losses on derivatives [indiscernible] made this as hedges that were included in revenues during the period, which is the mark-to-market impact, which was 150 -- $160.5 million this quarter. Two, we add back the actual cash received, $33.2 million and deduct the premiums paid for derivatives that settled during the quarter, which was $1 million, which leaves us with just the actual cash received net of any premiums made in our adjusted revenue number.
So final adjustment on our non-GAAP reconciliations reduces the total operating revenues by $64.7 million of cost reported as expense on EQT Production segment page for transportation and processing. This provides a realized price net of processing cost, which is consistent with our historic presentation.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil Conti."

As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced the third quarter 2015 adjusted loss of $0.33 per diluted share, which represents an $0.83 per share decrease from adjusted EPS in the third quarter of '",673,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced the third quarter 2015 adjusted loss of $0.33 per diluted share, which represents an $0.83 per share decrease from adjusted EPS in the third quarter of '14.
Adjusted operating cash flow was $156.3 million in the quarter or 46% lower than the third quarter of 2014. Results for the quarter were negatively impacted by lower commodity prices. Due to lower prices since last quarter, we also recorded a significant noncash gain on hedges of future production of $128.3 million during the quarter and that was some of the stuff that Pat just talked and that's excluded from in the adjusted earnings and cash flow.
If I could take a look at our continuing and recently activities at EQGP. On October 20, [ph] 2015, EQGP announced that cash distribution to its unit holders of $0.104 per unit for the third quarter of '15 or a 13% increase over the equivalent full quarter distribution in the second quarter.
The third quarter distribution position represents $24.9 million in payments, which EQGP will receive on November 23. These quarterly payments will continue to grow as distributions on EQGP grow and highlight the value of EQGP to EQT. 
The operational results were fairly straightforward in the third quarter, so I'll move right into the segment results and I will be brief.
First, EQT Production continued to grow production sales volume by 27% compared to the third quarter of 2014. However, revenues from that growth were more than offset by the lower commodity prices negatively impacting results in the third quarter. The average realized price at EQT Production was $1.21 per Mcf equivalent, a 55% decrease from $2.69 per Mcf equivalent last year, which led to adjusted operating revenues for the quarter of $188.5 million or $142.5 million lower than last year's third quarter.
There were many factors that led to the lower price, but lower NYMEX and liquids prices versus last year were the primary drivers. You will find the detailed components of the price differences in the tables in this morning's release.
Adjusted operating loss at EQT Production was $72 million excluding the noncash gain on hedges or $128.3 million that I just mentioned. That compared to adjusted operating income of $107.9 million in the third quarter of '14, and that was also excluding the noncash gain on hedges.
Total operating expenses at EQT Production was $325.2 million or [indiscernible] higher compared to the third quarter 2014. DD&A was $30.2 million higher. Transportation and processing expense was about $16 million higher. Exploration expense was $4.6 million higher. And ROE, excluding production taxes, was about $1.6 million higher. All consistent with the rolling growth. Production tax decreased by $3 million due to lower commodity prices in the period.
SG&A expense excluding $3.5 million in [indiscernible] was about $500,000 higher. 
Midstream results. Here, the operating income was up 21%, and the increase is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity-based transmission charges. Gathering revenues increased 23 -- 23% to $125.9 million in the third quarter of '15 primarily due to a 24% increase in gathered volumes.
Transmission revenues for the third quarter 2015 increased by $6.9 million or 12% driven by additional firm contracted capacity added over the past year. 
Operating expenses at Midstream for the third quarter of $82.2 million were about $9.4 million higher than last year, consistent with the growth in the Midstream business. 
And just to conclude with a brief note on liquidity, EQT did have $1.7 million of cash on hand at quarter end, not including the cash at EQM and EQGP as well as forward [indiscernible] under EQT's $1.5 billion credit facility. So we remain in a strong liquidity position to accomplish our goals for the foreseeable future.
Our current estimate of 2015 EQT operating cash flow is $900 million adjusted to exclude the noncontrolling interest portion of EQM and EQGP's cash flow. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve."

Today, I'll provide you with an update on our [indiscernible] program. As discussed on the last call, we completed our first EQT Utica well in July, the 591330 [ph] .

As discussed on the last call, we completed our first EQT Utica well in July, the 591330 [ph] . To remind you, the well's initial 24-hour flow was 72.9 million cubic feet with an average [indiscernible] pressure of 8,641 PSI. We've been boring this well directly into the pipeline at a restricted rate of about 30 million cubic feet per day. Except for the 7 days required to install the wellhead equipment, the only sales have been steady at this rate. Casing pressure has been declining at an average of 40 PSI per day. As of yesterday, sales volumes were 30.4 million cubic feet per day and the casing pressure was 6,320 PSI.
Cumulative production from this well has totaled at 2.6 Bcf in the first 86 days of production. Our expectation is that the daily production rate will not decline until the well pressure declines through the pipeline pressure, which is 500 PSI. Based on an extrapolation of the current pressure decline rate, we estimate that we pressure after approximately 8 months of production, which will be in the late March, 2016. The cumulative production at that time would be approximately 7.4 Bcf. 
At that point, we had a wide range of possible decline curves as we do not have any analogous decline data to rely on. Our current reservoir model suggests an ultimate expected recovery for this well in the range between 13.9 Bcf and 18.8 Bcf or a range of 4.3 to 5.9 Bcf per thousand foot of lateral. 
[indiscernible] the lowest of our range and assuming the high end of our cost per well target of between $12.5 million and $14 million per well, we estimate returns of a $2 wellhead gas price to be north of 20% for a 5,400-foot lateral well.
Since the last call, we've spent 2 additional Utica wells. In August, we spread a second well, with number 593066, which is located approximately 5 miles northeast of the well. We're currently at a depth of 12,200 feet and install the intermediate casing.
We're just beginning to draw the curve on this well and expect this well to be in line before the end of the year.
The third well is spread it September in Wetzel County, West Virginia, the big 190 well and is located approximately 30 miles southwest of the well. We reached TD as a deep intermediate hole. We topped old rig is to move up the well and well is secured or waiting to be great to run the intermediate casing. The rest of the drill will be completed in the Blue County rig is finished with the well and that rig is moved to West Virginia later this year.
We are making good progress on cost reductions for these wells, specifically at the current depth of the well, where we spent approximately 22% less than we did on these well at the same point. 
As I previously noted, we expect it to take several wells for us to achieve our cost target for these wells of between $12.5 million and $14 million. We are pleased with our progress so far and remain confident that we will achieve our targeted cost. We will continue to well data from the well in our analyst presentation periodically and we'll update you on the progress of the latest 2 wells [indiscernible]

We met with our board last week to discuss our long-term strategy as we do every Oc",963,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, the topic of my prepared remarks, as Steve mentioned, is our preliminary thinking regarding EQT's 2016 capital budget. We met with our board last week to discuss our long-term strategy as we do every October. We then meets in early December to approve the upcoming year's operating plan and capital budget. 
A key aspect of the discussion in the last week's meeting was the impact of the emerging deep Utica play on EQT's strategy. There have been fewer than 10 wells drilled and completed in the Deep Utica around our so it is still too early to be confident that the play would be economic, but the early results are certainly encouraging.
Specifically, if the Utica does work, which for us means that the returns are better than returns from the core Marcellus, we will certainly add significant resource potential to our inventory.  However, the current price in natural gas will likely be lower in that scenario and at the Utica is less economic. As a result, some of our other inventory to acquire high prices to make economic returns would be deferred possibly for many years. So while those of us, certainly including EQT, who has significant positions in the core of the Deep Utica would be the winners, if you will. The cannibalization of other opportunities will affect everyone, including those of us who will net-net be much better off if the Deep Utica play does work economically. Given this potential for lower long-term gas prices, we do not think it prudent to invest much money in wells since all-in after tax returns exceed our investment hurdle rates by only a relatively small amount. As a result, we are suspending drilling in those areas such as Central Pennsylvania and our Upper Devonian play that are outside the core.
This decision will affect our 2016 capital plan, though we are just starting to develop the specifics of the 2016 drilling program that forms the core of the plan. The focus in 2016 will be on this more narrowly drawn notion of what the core Marcellus would be assuming the deep Utica play works.
We will also pursue the Deep Utica play with the goal of determining economics, size of resource and midstream needs and are lowering the cost per well to our target range. Our initial thoughts are a 10 to 15 well Deep Utica program in 2016 with flexibility to shift capital between Marcellus and Utica as warranted based on our progress. 
Our pulmonary estimate for production volume growth in 2016 versus 2015 is 15% to 20%, which we will refine when we announce our formal development plan in early December. If we turn in line our fourth quarter wells in late December, as contemplated in our fourth quarter guidance, 2016 growth would likely be near the upper end of that range as those wells will contribute little, if anything, to volumes until early 2016.
Obviously, this overall approach will result in a 2016 capital budget, absent any acquisitions, that is a fair bit lower than 2015 and would result in continuing [indiscernible] of cash on hand as of in 2016, but we will provide specifics in December.
Another strategic implication of an economic Deep Utica play is a significant opportunity for EQM. A year ago, it would be hard to imagine -- would've been hard to imagine a more prolific play than the Marcellus. EQM has already announced a $3 billion backlog of midstream projects to serve the Marcellus play. [indiscernible] our current backlog continues to make sense if the Deep Utica proves economic as it either supports core Marcellus or take away projects that are needed regardless of the source raw for the natural gas.
However, if the Deep Utica works, it is likely to be larger than the Marcellus over time. The magnitude of incremental take away and gathering pipeline such a play with support is significant, even net of the previously mentioned reduction to Marcellus development that would occur in the scenario.
As we think about the EQT corporate structure, we are not likely to make any major decisions to change the current integrated model until we do understand the scope of the potential Deep Utica development program. We have reached much value in recent years from having the 2 businesses together and there is the potential that both companies would continue to benefit from these synergies into the dawn of the Utica era.
Finally, the Deep Utica potential has also affected our thoughts around acreage acquisitions. Given our view that our existing acreage sits on what is expected to be the core of the core in Deep Utica, we are focusing our interest -- our area of interest even more tightly on acreage that is in our core Marcellus and potentially core Deep Utica area.
As you can probably deduce from the lack of significant transaction announcements, the spread continues to be wide. We are a patient company and believe that there will be acreage available at fair prices eventually, but the definition of fair has to contemplate the potential that the Deep Utica works.
We do not think that bodes well for the price of acreage concentrating in anything but the core Marcellus and core Utica. This narrowly focus also suggests that smaller asset deals are much more likely than larger corporate deals. However, as we've stated previously, we are comfortable maintaining our industry-leading balance sheet even as we look for opportunities to create value.
In conclusion, EQT is committed to increasing the value of your shares and we look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Pat Kane."

or the cost per foot? I think our view is when we sit down and do a bottoms up analysis of what we think it should cost to drill these wells once you work through all of the problems and give the nonproductive time down to a minimum, that's where we come up with that $12.5 million. So I think, at current service costs, never say never. But we don't see a path to being significantly less than that for these wells.

The call will also be replayed for 7 days on our website. To remind you, the results of the EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM, and EQ GP Holdings, ticker EQGP, are consolidated in EQT's results. Earlier this morning, there were a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnership's conference call is at 11:30 a.m. today, which requires that we take the last question at 11:20. The dial-in number for that call is (913) 312-9034. The confirmation code is 2157781.
In just a moment, Phil will summarize EQT's results. Next, Steve will have a brief Utica update. Finally, Dave will provide preliminary thoughts on EQT's 2016 capital budget. Following their prepared remarks, Dave, Phil, Randy and Steve will be available to answer your questions.
I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and under risk factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the SEC and available on our website. Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such financial measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure. 
Before turning the call over to Phil, I will walk you through one of the non-GAAP reconciliations that caused some confusion last quarter, specifically production adjusted net operating revenue presented on Page 7 of today's release. This number is used as the basis for calculating our average realized sales price as presented on the price reconciliation included in this morning's release. The average realized price is calculated by dividing the adjusted net operating revenue by total sales volumes. There is a non-GAAP reconciliation in the release that I will briefly explain. We are making 2 adjustments to EQT Production total operating revenues as reported on the segment page in order to provide you with operating revenues, excluding the noncash impact of derivatives and the net of transportation and processing costs. 
With respect to derivatives, adjustments for noncash derivative activity have been the subject of SEC comments over the past couple of years. As a result, in accordance with what appears to be the SEC preference in this area, we adjust out the noncash activity in 3 steps. First, we back out all gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges that were included in revenues during the period, which is the mark-to-market impact, which was 150 -- $160.5 million this quarter. Two, we add back the actual cash received, $33.2 million, and deduct the premiums paid for derivatives that settled during the quarter, which was $1 million, which leaves us with just the actual cash received net of any premiums made in our adjusted revenue number. The final adjustment on our non-GAAP reconciliation simply reduces the total operating revenues by $64.7 million of cost reported as expense on EQT Production segment page for transportation and processing. This provides a realized price net of transportation and processing costs, which is consistent with our historic presentation.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil Conti."
269924,306253902,879908,"EQT Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,"Earnings Calls","EQT Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced the third quarter 2015 adjusted loss of $0.33 per diluted share, which represents an $0.83 per share decrease from adjusted EPS in the third quarter of '",673,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced the third quarter 2015 adjusted loss of $0.33 per diluted share, which represents an $0.83 per share decrease from adjusted EPS in the third quarter of '14. Adjusted operating cash flow was $156.3 million in the quarter or 46% lower than the third quarter of 2014. 
Results for the quarter were negatively impacted by lower commodity prices. Due to lower strip prices since last quarter, we also recorded a significant noncash gain on hedges of future production of $128.3 million during the quarter. And that was some of the stuff that Pat just talked about. And that's excluded from the adjusted earnings and cash flow.
I'd like to briefly take a look at our continuing and recently at EQGP. On October 20, 2015, EQGP announced a cash distribution to its unitholders of $0.104 per unit for the third quarter of '15 or a 13% increase over the equivalent full quarter distribution in the second quarter. The third quarter distribution decision represents $24.9 million in payments, which EQT will receive on November 23. These quarterly payments will continue to grow as distributions at EQGP grow and they highlight the value of EQGP to EQT.  
The operational results were fairly straightforward in the third quarter, so I'll move right into the segment results, and I will be brief. First, EQT Production continued to grow production sales volumes by 27% compared to the third quarter of 2014. However, revenues from that growth were more than offset by the lower commodity prices negatively impacting results in the third quarter. The average realized price at EQT Production was $1.21 per Mcf equivalent, a 55% decrease from $2.69 per Mcf equivalent last year, which led to adjusted operating revenues for the quarter of $188.5 million or $142.5 million lower than last year's third quarter.
There were many factors that led to the lower price, but lower NYMEX and liquids prices versus last year were the primary drivers. You will find the detailed components of the price differences in the tables in this morning's release. The adjusted operating loss at EQT Production was $72 million excluding the noncash gain on hedges of $128.3 million that I just mentioned. That compares to adjusted operating income of $107.9 million in the third quarter of '14. And that was also excluding a noncash gain on hedges.
Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $325.2 million or $53.5 million higher compared to the third quarter 2014. DD&A was $30.2 million higher. Transportation and processing expense was about $16 million higher. Exploration expense was $4.6 million higher. And LOE, excluding production taxes, was about $1.6 million higher, all consistent with the volume growth. Production tax decreased by $3 million due to lower commodity prices in the period. SG&A expense, excluding $3.5 million in rig release penalties, was about $0.5 million higher. 
Midstream results. Here, the operating income was up 21%. The increase is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased fixed capacity-based transmission charges. Gathering revenues increased 23% to $125.9 million in the third quarter of '15 primarily due to a 24% increase in gathered volumes. Transmission revenues for the third quarter 2015 increased by $6.9 million or 12%, driven by additional firm-contracted capacity added over the past year. Operating expenses at midstream for the third quarter of $82.2 million were about $9.4 million higher than last year, consistent with the growth in the midstream business. 
And just to conclude with a brief note on liquidity. EQT did have $1.7 million of cash on hand at quarter-end, not including cash at EQM and EQGP as well as full availability under EQT's $1.5 billion credit facility. So we remain in a strong liquidity position to accomplish our goals for the foreseeable future. Our current estimate of 2015 EQT operating cash flow is $900 million, adjusted to exclude the noncontrolling interest portion of EQM and EQGP's cash flow. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve."

Today, I'll provide you an update on our deep Utica well program. As discussed on the last call, we completed our first deep Utica well in July, the Scotts Run 591340. To remind you, the well's initial 24-hour flow was 72.9 million cubic",610,"Thank you, Phil. Today, I'll provide you an update on our deep Utica well program. As discussed on the last call, we completed our first deep Utica well in July, the Scotts Run 591340. To remind you, the well's initial 24-hour flow was 72.9 million cubic feet with an average flowing casing pressure of 8,641 psi. We've been flowing this well directly into the sales pipeline at a choke-restricted rate of about 30 million cubic feet per day. Except for the 7 days required to install the wellhead equipment, the oily sales have been steady at this rate. Casing pressure has been declining at an average of 40 psi per day. As of yesterday, sales volumes were 30.4 million cubic feet per day and the casing pressure was 6,320 psi.
Cumulative production from this well has totaled at 2.6 Bcf in the first 86 days of production. Our expectation is that the daily production rate will not decline until the well pressure declines through the pipeline pressure, which is 500 psi. Based on an extrapolation of the current pressure decline rate, we estimate that we'll reach line pressure after approximately 8 months of production, which will be in late March 2016. The cumulative production at that time would be approximately 7.4 Bcf. At that point, we have a wide range of possible decline curves as we do not have any analogous decline data to rely on. 
Our current reservoir modeling suggests an ultimate expected recovery for this well in a range between 13.9 Bcf and 18.8 Bcf or a range of 4.3 to 5.9 Bcf per thousand foot of lateral. Using the lowest EUR of our range and assuming the high end of our cost per well target of between $12.5 million and $14 million per well, we estimate returns at a $2 wellhead gas price to be north of 20% for a 5,400-foot lateral well.
Since the last call, we have spud 2 additional Utica wells. In August, we spud a second Greene County well, the Pettit #593066, which is located approximately 5 miles northeast of the Scotts Run well. We're currently at the depth of 12,200 feet and have installed the intermediate casing. We're just beginning to draw the curve on this well and expect this well to be in line before the end of the year.
The third well is spud in September in Wetzel County, West Virginia, the BIG-190 well, and is located approximately 30 miles southwest of the Scotts Run well. We reached TD as a deep intermediate hole. The top hole rig has been move off the well and the well is secured, awaiting the BIG rig to run the intermediate casing. The rest of the drilling will be completed when the Greene County rig is finished with the Pettit well and that rig is moved to West Virginia later this year.
We are making good progress on cost reductions for these wells. Specifically at the current depth of the Pettit well, we spent approximately 22% less than we did on the Scotts Run well at the same point. As I previously noted, we expect it to take several wells for us to achieve our cost target for these wells of between $12.5 million and $14 million. We are pleased with our progress so far and remain confident that we will achieve our targeted costs. We will continue to post well data from the Scotts Run well on our analyst presentation periodically, and we'll update you on the progress of the latest 2 wells as warranted.
I'll now turn the call over to David Porges for his initial thoughts on next year's capital budget."

Today, the topic of my prepared remarks, as Steve mentioned, is our preliminary thinking regarding EQT's 2016 capital budget. We met with our board last week to discuss our long-term strategy as we do every Oc",969,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, the topic of my prepared remarks, as Steve mentioned, is our preliminary thinking regarding EQT's 2016 capital budget. We met with our board last week to discuss our long-term strategy as we do every October. Our board then meets in early December to approve the upcoming year's operating plan and capital budget. 
A key aspect of the discussion in last week's meeting was the impact of the emerging deep Utica play on EQT's strategy. There have been fewer than 10 wells drilled and completed in the deep Utica around our acreage, so it is still too early to be confident that the play will be economic. But the early results are certainly encouraging. Specifically, if the Utica does work, which for us means that the returns are better than returns from the core Marcellus, we will certainly add significant resource potential to our inventory. However, the clearing price for natural gas will likely be lower in that scenario than if the Utica is less economic. 
As a result, some of our other inventory that requires high prices to make economic returns would be deferred possibly for many years. So while those of us, certainly including EQT, who have significant positions in the core of the deep Utica will be the winners, if you will, the cannibalization of other opportunities will affect everyone, including those of us who will net-net be much better off if the deep Utica play does work economically. 
Given this potential for lower long-term gas prices, we do not think it prudent to invest much money in wells whose all-in after-tax returns exceed our investment hurdle rates by only a relatively small amount. As a result, we are suspending drilling in those areas, such as Central Pennsylvania and our Upper Devonian play, that are outside that core. This decision will affect our 2016 capital plan, though we are just starting to develop the specifics of the 2016 drilling program that forms the core of that plan. The focus in 2016 will be on this more narrowly drawn notion of what the core Marcellus would be, assuming the deep Utica play works.
We will also pursue the deep Utica play with the goal of determining economics, size of resource and midstream needs and on lowering the cost per well to our target range. Our initial thoughts are a 10- to 15-well deep Utica program in 2016 with flexibility to shift capital between Marcellus and Utica as warranted based on our progress. 
Our preliminary estimate for production volume growth in 2016 versus 2015 is 15% to 20%, which we will refine when we announce our formal development plan on early December. If we turn in line our fourth quarter wells in late December, as contemplated in our fourth quarter guidance, 2016 growth would likely be near the upper end of that range as those wells would contribute little, if anything, to volumes until early 2016. Obviously, this overall approach will result in a 2016 capital budget, absent any acquisitions, that is a fair bit lower than 2015 and would result in continuing to have [indiscernible] of cash on hand as of end 2016. But we will provide specifics in December.
Another strategic implication of an economic deep Utica play is the significant opportunity for EQM. A year ago, it would be hard to imagine -- would've been hard to imagine a more prolific play than the Marcellus. And EQM has already announced a $3 billion backlog of midstream projects to serve the Marcellus play. Incidentally, that entire current backlog continues to make sense if the deep Utica proves economic as it either supports core Marcellus or take away projects that are needed regardless of the source rock for the natural gas.
However, if the deep Utica works, it is likely to be larger than the Marcellus over time. The magnitude of incremental takeaway in gathering pipeline such a play would support is significant, even net of the previously mentioned reduction to the Marcellus development that would occur in this scenario. As we think about the EQT corporate structure, we are not likely to make any major decisions to change the current integrated model until we do understand the scope of a potential deep Utica development program. We have reaped much value in recent years from having the 2 businesses together, and there is the potential that both companies would continue to benefit from these synergies into the dawn of the Utica era.
Finally, the deep Utica potential has also affected our thoughts around acreage acquisitions. Given our view that our existing acreage sits on what is expected to be the core of the core in deep Utica, we are focusing our interest -- our area of interest even more tightly on acreage that is in our core Marcellus and potentially core deep Utica area. As you can probably deduce from the lack of significant transaction announcements, the bid-ask spread continues to be wide. We are a patient company and believe that there will be acreage available at fair prices eventually. But the definition of fair has to contemplate the potential that the deep Utica works.
We do not think that bodes well for the price of acreage concentrated in anything but the core Marcellus and core Utica. This narrowing focus also suggests that smaller asset deals are much more likely than larger corporate deals. However, as we have stated previously, we are comfortable maintaining our industry-leading balance sheet even as we look for opportunities to create value.
In conclusion, EQT is committed to increasing the value of your shares. And we look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support. With that, I will turn the call back over to Pat Kane."

And the second part of your question, remind me again? About the cost per foot? I think our view is that when we sit down and do a bottoms-up analysis of what we think it should cost to drill these wells once you work through all of the problems and get the nonproductive time down to a minimum, that's where we come up with that $12.5 million. So I think at current service costs, never say never. But we don't see a path to being significantly less than that for these wells. And I think the $14 million gives us some room to have a few unexpected problems that maybe we wouldn't normally have on Marcellus wells, which is why we're quoting a range right now.

I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release under risk factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the SEC and available on our website. Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such financial measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure. 
Before turning the call over to Phil, I will walk you through one of the non-GAAP reconciliations that caused some confusion last quarter, specifically production adjusted net operating revenue presented on Page 7 of today's release. This number is used as the basis for calculating our average realized sales price as presented on the price reconciliation included in this morning's release. The average realized price is calculated by dividing the adjusted net operating revenue by total sales volumes. There was a non-GAAP reconciliation in the release that I will briefly explain. We are making 2 adjustments to EQT Production total operating revenues as reported on the segment page in order to provide you with operating revenues, excluding the noncash impact of derivatives and the net of transportation and processing costs. 
With respect to derivatives, adjustments for noncash derivative activity have been the subject of SEC comments over the past couple of years. As a result, in accordance with what appears to be the SEC preference in this area, we adjust out the noncash activity in 3 steps. First, we back up all gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges that were included in revenues during the period, which is the mark-to-market impact, which was 150 -- $160.5 million this quarter. Two, we add back the actual cash received, $33.2 million, and deduct the premiums paid for derivatives that settled during the quarter, which was $1 million, which leaves us with just the actual cash received net of any premiums made in our adjusted revenue number. The final adjustment on our non-GAAP reconciliation simply reduces the total operating revenues by $64.7 million of cost reported as expense on EQT Production segment page for transportation and processing. This provides a realized price net of transportation and processing costs, which is consistent with our historic presentation.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil Conti."
269924,306253902,880078,"EQT Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,"Earnings Calls","EQT Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced the third quarter 2015 adjusted loss of $0.33 per diluted share, which represents an $0.83 per share decrease from adjusted EPS in the third quarter of '",673,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced the third quarter 2015 adjusted loss of $0.33 per diluted share, which represents an $0.83 per share decrease from adjusted EPS in the third quarter of '14. Adjusted operating cash flow was $156.3 million in the quarter or 46% lower than the third quarter of 2014. 
Results for the quarter were negatively impacted by lower commodity prices. Due to lower strip prices since last quarter, we also recorded a significant noncash gain on hedges of future production of $128.3 million during the quarter. And that was some of the stuff that Pat just talked about. And that's excluded from the adjusted earnings and cash flow.
I'd like to briefly take a look at our continuing and recently IPO-ed EQGP. On October 20, 2015, EQGP announced a cash distribution to its unitholders of $0.104 per unit for the third quarter of '15 or a 13% increase over the equivalent full quarter distribution in the second quarter. The third quarter distribution decision represents $24.9 million in payments, which EQT will receive on November 23. These quarterly payments will continue to grow as distributions at EQGP grow and they highlight the value of EQGP to EQT.  
The operational results were fairly straightforward in the third quarter, so I'll move right into the segment results, and I will be brief. First, EQT Production continued to grow production sales volumes by 27% compared to the third quarter of 2014. However, revenues from that growth were more than offset by the lower commodity prices negatively impacting results in the third quarter. The average realized price at EQT Production was $1.21 per Mcf equivalent, a 55% decrease from $2.69 per Mcf equivalent last year, which led to adjusted operating revenues for the quarter of $188.5 million or $142.5 million lower than last year's third quarter.
There were many factors that led to the lower price, but lower NYMEX and liquids prices versus last year were the primary drivers. You will find the detailed components of the price differences in the tables in this morning's release. The adjusted operating loss at EQT Production was $72 million excluding the noncash gain on hedges of $128.3 million that I just mentioned. That compares to adjusted operating income of $107.9 million in the third quarter of '14. And that was also excluding a noncash gain on hedges.
Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $325.2 million or $53.5 million higher compared to the third quarter 2014. DD&A was $30.2 million higher. Transportation and processing expense was about $16 million higher. Exploration expense was $4.6 million higher. And LOE, excluding production taxes, was about $1.6 million higher, all consistent with the volume growth. Production tax decreased by $3 million due to lower commodity prices in the period. SG&A expense, excluding $3.5 million in rig release penalties, was about $0.5 million higher. 
Midstream results. Here, the operating income was up 21%. The increase is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased fixed capacity-based transmission charges. Gathering revenues increased 23% to $125.9 million in the third quarter of '15 primarily due to a 24% increase in gathered volumes. Transmission revenues for the third quarter 2015 increased by $6.9 million or 12%, driven by additional firm-contracted capacity added over the past year. Operating expenses at midstream for the third quarter of $82.2 million were about $9.4 million higher than last year, consistent with the growth in the midstream business. 
And just to conclude with a brief note on liquidity. EQT did have $1.7 billion of cash on hand at quarter-end, not including cash at EQM and EQGP as well as full availability under EQT's $1.5 billion credit facility. So we remain in a strong liquidity position to accomplish our goals for the foreseeable future. Our current estimate of 2015 EQT operating cash flow is $900 million, adjusted to exclude the noncontrolling interest portion of EQM and EQGP's cash flow. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve."

Today, I'll provide you an update on our deep Utica well program. As discussed on the last call, we completed our first deep Utica well in July, the Scotts Run 591340. To remind you, the well's initial 24-hour flow was 72.9 million cubic",608,"Thank you, Phil. Today, I'll provide you an update on our deep Utica well program. As discussed on the last call, we completed our first deep Utica well in July, the Scotts Run 591340. To remind you, the well's initial 24-hour flow was 72.9 million cubic feet with an average flowing casing pressure of 8,641 psi. We've been flowing this well directly into the sales pipeline at a choke-restricted rate of about 30 million cubic feet per day. Except for the 7 days required to install the wellhead equipment, daily sales have been steady at this rate. Casing pressure has been declining at an average of 40 psi per day. As of yesterday, sales volumes were 30.4 million cubic feet per day and the casing pressure was 6,320 psi.
Cumulative production from this well has totaled 2.6 Bcf in the first 86 days of production. Our expectation is that the daily production rate will not decline until the well pressure declines to the pipeline pressure, which is 500 psi. Based on an extrapolation of the current pressure decline rate, we estimate that we'll reach line pressure after approximately 8 months of production, which will be in late March 2016. The cumulative production at that time would be approximately 7.4 Bcf. At that point, we have a wide range of possible decline curves as we do not have any analogous decline data to rely on. 
Our current reservoir modeling suggests an ultimate expected recovery for this well in a range between 13.9 Bcf and 18.8 Bcf or a range of 4.3 to 5.9 Bcf per thousand foot of lateral. Using the lowest EUR of our range and assuming the high end of our cost per well target of between $12.5 million and $14 million per well, we estimate returns at a $2 wellhead gas price to be north of 20% for a 5,400-foot lateral well.
Since the last call, we have spud 2 additional Utica wells. In August, we spud a second Greene County well, the Pettit #593066, which is located approximately 5 miles northeast of the Scotts Run well. We're currently at the depth of 12,200 feet and have installed the intermediate casing. We're just beginning to draw the curve on this well and expect this well to be in line before the end of the year.
The third well was spud in September in Wetzel County, West Virginia, the BIG-190 well, and is located approximately 30 miles southwest of the Scotts Run well. We reached TD as a deep intermediate hole. The top hole rig has been moved off the well and the well is secured, awaiting the BIG rig to run the intermediate casing. The rest of the drilling will be completed when the Greene County rig is finished with the Pettit well and that rig is moved to West Virginia later this year.
We are making good progress on cost reductions for these wells. Specifically at the current depth of the Pettit well, we spent approximately 22% less than we did on the Scotts Run well at the same point. As I previously noted, we expect it to take several wells for us to achieve our cost target for these wells of between $12.5 million and $14 million. We are pleased with our progress so far and remain confident that we will achieve our targeted costs. We will continue to post well data from the Scotts Run well on our analyst presentation periodically, and we'll update you on the progress of the latest 2 wells as warranted.
I'll now turn the call over to David Porges for his initial thoughts on next year's capital budget."

Today, the topic of my prepared remarks, as Steve mentioned, is our preliminary thinking regarding EQT's 2016 capital budget. We met with our board last week to discuss our long-term strategy as we do every Oc",967,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, the topic of my prepared remarks, as Steve mentioned, is our preliminary thinking regarding EQT's 2016 capital budget. We met with our board last week to discuss our long-term strategy as we do every October. Our board then meets in early December to approve the upcoming year's operating plan and capital budget. 
A key aspect of the discussion in last week's meeting was the impact of the emerging deep Utica play on EQT's strategy. There have been fewer than 10 wells drilled and completed in the deep Utica around our acreage, so it is still too early to be confident that the play will be economic. But the early results are certainly encouraging. Specifically, if the Utica does work, which for us means that the returns are better than returns from the core Marcellus, we will certainly add significant resource potential to our inventory. However, the clearing price for natural gas would likely be lower in that scenario than if the Utica is less economic. 
As a result, some of our other inventory that requires higher prices to make economic returns would be deferred possibly for many years. So while those of us, certainly including EQT, who have significant positions in the core of the deep Utica will be the winners, if you will, the cannibalization of other opportunities will affect everyone, including those of us who will net-net be much better off if the deep Utica play does work economically. 
Given this potential for lower long-term gas prices, we do not think it prudent to invest much money in wells whose all-in after-tax returns exceed our investment hurdle rates by only a relatively small amount. As a result, we are suspending drilling in those areas, such as Central Pennsylvania and our Upper Devonian play, that are outside that core. This decision will affect our 2016 capital plan, though we are just starting to develop the specifics of the 2016 drilling program that forms the core of that plan. The focus in 2016 will be on this more narrowly drawn notion of what the core Marcellus would be, assuming the deep Utica play works.
We will also pursue the deep Utica play with the goal of determining economics, size of resource and midstream needs and on lowering the cost per well to our target range. Our initial thoughts are a 10- to 15-well deep Utica program in 2016 with flexibility to shift capital between Marcellus and Utica as warranted based on our progress. 
Our preliminary estimate for production volume growth in 2016 versus 2015 is 15% to 20%, which we will refine when we announce our formal development plan in early December. If we turn in line our fourth quarter wells in late December, as contemplated in our fourth quarter guidance, 2016 growth would likely be near the upper end of that range as those wells would contribute little, if anything, to volumes until early 2016. Obviously, this overall approach will result in a 2016 capital budget, absent any acquisitions, that is a fair bit lower than 2015 and would result in continuing to have [indiscernible] of cash on hand as of end 2016. But we will provide specifics in December.
Another strategic implication of an economic deep Utica play is the significant opportunity for EQM. A year ago, it would be hard to imagine -- would've been hard to imagine a more prolific play than the Marcellus. And EQM has already announced a $3 billion backlog of midstream projects to serve the Marcellus play. Incidentally, that entire current backlog continues to make sense if the deep Utica proves economic as it either supports core Marcellus or take away projects that are needed regardless of the source rock for the natural gas.
However, if the deep Utica works, it is likely to be larger than the Marcellus over time. The magnitude of incremental takeaway in gathering pipeline such a play would support is significant, even net of the previously mentioned reduction to Marcellus development that would occur in this scenario. As we think about the EQT corporate structure, we are not likely to make any major decisions to change the current integrated model until we do understand the scope of a potential deep Utica development program. We have reaped much value in recent years from having the 2 businesses together, and there is the potential that both companies would continue to benefit from these synergies into the dawn of the Utica era.
Finally, the deep Utica potential has also affected our thoughts around acreage acquisitions. Given our view that our existing acreage sits on what is expected to be the core of the core in deep Utica, we are focusing our interest -- our area of interest even more tightly on acreage that is in our core Marcellus and potentially core deep Utica area. As you can probably deduce from the lack of significant transaction announcements, the bid-ask spread continues to be wide. We are a patient company and believe that there will be acreage available at fair prices eventually. But the definition of fair has to contemplate the potential that the deep Utica works.
We do not think that bodes well for the price of acreage concentrated in anything but the core Marcellus and core Utica. This narrowing focus also suggests that smaller asset deals are much more likely than larger corporate deals. However, as we have stated previously, we are comfortable maintaining our industry-leading balance sheet even as we look for opportunities to create value.
In conclusion, EQT is committed to increasing the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support. With that, I will turn the call back over to Pat Kane."

And the second part of your question, remind me again? About the cost per foot? I think our view is that when we sit down and do a bottoms-up analysis of what we think it should cost to drill these wells once you work through all of the problems and get the nonproductive time down to a minimum, that's where we come up with that $12.5 million. So I think in current service costs, never say never. But we don't see a path to being significantly less than that for these wells. And I think the $14 million gives us some room to have a few unexpected problems that maybe we wouldn't normally have on Marcellus wells, which is why we're quoting a range right now. But our hope is to get at the bottom end of that range, but very confident we'll get within the top end."

We want to protect that IDR. And the way to do that is to have the most attractive midstream projects possible so that they can afford to pay the incremental cash flow to the GP, which is kind of the core value of that IDR where we stand now. So that's going to be the mantra. Strategically, it's going to be midstream expenditure should occur at EQM. Now if you're trying to get at what's more valuable generally midstream or upstream, I guess that's a bigger-picture question than just one company. And we'll see. We're trying to position ourselves so that we can be agnostic, so that we can take advantage of wherever the value is in the value chain. I agree that with the prospects of the Utica and issues like that, it's not clear what the value chain will look like several years down the road. But we think that the reason EQT is such an attractive investment is because EQT will participate no matter where the most value shows up in that value chain."

All-in after-tax returns is the way we tend to look at things. But that overlay that I mentioned in my prepared remarks was we just think we need to bear in mind what if the deep Utica works and what does that mean for clearing prices, et cetera, and therefore, we should be particularly cautious about investing in anything but the core Marcellus, which does stand up still in those environments and in the core Utica. So it's more of that. There's always uncertainty about what prices are going to be. But whenever you have a new low-cost supply source in any commodity business, you've got to start being warier of where one wants to invest one's money. So I think there's a certain amount of caution that we're taking -- that we're talking about because of that unknown, because of not knowing yet the extent to which the deep Utica will work. But our feeling that if it works the way it's looking like it might, that the core areas for Marcellus and Utica are simply going to be narrower. I mean, we're going to be able to supply a big portion of North America's natural gas needs from a relatively small geography."

I mean, the norm in commodities -- and I understand there does tend to be in the investor community a short-term focus, I recognize that. People need to make money each quarter. But actually, lower prices near term tend to lead to more robust recoveries later. So our view is much more the low-cost opportunities are going to be the ones that win out, and you want to make sure that you're, -- especially if you think prices are going to be stressed at all, that you're focusing on only going after the lowest-cost opportunities and not letting yourself kind of get drawn into investing in opportunities that are other than that. So I'd say that's our focus anyway. And look, in a lower price environment, of course, we're talking about the deep Utica perhaps helping to create. That obviously becomes even more important."
