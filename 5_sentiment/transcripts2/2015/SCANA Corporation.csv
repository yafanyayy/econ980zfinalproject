I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Basic earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $0.73 per share, consistent with the same period of the prior year. Overall, electric margins increased",2344,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Basic earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $0.73 per share, consistent with the same period of the prior year. Overall, electric margins increased during the fourth quarter of 2014 versus the same quarter of the prior year due primarily to continued recovery of financing costs through the Base Load Review Act, or BLRA, and customer growth.
As a reminder, the electric weather normalization pilot ended in December 2013, and the company's financial results for 2014 and going forward are now impacted by abnormal weather in our electric business.
Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we estimate that weather had a negative impact of $0.02 on electric margins versus the fourth quarter of the prior year. Additionally, higher gas margins and a slight decrease in the company's effective tax rate also contributed in the quarter. These increases were offset by expected increases in operations and maintenance expenses and CapEx-related items, including depreciation, interest expense as well as share dilution.
Please turn to Slide 4. Basic earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $3.79 per share versus $3.40 per share in 2013. Increases in electric and gas margins as well as the decreases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by operations and maintenance expenses and higher expenses and dilution related to our capital program. For the full year of 2014, we estimate weather added $0.21 per share to electric margins versus the prior year.
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric and Gas Company's full year earnings denoted in blue were up $0.41 per share for 2014 compared to the prior year. This was driven largely by increases in electric margins, which were due primarily to abnormal weather, plus the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA and customer growth.
Higher gas margins also contributed to the earnings improvement. These increases were partially offset by increases in O&M expenses, expenses related to our capital program, including property taxes, interest expense and depreciation, as well as share dilution. For the fourth quarter, basic earnings per share were $0.02 higher than in the same period last year.
PSNC Energy's earnings shown in red were $0.39 per share for the full year of 2014 compared to $0.37 per share in the prior year. This increase is mainly attributable to customer growth. For the fourth quarter of 2014, basic earnings were $0.16 per share, consistent with 2013.
SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, in green, showed an increase in earnings per share of $0.01 over last year. This is mainly due to increased margins from higher throughput during the first and fourth quarters of 2014. As a reminder, the increased margins in the first quarter were partially offset by higher commodity prices experienced in serving the incremental volumes and price competition. For the fourth quarter of 2014, basic earnings per share were also up $0.01 over the same period of 2013.
SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported  a loss of $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to near breakeven results in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the 12-month period, these businesses reported a loss of $0.01 per share in 2014 compared to earnings of $0.04 per share in 2013. This change is primarily the result of higher interest expense at the holding company due to the accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs associated with hybrid securities that were called at par in early 2015 prior to their maturity.
On Slide 6, we have provided 2 years of historical financial data on the 2 subsidiary sales we recently announced to assist in updating your models. The CGT transaction closed on January 31 and the SCI transaction is scheduled to close shortly. To recap, these transactions will generate approximately $650 million of gross proceeds. Our updated estimate of the net cash available to fund our expansion will exceed $425 million after taxes. I will discuss the planned changes to our financing plan shortly.
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory. As you can see on Slide 7, during 2014, company's announced plans to invest over $1 billion with the expectation of creating over 7,500 jobs in our Carolinas territories. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G  electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 6.5%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 5.6%.
At the top of Slide 8, you can see the South Carolina unemployment statistics as of December 2014 and 2013. Although the South Carolina unemployment rate only dropped 1/10th [ph] of a percentage point from the end of 2013, December of 2014 marked all-time highs for the numbers of South Carolinians employed and in the labor force. The nearly 50,000 additions to the workforce represent a 2.4% increase over December 2013 levels. In short, the expansion of the economy has clearly motivated many that had removed themselves from actively seeking work back into the workforce.
The December market numbers from the South Carolina Association of Realtors showed increases in new listing, pending sales and median sales prices while available housing inventories shrank. I also wanted to mention, as depicted at the bottom of the slide, that United Van Lines recently released its annual movers study for 2014, which tracks migration patterns state to state. Once again, South Carolina and North Carolina ranked second and third, respectively, in terms of domestic migration destinations, corroborating our realized customer growth statistics. These are all very positives signs for our territories.
Slide 9 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top of the slide are the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric business added customers at an annual rate of 1.4%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at 2.5% and 2.8%, respectively. Of particular note is the fact that all of these rates accelerated during the year.
The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were up 0.6% on a 12-month ended basis, driven mainly by strong industrial demand. We continue to see slightly lower weather-normalized consumption at the residential level, reflecting anticipated energy efficiencies.
Now please turn to Slide 10, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $8.9 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business.
In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric businesses in which we are allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended December 31 in the base electric business is approximately 10%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We are very pleased with the execution of our strategy.
Continuing down the page. On our new nuclear business, we are allowed an 11% return on equity. As you may recall, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved our 2014 request for revised rates under the BLRA, which add an incremental of approximately $561 million to our rate base and increased rates by approximately 2.8% in November.
Our regulated gas businesses in Carolinas continued to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina, respectively. And we continue to operate these businesses within a reasonable range of those returns. As a reminder, in November, SCE&G's gas business implemented a $2.6 million revenue reduction as a result of the rate stabilization act.
Slide 11 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast has been updated to reflect our most current CapEx projections for 2015 and '16 and is now inclusive of our 2017 estimates. Note that this forecast excludes CGT and SCI, as the sale of CGT has been completed and the transaction for SCI is expected to close by the end of this quarter. Also, this forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2017, which is updated from what was filed in our quarterly BLRA report.
The data in the BLRA reports are limited to the last approved order by this Public Service Commission in South Carolina and are not always consistent with our new nuclear CapEx expectations. This forecast more actively aligns itself with our anticipated project spending over the next 3 years as it relates to the schedule delay.
At the bottom of the slide, we've recapped the new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are calculated.
Now please turn to Slide 12. To summarize our financings for 2014, on May 27, SCE&G issued $300 million of 50-year bonds at 4.5%. On the equity side, we issued approximately $100 million from our 401(k) matching and drip plans. Looking forward, we revised our estimated financing plan through 2019. While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it's unlikely that these issuances will occur exactly as presented as they are change in our funding needs for public expenses.
This plan contemplates both the estimated base and the timing of the disbursements related to the new nuclear project as well as deployment of the proceeds from the sale of the subsidiaries. As mentioned in our press release, the plan is to use the cash proceeds, net of taxes from the sales of subs, to displace equity issuances. However, until we can fully deploy the proceeds for that purpose, we're taking advantage of this infusion of cash.
Earlier this month, SCANA redeemed, in advance of maturity, at par its $150 million 2009 Series A 7.7% enhanced junior subordinated notes. In addition, we have delayed long-term debt issuances and are reducing our short-term borrowings. We also turned off the issuance of new shares to supply our 401k and DRIP plans earlier this year and anticipate delaying the need for any additional equity issuances until 2017. We don't currently project the need for any additional equity beyond the new shares provided by the use of 401(k) and the DRIP plan, which we will turn on an as needed.
Overall, we continue to adjust the financing to match the related CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. Obviously, the construction delay has slowed expenditures, but they were also significantly reduced by lower-than-anticipated escalation. The delay is a matter of timing, but the escalation on those components already received or completed will result in permanent savings. Any change in the amount or timing of the new nuclear cost would obviously result in a change in this plan.
I would now like to discuss our 2015 earnings guidance and related assumptions as shown on Slide 13. First, as you can see on the top left slide, we are resetting our base here for our long-term GAAP adjusted average annual growth guidance of 3% to 6% over the next 3 to 5 years off of 2014's GAAP adjusted weather-normalized EPS of $3.58 per share. Our 2015 operating plan, exclusive of the gains on the sale of the 2 subsidiaries, would have resulted in $3.74 per share. However, we project the 2015 earnings will be negatively impacted by $0.04 per share due to the short-term impact of these 2 sales.
While these transactions are expected to yield approximately $0.04 per share of accretion on the long-term basis, all of the proceeds can't be officially deployed in the short run to displace equity needs. As such, we believe there will be downward pressure on 2015's expected earnings, which is considered in our guidance. Therefore, our 2015 net internal target for GAAP adjusted earnings is $3.70 per share. Our GAAP adjusted earnings per share guidance is $3.60 to $3.80 per share.
Due to the cyclical nature of our business, we expect to earn approximately 30% of this amount in the first quarter, approximately 25% in each the third and fourth quarters, and the remaining 20% in the second quarter. In computing this guidance range, we have included the impact of a base rate increase from our new nuclear filing under the BLRA, the 2014 gas RSA filing and our view of the economy. This guidance also incorporates the CapEx and financing plans we presented earlier. We continue to assume customer average use of electricity will be slightly lower this year as energy efficiency trends continue to work their way into the market.
We anticipate overall weather-normalized retail electric sales growth for 2015 to decline by approximately 0.6%. We forecast electric customer growth to be similar to 2014.
Operation and maintenance expenses are expected to be relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014 actuals. Our effective tax rate for 2014 was slightly less than 32%. And we estimate the rate for 2015, exclusive of the taxes on the gains of the sales of the subsidiaries, will be approximately 31%. Hopefully this will provide you with a line of sight into our view of 2015 as you update your models.
Finally, I will mention that earlier today, we announced an increase in our annual dividend rate for 2015 of $0.08 to $2.18 per share, a 3.8% increase. The results of 2014 and confidence in the long-term strategy were key considerations. We continue to anticipate growing dividends, fairly consistent with earnings, while staying within our stated payout policy of 55% to 60%.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I want to begin by recapping the preliminary new nuclear construction schedule on cost information we received from the Consortium. As described last week at our quarterly update filing with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina,",1203,"Thanks, Jimmy. I want to begin by recapping the preliminary new nuclear construction schedule on cost information we received from the Consortium. As described last week at our quarterly update filing with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, the Consortium has indicated a substantial completion date for Unit 2 is expected to occur by June of 2019 and a substantial completion date for Unit 3 may be approximately 12 months later. We are continuing our discussions with the Consortium in order to identify potential strategies to possibly accelerate the substantial completion date of Unit 2 to a time earlier in the first half of 2019 or to the end of 2018 with the Unit 3 following approximately 12 months later.
As Jimmy previously mentioned, we are in the midst of process with the Consortium, and we cannot predict when the revised schedule and cost estimates will be resolved. Further, neither SCE&G nor Santee Cooper has accepted the new preliminary schedule or financial responsibility associated with these delays. We anticipate filing a petition requesting an adjustment to our current capital cost and construction schedules with the Public Service Commission before the end of this quarter.
Under the BLRA, the Public Service Commission would then have 6 months to issue its order.
I would now like to discuss some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. On Slide 14, you can see an aerial photo of the site from December. I have labeled both units 2 and 3 as well as many other areas that make up the construction tabletop. And as you can see, progress continues to take place on the project.
Slide 15 shows where some of the module fabrication has been moved from CB&I's Lake Charles facility to various other venues in the United states and Japan. Fabrication of the CA-03 submodules continues at the SMCI facility in Florida. Newport industries in Virginia is fabricating and continues to ship building to the site. works and Toshiba operation are the principal fabricators for Unit 3's CA20 and CA-01 submodules, respectively.
On Slide 16, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture, you can see modules CA20 along with the containment vessel Ring 1, which has been placed on the containment vessel lower bowl. The lower bowl is now covered by the auxiliary building walls as they are coming up to what we call elevation 100, which is about 35 feet above the base mat. Once elevation 100 has been reached, work will begin on the annex building, which will house the electrical switch gear for the plant.
Slide 17 shows the schematic of the module inside the containment vessel. And here, you can see the locations of modules CA-01, 02, 03 and 05, which we'll further discuss shortly.
Slide 18 has an exploded view of CA-01 through 05 showing where they fit in the containment vessel.
Slide 19 shows a recent picture of Unit 2 module CA-01. CA-01 houses the generator, pressure and forms of fuel canal inside the containment vessel. We currently have all 47 submodules on-site, and 34 of those submodules are upright and being assembled in the Module Assembly Building or MAB.
Slide 20 is a shipment from Yokohama, Japan, of the first Unit 3 CA-01 submodule fabricated by Toshiba, which should be on-site in early March.
Slide 21 shows pictures of the Unit 2 module CA-05. This module comprises one of the major wall sections within the containment vessel. On the top right, you can see module CA-05 inside of the tent where the final wells are prior to placement. On December 6, 2014, this model was lifted with the Heavy Lift Derrick as seen on the left-hand side of the slide, in place in the containment vessel as seen in the bottom right-hand of this slide.
On Slide 22, you can see an aerial picture with a good view of the containment vessel rings that are currently being fabricated for units 2 and 3. As you can see on the bottom, the Unit 2 containment vessel ring 1 has been placed on top of the lower and ring 2 is complete and will be set after placement of structural module CA-01. Across the top of the picture, you can see 3 other containment vessel rings that are in the process of being fabricated for units 2 and 3. it has a total of 3 brings such -- in addition, the steel for the Unit 2 containment vessel top closure head is also on site.
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island. Here, you can see where the containment vessel lower bowl has been placed, and the ancillary walls continue to take [indiscernible].
On Slide 24, you can see an aerial picture showing the full profile cleaning power. Cooling tower is [indiscernible] both structurally complete and you can see the progress continuing on 2 and 3 Bravo.
On Slide 25, you can see 1 of the 2 steam generators unit 2 that arrives in the construction site for January. The component was transported from the Port of Charleston by rail on a specifically designed car. This steam generally weighs 1.3 million pounds. It's about 20 feet in diameter, and it's almost 82 feet long.
Slide 26 shows building panels for Unit 2. the buildings around the containment vessel. These panels will be welded together and concrete will be poured inside the panels to create a shield. on the left, you can view of the panels up close and the right, you can see it made on the yard where we have begun receiving the panels. We currently have received 44 of the 167 Unit 2 panels that are provided by industries.
I wanted also to briefly mention the 8-inch explosive or belts, which are a key component of the state the system if you want come back designed a recently passed series of a engineering test to determine if they will properly operating under extreme conditions such as high-pressure temperature. This great news for the project is for testing the qualified for them for.
On Slide 27, you will see the new nuclear CapEx actual and projected over the life of construction. This chart also reflects our company's current actual and estimated new nuclear CapEx during the years 2008 to 2020, which previously discussed is updated from we filed in the latest chapter of report. As you can see, the next several years are the in the construction period.

In the press release, you talked about the interest savings on the nuclear project. Am I thinking about this correctly that you have roughly $1.2 billion in potential interest rate savings versus the original project costs? So if that stay on plan, and let's assume a worst-case scenario where there's $660 million construction dispute it goes against you -- the entire thing so that's a real worst-case basis. Does that mean you're still under the original project cost and you're going to wind up -- and the customers are not going to be impacted in anyway?"

And this is really the first we've emphasized those savings. So we really like to clarify some misunderstanding, some in the bench markets and some in the local area here where our folks really weren't understanding the escalation savings. So we're projecting, as you know, in the BLRA somewhere around $575 million of lower escalation today than when we originally started the project. And sometimes that had been confused with lower financing costs. The lower escalation is just lower escalation on the actual labor and modules, et cetera, associated with the construction, has nothing to do with the financing cost. So what we put in the press release is our estimate of the estimated savings over the tenure of the bonds that we have issued and those that we have locked in, the savings that would occur over the life of those. So they're really 2 different matters. As far as your real question about -- would the $660 million be offset by the $1.2 billion, [ph] I paid really be offset dollar by dollar by the escalations savings because those are more in today's dollars, the $1.2 billion [ph] are savings to occur over the future of the bonds some 30-plus years."

So to make sure I don't further confuse this, let me go back. So what we've been presenting in each BLRA would be the total projected cost each time we file the report each quarter for our 55% share. And we originally, of course, were approved for $6",324,"Yes. So to make sure I don't further confuse this, let me go back. So what we've been presenting in each BLRA would be the total projected cost each time we file the report each quarter for our 55% share. And we originally, of course, were approved for $6.3 billion in total future estimated costs. And our current projections are just over $0.5 billion less than that, about $575 million less. All of those reports to date have been focused on the lower escalation, if you will, the lower inflation during the construction period that the Consortium was entitled to bill us for based upon publicly available indices associated with the construction. What we put in our press release today has nothing to do with that. That is the financing costs once the Consortium bills us with whatever the escalation is, how do we go out and finance it on the debt side? So the equity side is fairly straightforward, 50% of it financed through equity the BLRA and 11% ROE. The 50% refinance with debt, were doing with first mortgage bonds. We had originally estimated in our BLRA filing based upon our embedded cost of debt at that time, a debt cost of about 6.4%, whereas overall we issued bonds at slightly under 5% live to date on the project. And all of those are fixed-rate bonds. And so what we've disclosed is we estimate that the savings on those over the life of the bonds will be $700 million, about $20 million a year. And then additional bonds that we expect to issue in the next 2 years that we've already hedged the rate on, we estimate to save another $525 million [ph] on those over the life of those bonds. So that's the $1,225,000,000 [ph] in interest savings that we expect to incur over the life of those savings. Completely independent of the escalation to lower inflation on the construction itself."

I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Basic earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $0.73 per share, consistent with the same period of the prior year. Overall, electric margins increased",2342,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Basic earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $0.73 per share, consistent with the same period of the prior year. Overall, electric margins increased during the fourth quarter of 2014 versus the same quarter of the prior year, due primarily to continued recovery of financing costs through the Base Load Review Act, or BLRA, and customer growth.
As a reminder, the electric weather normalization pilot ended in December 2013, and the company's financial results for 2014 and going forward are now impacted by abnormal weather in our electric business.
Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we estimate that weather had a negative impact of $0.02 on electric margins versus the fourth quarter of the prior year. Additionally, higher gas margins and a slight decrease in the company's effective tax rate also contributed in the quarter. These increases were offset by expected increases in operations and maintenance expenses and CapEx-related items, including depreciation, interest expense as well as share dilution.
Please turn to Slide 4. Basic earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $3.79 per share versus $3.40 per share in 2013. Increases in electric and gas margins, as well as the decreases in the effective tax rate, were partially offset by operations and maintenance expenses and higher expenses and dilution related to our capital program. For the full year of 2014, we estimate weather added $0.21 per share to electric margins versus the prior year.
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric and Gas Company's full year earnings, denoted in blue, were up $0.41 per share for 2014 compared to the prior year. This was driven largely by increases in electric margins, which were due primarily to abnormal weather, plus the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA and customer growth.
Higher gas margins also contributed to the earnings improvement. These increases were partially offset by increases in O&M expenses, expenses related to our capital program, including property taxes, interest expense and depreciation, as well as share dilution. For the fourth quarter, basic earnings per share were $0.02 higher than in the same period last year.
PSNC Energy's earnings, shown in red, were $0.39 per share for the full year of 2014 compared to $0.37 per share in the prior year. This increase is mainly attributable to customer growth. For the fourth quarter of 2014, basic earnings were $0.16 per share, consistent with 2013.
SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, in green, showed an increase in earnings per share of $0.01 over last year. This is mainly due to increased margins from higher throughput during the first and fourth quarters of 2014. As a reminder, the increased margins in the first quarter were partially offset by higher commodity prices experienced in serving the incremental volumes and price competition. For the fourth quarter of 2014, basic earnings per share were also up $0.01 over the same period of 2013.
SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to near breakeven results in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the 12-month period, these businesses reported a loss of $0.01 per share in 2014 compared to earnings of $0.04 per share in 2013. This change is primarily the result of higher interest expense at the holding company due to the accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs associated with hybrid securities that were called at par in early 2015 prior to their maturity.
On Slide 6, we have provided 2 years of historical financial data on the 2 subsidiary sales we recently announced to assist in updating your models. The CGT transaction closed on January 31, and the SCI transaction is scheduled to close shortly. To recap, these transactions will generate approximately $650 million of gross proceeds. Our updated estimate of the net cash available to fund our expansion will exceed $425 million after taxes. I will discuss the planned changes to our financing plan shortly.
I would now like to touch on the economic trends in our service territory. As you can see on Slide 7, during 2014, companies announced plans to invest over $1 billion with the expectation of creating over 7,500 jobs in our Carolinas territories. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence, and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 6.5%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 5.6%.
At the top of Slide 8, you can see the South Carolina unemployment statistics as of December 2014 and 2013. Although the South Carolina unemployment rate only dropped 0.10% from the end of 2013, December of 2014 marked all-time highs for the number of South Carolinians employed and in the labor force. The nearly 50,000 additions to the workforce represent a 2.4% increase over December 2013 levels. In short, the expansion of the economy has clearly motivated many that had removed themselves from actively seeking work back into the workforce.
The December market numbers from the South Carolina Association of REALTORS showed increases in new listing, pending sales and median sales prices, while available housing inventory shrank. I also wanted to mention, as depicted at the bottom of the slide, that United Van Lines recently released its annual movers study for 2014, which tracks migration patterns state to state. Once again, South Carolina and North Carolina ranked second and third, respectively, in terms of domestic migration destinations, corroborating our realized customer growth statistics. These are all very positives signs for our territories.
Slide 9 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top of the slide are the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric business added customers at an annual rate of 1.4%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at 2.5% and 2.8%, respectively. Of particular note is the fact that all of these rates accelerated during the year.
The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were up 0.6% on a 12-month-ended basis, driven mainly by strong industrial demand. We continue to see slightly lower weather-normalized consumption at the residential level, reflecting anticipated energy efficiencies.
Now please turn to Slide 10, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $8.9 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business.
In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric businesses in which we are allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended December 31 in the base electric business is approximately 10%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We are very pleased with the execution of our strategy.
Continuing down the page. On our new nuclear business, we are allowed an 11% return on equity. As you may recall, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved our 2014 request for revised rates under the BLRA, which add an incremental quip of approximately $561 million to our rate base and increased rates by approximately 2.8% in November.
Our regulated gas businesses in Carolinas continued to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina, respectively. And we continue to operate these businesses within a reasonable range of those returns. As a reminder, in November, SCE&G's gas business implemented a $2.6 million revenue reduction as a result of the Rate Stabilization Act.
Slide 11 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast has been updated to reflect our most current CapEx projections for 2015 and '16, and is now inclusive of our 2017 estimates. Note that this forecast excludes CGT and SCI, as the sale of CGT has been completed and the transaction for SCI is expected to close by the end of this quarter. Also, this forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2017, which is updated from what was filed in our quarterly BLRA report.
The data in the BLRA reports are limited to the last approved order by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and are not always consistent with our new nuclear CapEx expectations. This forecast more accurately aligns itself with our anticipated project spending over the next 3 years as it relates to the schedule delay.
At the bottom of the slide, we recapped the new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are calculated.
Now please turn to Slide 12. To summarize our financings for 2014, on May 27, SCE&G issued $300 million of 50-year bonds at 4.5%. On the equity side, we issued approximately $100 million from our 401(k) matching and DRIP plans. Looking forward, we revised our estimated financing plan through 2019. While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it's unlikely that these issuances will occur exactly as presented as they are subject to changing in our funding needs for planned public expenses.
This plan contemplates both the estimated delays and the timing of the disbursements related to the new nuclear project, as well as deployment of the proceeds from the sale of the subsidiaries. As mentioned in our press release, the plan is to use the cash proceeds, net of taxes from the sales of subs, to displace equity issuances. However, until we can fully deploy the proceeds for that purpose, we're taking advantage of this infusion of cash.
Earlier this month, SCANA redeemed, in advance of maturity, at par, its $150 million 2009 Series A, 7.7% Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes. In addition, we have delayed long-term debt issuances and are reducing our short-term borrowings. We also turned off the issuance of new shares to supply our 401(k) and DRIP plans earlier this year, and anticipate delaying the need for any additional equity issuances until 2017. We don't currently project the need for any additional equity beyond the new shares provided by the use of 401(k) and the DRIP plan, which we will turn on an as needed.
Overall, we continue to adjust the financing to match the related CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. Obviously, the construction delay has slowed expenditures, but they were also significantly reduced by lower-than-anticipated escalation. The delay is a matter of timing, but the escalation on those components already received or completed will result in permanent savings. Any change in the amount or timing of the new nuclear cost would obviously result in a change in this plan.
I would now like to discuss our 2015 earnings guidance and related assumptions, as shown on Slide 13. First, as you can see on the top left of the slide, we are resetting our base year for our long-term GAAP-adjusted average annual growth guidance of 3% to 6% over the next 3 to 5 years, off of 2014's GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized EPS of $3.58 per share. Our 2015 operating plan, exclusive of the aggregate gains on the sale of the 2 subsidiaries, would have resulted in $3.74 per share. However, we project the 2015 earnings will be negatively impacted by $0.04 per share due to the short-term impact of these 2 sales.
While these transactions are expected to yield approximately $0.04 per share of accretion on a long-term basis, all of the proceeds can't be officially deployed in the short run to displace equity needs. As such, we believe there will be downward pressure on 2015's expected earnings, which is considered in our guidance. Therefore, our 2015 net internal target for GAAP-adjusted earnings is $3.70 per share. Our GAAP-adjusted earnings per share guidance is $3.60 to $3.80 per share.
Due to the cyclical nature of our business, we expect to earn approximately 30% of this amount in the first quarter, approximately 25% in each the third and fourth quarters, and the remaining 20% in the second quarter. In computing this guidance range, we have included the impact of a base rate increase from our new nuclear filing under the BLRA, the 2014 gas RSA filing and our view of the economy.
This guidance also incorporates the CapEx and financing plans we presented earlier. We continue to assume customer average use of electricity will be slightly lower this year, as energy efficiency trends continue to work their way into the market. We anticipate overall weather-normalized retail electric sales growth for 2015 to decline by approximately 0.6%. We forecast electric customer growth to be similar to 2014.
Operation and maintenance expenses are expected to be relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014 actuals. Our effective tax rate for 2014 was slightly less than 32%. And we estimate the rate for 2015, exclusive of the taxes on the gains of the sales of the subsidiaries, will be approximately 31%. Hopefully this will provide you with a line of sight into our view of 2015 as you update your models.
Finally, I will mention that earlier today, we announced an increase in our annual dividend rate for 2015 of $0.08 to $2.18 per share, a 3.8% increase. The results of 2014 and confidence in the long-term strategy were key considerations. We continue to anticipate growing dividends, fairly consistent with earnings, while staying within our stated payout policy of 55% to 60%.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I wanted to begin by recapping the preliminary new nuclear construction schedule and cost information we received from the Consortium. As described last week at our quarterly BLRA update filing with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, the Consortium has indicated the substantial completion date for Unit 2 is expected to occur by June of 2019, and the substantial completion date for Unit 3 may be approximately 12 months later. We are continuing our discussions with the Consortium in order to identify potential mitigation strategies to possibly accelerate the substantial completion date of Unit 2 to a time earlier in the first half of 2019 or to the end of 2018 with Unit 3 following approximately 12 months later.
As Jimmy previously mentioned, we are in the midst of negotiation process with the Consortium, and we cannot predict when the revised schedule and cost estimates will be resolved. Further, neither SCE&G nor Santee Cooper has accepted the new preliminary schedule or financial responsibility associated with these delays. We anticipate filing a petition requesting an adjustment to our current capital cost and construction schedules with the Public Service Commission before the end of this quarter. Under the BLRA, the Public Service Commission would then have 6 months to issue its order.
I would now like to discuss some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. On Slide 14, you can see an aerial photo of the site from December. I have labeled both units 2 and 3 as well as many other areas that make up the construction tabletop. And as you can see, progress continues to take place on the project.
Slide 15 shows where some of the module fabrication has been moved from CB&I's Lake Charles Louisiana facility to various other venues in the United states and Japan. Fabrication of the CA-03 submodules continues at the SMCI facility in Florida. Newport News Industries in Virginia is fabricating and continues to ship shipbuilding panels to the site. Oregon Iron Works and Toshiba IHI Corporation are the principal fabricators for Unit 3's CA20 and CA-01 submodules, respectively.
On Slide 16, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture, you can see modules CA20 along with the containment vessel Ring 1, which has been placed on the containment vessel lower bowl. The lower bowl is now covered by the auxiliary building walls as they are coming up to what we call elevation 100, which is about 35 feet above the base mat. Once elevation 100 has been reached, work will begin on the annex building, which will house the electrical switch gear for the plant.
Slide 17 shows the schematic of the module inside the containment vessel. And here, you can see the locations of modules CA-01, 02, 03 and 05, which we'll further discuss shortly.
Slide 18 has an exploded view of CA-01 through 05 showing where they fit spatially in the containment vessel.
Slide 19 shows a recent picture of Unit 2 module CA-01. CA-01 houses the steam generators, the pressurizer and forms a refueling canal inside the containment vessel. We currently have all 47 submodules on site, and 34 of those submodules are upright and being assembled in the Module Assembly Building, or MAB.
Slide 20 is a shipment from Yokohama, Japan, of the first Unit 3 CA-01 submodule fabricated by Toshiba, which should be on site in early March.
Slide 21 shows pictures of the Unit 2 module CA-05. This module comprises one of the major wall sections within the containment vessel. On the top right, you can see module CA-05 inside of the tent where the final wells are completed prior to placement. On December 6, 2014, this model was lifted with the heavy lift derrick, as seen on the left-hand side of the slide; and placed in the containment vessel, as seen in the bottom-right-hand side of this slide.
On Slide 22, you can see an aerial picture with a good view of the containment vessel rings that are currently being fabricated for units 2 and 3. As you can see on the bottom right, the Unit 2 containment vessel Ring 1 has been placed on top of the containment vessel lower bowl, and ring 2 is complete and will be set after placement of structural module CA-01. Across the top of the picture, you can see 3 other containment vessel rings that are in the process of being fabricated for units 2 and 3. Each unit has a total of 3 ring sections. In addition, the steel for the Unit 2 containment vessel top closure head is also on site.
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island. Here, you can see where the containment vessel lower bowl has been placed, and the auxiliary building walls continue to take form.
On Slide 24, you can see an aerial picture showing the 4 low-profile forced draft cooling towers. The cooling towers, 2 Alpha and 3 Alpha, are both structurally complete and you can see the progress continuing on 2 Bravo and 3 Bravo.
On Slide 25, you can see 1 of the 2 steam generators in Unit 2 that arrived in the construction site on January. The component was transported from the Port of Charleston by rail on a specifically designed Schnabel car. This steam generator weighs approximately 1.3 million pounds. It's about 20 feet in diameter, and it's almost 82 feet long.
Slide 26 shows shipbuilding panels for Unit 2. The shipbuilding surrounds the containment vessel. These panels will be welded together and concrete will be poured inside the panels to create a shipbuilding. On the left, you can see one of the panels up close; and the right, you can see it laid on the yard where we have begun receiving the panels. We currently have received 44 of the 167 Unit 2 panels that are provided by Newport News Industries.
I wanted also to briefly mention the 8-inch explosive, or squib belts, which are a key component of the passive safety system of the AP 1000 design. It recently passed a series of a engineering tests to determine if they will properly operating under extreme conditions, such as high-pressure and temperature. This is great news for the project as is prepares the valves for testing to qualify them for submergence.
On Slide 27, you will see the new nuclear CapEx, actual and projected, over the life of construction. This chart also reflects our company's current actual and estimated new nuclear CapEx during the years 2008 to 2020, which, as Jimmy previously discussed, is updated from where filed in the latest quarterly BLRA report. As you can see, the next several years are the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related actual and projected customer rate increases under the BLRA, and is associated with the right-hand access. As a reminder, the incremental 5% future acquisition of the new nuclear project from Santee Cooper will not affect these protected BLRA increases.
Please now turn to Slide 28. As mentioned in our third quarter call in September, the Public Service Commission approved a rate increase of $66.2 million. The new rates were effective for bills rendered on or after October 30. Our BLRA filings for 2015 are shown at the bottom of the slide. And you can see, we recently filed our quarterly status report for the fourth quarter.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

And this is really the first time we've emphasized those interest savings. So we were really trying to clarify some misunderstanding, some in the financial markets and some in the local area here, where folks really weren't understanding the escalation savings. So we're projecting, as you know, in the BLRA somewhere around $575 million of lower escalation today than when we originally started the project. And sometimes, that had been confused with lower financing costs. That lower escalation is just lower escalation on the actual labor and modules, et cetera, associated with the construction, has nothing to do with the financing cost. So what we put in the press release is our estimate of the estimated savings over the tenor of the bonds that we have issued and those that we have locked in, the savings that would occur over the life of those. So they're really 2 different matters. As far as your real question about -- would the $660 million be offset by the $1.2 billion, I tell you it'd really be offset dollar for dollar by the escalation savings because those are more in today's dollars, the $1.2 billion are savings to occur over the future of the bonds, some 30-plus years."

So now instead of running through 2018 or 2019, we're now running through 2020. So in the 3-year look, you don't necessarily see that. So what we've included in the capital forecast going forward would be where we see the normal construction process and our payments based on the Consortium achieving milestones. And we've added what we're estimating for increases in owner's costs and change orders that we would not dispute. There are some things, like cyber security. Cyber security rules were not around when the contract was negotiated. They've changed so we have to account for that. So wouldn't necessarily dispute the fact that we have to pay for cyber. And so that would be it an example of a change or that we will include in the filing we've got coming up. So to the extent that those costs would be in those next 3 years that's in what you're seeing. And we've included a number of escalation on our owner's cost, and we have taken what we would call a minimal amount of entitlement. So of that $660 million, there's a portion of that, that we said, we probably would not dispute that, so we've included that in the costs.

So to make sure I don't further confuse this, let me go back to what we've been presenting in each BLRA would be the total projected cost each time we file the report, each quarter, for our 55% share. And we originally, of course, were approved for $6.3 billion in total future estimated costs. And our current projections are just over $0.5 billion less than that, about $575 million less. All of those reports to date have been focused on the lower escalation, if you will, the lower inflation during the construction period that the Consortium was entitled to bill us for based upon publicly available inflation indices associated with the construction. What we put in our press release today has nothing to do with that. That is the financing costs once the Consortium bills us with whatever the escalation is, how do we go out and finance it on the debt side. So the equity side is fairly straightforward, 50% of it we financed at equity through the BLRA and 11% ROE. The 50% that we financed with debt we're doing with first mortgage bonds. We had originally estimated in our BLRA filing, based upon our embedded cost of debt at that time, a debt cost of about 6.4%. Whereas, overall, we issued bonds at slightly under 5% life to date on the project. And all of those are fixed-rate bonds. And so what we've disclosed is we estimate that the savings on those over the life of the bonds will be $700 million, about $20 million a year. And then additional bonds that we expect to issue in the next 2 years that we've already hedged the rate on, we estimate to save another, oh, $525 million on those over the life of those bonds. So that's the $1,225,000,000 in interest savings that we expect to occur over the life of those bonds that are outstanding. Completely independent of the escalation to lower inflation on the construction itself."

I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Basic earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $0.73 per share, consistent with the same period of the prior year. Overall, electric margins increased",2341,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Basic earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $0.73 per share, consistent with the same period of the prior year. Overall, electric margins increased during the fourth quarter of 2014 versus the same quarter of the prior year, due primarily to continued recovery of financing costs through the Base Load Review Act, or BLRA, and customer growth.
As a reminder, the electric weather normalization pilot ended in December 2013, and the company's financial results for 2014 and going forward are now impacted by abnormal weather in our electric business.
Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we estimate that weather had a negative impact of $0.02 on electric margins versus the fourth quarter of the prior year. Additionally, higher gas margins and a slight decrease in the company's effective tax rate also contributed to the quarter. These increases were offset by expected increases in operations and maintenance expenses and CapEx-related items, including depreciation, interest expense as well as share dilution.
Please turn to Slide 4. Basic earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $3.79 per share versus $3.40 per share in 2013. Increases in electric and gas margins, as well as the decreases in the effective tax rate, were partially offset by operations and maintenance expenses and higher expenses and dilution related to our capital program. For the full year of 2014, we estimate weather added $0.21 per share to electric margins versus the prior year.
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric and Gas Company's full year earnings, denoted in blue, were up $0.41 per share for 2014 compared to the prior year. This was driven largely by increases in electric margins, which were due primarily to abnormal weather, plus the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA and customer growth.
Higher gas margins also contributed to the earnings improvement. These increases were partially offset by increases in O&M expenses, expenses related to our capital program, including property taxes, interest expense and depreciation, as well as share dilution. For the fourth quarter, basic earnings per share were $0.02 higher than in the same period last year.
PSNC Energy's earnings, shown in red, were $0.39 per share for the full year of 2014 compared to $0.37 per share in the prior year. This increase is mainly attributable to customer growth. For the fourth quarter of 2014, basic earnings were $0.16 per share, consistent with 2013.
SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, in green, showed an increase in earnings per share of $0.01 over last year. This is mainly due to increased margins from higher throughput during the first and fourth quarters of 2014. As a reminder, the increased margins in the first quarter were partially offset by higher commodity prices experienced in serving the incremental volumes and price competition. For the fourth quarter of 2014, basic earnings per share were also up $0.01 over the same period of 2013.
SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to near breakeven results in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the 12-month period, these businesses reported a loss of $0.01 per share in 2014 compared to earnings of $0.04 per share in 2013. This change is primarily the result of higher interest expense at the holding company due to the accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs associated with hybrid securities that were called at par in early 2015 prior to their maturity.
On Slide 6, we have provided 2 years of historical financial data on the 2 subsidiary sales we recently announced to assist in updating your models. The CGT transaction closed on January 31, and the SCI transaction is scheduled to close shortly. To recap, these transactions will generate approximately $650 million of gross proceeds. Our updated estimate of the net cash available to fund our expansion will exceed $425 million after taxes. I will discuss the planned changes to our financing plan shortly.
I would now like to touch on the economic trends in our service territory. As you can see on Slide 7, during 2014, companies announced plans to invest over $1 billion with the expectation of creating over 7,500 jobs in our Carolinas territories. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence, and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 6.5%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 5.6%.
At the top of Slide 8, you can see the South Carolina unemployment statistics as of December 2014 and 2013. Although the South Carolina unemployment rate only dropped 0.10% from the end of 2013, December of 2014 marked all-time highs for the number of South Carolinians employed and in the labor force. The nearly 50,000 additions to the workforce represent a 2.4% increase over December 2013 levels. In short, the expansion of the economy has clearly motivated many that had removed themselves from actively seeking work back into the workforce.
The December market numbers from the South Carolina Association of REALTORS showed increases in new listings, pending sales and median sales prices, while available housing inventory shrank. I also wanted to mention, as depicted at the bottom of the slide, that United Van Lines recently released its annual movers study for 2014, which tracks migration patterns state to state. Once again, South Carolina and North Carolina ranked second and third, respectively, in terms of domestic migration destinations, corroborating our realized customer growth statistics. These are all very positive signs for our territories.
Slide 9 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top of the slide are the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric business added customers at an annual rate of 1.4%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at 2.5% and 2.8%, respectively. Of particular note is the fact that all of these rates accelerated during the year.
The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were up 0.6% on a 12-month-ended basis, driven mainly by strong industrial demand. We continue to see slightly lower weather-normalized consumption at the residential level, reflecting anticipated energy efficiencies.
Now please turn to Slide 10, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $8.9 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business.
In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric businesses in which we are allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended December 31 in the base electric business is approximately 10%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We are very pleased with the execution of our strategy.
Continuing down the page. On our new nuclear business, we are allowed an 11% return on equity. As you may recall, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved our 2014 request for revised rates under the BLRA, which add an incremental quip of approximately $561 million to our rate base and increased rates by approximately 2.8% in November.
Our regulated gas businesses in Carolinas continued to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina, respectively. And we continue to operate these businesses within a reasonable range of those returns. As a reminder, in November, SCE&G's gas business implemented a $2.6 million revenue reduction as a result of the Rate Stabilization Act.
Slide 11 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast has been updated to reflect our most current CapEx projections for 2015 and '16, and is now inclusive of our 2017 estimates. Note that this forecast excludes CGT and SCI, as the sale of CGT has been completed and the transaction for SCI is expected to close by the end of this quarter. Also, this forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2017, which is updated from what was filed in our quarterly BLRA report.
The data in the BLRA reports are limited to the last approved order by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and are not always consistent with our new nuclear CapEx expectations. This forecast more accurately aligns itself with our anticipated project spending over the next 3 years as it relates to the schedule delay.
At the bottom of the slide, we recapped the new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are calculated.
Now please turn to Slide 12. To summarize our financings for 2014, on May 27, SCE&G issued $300 million of 50-year bonds at 4.5%. On the equity side, we issued approximately $100 million from our 401(k) matching and DRIP plans. Looking forward, we revised our estimated financing plan through 2019. While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it's unlikely that these issuances will occur exactly as presented as they are subject to changing in our funding needs for planned project expenses.
This plan contemplates both the estimated delays and the timing of the disbursements related to the new nuclear project, as well as deployment of the proceeds from the sale of the subsidiaries. As mentioned in our press release, the plan is to use the cash proceeds, net of taxes from the sale of subs, to displace equity issuances. However, until we can fully deploy the proceeds for that purpose, we're taking advantage of this infusion of cash.
Earlier this month, SCANA redeemed, in advance of maturity, at par, its $150 million 2009 Series A, 7.7% Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes. In addition, we have delayed long-term debt issuances and are reducing our short-term borrowings. We also turned off the issuance of new shares to supply our 401(k) and DRIP plans earlier this year, and anticipate delaying the need for any additional equity issuances until 2017. We don't currently project the need for any additional equity beyond the new shares provided by the use of 401(k) and the DRIP plan, which we will turn on as needed.
Overall, we continue to adjust the financing to match the related CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. Obviously, the construction delay has slowed expenditures, but they were also significantly reduced by lower-than-anticipated escalation. The delay is a matter of timing, but the escalation on those components already received or completed will result in permanent savings. Any change in the amount or timing of the new nuclear cost would obviously result in a change in this plan.
I would now like to discuss our 2015 earnings guidance and related assumptions, as shown on Slide 13. First, as you can see on the top left of the slide, we are resetting our base year for our long-term GAAP-adjusted average annual growth guidance of 3% to 6% over the next 3 to 5 years, off of 2014's GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized EPS of $3.58 per share. Our 2015 operating plan, exclusive of the aggregate gains on the sale of the 2 subsidiaries, would have resulted in $3.74 per share. However, we project the 2015 earnings will be negatively impacted by $0.04 per share due to the short-term impact of these 2 sales.
While these transactions are expected to yield approximately $0.04 per share of accretion on a long-term basis, all of the proceeds can't be efficiently deployed in the short run to displace equity needs. As such, we believe there will be downward pressure on 2015's expected earnings, which is considered in our guidance. Therefore, our 2015 net internal target for GAAP-adjusted earnings is $3.70 per share. Our GAAP-adjusted earnings per share guidance is $3.60 to $3.80 per share.
Due to the cyclical nature of our business, we expect to earn approximately 30% of this amount in the first quarter, approximately 25% in each the third and fourth quarters, and the remaining 20% in the second quarter. In computing this guidance range, we have included the impact of a base rate increase from our new nuclear filing under the BLRA, the 2014 gas RSA filing and our view of the economy.
This guidance also incorporates the CapEx and financing plans we presented earlier. We continue to assume customer average use of electricity will be slightly lower this year, as energy efficiency trends continue to work their way into the market. We anticipate overall weather-normalized retail electric sales growth for 2015 to decline by approximately 0.6%. We forecast electric customer growth to be similar to 2014.
Operation and maintenance expenses are expected to be relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014 actuals. Our effective tax rate for 2014 was slightly less than 32%. And we estimate the rate for 2015, exclusive of the taxes on the gains of the sales of the subsidiaries, will be approximately 31%. Hopefully this will provide you with a line of sight into our view of 2015 as you update your models.
Finally, I will mention that earlier today, we announced an increase in our annual dividend rate for 2015 of $0.08 to $2.18 per share, a 3.8% increase. The results of 2014 and confidence in the long-term strategy were key considerations. We continue to anticipate growing dividends, fairly consistent with earnings, while staying within our stated payout policy of 55% to 60%.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I wanted to begin by recapping the preliminary new nuclear construction schedule and cost information we received from the Consortium. As described last week in our quarterly BLRA update filing with the Public Service Commission of South Ca",1260,"Thanks, Jimmy. I wanted to begin by recapping the preliminary new nuclear construction schedule and cost information we received from the Consortium. As described last week in our quarterly BLRA update filing with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, the Consortium has indicated the substantial completion date for Unit 2 is expected to occur by June of 2019, and the substantial completion date for Unit 3 may be approximately 12 months later. We are continuing our discussions with the Consortium in order to identify potential mitigation strategies to possibly accelerate the substantial completion date of Unit 2 to a time earlier in the first half of 2019 or to the end of 2018 with Unit 3 following approximately 12 months later.
As Jimmy previously mentioned, we are in the midst of negotiation process with the Consortium, and we cannot predict when the revised schedule and cost estimates will be resolved. Further, neither SCE&G nor Santee Cooper has accepted the new preliminary schedule or financial responsibility associated with these delays. We anticipate filing a petition requesting an adjustment to our current capital cost and construction schedules with the Public Service Commission before the end of this quarter. Under the BLRA, the Public Service Commission would then have 6 months to issue its order.
I would now like to discuss some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. On Slide 14, you can see an aerial photo of the site from December. I have labeled both units 2 and 3 as well as many other areas that make up the construction tabletop. And as you can see, progress continues to take place on the project.
Slide 15 shows where some of the module fabrication has been moved from CB&I's Lake Charles Louisiana facility to various other venues in the United states and Japan. Fabrication of the CA-03 submodules continues at the SMCI facility in Florida. Newport News Industries in Virginia is fabricating and continues to ship shield building panels to the site. Oregon Iron Works and Toshiba IHI Corporation are the principal fabricators for Unit 3's CA20 and CA-01 submodules, respectively.
On Slide 16, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture, you can see modules CA20 along with the containment vessel Ring 1, which has been placed on the containment vessel lower bowl. The lower bowl is now covered by the auxiliary building walls as they are coming up to what we call elevation 100, which is about 35 feet above the base mat. Once elevation 100 has been reached, work will begin on the annex building, which will house the electrical switch gear for the plant.
Slide 17 shows the schematic of the module inside the containment vessel. And here, you can see the locations of modules CA-01, 02, 03 and 05, which we'll further discuss shortly.
Slide 18 is an exploded view of CA-01 through 05 showing where they fit spatially in the containment vessel.
Slide 19 shows a recent picture of Unit 2 module CA-01. CA-01 houses the steam generators, the pressurizer and forms a refueling canal inside the containment vessel. We currently have all 47 submodules on site, and 34 of those submodules are upright and being assembled in the Module Assembly Building, or MAB.
Slide 20 is a shipment from Yokohama, Japan, of the first Unit 3 CA-01 submodule fabricated by Toshiba, which should be on site in early March.
Slide 21 shows pictures of the Unit 2 module CA-05. This module comprises one of the major wall sections within the containment vessel. On the top right, you can see module CA-05 inside of the tent where the final wells are completed prior to placement. On December 6, 2014, this model was lifted with the heavy lift derrick, as seen on the left-hand side of the slide; and placed in the containment vessel, as seen in the bottom-right-hand side of the slide.
On Slide 22, you can see an aerial picture with a good view of the containment vessel rings that are currently being fabricated for units 2 and 3. As you can see on the bottom right, the Unit 2 containment vessel Ring 1 has been placed on top of the containment vessel lower bowl, and ring 2 is complete and will be set after placement of structural module CA-01. Across the top of the picture, you can see 3 other containment vessel rings that are in the process of being fabricated for units 2 and 3. Each unit has a total of 3 ring sections. In addition, the steel for the Unit 2 containment vessel top closure head is also on site.
Slide 23 shows a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island. Here, you can see where the containment vessel lower bowl has been placed, and the auxiliary building walls continue to take form.
On Slide 24, you can see an aerial picture showing the 4 low-profile forced draft cooling towers. Cooling towers, 2 Alpha and 3 Alpha, are both structurally complete and you can see the progress continuing on 2 Bravo and 3 Bravo.
On Slide 25, you can see 1 of the 2 steam generators in Unit 2 that arrived at the construction site in January. The component was transported from the Port of Charleston by rail on a specifically designed Schnabel car. This steam generator weighs approximately 1.3 million pounds. It's about 20 feet in diameter, and it's almost 82 feet long.
Slide 26 shows shield building panels for Unit 2. The shield building surrounds the containment vessel. These panels will be welded together and concrete will be poured inside the panels to create the shield building. On the left, you can see one of the panels up close; on the right, you can see it laid on the yard where we have begun receiving the panels. We currently have received 44 of the 167 Unit 2 panels that are provided by Newport News Industries.
I wanted also to briefly mention the 8-inch explosive, or squib belts, which are a key component of the passive safety system of the AP 1000 design. It recently passed a series of engineering tests to determine if they will properly operating under extreme conditions, such as high-pressure and temperature. This is great news for the project as it prepares the valves for testing to qualify them for submergence.
On Slide 27, you will see the new nuclear CapEx, actual and projected, over the life of construction. This chart also reflects our company's current actual and estimated new nuclear CapEx during the years 2008 to 2020, which, as Jimmy previously discussed, is updated from what we filed in the latest quarterly BLRA report. As you can see, the next several years are the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related actual and projected customer rate increases under the BLRA, and is associated with the right-hand access. As a reminder, the incremental 5% future acquisition of the new nuclear project from Santee Cooper will not affect these protected BLRA increases.
Please now turn to Slide 28. As mentioned in our third quarter call in September, the Public Service Commission approved a rate increase of $66.2 million. The new rates were effective for bills rendered on or after October 30. Our BLRA filings for 2015 are shown at the bottom of the slide. And you can see, we recently filed our quarterly status report for the fourth quarter.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

And this is really the first time we've emphasized those interest savings. So we were really trying to clarify some misunderstanding, some in the financial markets and some in the local area here, where folks really weren't understanding the escalation savings. So we're projecting, as you know, in the BLRA somewhere around $575 million of lower escalation today than when we originally started the project. And sometimes, that had been confused with lower financing costs. That lower escalation is just lower escalation on the actual labor and modules, et cetera, associated with the construction, has nothing to do with the financing cost. So what we put in the press release is our estimate of the estimated savings over the tenor of the bonds that we have issued and those that we have locked in, the savings that would occur over the life of those. So they're really 2 different matters. As far as your real question about -- would the $660 million be offset by the $1.2 billion, I'd say it'd really be offset dollar for dollar by the escalation savings because those are more in today's dollars, the $1.2 billion are savings to occur over the future of the bonds, some 30-plus years."

And we've added what we're estimating for increases in owner's costs and change orders that we would not dispute. There are some things, like cyber security. Cyber security rules were not around when the contract was negotiated. They've changed so we have to account for that. So wouldn't necessarily dispute the fact that we have to pay for cyber. And so that would be an example of a change order that we will include in the filing we've got coming up. So to the extent that those costs would be in those next 3 years that's in what you're seeing.

So to make sure I don't further confuse this, let me go back to what we've been presenting in each BLRA would be the total projected cost each time we file the report, each quarter, for our 55% share. And we originally, of course, were approved for $",331,"Yes. So to make sure I don't further confuse this, let me go back to what we've been presenting in each BLRA would be the total projected cost each time we file the report, each quarter, for our 55% share. And we originally, of course, were approved for $6.3 billion in total future estimated costs. And our current projections are just over $0.5 billion less than that, about $575 million less. All of those reports to date have been focused on the lower escalation, if you will, the lower inflation during the construction period that the Consortium was entitled to bill us for based upon publicly available inflation indices associated with the construction. What we put in our press release today has nothing to do with that. That is the financing costs once the Consortium bills us with whatever the escalation is, how do we go out and finance it on the debt side. So the equity side is fairly straightforward, 50% of it we financed at equity through the BLRA and 11% ROE. The 50% that we financed with debt we're doing with first mortgage bonds. We had originally estimated in our BLRA filing, based upon our embedded cost of debt at that time, a debt cost of about 6.4%. Whereas, overall, we issued bonds at slightly under 5% life to date on the project. And all of those are fixed-rate bonds. And so what we've disclosed is we estimate that the savings on those over the life of the bonds will be $700 million, about $20 million a year. And then additional bonds that we expect to issue in the next 2 years that we've already hedged the rate on, we estimate to save another, oh, $525 million on those over the life of those bonds. So that's the $1,225,000,000 in interest savings that we expect to occur over the life of those bonds that are outstanding. Completely independent of the escalation to lower inflation on the construction itself."

I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2015 were $2.80 per share compared to $1.37 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The improved results in the firs",1376,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2015 were $2.80 per share compared to $1.37 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The improved results in the first quarter are mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI, and higher electric margins due primarily to a based load review act rate increase and customer growth. Also, O&M presented a favorable variance, which is primarily attributable to CGT only operating as part of the SCANA family for 1 month. This were partially offset by lower electric margins due to weather, lower gas margins and expected increases in CapEx related items, including interest, property taxes and share dilution. Note that even though weather had a negative impact on earnings year-over-year, they were still abnormally cold and earnings increased by $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $0.10 per share in the first quarter of 2014. 
Slide 4 shows earnings on a GAAP adjusted weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the first quarter of 2015 were $1.34 per share compared to $1.27 per share in the same quarter of 2014. This excludes the impact of abnormal weather and the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI in the first quarter of 2015 of $1.41 per share. 
Now on Slide 5 I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's first quarter 2015 earnings were relatively flat when compared to the same quarter of 2014. However, exclusive of the previously mentioned impacts of weather, earnings per share were up $0.05 in the first quarter of 2015 over the first quarter of 2014. Increases in earnings were due primarily to the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA, customer growth and a decrease in operation and maintenance expenses. These items were offset by a decrease in gas margins, as well as increases in expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense, property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. PSNC Energy's earnings were $0.24 per share for the first quarter of 2015, consistent with the prior year. SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, showed an increase in first quarter earnings of $0.03 per share in 2015 over last year. This improvement was primarily attributable to increased margins. On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported earnings of $1.48 per share in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $0.08 per share in the prior year. Excluding the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of a $1.41 per share, GAAP adjusted EPS was down $0.01 over the prior year. This is mainly attributable to lower interest expense at the holding company being more than offset by the foregoing earnings contribution from the subsidiaries that were sold. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. We continue to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. So far, in 2015, companies have announced plans to invest over $600 million with teh expectation of creating over 1,600 jobs in our Carolinas territories. Most significantly, Mercedes-Benz announced plans last month to invest about $500 million to build a new commercial van assembly plant in Charleston, creating approximately 1,300 jobs. South Carolina continues to be seen as a favorable place to start and/or expand existing businesses. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now 6.7% and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 5.6%. On the South Carolina unemployment rate has slightly increased over the past few quarters, March marked the 64th consecutive month of employment growth and the 14th consecutive month of labor force expansion as the number of people entering the workforce is at an all-time high. Approximately 50,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. 
Slide 7 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide are the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at 2.6% and 2.9%, respectively. Of particular note is the fact that all of these rates accelerated over rates a year ago. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather normalized Carolina [ph] sales for the 12 months ended March 31, 2015. Overall, weather normalized total retail sales were flat on a 12-month [indiscernible] basis. We continue to see slightly lower weather normalized consumption at the residential level, reflecting anticipated energy efficiencies, which is offset by increases in industrial demand. 
Now please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $8.9 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended March 31 in the base electric business is approximately 9.6%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. 
Continuing down the page. On our new nuclear business, we're allowed an 11% return on equity. Last year, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved our 2014 request for revised rates under the BLRA, which add an incremental quip of approximately $561 million to our rate base and increased rates by approximately 2.8% in November. As Steve will discuss shortly, we will be filing our new revised request for rates in May. Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina, respectively. And we continue to operate these businesses within a reasonable range of those returns. 
Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reflected in the pension filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on March 12, 2015. At the bottom of the slide, we recapped the new nuclear quip from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Now please turn to Slide 10 to review our estimated financing plan through 2017. As a reminder, in January, we issued approximately $14 million in equity through our 401(k) and plans before turning the plans of to new shares. By acquiring shares on the open-market to satisfy the needs of these plans, we can further utillize that cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017, and currently, expect look to satisfy future needs without follow-on offerings. While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances it is unlikely that this issuances will occur exactly as presented as they are subject to changes in funding needs for the planned project expenses, and we continue to adjust financing the related CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
Finally, on Slide 11, we are reaffirming our GAAP adjusted weather normalized earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.80 per share, along with our internal target of $3.70 per share. Our long-term GAAP adjusted weather normalized average annual growth guidance remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the next 3 to 5 years using a base of 2014's GAAP adjusted weather normalized EPS of $3.58 per share. 
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I'd like to begin by discussing the petition that SCE&G filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on March 12. The petition is seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule, as well as the capital cost schedule for the 2 new nuclear units. The construction schedule, without consideration of all mitigating strategies, includes a substantial completion date of June of 2019 for Unit 2 and June of 2020 for Unit 3. The new capital cost scheduled includes incremental capital costs that total $698 million, of which $539 million are associated with the delay and other contested costs. As we've seen noted, negotiations continue with the Consortium and even SCE&G, nor Santee Cooper has accepted responsibility for any contested and/or delay associated costs. Further, we cannot predict when these negotiations will be resolved. 
I'd now like to discuss some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 13 presents an aerial photo of the site from last December. Here, you can see the layout of the site. I've labeled both Units 2 and 3, as well as many other areas that make up the construction tabletop. The site changes daily. And for those of you that have been tracking the project for some time, you can see the progress continues to take place. 
On Slide 14, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture, you can see module CA20, along with the containment vessel Ring 1, which has been placed on the containment vessel lower bowl. Also visible in this photo are the personnel and equipment hatches which are located in the first Ring section. Work continuous on the containment vessel for placement of CA-01, which we will discuss shortly. Progress continues on achieving what we term Elevation 100 as building walls are being built up. Once Elevation 100 has been reached, work can begin on the annex building, which will house the electrical switch gear for the plant, as well as placing of the shield building panels. 
Slide 15 presents a schematic of the large structural modules that will be located inside the containment vessel. And here you can see the locations of modules CA-01, 02, 03 and 05, which we will further discuss shortly. 
Slide 16 has another schematic view of the modules inside of the containment vessel. This exploded view of CA-01 through 05 is your better feel of how they fit spatially inside the containment vessel. 
Slide 17 recent picture of Unit 2 module CA-01. CA-01 houses steam generators, depressurizer and feel of canal inside of the containment vessel. On the right-hand side of the photo, you can see an art flash from the automatic process that seemed submodules together. The seam welding on all submodules for distinct has been completed in the Module Assembly Building or MAB. Once support concrete has been placed and cured, the CA-01 module will be moved outside of MAB, rigged to the Heavy Lift Derrick and sent into the Unit 2 containment vessel. After the placement of CA-01 for Unit 2, the next module to be placed will be module CA-02. 
Slide 18 shows a picture of CA-02 as it is very being fabricated. And we now have all 5 submodules on site with 3 standing upright for assembly in the MAB. Module CA-02 has a wall section that forms part of the incontainment water storage tank located inside the containment vessel. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island. The containment vessel lower bowl has been placed and the axillary building walls continue to take form. 
On the left side of Slide 20, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 turbine building and I've added showing where the construction is taking place for the turbine pedestal. On the right, you can see a picture from the top of the turbine building of the turbine pedestal. The turbine pedestal will be concrete 10 feet thick and will support the Unit 2 turbine when completed. 
Slide 21 shows some of the shield building panels that have arrived on site for Unit 2. Shield building surrounds the containment vessel. These panels will be welded together and concrete will be poured inside the panels to create a shield building. On the left, you can see one of these panels up close. On the right, you can see the laid on yard where we have been receiving these panels. We currently have received about 60 of the 167 Unit 2 panels that are manufactured by Newport News Industries. 
On Slide 22, you can see where we have begun SMB of the shield bidding panels. Once joined and welded together, panel sessions will be placed starting Elevation 100. 
On Slide 23, you'll see the new nuclear CapEx actual and projected over the life of the construction. This chart reflects our company's current actual and estimated new nuclear CapEx during the years 2008 to 2020, reflecting the petition filed March 12 with the Public Service Commission. As you can see, the next several years are the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related actual and projected customer rate increases under the BLRA and is associated with the right-hand access. 
Please now turn to Slide 24. We have 2 BLRA filings coming up in May. In mid-May, we will file a quarterly status update with the Public Service Commission. And as mentioned earlier, on May 29, we will make our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA. 
Finally, please turn to Slide 25 to briefly discuss our solar initiative in South Carolina. Our customers and other South Carolina stakeholders expressed the desire for solar energy, and we've been looking for ways to economically integrate integrated additional solar into our generation portfolio. As a part of the distributed energy resource program, which was filed with the Public Service Commission in February, SCE&G plans to add approximately 95 megawatts of renewable energy by the end of 2020. In 2015, we plan to install approximately 10 megawatts of solar generation to our system. As you can see from the slide, the first 2 solar farms will be a 3.8-megawatt solar farm in Casey, South Carolina, adjacent to our corporate headquarters, and a 500-kilowatt solar farm that will be constructed in North Charleston, South Carolina. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

So that's what our goals are from between now and about 2020. And what we've outlined here are the first of the projects that we have planned. Now whether we own those upfront are not will be a question. And right now we're not thinking that we will own those necessarily upfront. Other entities can take advantage of things like tax credits that we were not able to take advantage of. I think eventually we will probably own them.

It's a matter of juggling everything we have to juggle and running the operating company at reasonable equity levels that the regulators will endorse. So there's only so much we can do without. The real strain on the metrics is the longer -- although the BLRA is a very effective mechanism, all it allows us to do is to recover the financing costs during a construction period. We're not rig covering the actual construction cost of the plants until they start depreciation. That's when we get to that the recovery of the actual cost of the plant. So the longer that period is drawn out with increased cost of the plant, it's going to put more pressure on the cash flow ratios. So I wouldn't say we don't think it's important. It just maybe very, very difficult to do with juggling all the factors we have to juggle."

I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2015 were $2.80 per share compared to $1.37 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The improved results in the firs",1368,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2015 were $2.80 per share compared to $1.37 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The improved results in the first quarter are mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI and higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth. Also, O&M presented a favorable variance, which is primarily attributable to CGT only operating as part of the SCANA family for one month. These were partially offset by lower electric margins due to weather, lower gas margins and expected increases in CapEx-related items, including interest, property taxes and share dilution. Note that even though weather had a negative impact on earnings year-over-year, it were still abnormally cold and earnings increased by $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $0.10 per share in the first quarter of 2014. 
Slide 4 shows earnings on a GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the first quarter of 2015 were $1.34 per share compared to $1.27 per share in the same quarter of 2014. This excludes the impact of abnormal weather and the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI in the first quarter of 2015 of $1.41 per share. 
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's first quarter 2015 earnings were relatively flat when compared to the same quarter of 2014. However, exclusive of the previously mentioned impacts of weather, earnings per share were up $0.05 in the first quarter of 2015 over the first quarter of 2014. Increases in earnings were due primarily to the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA, customer growth and a decrease in operation and maintenance expenses. These items were offset by a decrease in gas margins, as well as increases in expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense, property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. PSNC Energy's earnings were $0.24 per share for the first quarter of 2015, consistent with the prior year. SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, showed an increase in first quarter earnings of $0.03 per share in 2015 over last year. This improvement was primarily attributable to increased margins. On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported earnings of $1.48 per share in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $0.08 per share in the prior year. Excluding the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP-adjusted EPS was down $0.01 over the prior year. This is mainly attributable to lower interest expense at the holding company being more than offset by the foregone earnings contribution from the subsidiaries that were sold. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. We continue to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. So far, in 2015, companies have announced plans to invest over $600 million with the expectation of creating over 1,600 jobs in our Carolinas territories. Most significantly, Mercedes-Benz announced plans last month to invest about $500 million to build a new commercial van assembly plant in Charleston, creating approximately 1,300 jobs. South Carolina continues to be seen as a favorable place to start and/or expand existing businesses. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now 6.7%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 5.6%. While the South Carolina unemployment rate has slightly increased over the past few quarters, March marked the 64th consecutive month of employment growth and the 14th consecutive month of labor force expansion as the number of people entering the workforce is at an all-time high. Approximately 50,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. 
Slide 7 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide are the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at 2.6% and 2.9%, respectively. Of particular note is the fact that all of these rates accelerated over rates a year ago. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales for the 12 months ended March 31, 2015. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were flat on a 12-month-ended basis. We continue to see slightly lower weather-normalized consumption at the residential level, reflecting anticipated energy efficiencies, which is offset by increases in industrial demand. 
Now please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $8.9 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended March 31 in the base electric business is approximately 9.6%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. 
Continuing down the page. On our new nuclear business, we are allowed an 11% return on equity. Last year, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved our 2014 request for revised rates under the BLRA, which add an incremental quip of approximately $561 million to our rate base and increased rates by approximately 2.8% in November. As Steve will discuss shortly, we will be filing our new revised request for rates in May. Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina, respectively. And we continue to operate these businesses within a reasonable range of those returns. 
Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reflected in the petition filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on March 12, 2015. At the bottom of the slide, we recap the new nuclear quip from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Now please turn to Slide 10 to review our estimated financing plan through 2017. As a reminder, in January, we issued approximately $14 million in equity through our 401(k) and DRIP plans before turning the plans off to new shares. By acquiring shares on the open market to satisfy the needs of these plans, we can further utilize the cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017, and currently expect we can satisfy future needs without follow-on offerings. While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur exactly as presented as they are subject to changes in funding needs for the planned project expenses, and we continue to adjust the financing to match the related CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
Finally, on Slide 11, we are reaffirming our GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.80 per share, along with our internal target of $3.70 per share. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized average annual growth guidance remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the next 3 to 5 years using a base of 2014's GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized EPS of $3.58 per share. 
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I'd like to begin by discussing the petition that SCE&G filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on March 12. The petition is seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule as well",1091,"Thanks, Jimmy. Please turn to Slide 12. I'd like to begin by discussing the petition that SCE&G filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on March 12. The petition is seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule as well as the capital cost schedule for the 2 new nuclear units. The construction schedule, without consideration of all mitigating strategies, includes a substantial completion date of June of 2019 for Unit 2 and June of 2020 for Unit 3. The new capital cost schedule includes incremental capital costs that total $698 million, of which $539 million are associated with the delay and other contested costs. As previously noted, negotiations continue with the Consortium and neither SCE&G nor Santee Cooper has accepted responsibility for any contested and/or delay associated costs. Further, we cannot predict when these negotiations will be resolved. 
I'd now like to discuss some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 13 presents an aerial photo of the site from last December. Here, you can see the layout of the site. I've labeled both Units 2 and 3, as well as many other areas that make up the construction tabletop. The site changes daily. And for those of you that have been tracking the project for some time, you can see the progress continues to take place. 
On Slide 14, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture, you can see module CA20, along with the containment vessel Ring 1, which has been placed on the containment vessel lower bowl. Also visible in this photo are the personnel and equipment hatches which are located in the first Ring section. Work continues on the containment vessel prepared for placement of CA-01, which we will discuss shortly. Progress continues on achieving what we term Elevation 100 as auxillary building walls are being built up. Once Elevation 100 has been reached, work will begin on the annex building, which will house the electrical switch gear for the plant, as well as placing of the shield building panels. 
Slide 15 presents a schematic of the large structural modules that will be located inside the containment vessel. And here you can see the locations of modules CA-01, 02, 03 and 05, which we will further discuss shortly. 
Slide 16 has another schematic view of the modules inside of the containment vessel. This exploded view of CA-01 through 05 gives you a better feel of how they fit spatially inside the containment vessel. 
Slide 17 shows a recent picture of Unit 2 module CA-01. CA-01 houses the steam generators, the pressurizer and forms a refueling canal inside the containment vessel. On the right-hand side of the photo, you can see an arc flash from the automatic process that's seam welding the submodules together. The seam welding on all submodules in preparation for lifting has been completed in the Module Assembly Building, or MAB. Once support concrete has been placed and cured, the CA-01 module will be moved outside of the MAB, rigged to the heavy lift derrick and set in the Unit 2 containment vessel. After the placement of CA-01 for Unit 2, the next module to be placed will be module CA-02. 
Slide 18 shows a picture of CA-02 as it is currently being fabricated. We now have all 5 submodules on site, with 3 standing upright for assembly in the MAB. Module CA-02 has a wall section that forms part of the incontainment refueling water storage tank located inside the containment vessel. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island. The containment vessel lower bowl has been placed and the axillary building walls continue to take form. 
On the left side of Slide 20, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 turbine building and I've added an arrow showing where the construction is taking place for the turbine pedestal. On the right, you can see a picture from the top of the turbine building of the turbine pedestal. The turbine pedestal will be concrete 10 feet thick and will support the Unit 2 turbine when completed. 
Slide 21 shows some of the shield building panels that have arrived on site for Unit 2. Shield building surrounds the containment vessel. These panels will be welded together, and concrete will be poured inside the panels to create a shield building. On the left, you can see one of these panels up close. On the right, you can see the laydown yard where we have been receiving these panels. We currently have received about 60 of the 167 Unit 2 panels that were manufactured by Newport News Industries. 
On Slide 22, you can see where we have begun assembly of the shield bidding panels. Once joined and welded together, panel sections will be placed starting at Elevation 100. 
On Slide 23, you'll see the new nuclear CapEx, actual and projected, over the life of the construction. This chart reflects our company's current actual and estimated new nuclear CapEx during the years 2008 to 2020, reflecting the petition filed March 12 with the Public Service Commission. As you can see, the next several years are the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related actual and projected customer rate increases under the BLRA and is associated with the right-hand access. 
Please now turn to Slide 24. We have 2 BLRA filings coming up in May. In mid-May, we will file a quarterly status update with the Public Service Commission. And as mentioned earlier, on May 29, we will make our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA. 
Finally, please turn to Slide 25 to briefly discuss our solar initiative in South Carolina. Our customers and other South Carolina stakeholders had expressed a desire for solar energy, and we've been looking for ways to economically integrate additional solar into our generation portfolio. As a part of the distributed energy resource program, which was filed with the Public Service Commission in February, SCE&G plans to add approximately 95 megawatts of renewable energy by the end of 2020. In 2015, we plan to install approximately 10 megawatts of solar generation to our system. As you can see from the slide, the first 2 solar farms will be a 3.8-megawatt solar farm in Cayce, South Carolina, adjacent to our corporate headquarters, and a 500-kilowatt solar farm that will be constructed in North Charleston, South Carolina. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

So that's what our goals are from between now and about 2020. And what we've outlined here are the first of the projects that we have planned. Now whether we own those upfront are not will be a question. And right now, we're not thinking that we will own those necessarily upfront. Other entities can take advantage of things like tax credits that we were not able to take advantage of. I think eventually we will probably own them. We also have about 300-or-so customers on our system right now with solar, all relatively small commercial and residential scale in addition to about a 2.3-megawatt facility we have down at Boeing. We do anticipate that we'll end up with somewhere in the range of 5,000 commercial and residential customers after 2020 through this state-approved program."

On the gas side, we've got the Rate Stabilization Act in South Carolina, which measures it each year. And so at the end of the heating season, at the end of the first quarter, of course, the numbers that we disclosed there for the gas business, we're at 12.31%. But once they settle out that and make their pro forma adjustments, the Office of Regulatory Staff will review it.

The only thing I was mentioning is that some of them, and frankly I don't remember which one right now, have, and maybe most, all of them even have these methodologies so that if the OpCo moves, the holdco has to move by methodology by definition. We don't have anything other than that. I think they're all watching the outcome for the holdco, just like they are on the Opco of this very, very important filing before the PSC and the BLRA update. So I think that is the key issue. Not aware of any kind of covenant issue or anything like that would cause any additional concerns."

I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2015 were $2.80 per share compared to $1.37 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The improved results in the firs",1367,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2015 were $2.80 per share compared to $1.37 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The improved results in the first quarter are mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI and higher electric margins, due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth. Also, O&M presented a favorable variance, which is primarily attributable to CGT only operating as part of the SCANA family for one month. These were partially offset by lower electric margins due to weather, lower gas margins and expected increases in CapEx-related items, including interest, property taxes and share dilution. Note that even though weather had a negative impact on earnings year-over-year, it was still abnormally cold and earnings increased by $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $0.10 per share in the first quarter of 2014. 
Slide 4 shows earnings on a GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the first quarter of 2015 were $1.34 per share compared to $1.27 per share in the same quarter of 2014. This excludes the impact of abnormal weather and the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI in the first quarter of 2015 of $1.41 per share. 
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's first quarter 2015 earnings were relatively flat when compared to the same quarter of 2014. However, exclusive of the previously mentioned impacts of weather, earnings per share were up $0.05 in the first quarter of 2015 over the first quarter of 2014. Increases in earnings were due primarily to the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA, customer growth and a decrease in operation and maintenance expenses. These items were offset by a decrease in gas margins, as well as increases in expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense, property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. PSNC Energy's earnings were $0.24 per share for the first quarter of 2015, consistent with the prior year. SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, showed an increase in first quarter earnings of $0.03 per share in 2015 over last year. This improvement was primarily attributable to increased margins. On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported earnings of $1.48 per share in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $0.08 per share in the prior year. Excluding the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP-adjusted EPS was down $0.01 over the prior year. This is mainly attributable to lower interest expense at the holding company being more than offset by the foregone earnings contribution from the subsidiaries that were sold. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. We continue to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. So far, in 2015, companies have announced plans to invest over $600 million with the expectation of creating over 1,600 jobs in our Carolinas territories. Most significantly, Mercedes-Benz announced plans last month to invest about $500 million to build a new commercial van assembly plant in Charleston, creating approximately 1,300 jobs. South Carolina continues to be seen as a favorable place to start and/or expand existing businesses. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now 6.7%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 5.6%. While the South Carolina unemployment rate has slightly increased over the past few quarters, March marked the 64th consecutive month of employment growth and the 14th consecutive month of labor force expansion, as the number of people entering the workforce is at an all-time high. Approximately 50,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. 
Slide 7 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide are the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at 2.6% and 2.9%, respectively. Of particular note is the fact that all of these rates accelerated over rates a year ago. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended March 31, 2015. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were flat on a 12-month-ended basis. We continue to see slightly lower weather-normalized consumption at the residential level, reflecting anticipated energy efficiencies, which is offset by increases in industrial demand. 
Now please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $8.9 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended March 31 in the base electric business is approximately 9.6%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. 
Continuing down the page. On our new nuclear business, we are allowed an 11% return on equity. Last year, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved our 2014 request for revised rates under the BLRA, which add an incremental quip of approximately $561 million to our rate base and increased rates by approximately 2.8% in November. As Steve will discuss shortly, we will be filing our new revised request for rates in May. Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina, respectively. And we continue to operate these businesses within a reasonable range of those returns. 
Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reflected in the petition filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on March 12, 2015. At the bottom of the slide, we recap the new nuclear quip from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Now please turn to Slide 10 to review our estimated financing plan through 2017. As a reminder, in January, we issued approximately $14 million in equity through our 401(k) and DRIP plans before turning the plans off to new shares. By acquiring shares on the open market to satisfy the needs of these plans, we can further utilize the cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017, and currently expect we can satisfy future needs without follow-on offerings. While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur exactly as presented, as they are subject to changes in funding needs for the planned project expenses, and we continue to adjust the financing to match the related CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
Finally, on Slide 11, we are reaffirming our GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.80 per share, along with our internal target of $3.70 per share. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized average annual growth guidance remains unchanged, as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the next 3 to 5 years using a base of 2014's GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized EPS of $3.58 per share. 
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I'd like to begin by discussing the petition that SCE&G filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on March 12. The petition is seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule as well",1091,"Thanks, Jimmy. Please turn to Slide 12. I'd like to begin by discussing the petition that SCE&G filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on March 12. The petition is seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule as well as the capital cost schedule for the 2 new nuclear units. The construction schedule, without consideration of all mitigating strategies, includes a substantial completion date of June of 2019 for Unit 2 and June of 2020 for Unit 3. The new capital cost schedule includes incremental capital costs that total $698 million, of which $539 million are associated with the delay and other contested costs. As previously noted, negotiations continue with the Consortium and neither SCE&G nor Santee Cooper has accepted responsibility for any contested and/or delayed associated costs. Further, we cannot predict when these negotiations will be resolved. 
I'd now like to discuss some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 13 presents an aerial photo of the site from last December. Here, you can see the layout of the site. I've labeled both Units 2 and 3, as well as many other areas that make up the construction tabletop. The site changes daily. And for those of you that have been tracking the project for some time, you can see that progress continues to take place. 
On Slide 14, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture, you can see module CA20, along with the containment vessel Ring 1, which has been placed on the containment vessel lower bowl. Also visible in this photo are the personnel and equipment hatches, which are located in the first Ring section. Work continues on the containment vessel, prepared for placement of CA-01, which we will discuss shortly. Progress continues on achieving what we term Elevation 100, as auxiliary building walls are being built up. Once Elevation 100 has been reached, work will begin on the annex building, which will house the electrical switch gear for the plant, as well as placing of the shield building panels. 
Slide 15 presents a schematic of the large structural modules that will be located inside the containment vessel. And here you can see the locations of modules CA-01, 02, 03 and 05, which we will further discuss shortly. 
Slide 16 has another schematic view of the modules inside of the containment vessel. This exploded view of CA-01 through 05 gives you a better feel of how they fit spatially inside the containment vessel. 
Slide 17 shows a recent picture of Unit 2 module CA-01. CA-01 houses the steam generators, the pressurizer and forms a refueling canal inside the containment vessel. On the right-hand side of the photo, you can see an arc flash from the automatic process that's seam welding the submodules together. The seam welding on all submodules in preparation for lifting has been completed in the Module Assembly Building, or MAB. Once support concrete has been placed and cured, the CA-01 module will be moved outside of the MAB, rigged to the heavy-lift derrick and set in the Unit 2 containment vessel. After the placement of CA-01 for Unit 2, the next module to be placed will be module CA-02. 
Slide 18 shows a picture of CA-02 as it is currently being fabricated. We now have all 5 submodules on site, with 3 standing upright for assembly in the MAB. Module CA-02 has a wall section that forms part of the incontainment refueling water storage tank located inside the containment vessel. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island. The containment vessel lower bowl has been placed and the axillary building walls continue to take form. 
On the left side of Slide 20, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 turbine building, and I've added an arrow showing where the construction is taking place for the turbine pedestal. On the right, you can see a picture from the top of the turbine building of the turbine pedestal. The turbine pedestal will be concrete, 10 feet thick, and will support the Unit 2 turbine when completed. 
Slide 21 shows some of the shield building panels that have arrived on site for Unit 2. The shield building surrounds the containment vessel. These panels will be welded together, and concrete will be poured inside the panels to create a shield building. On the left, you can see one of these panels up close. On the right, you can see the laydown yard where we have been receiving these panels. We currently have received about 60 of the 167 Unit 2 panels that were manufactured by Newport News Industries. 
On Slide 22, you can see where we have begun assembly of the shield building panels. Once joined and welded together, panel sections will be placed starting at Elevation 100. 
On Slide 23, you'll see the new nuclear CapEx, actual and projected, over the life of the construction. This chart reflects our company's current actual and estimated new nuclear CapEx during the years 2008 to 2020, reflecting the petition filed March 12 with the Public Service Commission. As you can see, the next several years are the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related actual and projected customer rate increases under the BLRA and is associated with the right-hand axis. 
Please now turn to Slide 24. We have 2 BLRA filings coming up in May. In mid-May, we will file a quarterly status update with the Public Service Commission. And as mentioned earlier, on May 29, we will make our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA. 
Finally, please turn to Slide 25 to briefly discuss our solar initiative in South Carolina. Our customers and other South Carolina stakeholders had expressed a desire for solar energy, and we've been looking for ways to economically integrate additional solar into our generation portfolio. As a part of the distributed energy resource program, which was filed with the Public Service Commission in February, SCE&G plans to add approximately 95 megawatts of renewable energy by the end of 2020. In 2015, we plan to install approximately 10 megawatts of solar generation to our system. As you can see from the slide, the first 2 solar farms will be a 3.8-megawatt solar farm in Cayce, South Carolina, adjacent to our corporate headquarters, and a 500-kilowatt solar farm that will be constructed in North Charleston, South Carolina. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

And so at the end of the heating season, at the end of the first quarter, of course, the numbers that we disclosed there for the gas business, we're at 12.31%. But once they settle out that and make their pro forma adjustments, the Office of Regulatory Staff will review it.

I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2015 were $2.80 per share compared to $1.37 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The improved results in the firs",1367,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2015 were $2.80 per share compared to $1.37 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The improved results in the first quarter are mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI and higher electric margins, due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth. Also, O&M presented a favorable variance, which is primarily attributable to CGT only operating as part of the SCANA family for one month. These were partially offset by lower electric margins due to weather, lower gas margins and expected increases in CapEx-related items, including interest, property taxes and share dilution. Note that even though weather had a negative impact on earnings year-over-year, it was still abnormally cold and earnings increased by $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $0.10 per share in the first quarter of 2014. 
Slide 4 shows earnings on a GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the first quarter of 2015 were $1.34 per share compared to $1.27 per share in the same quarter of 2014. This excludes the impact of abnormal weather and the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI in the first quarter of 2015 of $1.41 per share. 
Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's first quarter 2015 earnings were relatively flat when compared to the same quarter of 2014. However, exclusive of the previously mentioned impacts of weather, earnings per share were up $0.05 in the first quarter of 2015 over the first quarter of 2014. Increases in earnings were due primarily to the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA, customer growth and a decrease in operation and maintenance expenses. These items were offset by a decrease in gas margins as well as increases in expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense, property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. PSNC Energy's earnings were $0.24 per share for the first quarter of 2015, consistent with the prior year. SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, showed an increase in first quarter earnings of $0.03 per share in 2015 over last year. This improvement was primarily attributable to increased margins. On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported earnings of $1.48 per share in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $0.08 per share in the prior year. Excluding the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP-adjusted EPS was down $0.01 over the prior year. This is mainly attributable to lower interest expense at the holding company being more than offset by the foregone earnings contribution from the subsidiaries that were sold. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. We continue to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. So far, in 2015, companies have announced plans to invest over $600 million with the expectation of creating over 1,600 jobs in our Carolinas territories. Most significantly, Mercedes-Benz announced plans last month to invest about $500 million to build a new commercial van assembly plant in Charleston, creating approximately 1,300 jobs. South Carolina continues to be seen as a favorable place to start and/or expand existing businesses. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now 6.7%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 5.6%. While the South Carolina unemployment rate has slightly increased over the past few quarters, March marked the 64th consecutive month of employment growth and the 14th consecutive month of labor force expansion, as the number of people entering the workforce is at an all-time high. Approximately 50,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. 
Slide 7 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide are the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at 2.6% and 2.9%, respectively. Of particular note is the fact that all of these rates accelerated over rates a year ago. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended March 31, 2015. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were flat on a 12-month-ended basis. We continue to see slightly lower weather-normalized consumption at the residential level, reflecting anticipated energy efficiencies, which is offset by increases in industrial demand. 
Now please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $8.9 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended March 31 in the base electric business is approximately 9.6%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. 
Continuing down the page. On our new nuclear business, we are allowed an 11% return on equity. Last year, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved our 2014 request for revised rates under the BLRA, which add an incremental quip of approximately $561 million to our rate base and increased rates by approximately 2.8% in November. As Steve will discuss shortly, we will be filing our new revised request for rates in May. Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina, respectively. And we continue to operate these businesses within a reasonable range of those returns. 
Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reflected in the petition filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on March 12, 2015. At the bottom of the slide, we recap the new nuclear quip from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Now please turn to Slide 10 to review our estimated financing plan through 2017. As a reminder, in January, we issued approximately $14 million in equity through our 401(k) and DRIP plans before turning the plans off to new shares. By acquiring shares on the open market to satisfy the needs of these plans, we can further utilize the cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017, and currently expect we can satisfy future needs without follow-on offerings. While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur exactly as presented, as they are subject to changes in funding needs for the planned project expenses, and we continue to adjust the financing to match the related CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
Finally, on Slide 11, we are reaffirming our GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.80 per share, along with our internal target of $3.70 per share. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized average annual growth guidance remains unchanged, as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the next 3 to 5 years using a base of 2014's GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized EPS of $3.58 per share. 
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I'd like to begin by discussing the petition that SCE&G filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on March 12. The petition is seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule as well as the capital cost schedule for the 2 new nuclear units. The construction schedule, without consideration of all mitigating strategies, includes a substantial completion date of June of 2019 for Unit 2 and June of 2020 for Unit 3. The new capital cost schedule includes incremental capital costs that total $698 million, of which $539 million are associated with the delay and other contested costs. As previously noted, negotiations continue with the Consortium and neither SCE&G nor Santee Cooper has accepted responsibility for any contested and/or delayed associated costs. Further, we cannot predict when these negotiations will be resolved. 
I'd now like to discuss some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 13 presents an aerial photo of the site from last December. Here, you can see the layout of the site. I've labeled both Units 2 and 3 as well as many other areas that make up the construction tabletop. The site changes daily. And for those of you that have been tracking the project for some time, you can see that progress continues to take place. 
On Slide 14, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture, you can see module CA20, along with the containment vessel Ring 1, which has been placed on the containment vessel lower bowl. Also visible in this photo are the personnel and equipment hatches, which are located in the first Ring section. Work continues on the containment vessel, prepared for placement of CA-01, which we will discuss shortly. Progress continues on achieving what we term Elevation 100, as auxiliary building walls are being built up. Once Elevation 100 has been reached, work will begin on the annex building, which will house the electrical switch gear for the plant as well as placing of the shield building panels. 
Slide 15 presents a schematic of the large structural modules that will be located inside the containment vessel. And here you can see the locations of modules CA-01, 02, 03 and 05, which we will further discuss shortly. 
Slide 16 has another schematic view of the modules inside of the containment vessel. This exploded view of CA-01 through 05 gives you a better feel of how they fit spatially inside the containment vessel. 
Slide 17 shows a recent picture of Unit 2 module CA-01. CA-01 houses the steam generators, the pressurizer and forms a refueling canal inside the containment vessel. On the right-hand side of the photo, you can see an arc flash from the automatic process that's seam welding the submodules together. The seam welding on all submodules in preparation for lifting has been completed in the Module Assembly Building, or MAB. Once support concrete has been placed and cured, the CA-01 module will be moved outside of the MAB, rigged to the heavy-lift derrick and set in the Unit 2 containment vessel. After the placement of CA-01 for Unit 2, the next module to be placed will be module CA-02. 
Slide 18 shows a picture of CA-02 as it is currently being fabricated. We now have all 5 submodules on site, with 3 standing upright for assembly in the MAB. Module CA-02 has a wall section that forms part of the in containment refueling water storage tank located inside the containment vessel. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island. The containment vessel lower bowl has been placed and the axillary building walls continue to take form. 
On the left side of Slide 20, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 turbine building, and I've added an arrow showing where the construction is taking place for the turbine pedestal. On the right, you can see a picture from the top of the turbine building of the turbine pedestal. The turbine pedestal will be concrete, 10 feet thick, and will support the Unit 2 turbine when completed. 
Slide 21 shows some of the shield building panels that have arrived on site for Unit 2. The shield building surrounds the containment vessel. These panels will be welded together, and concrete will be poured inside the panels to create a shield building. On the left, you can see one of these panels up close. On the right, you can see the laydown yard where we have been receiving these panels. We currently have received about 60 of the 167 Unit 2 panels that were manufactured by Newport News Industries. 
On Slide 22, you can see where we have begun assembly of the shield building panels. Once joined and welded together, panel sections will be placed starting at Elevation 100. 
On Slide 23, you'll see the new nuclear CapEx, actual and projected, over the life of the construction. This chart reflects our company's current actual and estimated new nuclear CapEx during the years 2008 to 2020, reflecting the petition filed March 12 with the Public Service Commission. As you can see, the next several years are the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related actual and projected customer rate increases under the BLRA and is associated with the right-hand axis. 
Please now turn to Slide 24. We have 2 BLRA filings coming up in May. In mid-May, we will file a quarterly status update with the Public Service Commission. And as mentioned earlier, on May 29, we will make our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA. 
Finally, please turn to Slide 25 to briefly discuss our solar initiative in South Carolina. Our customers and other South Carolina stakeholders had expressed a desire for solar energy, and we've been looking for ways to economically integrate additional solar into our generation portfolio. As a part of the distributed energy resource program, which was filed with the Public Service Commission in February, SCE&G plans to add approximately 95 megawatts of renewable energy by the end of 2020. In 2015, we plan to install approximately 10 megawatts of solar generation to our system. As you can see from the slide, the first 2 solar farms will be a 3.8-megawatt solar farm in Cayce, South Carolina, adjacent to our corporate headquarters, and a 500-kilowatt solar farm that will be constructed in North Charleston, South Carolina. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

So that's what our goals are from between now and about 2020. And what we've outlined here are the first of the projects that we have planned. Now whether we own those upfront or not will be a question. And right now, we're not thinking that we will own those necessarily upfront. Other entities can take advantage of things like tax credits that we are not able to take advantage of. I think eventually we will probably own them. We also have about 300-or-so customers on our system right now with solar, all relatively small commercial and residential scale, in addition to about a 2.3-megawatt facility we have down at Boeing.

It's a matter of juggling everything we have to juggle and running the operating company at reasonable equity levels that the regulators will endorse. So there's only so much we can do with that. And the real strain on the metrics is the longer -- although the BLRA is a very effective mechanism, all it allows us to do is recover the financing costs during a construction period. We're not covering the actual construction cost of the plants until they start depreciation. That's when we get that -- the recovery of the actual cost of the plant. So the longer that period is drawn out with increased cost of the plant, it's going to put more pressure on the cash flow ratios. So I wouldn't say we don't think it's important.

GAAP earnings in the second quarter of 2015 were $0.69 per share compared to a $0.68 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The improved results in the second quarter are mainly attributable to higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth. These were partially offset by lower gas margins, primarily due to lost gas margins of $0.06 per share resulting from the sale of CGT and expected increases in CapEx-related items including interest and share dilution. Note that even though weather had no impact on earnings quarter-over-quarter, abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.06 per share in the second quarter of both 2014 and 2015. 
Please turn to Slide 4. Earnings per share for the 6 months ended June 30, 2015, were $3.49 per share versus $2.05 in 2014. The improved results were mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI, and higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth. Also, O&M presented a favorable variance, which is primarily attributable to CGT only operating as part of the SCANA family for 1 month. These were partially offset by lower electric margins due to weather in the first quarter, lower gas margins primarily attributable to $0.09 per share from the sale of CGT and expected increases in CapEx-related items, including depreciation, interest property taxes and share dilution. Although electric margins reflected a negative $0.05 per share due to weather year-over-year, abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.11 per share year-to-date 2015 compared to $0.16 per share in 2014. 
Slide 5 shows earnings on a GAAP adjusted weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the second quarter of 2015 were $0.63 per share compared to $0.62 per share in the same quarter of 2014. Year-to-date June earnings were $1.97 per share in 2015 compared to $1.89 per share from the prior year. As a reminder, GAAP adjusted weather normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins and the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI from the first quarter of 2015. 
Now on Slide 6. I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company second quarter 2015 earnings were up $0.07 compared to the same period of 2014. Increases in earnings were due primarily to the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA and customer growth. These items were offset by increases in expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense, property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. Year-to-date, earnings were also higher by $0.07 due primarily to the same drivers. PSNC introduced earnings for the second quarter of 2015 decreased $0.01 per share over the second quarter of 2014, primarily due to increased O&M and depreciation. For the 6-month period ended June 30, earnings were also down $0.01 per share. 
SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, showed a decrease in second quarter earnings of $0.02 per share in 2015 over last year. This was primarily attributable to lower margins resulting from lower sales volumes during the month of April, which was warmer than in 2014. Year-to-date earnings were $0.15 per share compared to $0.13 per share in the prior year. 
Additionally, I'm pleased to report that SCANA Energy has been improved to serve as the regulated provider for the State of Georgia through August, 2017. SCANA Energy has served as a regulated providers since the program's inception in 2002. On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.04 per share in the second quarter of 2015 compared to a loss of $0.01 per share in the prior year. This is mainly attributable to foregone earnings contributions from the subsidiaries that were sold during the first quarter of this year. For the 6-month periods, these businesses reported earnings per share of $1.44 in 2015 compared to $0.08 in 2014. Excluding the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP-adjusted EPS was down $0.05 from the prior year. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 7. So far in 2015, companies have announced plans to invest approximately $750 million with the expectation of creating over 1,800 jobs in our Carolinas territories. This growth reinforces that the Carolinas continued to be seen as a favorable business environment. At a bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE in the electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 6.6% and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 6.1%. Approximately 60,000 more South Carolina are working today than a year ago. 
Slide 8 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see accelerating customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric business added customers had a year-over-year rate of 1.6%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at 2.7% and 3%, respectively. This is the first time any of our businesses have hit 3% growth since 2008. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2015. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were up 1.1% on a 12-month ended basis. We continue to see slightly lower weather-normalized consumption at the residential level reflecting anticipated energy efficiencies, which is offset by increases in industrial demand. The residential consumption decline has been slightly more moderate than we anticipated but we expect the peak summer months to continue the trend. 
Now please turn to Slide 9, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9 billion. As noted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see that as SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended June 30 in the base electric business is approximately 9.5% meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. 
We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. Continuing down the page, on our new nuclear business, we're allowed an 11% return on equity. I wanted to briefly mention that under the terms of our recently announced settlement agreement, if approved by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, the allowed ROE for the new nuclear business will drop to 10.5% for all prospect of request for advice rates under the BLRA beginning in 2016. We have had net incremental CWIP over the last year of approximately $547 million ad Steve will discuss shortly, we filed our 2015 request for revised rates back in May. 
Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well, and we're allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina, respectively, and we continue to operate these businesses within a reasonable range of those returns. 
Slide 10 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reflected in the recently filed annual request for revised rates with the Public Service Commission in South Carolina in May. At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods, on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Now please turn to Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2017. This plan is the same as was presented last quarter. On May 19 for this year, SCE&G issued $500 million of 50-year bonds at 5.1%. Also in January, we issued approximately $14 million in equity through our 401(k) and DRIP plans before turning out the plans to new shares. By acquiring shares on the open market to satisfy the needs of these plans, we can further utilize the cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017. 
While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur exactly as presented as they are subject to changes in funding needs for planned project expenses, and we continue to adjust the financing to match the related CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
Finally, on Slide 12, we are reaffirming our GAAP-adjusted weather normalized earnings guidance of these dollar $3.60 to $3.80 per share, along with our internal target of $3.70 per share. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized average annual growth guidance remains unchanged, as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the next 3 to 5 years using a base of 2014's GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized EPS of $3.58. As a reminder, our projected effective tax rate for 2015, exclusive of the taxes on the gains on the sales of the subsidiaries remains approximately 31%. I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I would like to begin by again touching base on the petition that SCE&G filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on March 12 this year that is seeking approval to update the construction milestone",1134,"Thanks, Jimmy. Please turn to Slide 13. I would like to begin by again touching base on the petition that SCE&G filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on March 12 this year that is seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule, as well as the capital cost schedule for the 2 new nuclear units. The construction schedule, without consideration of all mitigating strategies, includes a substantial completion date of June of 2019 for Unit 2 and June of 2020 for Unit 3. The new capital cost schedule includes incremental capital costs that total $698 million, of which $539 million are associated with the delay and other contested costs. Negotiations continue with the Consortium and neither SCE&G nor Santee Cooper has accepted responsibility for any contested and/or delayed associated costs. Further, we cannot predict when these negotiations will be resolved. 
Our hearing with the Public Service Commission took place last week, on July 21 and 22. This year, was the only active intervenor in the hearing and SCE&G and the Office of Regulatory Staff or ORS were the only parties that presented witness testimony. The ORS, one of the parties who entered into a settlement agreement with the SCE&G, also presented the terms be at the hearing. A decision by the PSE will come no later than September 12. We are hopeful the PSE will approve the settlement agreement we entered into with ORS and the South Carolina Energy Users Committee related to the aforementioned position. The settlement agreement signifies that no contested issues exists settling parties and supports the approval of the revised construction and capital cost schedules. As Jimmy has already mentioned, the settling parties also agreed to revise the allowed return on equity to 10.5% from 11% for calculating prospective revised rates sought under the BLRA on our after January 1 of 2016. 
I'd now like to discuss some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 14 presents an aerial photo of the site from March. This photo gives you a view of the layout of the site and units 2 and 3, as well as many other areas that make up the construction tabletop. 
On Slide 15 you can see an aerial photo from a different perspective. The same will shows a couple of the parking lots for the construction staff of the new units. And currently, there are approximately 3,500 workers at the site. I would like to mention also that we're having great success of having the permanent staff for the new units. We've already hired almost 600 of the anticipated 800 full-time positions that will be needed when the units are online. 
On Slide 16, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture, you can see module CA-20, along with containment vessel ring 1 which has been placed on the lower bowl. We continue to make progress with the fabrication in placement on containment vessel structural modules. 
Slide 17 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural modules that are located inside of the containment vessel. This exploded view of CA-01 through 05 gives you a better feel for how they fit spatially inside containment vessel. 
Slide 18 shows the lift in placement of the Unit 2 module CA-01, which took place on July 23. The 2.4 million pound CA-01 houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms are filling for now inside the containment vessel. This module is the heaviest lift that will occur during the nuclear construction project. On the top left, you can see where one of the Module Assembly Building or MAB walls was removed in order to move the module outside for rigging to the [indiscernible]. CA-01 was then lifted and placed into the Unit 2 containment vessel. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of CA-02, which will be the next structural module placed in the Unit 2 containment vessel. All 5 sub-modules have been assembled in the MAB and CA-02 is now structurally complete. Module CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling storage tank. Fabrication is nearing completion and the containment vessel rings for both units. 
On Slide 20, you can see the fabrication of the Unit 2 containment vessel top head. Once all 3 containment vessel rings have been placed for Unit 2, disclosure head will be placed on top to seal the containment vessel. 
Slide 21 shows a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island. The containment vessel lower bowl has been placed and the building walls continue to take form. 
Slide 22 shows the June 29th lift in placement of the Unit 3 module CA-04 into the containment vessel lower bowl. Module CA-04 has a reactive vessel cavity that will house the reactor. 
Please turn to Slide 23. One day prior to placement of CA-04, the Unit 3 reactor vessel was received on site. The Unit 3 reactor vessel arrived in the Port of Charleston on June 26 and was transported over the next 2 days via rail on a specially designed railcar due to the excessive weight of the component. Once the Unit 3 CA-04 is fully encased in concrete, this reactor vessel, which houses the fuel assemblies will be lowered into it and mounted on top. 
Slide 24 shows the placement of the first Unit 2 shield building panels. 6 of the panels, each weighing approximately 30,000 pounds and spanning 40 feet, were lifted and placed outside of the containment vessel earlier this month. As the shield building plans are placed and welded together, concrete will poured inside of the pounds to create the shield building. 
On Slide 25, you will see the new nuclear CapEx actual and projected over the life of construction. This chart reflects our company's current actual and estimated new nuclear CapEx during the years 2008 to 2020. It's reflected in the annual request for revised rates with the Public Service Commission. 
As you can see, this year and the next several years of the peak nuclear construction period, the green line represents the related actual and projected customer rate increases under the BLRA and is associated with the right-hand axis. Please now turn to Slide 26. As you can see, we filed our BLRA quarterly status update for the first quarter of 2015 in May, as well as our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA. The Regulatory Staff has completed their review of our request and is recommending to the commission a $64.5 million revenue increase or a rate increase of about 2.6%. We concur with their recommendation and anticipate the requested increase in rates effective for bills rendered on or after October 30. That concludes our prepared marks. I'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

Now we're not always completely successful and in this case, the Office of Regulatory Staff, ourselves and one of the intervenors, which is the Energy Committee entered into that settlement agreement. There were a couple of intervenors who did not sign on to a settlement agreement. The SEER Club, which actively participated, and then there was 1 other entity that did not actively participated in the hearing which is not unusual. There a lot of people that it of adjusted to get information they don't really participate in the process. So from our perspective, it was very positive that we entered into the agreement and we only had 1 intervenor against this in the hearing process. I think what the intervenors got out of it was that they're concerned with rates and by lowering the ROE, they had a small reduction in rates over the term of the construction process.

I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the second quarter of 2015 were $0.69 per share compared to a $0.68 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The improved results in the s",1592,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the second quarter of 2015 were $0.69 per share compared to a $0.68 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The improved results in the second quarter are mainly attributable to higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth. These were partially offset by lower gas margins, primarily due to loss gas margins of $0.06 per share resulting from the sale of CGT and expected increases in CapEx-related items including interest and share dilution. Note that even though weather had no impact on earnings quarter-over-quarter, abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.06 per share in the second quarter of both 2014 and 2015. 
Please turn to Slide 4. Earnings per share for the 6 months ended June 30, 2015, were $3.49 per share versus $2.05 in 2014. The improved results were mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI, and higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth. Also, O&M presented a favorable variance, which is primarily attributable to CGT only operating as part of the SCANA family for 1 month. These were partially offset by lower electric margins due to weather in the first quarter, lower gas margins primarily attributable to $0.09 per share from the sale of CGT and expected increases in CapEx-related items, including depreciation, interest property taxes and share dilution. Although electric margins reflected a negative $0.05 per share due to weather year-over-year, abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.11 per share year-to-date 2015 compared to $0.16 per share in 2014. 
Slide 5 shows earnings on a GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the second quarter of 2015 were $0.63 per share compared to $0.62 per share in the same quarter of 2014. Year-to-date June earnings were $1.97 per share in 2015 compared to $1.89 per share from the prior year. As a reminder, GAAP adjusted weather normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins and the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI from the first quarter of 2015. 
Now on Slide 6. I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company second quarter 2015 earnings were up $0.07 compared to the same period of 2014. Increases in earnings were due primarily to the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA and customer growth. These items were offset by increases in expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense, property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. Year-to-date, earnings were also higher by $0.07 due primarily to the same drivers. PSNC Energy's earnings for the second quarter of 2015 decreased $0.01 per share over the second quarter of 2014, primarily due to increased O&M and depreciation. For the 6-month period ended June 30, earnings were also down $0.01 per share. 
SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, showed a decrease in second quarter earnings of $0.02 per share in 2015 over last year. This was primarily attributable to lower margins resulting from lower residential sales volumes during the month of April, which was warmer than in 2014. Year-to-date earnings were $0.15 per share compared to $0.13 per share in the prior year. 
Additionally, I'm pleased to report that SCANA Energy has been improved to serve as the regulated provider for the State of Georgia through August, 2017. SCANA Energy has served as a regulated provider since the program's inception in 2002. On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.04 per share in the second quarter of 2015 compared to a loss of $0.01 per share in the prior year. This is mainly attributable to foregone earnings contributions from the subsidiaries that were sold during the first quarter of this year. For the 6-month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $1.44 in 2015 compared to $0.08 in 2014. Excluding the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP-adjusted EPS was down $0.05 from the prior year. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 7. So far in 2015, companies have announced plans to invest approximately $750 million with the expectation of creating over 1,800 jobs in our Carolinas territories. This growth reinforces that the Carolinas continued to be seen as a favorable business environment. At a bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 6.6% and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 6.1%. Approximately 60,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. 
Slide 8 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see accelerating customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.6%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at 2.7% and 3%, respectively. This is the first time any of our businesses have hit 3% growth since 2008. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2015. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were up 1.1% on a 12-month ended basis. We continue to see slightly lower weather-normalized consumption at the residential level reflecting anticipated energy efficiencies, which is offset by increases in industrial demand. The residential consumption decline has been slightly more moderate than we anticipated but we expect the peak summer months to continue the trend. 
Now please turn to Slide 9, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see that SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended June 30 in the base electric business is approximately 9.5% meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. 
We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. Continuing down the page, on our new nuclear business, we're allowed an 11% return on equity. I wanted to briefly mention that under the terms of our recently announced settlement agreement, if approved by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, the allowed ROE for the new nuclear business will drop to 10.5% for all prospective request for revised rates under the BLRA beginning in 2016. We have had net incremental CWIP over the last year of approximately $547 million and as Steve will discuss shortly, we filed our 2015 request for revised rates back in May. 
Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well, and we're allowed a return of equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina, respectively. And we continue to operate these businesses within a reasonable range of those returns. 
Slide 10 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reflected in the recently filed annual request for revised rates with the Public Service Commission in South Carolina in May. At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods, on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Now please turn to Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2017. This plan is the same as was presented last quarter. On May 19 of this year, SCE&G issued $500 million of 50-year bonds at 5.1%. Also in January, we issued approximately $14 million in equity through our 401(k) and DRIP plans before turning off the plans to new shares. By acquiring shares on the open market to satisfy the need of these plans, we can further utilize the cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017. 
While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur exactly as presented as they are subject to changes in funding needs for planned project expenses, and we continue to adjust the financing to match the related CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
Finally, on Slide 12, we are reaffirming our GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.80 per share, along with our internal target of $3.70 per share. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized average annual growth guidance remains unchanged, as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the next 3 to 5 years using a base of 2014's GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized EPS of $3.58. As a reminder, our projected effective tax rate for 2015, exclusive of the taxes on the gains on the sales of the subsidiaries remains approximately 31%. I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I would like to begin by again touching base on the petition that SCE&G filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on March 12 this year, that is seeking approval to update the construction milestone",1150,"Thanks, Jimmy. Please turn to Slide 13. I would like to begin by again touching base on the petition that SCE&G filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on March 12 this year, that is seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule, as well as the capital cost schedule for the 2 new nuclear units. The construction schedule, without consideration of all mitigating strategies, includes a substantial completion date of June of 2019 for Unit 2 and June of 2020 for Unit 3. The new capital cost schedule includes incremental capital costs that total $698 million, of which $539 million are associated with the delay and other contested costs. Negotiations continue with the consortium and neither SCE&G nor Santee Cooper has accepted responsibility for any contested and/or delay associated costs. Further, we cannot predict when these negotiations will be resolved. 
Our hearing with the Public Service Commission took place last week, on July 21 and 22. The Sierra Club was the only active intervenor in the hearing and SCE&G and the Office of Regulatory Staff or ORS were the only parties that presented witness testimony. The ORS, one of the parties who entered into a settlement agreement with SCE&G, also presented the terms of the agreement at the hearing. A decision by the PSC will come no later than September 12. We are hopeful that the PSC will approve the settlement agreement we entered into with ORS and the South Carolina Energy Users Committee related to the aforementioned petition. This settlement agreement signifies that no contested issues exists among the settling parties and supports the approval of the revised construction and capital cost schedules. As Jimmy has already mentioned, the settling parties also agreed to revise the allowed return on equity to 10.5% from 11% for calculating prospective revised rates sought under the BLRA on or after January 1 of 2016. 
I'd now like to discuss some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 14 presents an aerial photo of the site from March. This photo gives you a view of the layout of the site and [ph] of both units 2 and 3, as well as many other areas that make up the construction tabletop. 
On Slide 15 you can see an aerial photo from a different perspective. This angle shows a couple of the parking lots for the construction staff of the new units. And currently, there are approximately 3,500 workers at the site. I would like to mention also that we're having great success of having the permanent staff for the new units. We've already hired almost 600 of the anticipated 800 full-time positions that will be needed when the units are online. 
On Slide 16, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture, you can see module CA20, along with containment vessel ring 1 which has been placed on the lower bowl. We continue to make progress with the fabrication in placement of containment vessel structural modules. 
Slide 17 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural modules that are located inside of the containment vessel. This exploded view of CA-01 through 05 gives you a better feel for how they fit spatially inside the containment vessel. 
Slide 18 shows the lift and placement of the Unit 2 module CA-01, which took place on July 23. The 2.4 million pound CA-01 houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms a refilling canal inside the containment vessel. This module is the heaviest lift that will occur during the nuclear construction project. On the top left, you can see where one of the Module Assembly Building or MAB walls was removed in order to move the module outside for rigging to the heavy lift derrick. CA-01 was then lifted and placed into the Unit 2 containment vessel. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of CA-02, which will be the next structural module placed in the Unit 2 containment vessel. All 5 sub-modules have been assembled in the MAB and CA-02 is now structurally complete. Module CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. Fabrication is nearing completion and the containment vessel rings for both units. 
On Slide 20, you can see the fabrication of the Unit 2 containment vessel top head. Once all 3 containment vessel rings have been placed for Unit 2, this closure head will be placed on top to seal the containment vessel. 
Slide 21 shows a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island. The containment vessel lower bowl has been placed and the auxiliary building walls continue to take form. 
Slide 22 shows the June 29 lift and placement of the Unit 3 module CA-04 into the containment vessel lower bowl. Module CA-04 has a reactive vessel cavity that will house the reactor. 
Please turn to Slide 23. One day prior to the placement of CA-04, the Unit 3 reactor vessel was received on site. The Unit 3 reactor vessel arrived in the Port of Charleston on June 26 and was transported over the next 2 days via rail on a specially designed railcar due to the excessive weight of the component. Once the Unit 3 CA-04 is fully encased in concrete, this reactor vessel, which houses the fuel assemblies will be lowered into it and mounted on top. 
Slide 24 shows the placement of the first Unit 2 shield building panels. 6 of the panels, each weighing approximately 30,000 pounds and spanning 40 feet, were lifted and placed outside of the containment vessel earlier this month. As the shield building panels are placed and welded together, concrete will be poured inside of the panels to create the shield building. 
On Slide 25, you will see the new nuclear CapEx actual and projected over the life of construction. This chart reflects our company's current actual and estimated new nuclear CapEx during the years 2008 to 2020. It's reflected in the annual request for revised rates with the Public Service Commission. 
As you can see, this year and the next several years are the peak nuclear construction period, the green line represents the related actual and projected customer rate increases under the BLRA and is associated with the right-hand axis. Please now turn to Slide 26. As you can see, we filed our BLRA quarterly status update for the first quarter of 2015 in May, as well as our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA. The Office of Regulatory Staff has completed their review of our request and is recommending to the commission a $64.5 million revenue increase or a rate increase of about 2.6%. We concur with their recommendation and anticipate the requested increase in rates effective for bills rendered on or after October 30. That concludes our prepared marks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

Now we're not always completely successful and in this case, the Office of Regulatory Staff, ourselves and one of the intervenors, which is the Energy Users Committee entered into that settlement agreement. There were a couple of intervenors who did not sign on to a settlement agreement. The Sierra Club, which actively participated, and then there was 1 other entity that did not actively participated in the hearing, which is not unusual. There a lot of people that signed on as intervenors just to get information, they don't really participate in the process. So from our perspective, it was very positive that we entered into the agreement and we only had 1 intervenor against us in the hearing process. I think what the intervenors got out of it was that they're concerned with rates and by lowering the ROE, they had a small reduction in rates over the term in the construction process. And it just made a much more positive hearing process than we've had in the past."

I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the second quarter of 2015 were $0.69 per share compared to $0.68 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The improved results in the sec",1589,"Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the second quarter of 2015 were $0.69 per share compared to $0.68 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The improved results in the second quarter are mainly attributable to higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth. These were partially offset by lower gas margins, primarily due to lost gas margins of $0.06 per share resulting from the sale of CGT and expected increases in CapEx-related items including interest and share dilution. Note that even though weather had no impact on earnings quarter-over-quarter, abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.06 per share in the second quarter of both 2014 and 2015. 
Please turn to Slide 4. Earnings per share for the 6 months ended June 30, 2015, were $3.49 per share versus $2.05 in 2014. The improved results are mainly attributable to the net of tax gains from the sales of CGT and SCI, and higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth. Also, O&M presented a favorable variance, which is primarily attributable to CGT only operating as part of the SCANA family for one month. These were partially offset by lower electric margins due to weather in the first quarter, lower gas margins primarily attributable to $0.09 per share from the sale of CGT and expected increases in CapEx-related items, including depreciation, interest, property taxes and share dilution. Although electric margins reflected a negative $0.05 per share due to weather year-over-year, abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.11 per share year-to-date 2015 compared to $0.16 per share in 2014. 
Slide 5 shows earnings on a GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the second quarter of 2015 were $0.63 per share compared to $0.62 per share in the same quarter of 2014. Year-to-date June earnings were $1.97 per share in 2015 compared to $1.89 per share from the prior year. As a reminder, GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins and the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI from the first quarter of 2015. 
Now on Slide 6, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's second quarter 2015 earnings were up $0.07 compared to the same period of 2014. Increases in earnings were due primarily to the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA and customer growth. These items were offset by increases in expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense, property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. Year-to-date, earnings were also higher by $0.07 due primarily to the same drivers. PSNC Energy's earnings for the second quarter of 2015 decreased $0.01 per share over the second quarter of 2014, primarily due to increased O&M and depreciation. For the 6-month period ended June 30, earnings were also down $0.01 per share. 
SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, showed a decrease in second quarter earnings of $0.02 per share in 2015 over last year. This was primarily attributable to lower margins resulting from lower residential sales volumes during the month of April, which was warmer than in 2014. Year-to-date earnings were $0.15 per share compared to $0.13 per share in the prior year. 
Additionally, I'm pleased to report that SCANA Energy has been approved to serve as the regulated provider for the State of Georgia through August, 2017. SCANA Energy has served as a regulated provider since the program's inception in 2002. On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.04 per share in the second quarter of 2015 compared to a loss of $0.01 per share in the prior year. This is mainly attributable to foregone earnings contributions from the subsidiaries that were sold during the first quarter of this year. For the 6-month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $1.44 in 2015 compared to $0.08 in 2014. Excluding the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP-adjusted EPS was down $0.05 from the prior year. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 7. So far in 2015, companies have announced plans to invest approximately $750 million with the expectation of creating over 1,800 jobs in our Carolinas territories. This growth reinforces that the Carolinas continue to be seen as a favorable business environment. At a bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 6.6% and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 6.1%. Approximately 60,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. 
Slide 8 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see accelerating customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.6%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at 2.7% and 3%, respectively. This is the first time any of our businesses have hit 3% growth since 2008. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2015. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were up 1.1% on a 12-month ended basis. We continued to see slightly lower weather-normalized consumption at the residential level reflecting anticipated energy efficiencies, which is offset by increases in industrial demand. The residential consumption decline has been slightly more moderate than we anticipated, but we expect the peak summer months to continue the trend. 
Now please turn to Slide 9, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulator rate base of approximately $9 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see that SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended June 30 in the base electric business is approximately 9.5%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. 
We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. Continuing down the page, on our new nuclear business, we're allowed an 11% return on equity. I wanted to briefly mention that under the terms of our recently announced settlement agreement, if approved by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, the allowed ROE for the new nuclear business will drop to 10.5% for all prospective requests for revised rates under the BLRA beginning in 2016. We have had net incremental CWIP over the last year of approximately $547 million, and as Steve will discuss shortly, we filed our 2015 request for revised rates back in May. 
Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well, and we're allowed a return of equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina, respectively. And we continue to operate these businesses within a reasonable range of those returns. 
Slide 10 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reflected in the recently filed annual request for revised rates with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina in May. At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Now please turn to Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2017. This plan is the same as was presented last quarter. On May 19 of this year, SCE&G issued $500 million of 50-year bonds at 5.1%. Also, in January, we issued approximately $14 million in equity through our 401(k) and DRIP plans before turning off the plans to new shares. By acquiring shares on the open market to satisfy the need of these plans, we can further utilize the cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017. 
While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur exactly as presented as they are subject to changes in funding needs for planned project expenses, and we continue to adjust the financing to match the related CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
Finally, on Slide 12, we are reaffirming our GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.80 per share, along with our internal target of $3.70 per share. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized average annual growth guidance remains unchanged, as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the next 3 to 5 years, using a base of 2014's GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized EPS of $3.58. As a reminder, our projected effective tax rate for 2015, exclusive of the taxes on the gains on the sales of the subsidiaries, remains approximately 31%. I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

Please turn to Slide 13. I would like to begin by again touching base on the petition that SCE&G filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on March 12 of this year that is seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule, as well as the capital cost schedule for the 2 new nuclear units. The construction schedule, without consideration of all mitigating strategies, includes a substantial completion date of June of 2019 for Unit 2 and June of 2020 for Unit 3. The new capital cost schedule includes incremental capital costs that total $698 million, of which $539 million are associated with the delay and other contested costs. Negotiations continue with the consortium, and neither SCE&G nor Santee Cooper has accepted responsibility for any contested and/or delay associated costs. Further, we cannot predict when these negotiations will be resolved. 
Our hearing with the Public Service Commission took place last week, on July 21 and 22. The Sierra Club was the only active intervenor in the hearing, and SCE&G and the Office of Regulatory Staff, or ORS, were the only parties that presented witness testimony. The ORS, one of the parties who entered into a settlement agreement with SCE&G, also presented the terms of the agreement at the hearing. A decision by the PSC will come no later than September 12. We are hopeful that the PSC will approve the settlement agreement we entered into with ORS and the South Carolina Energy Users Committee related to the aforementioned petition. This settlement agreement signifies that no contested issues exist among the settling parties and supports the approval of the revised construction and capital cost schedules. As Jimmy has already mentioned, the settling parties also agree to revise the allowed return on equity to 10.5% from 11% for calculating prospective revised rates sought under the BLRA on or after January 1 of 2016. 
I'd now like to discuss some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 14 presents an aerial photo of the site from March. This photo gives you a view of the layout of the site and of the layout of both units 2 and 3, as well as many other areas that make up the construction tabletop. 
On Slide 15 you can see an aerial photo from a different perspective. This angle shows a couple of the parking lots for the construction staff for the new units. And currently, there are approximately 3,500 workers at the site. I would like to mention also that we are having great success of hiring the permanent staff for the new units. We've already hired almost 600 of the anticipated 800 full-time positions that will be needed when the units are online. 
On Slide 16, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture, you can see module CA20, along with containment vessel ring 1 which has been placed on the lower bowl. We continue to make progress with the fabrication and placement of containment vessel structural modules. 
Slide 17 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural modules that are located inside of the containment vessel. This exploded view of CA-01 through 05 gives you a better feel for how they fit spatially inside said containment vessel. 
Slide 18 shows the lift and placement of the Unit 2 module CA-01, which took place on July 23. The 2.4 million pound CA-01 houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms a refueling canal inside the containment vessel. This module is the heaviest lift that will occur during the nuclear construction project. On the top left, you can see where one of the Module Assembly Building, or MAB, walls was removed in order to move the module outside for rigging to the heavy lift derrick. CA-01 was then lifted and placed into the Unit 2 containment vessel. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of CA-02, which will be the next structural module placed in the Unit 2 containment vessel. All 5 sub-modules have been assembled in the MAB, and CA-02 is now structurally complete. Module CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. Fabrication is nearing completion on the containment vessel rings for both units. 
On Slide 20, you can see the fabrication of the Unit 2 containment vessel top head. Once all 3 containment vessel rings have been placed for Unit 2, this closure head will be placed on top to seal the containment vessel. 
Slide 21 shows a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island. The containment vessel lower bowl has been placed and the auxiliary building walls continue to take form. 
Slide 22 shows the June 29 lift and placement of the Unit 3 module CA-04 into the containment vessel lower bowl. Module CA-04 has a reactive vessel cavity that will house the reactor. 
Please turn to Slide 23. One day prior to the placement of CA-04, the Unit 3 reactor vessel was received on site. The Unit 3 reactor vessel arrived in the Port of Charleston on June 26 and was transported over the next 2 days via rail on a specially designed railcar due to the excessive weight of the component. Once the Unit 3 CA-04 is fully encased in concrete, this reactor vessel, which houses the fuel assemblies, will be lowered into it and mounted on top. 
Slide 24 shows the placement of the first Unit 2 shield building panels. 6 of the panels, each weighing approximately 30,000 pounds and spanning 40 feet, were lifted and placed outside of the containment vessel earlier this month. As the shield building panels are placed and welded together, concrete will be poured inside of the panels to create the shield building. 
On Slide 25, you will see the new nuclear CapEx, actual and projected, over the life of construction. This chart reflects our company's current actual and estimated new nuclear CapEx during the years 2008 to 2020. It's reflected in the annual request for revised rates with the Public Service Commission. 
As you can see, this year and the next several years are the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related actual and projected customer rate increases under the BLRA and is associated with the right-hand axis. 
Please now turn to Slide 26. As you can see, we filed our BLRA quarterly status update for the first quarter of 2015 in May, as well as our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA. The Office of Regulatory Staff has completed their review of our request and is recommending to the Commission a $64.5 million revenue increase, or a rate increase of about 2.6%. We concur with their recommendation and anticipate the requested increase in rates effective for bills rendered on or after October 30. That concludes our prepared marks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

The Office of Regulatory Staff is also encouraged and likes to promote settlement agreements. And so we always try to present a settlement agreement to the Commission whenever we go in for any case. Now we're not always completely successful, and in this case, the Office of Regulatory Staff, ourselves and one of the intervenors, which is the Energy Users Committee, entered into that settlement agreement. There were a couple of intervenors who did not sign on to the settlement agreement. The Sierra Club, which actively participated, and then there was one other entity that did not actively participate in the hearing, which is not unusual. There a lot of people that sign on as intervenors just to get information, they don't really participate in the process. So from our perspective, it was very positive that we entered into the agreement and we only had one intervenor against us in the hearing process. I think what the intervenors got out of it was that they're concerned with rates, and by lowering the ROE, they had a small reduction in rates over the term of the construction process. And it just made it a much more positive hearing process than we've had in the past."

So their pushing on those reactor coolant pumps means that they will not be an issue for us. So they'll be off our critical path.

One of them here at our corporate campus on the order of 4 megawatts. And then we've got about a 500-kilowatt system going to go in down near the Charleston area. We do have a number of requests for interconnection to our system from solar generators. So I would imagine that we will far exceed the 90 megawatts by 2020. They just won't fall under that Act 236."

While our system was restored very quickly, the property damage of the citizens of South Carolina will take a long time to restore. And tragically, several lives were lost and families altered forever. 
Now on Slide 3, we'll begin our earnings discussion. GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 2015 were $1.04 per share compared to $1.01 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The improved results in the third quarter are mainly attributable to higher electric margins due primarily to weather, a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth as well as lower depreciation expense as I will discuss shortly. These were partially offset by lower gas margins, primarily due to lost gas margins of $0.06 per share resulting from the sale of CGT, an increase in O&M expense and expected increases in CapEx-related items included -- including interest and share dilution. 
Note that abnormal weather contributed $0.11 per share and $0.07 per share of additional electric margin in the third quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively. SCE&G periodically conducts depreciation studies related to electric plant to better determine the proper annual depreciation accrual rates. A new depreciation study performed earlier this year resulted in the adoption of depreciation rates, which produced an annual decrease to depreciation expense of approximately $29 million. The PSC authorized SCE&G to implement the new depreciation rates effective January 1, 2015, and at the company's request, the retroactive $14.5 million credit from the application of the new rates from January through June of this year has been used to offset a portion of the deferred fuel ballots related to its retail electric operations. 
For the third quarter of 2015 and all subsequent periods, the incremental reduction to depreciation expense will flow through income. 
Now please turn to Slide 4. Earnings per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2015, were $4.53 versus $3.06 in 2014. The improved results are mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI, higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth as well as lower depreciation expense as described earlier. These were partially offset by lower electric margins due to weather from the first quarter; lower gas margins, primarily due to lost gas margins of $0.15 per share resulting from the sale of CGT; an increase in O&M expense; and expected increases in CapEx-related items, including interest, property taxes and share dilution. 
Although electric margins reflected a negative $0.01 per share due to weather year-over-year, abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.22 per share year-to-date 2015 compared to $0.23 per share in 2014. 
Slide 5 shows earnings on a GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the third quarter of 2015 were $0.93 per share compared to $0.94 per share in the same quarter of 2014. Year-to-date September, earnings were $2.90 per share in 2015 compared to $2.83 per share in the prior year. 
As a reminder, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins and the net of tax gains on the sale of CGT and SCI from the first quarter of 2015. Based upon our results today and our expectations for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our 2015 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.80 per share. 
Now on Slide 6, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's third quarter 2015 earnings were up $0.06 compared to the same period of 2014. Increases in earnings were due primarily to weather, the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA and customer growth. The application of the previously mentioned new depreciation rates also positively contribute to earnings for the quarter. These items were offset by increases in O&M expenses and expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense and share dilution. 
Year-to-date earnings were higher by $0.13, due primarily to the same drivers as the quarter with the exception of weather. 
PSNC Energy reported a seasonal loss of $0.04 per share in the third quarter of 2015 compared to a loss of $0.02 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to increased O&M, depreciation and property taxes, partially offset by customer growth. Year-to-date 2015 earnings are $0.21 per share compared to $0.23 per share in the prior year. 
SCANA Energy, our retail and natural gas marketing business in Georgia, showed a decrease in third quarter earnings of $0.01 per share in 2015 over the same quarter of last year, primarily due to increased O&M. For the 9-month period ended September 30, earnings were up $0.01 per share. 
On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2015, consistent with the prior year. Lower interest expense at the holding company and increased margins in our marketing business were primarily offset by foregone earnings, contributions from the subsidiaries that were sold during the first quarter of this year. 
For the 9-month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $1.37 in 2015 compared to $0.02 in 2014. Excluding the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS was down $0.06 from the prior year, again due to foregone earnings from the sale of the businesses earlier this year. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 7. So far in 2015, companies have announced plans to invest over $1 billion with the expectation of creating over 3,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories. We're excited by the continuous growth in our service territories as the Carolinas continue to be seen as a favorable business environment. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.7%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 5.3%. Of particular interest and a testament to our state's strong economic growth, approximately 80,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. 
Slide 8 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.6%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at an accelerated rate of 2.8% and 3.1%, respectively. We continue to see very strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. 
The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales for the 12 months ended September 30, 2015. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were up 1.7% on a 12-month ended basis. 
We continue to be encouraged by the strong industrial expansion that has, in turn, led to strong sales growth, not only in the industrial sector but also in the residential and commercial markets. 
Now please turn to Slide 9, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.5 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended September 30 in the base electric business is approximately 9.7%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA related base increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. 
Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% and 10.6% in South and North Carolina, respectively. 
Slide 10 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast has been updated to reflect our most current CapEx projections for 2016 and '17 and is now inclusive of our 2018 estimates. This forecast also reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018, including an estimate of the impact of the settlement with the Consortium, which Kevin will address later. 
At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods of which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Now please turn to Slide 11 to review our updated estimated financing plan through 2018. As a reminder, on May 19 of this year, SCE&G issued $500 million of 50-year bonds at 5.1%. Also in January, we issued approximately $14 million in equity through our 401(k) and DRIP plan before turning off the plans to new shares. 
By acquiring shares on the open market to satisfy the needs of these plans, we can further utilize the cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017, and we'll turn back on the 401(k) and DRIP plans to satisfy those needs. 
On the debt side and based upon cash flows and planned construction payments to date, we have deferred $325 million of Q4 planned debt issuances and accelerated some issuances from the out-years to better align with our expected funding needs. This plan also anticipates a debt to be issued at PSNC to fund its anticipated CapEx spending. 
While these are our best estimates with incremental debt and equity issuances, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur exactly as presented as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses, and we continue to adjust the financing to match the related CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
Now I'd like to discuss our 2016 earnings guidance and related assumptions as shown on Slide 12. Our 2016 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized preliminary earnings guidance is $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share, and our internal target is $4 per share. 
Due to the cyclical nature of our business, we expect to earn approximately 30% of this amount in the first quarter, approximately 25% in each of the third and fourth quarters and the remaining 20% in the second quarter. In computing this guidance range, we have included the impact of a base rate increase from our new nuclear filing under the BLRA, the accretive impact of the sales of CGT and SCI and our view of the economy. This guidance also incorporates CapEx and financing plans we presented earlier. 
We forecast electric customer growth to be at approximately 1.5%, offsetting our assumption that customer average use of electricity will be slightly lower in 2016. We anticipate overall weather-normalized retail electric sales growth for 2016 to decline by approximately 0.2%. 
We expect operating and maintenance expenses to be approximately 2% higher in 2016 than where we project to finish for the end of 2015. We also expect continued growth in the CapEx-related costs of property taxes, depreciation and interests. 
For the remainder of 2015, exclusive of the taxes on the gains on the sales of the subsidiaries and looking out into 2016, we project an effective tax rate of approximately 32%. We continue to be cautiously optimistic about our long-term view and are reaffirming GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized average annual growth guidance as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the 3 to 5 years using a base of 2014's GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.58 per share. Hopefully, this will provide you with some clarity of our view of 2016 as you update your models. 
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I'd like to begin by addressing the impact that the recent rainfall and flooding in South Carolina had on the new nuclear construction project. 
As you probably already seen on our website, we estimate that this weather event resulted in a loss of about 4 days of work effort. I wanted to clarify that the construction schedule has a contingency for weather delays and other events, so the missed days should not impact planned in-service days for the new units. We have had very little weather impact to date, which is why this event should not have an impact on the project. 
Please turn to Slide 13. I'd now like to address the Public Service Commission of South Carolina's unanimous approval of the petition SCE&G filed in March of this year, seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule as well as the capital cost schedule for the 2 new nuclear units. 
The approval of the petition, along with the settlement agreement entered into with the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff and the South Carolina Energy Users Committee, adjusted the commission approved substantial completion dates to June of 2019 for Unit 2 and June of 2020 for Unit 3. This agreement also allowed for the inclusion of incremental capital costs that totaled $698 million and revised the allowed return on equity to 10.5% from 11% for calculating perspective revised rates under the BLRA on or after January 1, 2016. 
Moving on to some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site, Slide 14 presents an aerial photo of the site from June. This photo gives you a view of the layout of the site, and I've labeled both units 2 and 3 as well as many of the areas that make up what we call the construction tabletop. 
On Slide 15, you can see picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture, you can see module CA20 on the left side of the slide along with the containment vessel of first ring, which has been placed on and welded to the lower bowl. If you look through the personnel and equipment hatch openings in the containment vessel ring, you can see superstructure module CA-01, which as you'll recall was placed back in July. We continue to make progress with the fabrication and placement of containment vessel structural modules. 
Slide 16 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. This exploded view of CA-01 through 05 gives you a better feel for how they fit spatially inside the containment vessel. As you may know, we have now placed CA-01, CA-04 and CA-05 for Unit 2. 
Slide 17 shows a picture of CA-02, which will be the next structural module placed in the Unit 2 containment vessel. Module CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. As you see here, all 5 submodules have been assembled, and CA-02 is now structurally complete and has been moved outside of the module assembly building or MAB. This module is scheduled to be placed sometime in the first half of 2016. 
Slide 18 shows a picture of CA-03, which is the west wall of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. 4 of CA-03's 17 submodules were on site, and 3 have been fabricated in the MAB. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 3 Nuclear Island. Module CA-04 was placed inside the containment vessel lower bowl back in June, and the auxilliary building walls, as you can see, continue to take form. 
Slide 20 shows an aerial view of the low-profile cooling towers from June. Three of the 4 cooling towers are now structurally complete with the fourth, 2 Bravo shown on this slide -- sorry as shown on Slide 21 being about 50% complete. 
Please now turn to Slide 22. Here you can see the placement of the concrete foundation for the Unit 2 turbine building first bay. This 6-foot thick basement took 27 hours to pour and consisted of 2,100 cubic yards of concrete. This first bay is a transition from the building to the turbine building. 
Slide 23 shows the completed Unit 2 transformer base. These transformer base are constructed with reinforcing bar in concrete and serve as a firewall partially enclosing the transformers. These 9 transformer base in Unit 2 were completed during August. 
Components continue to arrive on site. On Slide 24, you can see some pictures of the Unit 3 pressurizer arriving in the Port of Charleston. It was in transfer via rail car to the site. Pressurizer will be housed in the containment vessel and will be used to control the pressure in the reactor coolant system. 
Please now turn to Slide 25. As we mentioned during our second quarter call, we filed our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA in May. In response to the request in September, the PSC approved an increase of $64.5 million. The new rates are effective for bills rendered on or after October 30. Our BLRA filings for 2015 are shown on the bottom of the slide, and as you can see in August, we filed our quarterly status report on our new nuclear project with the commission and the Office of Regulatory Staff for the second quarter of 2015. We intend to file our quarterly status report for the third quarter in November. 
I will now turn the call over to Kevin."

I'm glad to be with you today to provide some details in connection with our amendment to the EPC agreement for the new AP1000 units at the V.C. Summer site we announced earlier this week. A number of the key points are summarized on Slid",856,"Thanks, Steve. I'm glad to be with you today to provide some details in connection with our amendment to the EPC agreement for the new AP1000 units at the V.C. Summer site we announced earlier this week. 
A number of the key points are summarized on Slide 26. As you know, these plants were being constructed under an EPC agreement with the consortium of Westinghouse and Chicago Bridge and Iron subsidiaries, Stone & Webster. Westinghouse has announced that it intends to acquire Stone & Webster from CBNI. Following that acquisition, Stone & Webster will continue to be a party to the EPC agreement but as a subsidiary of Westinghouse instead of CBNI. The amendment to the EPC agreement allows CBNI to exit its guarantee obligation to the project. 
The obligations under the EPC agreement are joint and several obligations of Westinghouse and Stone & Webster and the October 2015 amendment provides for Toshiba Corporation, the parent company of Westinghouse, to reaffirm its guarantee of the Westinghouse payment obligation. 
In exchange for the release of the CB&I guarantee, the amendment of the EPC contract and an option to fix project costs, SCE&G, Santee Cooper and Westinghouse have agreed to a full resolution and settlement of substantially all known claims and disputes outstanding under the EPC agreement. Under this amendment, SCE&G has agreed to pay Westinghouse incremental capital costs of approximately $245 million over the $5.247 billion approved in the Public Service Commission's recent order #2015-661. This, along with estimated escalation and AFUDC, would bring the total gross construction cost of the project to approximately $7.113 billion. 
The amendment also revises the guaranteed substantial completion dates of Units 2 and 3 to August 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. SCE&G share of liquidated damages would increase from $86 million to $509 million. The new liquidated damages are tied to the new guaranteed substantial completion date and the eligibility of the units to earn federal production tax credits. 
Westinghouse also has opportunity to earn from SCE&G completion bonuses of approximately $303 million or $151.5 million for each unit depending on the timing of the plants being placed into service. In addition, this amendment provides SCE&G for itself and its agent for Santee Cooper an exclusive and irrevocable option until November 1, 2016, to further amend the EPC agreement to fix the total amount remaining to be paid for the entire scope of work on the project after June 30, 2015, and approximately $3.345 billion, which is SCE&G's 55% portion of $6.082 billion. 
This fixed price option would result in SCE&G paying Westinghouse incremental project costs of approximately $774 million over the previous escalated amount approved by the PSC of $6.826 billion. Combined with estimated escalation and AFUDC, this would bring the total gross construction cost of the project to approximately $7.601 billion. If the fixed price option is exercised, SCE&G share of the delay related liquidated damages amounts previously referred to would then be kept in approximately $372 million or $186 million per unit. 
The completion bonus to be paid by SCE&G with option is approximately $165 million or $82.5 million for each unit depending on the timing of the plants being placed in service. Our team worked very hard to include the unilateral fixed price option into this settlement. We will be evaluating the potential benefits of this option over the next several months. 
If elected, this option would fix all cost to Westinghouse at an approximate 11% increase over the current PSC approved budget. We along with our partner, Santee Cooper, believe this option has significant value. 
Once our evaluation of this option is complete, we will discuss with the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff our conclusion regarding our decision whether to exercise the option and make a filing with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. An important part of the amendment is the development of a new revised construction payment milestone schedule. 
Over the next 5 months or until the new payment schedule is agreed upon, SCE&G will make monthly payments of approximately $100 million per month, of which our share is $55 million. Thereafter, payments will be made to Westinghouse based on construction milestones achieved. After this milestone schedule is agreed upon and if the fixed price option is elected and approved, our CapEx schedule Jimmy reviewed on Slide 10 will be updated and our financing schedule will be conformed as well. 
The amendment also modifies the EPC agreement to explicitly defined what constitutes a change in law to reduce the likelihood of certain commercial disputes. A dispute resolution board will be established for resolution of disputes as the requirement or ability to bring suit you for substantial completion of the project has been eliminated. 
Finally, I'm excited to have Fluor Corporation involved in the project. Fluor was established in South Carolina has a deep nuclear pedigree with this Nuclear division being headquartered in Greenwood, South Carolina we've had a long relationship with Fluor and believe they have an excellent record of delivering on commitments. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

We want to take some time to let Fluor get acclimated to the project, have them look at the project schedule, the timetable associated with the completion dates and get their opinion combined with our evaluation of how they intend approach the completion of the project so we can evaluate the option we're under today, which is to complete the project with the target pricing along with fixed and firm. The bulk of the project left to be done is in that target category, which means we pay the cost that they incur. That's important to us to get their feedback on the achievement of the milestones and what risk we think we may have there. We think we've strengthened our risk position there because we increased the LDs on the project significantly. I think it's 6x if we go under the existing option today. So once we get a chance to fully evaluate the schedule, the new completion dates along with their oversight and our completed evaluation, I think we'll be in a better position to make that decision. We certainly think the fixed price option is very appealing. We worked hard to negotiate that option entire settlement. This does given us additional protection for rising costs. Certainly, interest rates and projected escalation rates between now and the time we make that decision would have an impact on which way we might go, but we just need some more time to evaluate that more fully."

In the original agreement, there were 2 types of payments to be made. Some of those were based on time, just passing of the timetable on the schedule, and others were based on actual work done. That got to be fairly contentious because we felt like in some circumstances, we were being built for work that was not being completed consistent with the schedule we had agreed to in the original contract. What this amendment does is it resolves those differences. So everything that's been paid to date is, I think I'm confident saying that was the work that's actually been performed on the project. We're certainly not ahead of schedule. So what we'll do is we're going to work with Westinghouse and Fluor very carefully to come up with a new construction payment milestone schedule. It'll take about 5 months to do that we've estimated. So during that time on 100% basis, we'll be paying $100 million per month and then at the end of 6 months, that'll be trued up. So we won't be ahead or behind at that point. And then from that point on, once we agree to the schedule, payments will be made as milestones are achieved, and that'll be very simply if the work's done, there'll be paid. If the work's not done in accordance with the schedule regardless how much time is past, there won't be a payment required from us."

I mean, the fact under the existing option that we've resolved all of these outstanding issues eliminates the risk of a potential litigation under those issues and the risk are just inherent going through that process over time, and I think the fact that we've significantly raised the liquidated damages gives us a lot more protection. Under the existing contracts arrangement, our liquidated damages are 6x what they were in the original contract. We still bear the risk of potential increased escalation, and I just increased interest expense during that time on the targeted dollars, and the majority of dollars to be spent between now and the completion of the project are in that target bucket. But I think when you add them all of those together, our risk profile is certainly a reduced from where it was before we signed the amendment. On the fixed price option that we have in front of us, I think that really enhances our risk profile because we shift that escalation risk back to Westinghouse and our only risk would be changes in law or change orders that might be associated with the project. And we still got incentives payable under either option that would encourage them to complete the units on time. So anything that helps that happen in accordance with the schedule in the guaranty completion date would lower our risk profile."

But Westinghouse has had an opportunity to assess quality as of our folks. And so we don't just rely on the quality from the vendor in this case, CB&I. We have our own quality group, our own quality inspectors, and we send our folks not just at the site we will send them to facilities that our manufacturing components, whether it be CB&I or somebody else and we'll send them, whether it's domestically or internationally.

So the industrial recruitment in the state has been a real home run. Our governor has made that central to our platform she's been extremely successful, and we've seen it in the RNC markets as a result of that.

While our system was restored very quickly, the property damage of the citizens of South Carolina will take a long time to restore, and tragically, several lives were lost and families altered forever. 
Now on Slide 3, we'll begin our earnings discussion. GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 2015 were $1.04 per share compared to $1.01 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The improved results in the third quarter are mainly attributable to higher electric margins due primarily to weather, a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth as well as lower depreciation expense as I will discuss shortly. These were partially offset by lower gas margins, primarily due to lost gas margins of $0.06 per share resulting from the sale of CGT, an increase in O&M expense and expected increases in CapEx-related items included -- including interest and share dilution. Note that abnormal weather contributed $0.11 per share and $0.07 per share of additional electric margin in the third quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
SCE&G periodically conducts depreciation studies related to electric plant to better determine the proper annual depreciation accrual rates. A new depreciation study performed earlier this year resulted in the adoption of depreciation rates, which produce an annual decrease to depreciation expense of approximately $29 million. The PSC authorized SCE&G to implement the new depreciation rates effective January 1, 2015, and at the company's request, the retroactive $14.5 million credit from the application of the new rates from January through June of this year has been used to offset a portion of the deferred fuel ballots related to its retail electric operations. 
For the third quarter of 2015 and all subsequent periods, the incremental reduction to depreciation expense will flow through income. 
Now please turn to Slide 4. Earnings per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2015, were $4.53 versus $3.06 in 2014. The improved results are mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI, higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth as well as lower depreciation expense as described earlier. These were partially offset by lower electric margins due to weather from the first quarter; lower gas margins, primarily due to lost gas margins of $0.15 per share resulting from the sale of CGT; an increase in O&M expense; and expected increases in CapEx-related items including interest, property taxes and share dilution. 
Although electric margins reflected a negative $0.01 per share due to weather year-over-year, abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.22 per share year-to-date 2015 compared to $0.23 per share in 2014. 
Slide 5 shows earnings on a GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the third quarter of 2015 were $0.93 per share compared to $0.94 per share in the same quarter of 2014. Year-to-date September, earnings were $2.90 per share in 2015 compared to $2.83 per share in the prior year. 
As a reminder, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins and the net-of-tax gains on the sale of CGT and SCI from the first quarter of 2015. 
Based upon our results today and our expectations for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our 2015 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.80 per share. 
Now on Slide 6, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's third quarter 2015 earnings were up $0.06 compared to the same period of 2014. Increases in earnings were due primarily to weather, the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA and customer growth. The application of the previously mentioned new depreciation rates also positively contribute to earnings for the quarter. These items were offset by increases in O&M expenses and expenses related to our capital program including interest expense and share dilution. Year-to-date earnings were higher by $0.13 due primarily to the same drivers as the quarter with the exception of weather. 
PSNC Energy reported a seasonal loss of $0.04 per share in the third quarter of 2015 compared to a loss of $0.02 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to increased O&M, depreciation and property taxes, partially offset by customer growth. Year-to-date 2015 earnings are $0.21 per share compared to $0.23 per share in the prior year. 
SCANA Energy, our retail and natural gas marketing business in Georgia, showed a decrease in third quarter earnings of $0.01 per share in 2015 over the same quarter of last year, primarily due to increased O&M. For the 9-month period ended September 30, earnings were up $0.01 per share. 
On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2015, consistent with the prior year. Lower interest expense at the holding company and increased margins in our marketing business were primarily offset by foregone earnings contributions from the subsidiaries that were sold during the first quarter of this year. For the 9-month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $1.37 in 2015 compared to $0.02 in 2014. Excluding the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS was down $0.06 from the prior year, again due to foregone earnings from the sale of the businesses earlier this year. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 7. So far in 2015, companies have announced plans to invest over $1 billion with the expectation of creating over 3,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories. We're excited by the continuous growth in our service territories as the Carolinas continue to be seen as a favorable business environment. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.7% and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 5.3%. Of particular interest and attesting to our state's strong economic growth, approximately 80,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. 
Slide 8 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.6%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at an accelerated rate of 2.8% and 3.1%, respectively. We continue to see very strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. 
The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended September 30, 2015. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were up 1.7% on a 12-month ended basis. 
We continue to be encouraged by the strong industrial expansion that has, in turn, led to strong sales growth not only in the industrial sector, but also in the residential and commercial markets. 
Now please turn to Slide 9, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.5 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended September 30 in the base electric business is approximately 9.7%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. 
Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% and 10.6% in South and North Carolina, respectively. 
Slide 10 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast has been updated to reflect our most current CapEx projections for 2016 and '17 and is now inclusive of our 2018 estimates. This forecast also reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 including an estimate of the impact of the settlement with the consortium, which Kevin will address later. 
At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods, which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Now please turn to Slide 11 to review our updated estimated financing plan through 2018. As a reminder, on May 19 of this year, SCE&G issued $500 million of 50-year bonds at 5.1%. Also in January, we issued approximately $14 million in equity through our 401(k) and DRIP plans before turning off the plans to new shares. 
By acquiring shares on the open market to satisfy the needs of these plans, we can further utilize the cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017 and we'll turn back on the 401(k) and DRIP plans to satisfy those needs. 
On the debt side and based upon cash flows and planned construction payments to date, we have deferred $325 million of Q4 planned debt issuances and accelerated some issuances from the out-years to better align with our expected funding needs. This plan also anticipates debt to be issued at PSNC to fund its anticipated CapEx spending. 
While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur exactly as presented as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses, and we continue to adjust the financing to match the related CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
Now I'd like to discuss our 2016 earnings guidance and related assumptions as shown on Slide 12. Our 2016 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized preliminary earnings guidance is $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share and our internal target is $4 per share. Due to the cyclical nature of our business, we expect to earn approximately 30% of this amount in the first quarter, approximately 25% in each of the third and fourth quarters and the remaining 20% in the second quarter. In computing this guidance range, we have included the impact of a base rate increase from our new nuclear filing under the BLRA, the accretive impact of the sales of CGT and SCI and our view of the economy. This guidance also incorporates CapEx and financing plans we presented earlier. 
We forecast electric customer growth to be at approximately 1.5%, offsetting our assumption that customer average use of electricity will be slightly lower in 2016. We anticipate overall weather-normalized retail electric sales growth for 2016 to decline by approximately 0.2%. 
We expect operating and maintenance expenses to be approximately 2% higher in 2016 than where we project to finish for the end of 2015. We also expect continued growth in the CapEx-related costs of property taxes, depreciation and interests. 
For the remainder of 2015, exclusive of the taxes on the gains on the sales of the subsidiaries and looking out into 2016, we project an effective tax rate of approximately 32%. 
We continue to be cautiously optimistic about our long-term view and are reaffirming GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized average annual growth guidance as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the 3 to 5 years using a base of 2014's GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.58 per share. Hopefully, this will provide you with some clarity of our view of 2016 as you update your models. 
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I would like to begin by addressing the impact that the recent rainfall and flooding in South Carolina had on the new nuclear construction project.

I would like to begin by addressing the impact that the recent rainfall and flooding in South Carolina had on the new nuclear construction project. 
As you've probably already seen on our website, we estimate that this weather event resulted in a loss of about 4 days of work effort. I wanted to clarify that the construction schedule has a contingency for weather delays and other events, so the missed days should not impact the planned in-service dates for the new units. We have had very little weather impact to date, which is why this event should not have an impact on the project. 
Please turn to Slide 13. I'd now like to address the Public Service Commission of South Carolina's unanimous approval of the petition that SCE&G filed in March of this year seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule as well as the capital cost schedule for the 2 new nuclear units. The approval of the petition, along with the settlement agreement entered into with the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff and the South Carolina Energy Users Committee, adjusted the commission-approved substantial completion dates to June of 2019 for Unit 2 and June of 2020 for Unit 3. This agreement also allowed for the inclusion of incremental capital costs that totaled $698 million and revised the allowed return on equity to 10.5% from 11% for calculating prospective revised rates under the BLRA on or after January 1, 2016. 
Moving on to some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site, Slide 14 presents an aerial photo of the site from June. This photo gives you a view of the layout of the site and I've labeled both Units 2 and 3 as well as many of the areas that make up what we call the construction tabletop. 
On Slide 15, you can see picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture, you can see module CA20 on the left side of the slide along with the containment vessel first ring, which has been placed on and welded to the lower bowl. If you look through the personnel and equipment hatch openings in the containment vessel ring, you can see superstructure module CA-01, which, as you'll recall, was placed back in July. We continue to make progress with the fabrication and placement of containment vessel structural modules. 
Slide 16 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. This exploded view of CA-01 through 05 gives you a better feel for how they fit spatially inside the containment vessel. As you may know, we have now placed CA-01, CA-04 and CA-05 for Unit 2. 
Slide 17 shows a picture of CA-02, which will be the next structural module placed in the Unit 2 containment vessel. Module CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. As you see here, all 5 submodules have been assembled and CA-02 is now structurally complete and has been moved outside of the module assembly building or MAB. This module is scheduled to be placed sometime in the first half of 2016. 
Slide 18 shows a picture of CA-03, which is the west wall of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. 4 of CA-03's 17 submodules were on-site and 3 have been fabricated in the MAB. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island. Module CA-04 was placed inside of the containment vessel lower bowl back in June and the auxiliary building walls, as you can see, continue to take form. 
Slide 20 shows an aerial view of the low-profile cooling towers from June. Three of the 4 cooling towers are now structurally complete with the fourth, 2 Bravo shown on this slide -- sorry, as shown on Slide 21, being about 50% complete. 
Please now turn to Slide 22. Here you can see the placement of the concrete foundation for the Unit 2 Turbine Building first bay. This 6-foot thick basemat took 27 hours to pour and consisted of 2,100 cubic yards of concrete. This first bay is a transition from the aux building to the turbine building. 
Slide 23 shows the completed Unit 2 transformer base. These transformer bas are constructed with reinforcing bar and concrete and serve as a firewall partially enclosing the transformers. These 9 transformer bays for Unit 2 were completed during August. 
Components continue to arrive on-site. On Slide 24, you can see some pictures of the Unit 3 pressurizer arriving in the Port of Charleston. It was then transferred via railcar to the site. The pressurizer will be housed inside the containment vessel and will be used to control the pressure in the reactor coolant system. 
Please now turn to Slide 25. As we mentioned during our second quarter call, we filed our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA in May. In response to that request, in September, the PSC approved an increase of $64.5 million. The new rates are effective for bills rendered on or after October 30. Our BLRA filings for 2015 are shown at the bottom of the slide, and as you can see, in August, we filed our quarterly status report on our new nuclear project with the commission and the Office of Regulatory Staff for the second quarter of 2015. We intend to file our quarterly status report for the third quarter in November. 
I will now turn the call over to Kevin."

I'm glad to be with you today to provide some details in connection with our amendment to the EPC agreement for the new AP1000 units at the VC Summer site we announced earlier this week. A number of the key points are summarized on Slide",852,"Thanks, Steve. I'm glad to be with you today to provide some details in connection with our amendment to the EPC agreement for the new AP1000 units at the VC Summer site we announced earlier this week. 
A number of the key points are summarized on Slide 26. As you know, these plants were being constructed under an EPC agreement with the consortium of Westinghouse and Chicago Bridge and Iron subsidiary, Stone & Webster. Westinghouse has announced that it intends to acquire Stone & Webster from CB&I. Following that acquisition, Stone & Webster will continue to be a party to the EPC agreement, but as a subsidiary of Westinghouse instead of CB&I. The amendment to the EPC agreement allows CB&I to exit its guarantee obligation to the project. 
The obligations under the EPC agreement are joint and several obligations of Westinghouse and Stone & Webster and the October 2015 amendment provides for Toshiba Corporation, the parent company of Westinghouse, to reaffirm its guarantee of the Westinghouse payment obligation. 
In exchange for the release of the CB&I guarantee, the amendment of the EPC contract and an option to fix project costs, SCE&G, Santee Cooper and Westinghouse have agreed to a full resolution and settlement of substantially all known claims and disputes outstanding under the EPC agreement. Under this amendment, SCE&G has agreed to pay Westinghouse incremental capital costs of approximately $245 million over the $5.247 billion approved in the Public Service Commission's recent order #2015-661. This, along with estimated escalation and AFUDC, would bring the total gross construction cost of the project to approximately $7.113 billion. 
The amendment also revises the guaranteed substantial completion dates of Units 2 and 3 to August 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. 
SCE&G's share of liquidated damages would increase from $86 million to $509 million. The new liquidated damages are tied to the new guaranteed substantial completion dates and the eligibility of the units to earn federal production tax credits. 
Westinghouse also has the opportunity to earn from SCE&G completion bonuses of approximately $303 million or $151.5 million for each unit depending on the timing of the plants being placed into service. 
In addition, this amendment provides SCE&G for itself and its agent for Santee Cooper an exclusive and irrevocable option until November 1, 2016, to further amend the EPC agreement to fix the total amount remaining to be paid for the entire scope of work on the project after June 30, 2015, at approximately $3.345 billion, which is SCE&G's 55% portion of $6.082 billion. This fixed-price option would result in SCE&G paying Westinghouse incremental project costs of approximately $774 million over the previous escalated amount approved by the PSC of $6.826 billion. Combined with estimated escalation and AFUDC, this would bring the total gross construction cost of the project to approximately $7.601 billion. If the fixed-price option is exercised, SCE&G's share of the delay-related liquidated damages amounts previously referred to would then be kept in approximately $372 million or $186 million per unit. 
The completion bonus to be paid by SCE&G with this option is approximately $165 million or $82.5 million for each unit depending on the timing of the plants being placed in service. 
Our team worked very hard to include the unilateral fixed-price option into this settlement. We will be evaluating the potential benefits of this option over the next several months. If elected, this option would fix all cost to Westinghouse at an approximate 11% increase over the current PSC-approved budget. We, along with our partner, Santee Cooper, believe this option has significant value. 
Once our evaluation of this option is complete, we will discuss with the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff our conclusion regarding our decision whether to exercise the option and make a filing with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. 
An important part of the amendment is the development of a new revised construction payment milestone schedule. Over the next 5 months or until the new payment schedule is agreed upon, SCE&G will make monthly payments of approximately $100 million per month, of which our share is $55 million. Thereafter, payments will be made to Westinghouse based on construction milestones achieved. After this milestone schedule is agreed upon and if the fixed-price option is elected and approved, our CapEx schedule Jimmy reviewed on Slide 10 will be updated and our financing schedule will be conformed as well. 
The amendment also modifies the EPC agreement to explicitly define what constitutes a change in law to reduce the likelihood of certain commercial disputes. A dispute resolution board will be established for resolution of disputes as the requirement or ability to bring suit before substantial completion of the project has been eliminated. 
Finally, I'm excited to have Fluor Corporation involved in the project. Fluor was established in South Carolina and has a deep nuclear pedigree with its nuclear division being headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina. We've had a long relationship with Fluor and believe they have an excellent record of delivering on commitments. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

We have 12 months to make the final decision. We want to take some time to let Fluor get acclimated to the project, have them look at the project schedule, the timetable associated with the completion dates and get their opinion combined with our evaluation of how they intend to approach the completion of the project so we can evaluate the option we're under today, which is to complete the project with the target pricing along with a fixed and firm. The bulk of the project left to be done is in that target category, which means we pay the costs that they incur. That's important to us to because we want to get their feedback on the achievement of the milestones and what risks we think we may have there. We think we've strengthened our risk position there because we've increased the LDs on the project significantly. I think it's 6x if we go under the existing option today. So once we get a chance to fully evaluate the schedule, the new completion dates, along with their oversight and our completed evaluation, I think we'll be in a better position to make that decision. We certainly think the fixed-price option is very appealing. We worked hard to negotiate that option entire settlement because we believe it does give us additional protection for rising costs. Certainly, interest rates and projected escalation rates between now and the time we make that decision would have an impact on which way we might go, but we just need some more time to evaluate that more fully."

In the original agreement, there were 2 types of payments to be made. Some of those were based on time, just passing the timetable on the schedule, and others were based on actual work done. That got to be fairly contentious because we felt like, in some circumstances, we were being billed for work that was not being completed consistent with the schedule we had agreed to in the original contract. What this amendment does is it resolves those differences. So everything that's been paid to date is, I think, I'm confident saying that was the work that's actually been performed on the project. We're certainly not ahead of schedule. So what we'll do is we're going to work with Westinghouse and Fluor very carefully to come up with a new construction payment milestone schedule. It'll take about 5 months to do that we've estimated. So during that time on 100% basis, we'll be paying $100 million per month, and then at the end of 6 months, that'll be trued up. So we won't be ahead or behind at that point. And then from that point on, once we agree to the schedule, payments will be made as milestones are achieved. And that'll be very simply if the work's done, they'll be paid. If the work's not done in accordance with the schedule regardless of how much time is past, there won't be a payment required from us."

We would like to have these project completed on time and have that a nice problem to have. We'll address that with the commission. I'm likely to be asked by the commission how we perceive that and my recommendation would be we wait till the end of the project to see what the final costs come in, and that's our most likely recommendation to the commission since we can't determine exactly what that would be today. And that might be influenced by which option we take, too."

I mean, in fact, under the existing option that we've resolved all of these outstanding issues eliminates the risk of a potential litigation under those issues and the risks that are just inherent when going through that process over time. And I think the fact that we've significantly raised the liquidated damages gives us a lot more protection. Under the existing contracts arrangement, our liquidated damages are 6x what they were in the original contract. We still bear the risk of potential increased escalation and just increased interest expense during that time on the targeted dollars and the majority of dollars to be spent between now and the completion of the project are in that target bucket. But I think when you add them all of those together, our risk profile is certainly reduced from where it was before we signed the amendment. On the fixed-price option that we have in front of us, I think that really enhances our risk profile because we shift that escalation risk back to Westinghouse and our only risk would be changes in law or change orders that might be associated with the project. And we still got incentives payable under either option that would encourage them to complete the units on time. So anything that helps that happen in accordance with the schedule and the guarantee completion dates would lower our risk profile."

The unemployment rate has dropped from 6.6% to 5.7%, but that only tells part of the story. The workforce has expanded 3%. So if the workforce were the same level today than it were a year ago, the unemployment rate would be less than 3% in South Carolina. So the industrial recruitment in the state has been a real home run. Our governor has made that central to her platform and she's been extremely successful and we've seen it in the RNC markets as a result of that; now contrast that to our north -- to North Carolina where the workforce has expanded 1.8%; contrast it to Georgia where it's actually slightly down, almost breakeven year-over-year.

While our system was restored very quickly, the property damage of the citizens of South Carolina will take a long time to restore, and tragically, several lives were lost and families altered forever. 
Now on Slide 3, we'll begin our earnings discussion. GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 2015 were $1.04 per share compared to $1.01 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The improved results in the third quarter are mainly attributable to higher electric margins due primarily to weather, a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth as well as lower depreciation expense as I will discuss shortly. These were partially offset by lower gas margins, primarily due to lost gas margins of $0.06 per share resulting from the sale of CGT, an increase in O&M expense and expected increases in CapEx-related items included -- including interest and share dilution. Note that abnormal weather contributed $0.11 per share and $0.07 per share of additional electric margin in the third quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
SCE&G periodically conducts depreciation studies related to electric plant to better determine the proper annual depreciation accrual rates. A new depreciation study performed earlier this year resulted in the adoption of depreciation rates, which produced an annual decrease to depreciation expense of approximately $29 million. The PSC authorized SCE&G to implement the new depreciation rates effective January 1, 2015, and at the company's request, the retroactive $14.5 million credit from the application of the new rates from January through June of this year has been used to offset a portion of the deferred fuel balance related to its retail electric operations. 
For the third quarter of 2015 and all subsequent periods, the incremental reduction to depreciation expense will flow through income. 
Now please turn to Slide 4. Earnings per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2015, were $4.53 versus $3.06 in 2014. The improved results are mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI, higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth as well as lower depreciation expense as described earlier. These were partially offset by lower electric margins due to weather from the first quarter; lower gas margins, primarily due to lost gas margins of $0.15 per share resulting from the sale of CGT; an increase in O&M expense; and expected increases in CapEx-related items including interest, property taxes and share dilution. 
Although electric margins reflected a negative $0.01 per share due to weather year-over-year, abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.22 per share year-to-date 2015 compared to $0.23 per share in 2014. 
Slide 5 shows earnings on a GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the third quarter of 2015 were $0.93 per share compared to $0.94 per share in the same quarter of 2014. Year-to-date September, earnings were $2.90 per share in 2015 compared to $2.83 per share in the prior year. 
As a reminder, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins and the net-of-tax gains on the sale of CGT and SCI from the first quarter of 2015. 
Based upon our results to date and our expectations for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our 2015 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.80 per share. 
Now on Slide 6, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's third quarter 2015 earnings were up $0.06 compared to the same period of 2014. Increases in earnings were due primarily to weather, the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA and customer growth. The application of the previously mentioned new depreciation rates also positively contribute to earnings for the quarter. These items were offset by increases in O&M expenses and expenses related to our capital program including interest expense and share dilution. Year-to-date earnings were higher by $0.13 due primarily to the same drivers as the quarter with the exception of weather. 
PSNC Energy reported a seasonal loss of $0.04 per share in the third quarter of 2015 compared to a loss of $0.02 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to increased O&M, depreciation and property taxes, partially offset by customer growth. Year-to-date 2015 earnings are $0.21 per share compared to $0.23 per share in the prior year. 
SCANA Energy, our retail and natural gas marketing business in Georgia, showed a decrease in third quarter earnings of $0.01 per share in 2015 over the same quarter of last year, primarily due to increased O&M. For the 9-month period ended September 30, earnings were up $0.01 per share. 
On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2015, consistent with the prior year. Lower interest expense at the holding company and increased margins in our marketing business were primarily offset by foregone earnings contributions from the subsidiaries that were sold during the first quarter of this year. For the 9-month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $1.37 in 2015 compared to $0.02 in 2014. Excluding the net-of-tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS was down $0.06 from the prior year, again due to foregone earnings from the sale of the businesses earlier this year. 
I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 7. So far in 2015, companies have announced plans to invest over $1 billion with the expectation of creating over 3,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories. We're excited by the continuous growth in our service territories as the Carolinas continue to be seen as a favorable business environment. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate along with the rates for the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.7% and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 5.3%. Of particular interest and attesting to our state's strong economic growth, approximately 80,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. 
Slide 8 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.6%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at an accelerated rate of 2.8% and 3.1%, respectively. We continue to see very strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. 
The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended September 30, 2015. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were up 1.7% on a 12-month ended basis. 
We continue to be encouraged by the strong industrial expansion that has, in turn, led to strong sales growth not only in the industrial sector, but also in the residential and commercial markets. 
Now please turn to Slide 9, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.5 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended September 30 in the base electric business is approximately 9.7%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. 
Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% and 10.6% in South and North Carolina, respectively. 
Slide 10 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast has been updated to reflect our most current CapEx projections for 2016 and '17 and is now inclusive of our 2018 estimates. This forecast also reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 including an estimate of the impact of the settlement with the consortium, which Kevin will address later. 
At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods, which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. 
Now please turn to Slide 11 to review our updated estimated financing plan through 2018. As a reminder, on May 19 of this year, SCE&G issued $500 million of 50-year bonds at 5.1%. Also in January, we issued approximately $14 million in equity through our 401(k) and DRIP plans before turning off the plans to new shares. 
By acquiring shares on the open market to satisfy the needs of these plans, we can further utilize the cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017 and we'll turn back on the 401(k) and DRIP plans to satisfy those needs. 
On the debt side and based upon cash flows and planned construction payments to date, we have deferred $325 million of Q4 planned debt issuances and accelerated some issuances from the out-years to better align with our expected funding needs. This plan also anticipates debt to be issued at PSNC to fund its anticipated CapEx spending. 
While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur exactly as presented as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses, and we continue to adjust the financing to match the related CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. 
Now I'd like to discuss our 2016 earnings guidance and related assumptions as shown on Slide 12. Our 2016 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized preliminary earnings guidance is $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share and our internal target is $4 per share. Due to the cyclical nature of our business, we expect to earn approximately 30% of this amount in the first quarter, approximately 25% in each of the third and fourth quarters and the remaining 20% in the second quarter. In computing this guidance range, we have included the impact of a base rate increase from our new nuclear filing under the BLRA, the accretive impact of the sales of CGT and SCI and our view of the economy. This guidance also incorporates CapEx and financing plans we presented earlier. 
We forecast electric customer growth to be at approximately 1.5%, offsetting our assumption that customer average use of electricity will be slightly lower in 2016. We anticipate overall weather-normalized retail electric sales growth for 2016 to decline by approximately 0.2%. 
We expect operating and maintenance expenses to be approximately 2% higher in 2016 than where we project to finish for the end of 2015. We also expect continued growth in the CapEx-related costs of property taxes, depreciation and interests. 
For the remainder of 2015, exclusive of the taxes on the gains on the sales of the subsidiaries and looking out into 2016, we project an effective tax rate of approximately 32%. 
We continue to be cautiously optimistic about our long-term view and are reaffirming GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized average annual growth guidance as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the 3 to 5 years using a base of 2014's GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.58 per share. Hopefully, this will provide you with some clarity of our view of 2016 as you update your models. 
I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project."

I would like to begin by addressing the impact that the recent rainfall and flooding in South Carolina had on the new nuclear construction project. 
As you've probably already seen on our website, we estimate that this weather event resulted in a loss of about 4 days of work effort. I wanted to clarify that the construction schedule has a contingency for weather delays and other events, so the missed days should not impact the planned in-service dates for the new units. We have had very little weather impact to date, which is why this event should not have an impact on the project. 
Please turn to Slide 13. I'd now like to address the Public Service Commission of South Carolina's unanimous approval of the petition that SCE&G filed in March of this year seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule as well as the capital cost schedule for the 2 new nuclear units. The approval of the petition, along with the settlement agreement entered into with the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff and the South Carolina Energy Users Committee, adjusted the commission-approved substantial completion dates to June of 2019 for Unit 2 and June of 2020 for Unit 3. This agreement also allowed for the inclusion of incremental capital costs that totaled $698 million and revised the allowed return on equity to 10.5% from 11% for calculating prospective revised rates under the BLRA on or after January 1, 2016. 
Moving on to some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site, Slide 14 presents an aerial photo of the site from June. This photo gives you a view of the layout of the site and I've labeled both Units 2 and 3 as well as many of the areas that make up what we call the construction tabletop. 
On Slide 15, you can see picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture, you can see module CA20 on the left side of the slide along with the containment vessel first ring, which has been placed on and welded to the lower bowl. If you look through the personnel and equipment hatch openings in the containment vessel ring, you can see superstructure module CA-01, which, as you'll recall, was placed back in July. We continue to make progress with the fabrication and placement of containment vessel structural modules. 
Slide 16 presents a schematic view of the 5 large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. This exploded view of CA-01 through 05 gives you a better feel for how they fit spatially inside the containment vessel. As you may know, we have now placed CA-01, CA-04 and CA-05 for Unit 2. 
Slide 17 shows a picture of CA-02, which will be the next structural module placed in the Unit 2 containment vessel. Module CA-02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. As you see here, all 5 submodules have been assembled and CA-02 is now structurally complete and has been moved outside of the module assembly building or MAB. This module is scheduled to be placed sometime in the first half of 2016. 
Slide 18 shows a picture of CA-03, which is the west wall of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. 4 of CA-03's 17 sub-modules were on-site and 3 have been fabricated in the MAB. 
Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island. Module CA-04 was placed inside of the containment vessel lower bowl back in June and the auxiliary building walls, as you can see, continue to take form. 
Slide 20 shows an aerial view of the low-profile cooling towers from June. Three of the 4 cooling towers are now structurally complete with the fourth, 2 Bravo shown on this slide -- sorry, as shown on Slide 21, being about 50% complete. 
Please now turn to Slide 22. Here you can see the placement of the concrete foundation for the Unit 2 Turbine Building first bay. This 6-foot thick basemat took 27 hours to pour and consisted of 2,100 cubic yards of concrete. This first bay is a transition from the aux building to the turbine building. 
Slide 23 shows the completed Unit 2 transformer bays. These transformer bays are constructed with reinforcing bar and concrete and serve as a firewall partially enclosing the transformers. These 9 transformer bays for Unit 2 were completed during August. 
Components continue to arrive on-site. On Slide 24, you can see some pictures of the Unit 3 pressurizer arriving in the Port of Charleston. It was then transferred via railcar to the site. The pressurizer will be housed inside the containment vessel and will be used to control the pressure in the reactor coolant system. 
Please now turn to Slide 25. As we mentioned during our second quarter call, we filed our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA in May. In response to that request, in September, the PSC approved an increase of $64.5 million. The new rates are effective for bills rendered on or after October 30. Our BLRA filings for 2015 are shown at the bottom of the slide, and as you can see, in August, we filed our quarterly status report on our new nuclear project with the commission and the Office of Regulatory Staff for the second quarter of 2015. We intend to file our quarterly status report for the third quarter in November. 
I will now turn the call over to Kevin."

I'm glad to be with you today to provide some details in connection with our amendment to the EPC agreement for the new AP1000 units at the VC Summer site we announced earlier this week. A number of the key points are summarized on Slide",852,"Thanks, Steve. I'm glad to be with you today to provide some details in connection with our amendment to the EPC agreement for the new AP1000 units at the VC Summer site we announced earlier this week. 
A number of the key points are summarized on Slide 26. As you know, these plants were being constructed under an EPC agreement with the consortium of Westinghouse and Chicago Bridge & Iron subsidiary, Stone & Webster. Westinghouse has announced that it intends to acquire Stone & Webster from CB&I. Following that acquisition, Stone & Webster will continue to be a party to the EPC agreement, but as a subsidiary of Westinghouse instead of CB&I. The amendment to the EPC agreement allows CB&I to exit its guarantee obligation to the project. 
The obligations under the EPC agreement are joint and several obligations of Westinghouse and Stone & Webster and the October 2015 amendment provides for Toshiba Corporation, the parent company of Westinghouse, to reaffirm its guarantee of the Westinghouse payment obligation. 
In exchange for the release of the CB&I guarantee, the amendment of the EPC contract and an option to fix project costs, SCE&G, Santee Cooper and Westinghouse have agreed to a full resolution and settlement of substantially all known claims and disputes outstanding under the EPC agreement. Under this amendment, SCE&G has agreed to pay Westinghouse incremental capital costs of approximately $245 million over the $5.247 billion approved in the Public Service Commission's recent order #2015-661. This, along with estimated escalation and AFUDC, would bring the total gross construction cost of the project to approximately $7.113 billion. 
The amendment also revises the guaranteed substantial completion dates of Units 2 and 3 to August 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. 
SCE&G's share of liquidated damages would increase from $86 million to $509 million. The new liquidated damages are tied to the new guaranteed substantial completion dates and the eligibility of the units to earn federal production tax credits. 
Westinghouse also has the opportunity to earn from SCE&G completion bonuses of approximately $303 million, or $151.5 million for each unit, depending on the timing of the plants being placed into service. 
In addition, this amendment provides SCE&G for itself and its agent for Santee Cooper an exclusive and irrevocable option until November 1, 2016, to further amend the EPC agreement to fix the total amount remaining to be paid for the entire scope of work on the project after June 30, 2015, at approximately $3.345 billion, which is SCE&G's 55% portion of $6.082 billion. This fixed-price option would result in SCE&G paying Westinghouse incremental project costs of approximately $774 million over the previous escalated amount approved by the PSC of $6.826 billion. Combined with estimated escalation and AFUDC, this would bring the total gross construction cost of the project to approximately $7.601 billion. If the fixed-price option is exercised, SCE&G's share of the delay-related liquidated damages amounts previously referred to would then be capped in approximately $372 million or $186 million per unit. 
The completion bonus to be paid by SCE&G with this option is approximately $165 million, or $82.5 million for each unit, depending on the timing of the plants being placed in service. 
Our team worked very hard to include the unilateral fixed-price option into this settlement. We will be evaluating the potential benefits of this option over the next several months. If elected, this option would fix all cost to Westinghouse at an approximate 11% increase over the current PSC-approved budget. We, along with our partner, Santee Cooper, believe this option has significant value. 
Once our evaluation of this option is complete, we will discuss with the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff our conclusion regarding our decision whether to exercise the option and make a filing with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. 
An important part of the amendment is the development of a new revised construction payment milestone schedule. Over the next 5 months or until the new payment schedule is agreed upon, SCE&G will make monthly payments of approximately $100 million per month, of which our share is $55 million. Thereafter, payments will be made to Westinghouse based on construction milestones achieved. After this milestone schedule is agreed upon and if the fixed-price option is elected and approved, our CapEx schedule Jimmy reviewed on Slide 10 will be updated and our financing schedule will be conformed as well. 
The amendment also modifies the EPC agreement to explicitly define what constitutes a change in law to reduce the likelihood of certain commercial disputes. A dispute resolution board will be established for resolution of disputes as the requirement or ability to bring suit before substantial completion of the project has been eliminated. 
Finally, I'm excited to have Fluor Corporation involved in the project. Fluor was established in South Carolina and has a deep nuclear pedigree with its nuclear division being headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina. We've had a long relationship with Fluor and believe they have an excellent record of delivering on commitments. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have."

We want to take some time to let Fluor get acclimated to the project, have them look at the project schedule, the timetable associated with the completion dates and get their opinion combined with our evaluation of how they intend to approach the completion of the project so we can evaluate the option we're under today, which is to complete the project with the target pricing along with a fixed and firm. The bulk of the project left to be done is in that target category, which means we pay the costs that they incur. That's important to us to because we want to get their feedback on the achievement of the milestones and what risks we think we may have there. We think we've strengthened our risk position there because we've increased the LDs on the project significantly. I think it's 6x if we go under the existing option today. So once we get a chance to fully evaluate the schedule, the new completion dates, along with their oversight and our complete evaluation, I think we'll be in a better position to make that decision. We certainly think the fixed-price option is very appealing. We worked hard to negotiate that option into our settlement because we believe it does give us additional protection for rising costs. Certainly, interest rates and projected escalation rates between now and the time we make that decision would have an impact on which way we might go, but we just need some more time to evaluate that more fully."

In the original agreement, there were 2 types of payments to be made. Some of those were based on time, just passing the timetable on the schedule, and others were based on actual work done. That got to be fairly contentious because we felt like, in some circumstances, we were being billed for work that was not being completed consistently with the schedule we had agreed to in the original contract. What this amendment does is it resolves those differences. So everything that's been paid to date is, I think, I'm confident in saying that was for work that's actually been performed on the project. We're certainly not ahead of schedule. 
So what we'll do is we're going to work with Westinghouse and Fluor very carefully to come up with a new construction payment milestone schedule. It'll take about 5 months to do that we've estimated. So during that time on 100% basis, we'll be paying $100 million per month, and then at the end of 6 months, that'll be trued up. So we won't be ahead or behind at that point. And then from that point on, once we agree to the schedule, payments will be made as milestones are achieved. And that'll be very simply if the work's done, they'll be paid. If the work's not done in accordance with the schedule regardless of how much time has passed, there won't be a payment required from us."

I mean, in fact, under the existing option that we've resolved all of these outstanding issues eliminates the risk of a potential litigation on those issues and the risks that are just inherent when going through that process over time. And I think the fact that we've significantly raised the liquidated damages gives us a lot more protection. Under the existing contractual arrangement, our liquidated damages are 6x what they were in the original contract. We still bear the risk of potential increased escalation and just increased interest expense during that time on the targeted dollars and the majority of dollars to be spent between now and the completion of the project are in that target bucket. But I think when you add them all of those together, our risk profile is certainly reduced from where it was before we signed the amendment. On the fixed-price option that we have in front of us, I think that really enhances our risk profile because we shift that escalation risk back to Westinghouse and our only risk would be changes in law or change orders that might be associated with the project. And we still got incentives payable under either option that would encourage them to complete the units on time. So anything that helps that happen in accordance with the schedule and the guarantee completion dates would lower our risk profile."

And the language around changes that we've worked on and incorporated into this agreement significantly restricts what would be allowed as a regulatory-driven change.

The unemployment rate has dropped from 6.6% to 5.7%, but that only tells part of the story. The workforce has expanded 3%. So if the workforce were the same level today than it were a year ago, the unemployment rate would be less than 3% in South Carolina. So the industrial recruitment in the state has been a real home run. Our governor has made that central to her platform and she's been extremely successful and we've seen it in the RNC markets as a result of that; now contrast that to our north -- to North Carolina where the workforce has expanded 1.8%; contrast it to Georgia where it's actually slightly down, almost breakeven year-over-year.
