This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that's important to your calendar. We plan to hold a call on February 4 at 10:00 a.m. Central time to update our capital management strategy. Similar to what we've done in the -- for the last 2 years on this topic, Kevin March will provide insight into our strategy and also answer some of the most frequently asked questions.
Turning to our earnings update. The fourth quarter marked another quarter of strong progress. Our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing grew again with combined revenue up 13% from a year ago. Revenue of $3.27 billion came in at the middle of the expected range that we communicated to you in October. Earnings per share were $0.76 and included a $0.05 benefit for the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit and a $0.02 benefit from gains on sales of assets. Without these 2 items, our earnings would have been in the middle of our expected range.
In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the year was $3.5 billion, up 18% from a year ago. Free cash flow with 27% of revenue, consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30%. This is a 3 percentage point increase improvement from a year ago period. We believe this reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300-millimeter output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business.
In 2014, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. In the fourth quarter, TI revenue grew 8% from a year ago, with growth in both Analog and Embedded Processing.
Analog revenue grew 14% from a year ago, led by Power Management. High Value Analog & Logic, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog also grew. This is the sixth quarter in a row of year-over-year growth for Analog.
Embedded Processing revenue grew 11% from a year ago due to growth in processors, microcontrollers and connectivity, each of which increased by about the same amount. It is notable that connectivity grew at the fastest rate as we continue to see more products being connected. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for Embedded Processing.
In our Other segment, revenue declined 14% from a year ago due to legacy Wireless and custom ASIC products.
Turning to distribution. Resales increased 14% from a year ago, consistent with our combined revenue growth of Analog and Embedded Processing. Weeks of inventory decreased by a week from a year ago to a historically low level of just under 4.5 weeks. This level has decreased over the past 2 years because we've structurally changed how our inventories managed in the distribution channel with our consignment program. This quarter, we continue to support more of our distribution sales from consignment inventory and now have about 60% of our distribution revenue on consignment, up about 15 percentage points from a year ago. With this program, inventory sits on TI's balance sheet and revenue is recognized when our distributors pull products from our consignment inventory that's stored at the distributors' location. We carry higher levels of inventory on TI's balance sheet with this program, which had several benefits such as minimizing impact due the changes in distribution channel inventory and giving us greater flexibility to meet customer demand.
Turning to our end markets. In 2014, industrial and automotive combined were 44% of TI's revenue, up a couple of percentage points from last year. Specifically, industrial made up 31% of TI's revenue; automotive, 13%; personal electronics, 29%; communications equipment, 17%; enterprise systems, 6%; and Other, 4%.
We continue to refine our understanding of customers end markets with better tools and software. On our website, we've included the last 2 years of updated markets estimates, and we've identified the sectors inside of each of those markets for your reference.
Finally, let me make a few observations about the year overall. For 2014, Analog and Embedded Processing revenue grew a combined 12%, with Analog up 13% and Embedded up 12%. We gained market share in both businesses again in 2014. These 2 key businesses were 83% of TI's revenue for the year, up from 79% in 2013. Because they now make up more of our revenue, they're driving top line growth for the company. TI revenue overall grew 7% in 2014.
Now Kevin will review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit increased 16% from a year ago quarter. This gross profit reflects higher revenue, increased loaded and an improved product portfolio",949,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone.
Gross profit in the quarter was $1.90 billion or 58% of revenue. Gross profit increased 16% from a year ago quarter. This gross profit reflects higher revenue, increased loaded and an improved product portfolio focused on Analog and Embedded Processing that benefits from our efficient manufacturing strategy.
Moving to operating expenses. Combined R&D and SG&A expense of $740 million was down $67 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflects the targeted reductions in Embedded Processing in Japan that were previously announced. That restructuring is now essentially complete, and we achieved a little more than our estimated annualized savings.
Acquisition charges were $82 million, almost all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, a noncash expense. Restructuring and other charges were a $27 million benefit due to gains on sales of assets. Operating profit was $1.10 billion or 33.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 60% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 38.7%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 17.0%, more than doubling from a year ago as we benefit from our investments for growth and as we our restructuring plan to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing.
While this is a solid progress, we still have work to do in this business. We expect Embedded operating margins to continue to increase as our investments in R&D and SG&A will continue to drive top line growth while we hold these expenses flat.
Net income in the fourth quarter was $825 million or $0.76 per share. As a reminder, earnings per share included a $0.05 benefit for the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit and a benefit of $0.02 from the gains on sales of assets.
Let me now to comment on our capital management result, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.27 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 117, slightly above our model range but a number that we are quite comfortable with. it is with a growing portion of our product demands being supported by consignment inventory versus customer-owned inventory. We believe these consignment arrangements give us better real-time feedback to end market demand, allowing us to better manage our factories and maintain short lead times. We expect consignment inventory to continue to increase over the coming years as distribution becomes a growing portion of our business. We will monitor the appropriateness of our current model of 105 to 115 days investment and possibly update this model in the next year or so.
Capital expenditures were $125 million in the quarter. In 2014, cash flow from operations was $3.89 billion, up 15% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $385 million or 3% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% [ph] revenue.
Free cash flow for the year was $3.50 billion [ph] or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 18% higher than a year ago. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or potentially reinvested in the business. As we've noted, our intention to return 100% of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation, minus net debt retirement.
In the fourth quarter, TI paid $356 million in dividends and repurchased $698 million of our stock, for a total return of $1.05 billion. Total cash returned in 2014 was $4.15 billion, which is 3% higher than the prior year. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.3% over the past 12 months and by 39% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our to return cash and in our cash management -- on our tax practices, we need -- ended the fourth quarter with $3.54 billion of cash and short-term investments. TI U.S. entities own 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock.
TI's orders in the quarter were $3.18 billion, up 11% from a year ago.
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion in the first quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would increase 7% from a year ago. We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.67. [ph] Restructuring charges will be essentially 0. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million to $85 million per quarter for the next 5 years.
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the first quarter and for the year. The rate is higher than last year because of an expected increase in profits and does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.
In summary, the fourth quarter demonstrates the growing strength of TI's business model. Our strategy is anchored in Analog and Embedded Processing and is bolstered by an efficient manufacturing operation and a broad sales channel. The result is a diverse and long-lived positions in many markets. We remain intent on excellence in execution, being disciplined in allocating our capital and our firm believers that free cash flow per share is the best indicator for long-term value.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

One of the things to keep in mind when you adjust your factory loadings, if your quarterly loadings are really for the following quarter's expectations, then if you think about the pattern of movement through the quarter, you take your loadings coming in the fourth quarter dropping coming into the quarter and going in the first quarter, our start to increase in the quarter.

If you look overall, you can look at the components that sit inside of Other. The first is DLP. And I'd described that as a more steady business and one that may have some we describe wild cards of new opportunities. The vast majority of that business is in front projectors today as well as in cinema. And we've got some what the call pico projectors or small form factors that make up the revenue. But there are some opportunities inside of automotive and other embedded opportunities that could provide growth in the future. The next biggest piece of that revenue is calculators. And that business has been, I'd say flat to maybe slightly down over time. And then royalties have run steady, about $40 million to $50 million a quarter. And that's probably a good thing to look. And then we will have ASIC business that will transition over EP over time. And that is some business that is in communications infrastructure, and we believe that, that will move over.

We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that's important to your calendar. We plan to hold a call on February 4 at 10:00 a.m. Central time to update our capital management strategy. Similar to what we've done in the -- for the last 2 years on this topic, Kevin March will provide insight into our strategy and also answer some of the most frequently asked questions.
Turning to our earnings update. The fourth quarter marked another quarter of strong progress. Our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing grew again with combined revenue up 13% from a year ago. Revenue of $3.27 billion came in at the middle of the expected range that we communicated to you in October. Earnings per share were $0.76 and included a $0.05 benefit for the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit and a $0.02 benefit from gains on sales of assets. Without these 2 items, our earnings would have been in the middle of our expected range.
In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the year was $3.5 billion, up 18% from a year ago. Free cash flow was 27% of revenue, consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30%. This is a 3 percentage point increase improvement from a year ago period. We believe this reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300-millimeter output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business.
In 2014, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. 
In the fourth quarter, TI revenue grew 8% from a year ago, with growth in both Analog and Embedded Processing.
Analog revenue grew 14% from a year ago, led by Power Management. High Volume Analog & Logic, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog also grew. This is the sixth quarter in a row of year-over-year growth for Analog. 
Embedded Processing revenue grew 11% from a year ago due to growth in processors, microcontrollers and connectivity, each of which increased by about the same amount. It is notable that connectivity grew at the fastest rate as we continue to see more products being connected. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for Embedded Processing.
In our Other segment, revenue declined 14% from a year ago due to legacy Wireless and custom ASIC products.
Turning to distribution. Resales increased 14% from a year ago, consistent with our combined revenue growth of Analog and Embedded Processing. Weeks of inventory decreased by a week from a year ago to a historically low level of just under 4.5 weeks. This level has decreased over the past 2 years because we've structurally changed how our inventory is managed in the distribution channel with our consignment program. This quarter, we continue to support more of our distribution sales from consignment inventory and now have about 60% of our distribution revenue on consignment, up about 15 percentage points from a year ago. 
With this program, inventory sits on TI's balance sheet and revenue is recognized when our distributors pull products from our consignment inventory that's stored at the distributors' location. We carry higher levels of inventory on TI's balance sheet with this program, which has several benefits such as minimizing impact due to changes in distribution channel inventory and giving us greater flexibility to meet customer demand.
Turning to our end markets. In 2014, industrial and automotive combined were 44% of TI's revenue, up a couple of percentage points from last year. Specifically, industrial made up 31% of TI's revenue; automotive, 13%; personal electronics, 29%; communications equipment, 17%; enterprise systems, 6%; and other, 4%. We continue to refine our understanding of customers' end markets with better tools and software. On our website, we've included the last 2 years of updated market estimates, and we've identified the sectors inside of each of those markets for your reference.
Finally, let me make a few observations about the year overall. For 2014, Analog and Embedded Processing revenue grew a combined 12%, with Analog up 13% and Embedded up 12%. We gained market share in both businesses again in 2014. These 2 key businesses were 83% of TI's revenue for the year, up from 79% in 2013. Because they now make up more of our revenue, they're driving top line growth for the company. TI revenue overall grew 7% in 2014.
Now Kevin will review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $1.90 billion or 58% of revenue. Gross profit increased 16% from the year ago quarter. This gross profit reflects higher revenue, increased factory loadings and an improved product portfolio focused on Analog and Embedded Processing that benefits from our efficient manufacturing strategy.
Moving to operating expenses. Combined R&D and SG&A expense of $740 million was down $67 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflects the targeted reductions in Embedded Processing in Japan that were previously announced. That restructuring is now essentially complete, and we achieved a little more than our estimated annualized savings.
Acquisition charges were $82 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, a noncash expense. Restructuring and other charges were a $27 million benefit due to gains on sales of assets. 
Operating profit was $1.10 billion or 33.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 60% from the year-ago quarter. 
Operating margin for Analog was 38.7%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 17.0%, more than doubling from a year ago as we benefit from our investments for growth and as we executed our restructuring plan to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing. While there's a solid progress, we still have work to do in this business. We expect Embedded operating margins to continue to increase as our investments in R&D and SG&A will continue to drive top line growth while we hold these expenses flat.
Net income in the fourth quarter was $825 million or $0.76 per share. As a reminder, earnings per share included a $0.05 benefit for the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit and a benefit of $0.02 from the gains on sales of assets.
Let me now to comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.27 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 117, slightly above our model range but a number that we are quite comfortable with. It is consistent with the growing portion of our product demands being supported with consignment inventory versus customer-owned inventory. We believe these consignment arrangements give us better real-time feedback to end market demand, allowing us to better manage our factories and maintain short lead times. We'll expect consignment inventory to continue to increase over the coming years as distribution becomes a growing portion of our business. We will monitor the appropriateness of our current model of 105 to 115 days of inventory and possibly update this model in the next year or so.
Capital expenditures were $125 million in the quarter. In 2014, cash flow from operations was $3.89 billion, up 15% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $385 million or 3% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue.
Free cash flow for the year was $3.50 billion or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 18% higher than a year ago. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. As we've noted, our intention is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt retirement.
In the fourth quarter, TI paid $356 million in dividends and repurchased $698 million of our stock, for a total return of $1.05 billion. Total cash returned in 2014 was $4.15 billion, which is 3% higher than the prior year. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.3% over the past 12 months and by 39% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash in (sic) are our cash management and our tax practices. We need the fourth -- ended the fourth quarter with $3.54 billion of cash and short-term investments. TI's U.S. entities own 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock.
TI orders in the quarter were $3.18 billion, up 11% from a year ago.
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion in the first quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would increase 7% from a year ago. We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.67. Restructuring charges will be essentially 0. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million to $85 million per quarter for the next 5 years.
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the first quarter and for the year. The rate is higher than last year because of an expected increase in profits and does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.
In summary, the fourth quarter demonstrates the growing strength of TI's business model. Our strategy is anchored in Analog and Embedded Processing and is bolstered by an efficient manufacturing operation and a broad sales channel. The result is a diverse and long-lived positions in many markets. We remain intent on excellence in execution, being disciplined in allocating our capital, and our firm belief that free cash flow per share is the best long-term indicator of shareholder value.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

But given the growth in consignment and the typically seasonally strong 2Q, we expect our factory loadings to increase as we move through the quarter, as I mentioned a moment ago. One of the things to keep in mind when you adjust your factory loadings, if your quarterly loadings are really for the following quarter's expectations, then if you think about the pattern of movement through the quarter, if you take your loadings coming into the fourth quarter, our loadings will be dropping coming into the quarter. And going into the first quarter, our loadings start to increase during the quarter. And so you're always going to have a bit of a lag when you try to track the GPM that follows with that, which I think is what you're asking for there, Stacy.

Third to fourth, that biggest transition sequentially, of course, is due to the change in -- the change of that business. If you look overall, you can look at the components that sit inside of Other. The first is DLP. And I'd described that as a more steady business and one that may have some we'd describe as wild cards of new opportunities. The vast majority of that business is in front projectors today as well as in cinema. And we've got some what we call pico projectors or small form factor projectors that make up the revenue. But there are some opportunities inside of automotive and other embedded opportunities that could provide growth in the future. The next biggest piece of that revenue is calculators. And that business has been, I'd say, flat to maybe slightly down over time. And then royalties have run steady, about $40 million to $50 million a quarter. And that's probably a good thing to look. And then we will have ASIC business that will transition over to EP over time. That is some business that's in communications infrastructure. And we believe that, that will move over.

While we took spending down this past year as a result of the restructuring actions we announced this time a year ago, we didn't eliminate them. The amount that we're investing is still quite high, and that's why the operating profit is still not quite where we think entitlement would take us to. So we continue to invest at quite a healthy level, just not at the level that you saw us invest in, in the prior few years. So those combined, high levels of investment, an expanding product portfolio from heavier levels of investment in the prior few years have all given us very strong growth in that segment and will continue to give us growth. And quite frankly, based upon some of the best-in-class performers that you can look at out there, we have, shall we say, expectations similar to at least as well as those companies are operating."

A lot of our competitors will have half a dozen or a dozen different architectures where they've got to spread their R&D investment over. So we can be very efficient with that. So in addition, if you remember, as part of the Wireless restructuring, we brought over those connectivity products that really already had a pretty significant investment in those Wireless technology. So we're supporting nearly a dozen different Wireless standards today. And that group is really focused on growing the top line rather than having to develop baseline technologies. So that will -- thanks for that question, Vivek."

And those products could be anywhere from $0.75 down to a net goal [ph]. And oftentimes, they may have lives that lived from one generation of a product to another. So those are the types of opportunities that we try to look for in a space like comms equipment. Now certainly from an investment -- incremental investment profile, if we had an extra dollar to spend and we had an opportunity to spend that in either industrial or automotive, those products in general just tend to have longer life cycles and better characteristics. So that may see an increase in investment. And then lastly, I'll just add that those 2 markets, I think, have the secular trends that you're well aware of. So we'll benefit from that as the rest of the industry will. And of course, we hope to benefit disproportionately from those investments. Do you have a follow-on, Jim?"

If you look at those businesses, certainly over the last 5 years, they both have continued to gain share. And we believe that we're continuing to invest, and we've got a lot of room to gain share. In fact, in Analog, we've got 18.3% market share. And inside of Embedded Processing, we've got around 15 percentage points. So lots of headroom to do that.

We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.
Before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that's important to your calendars. We plan to hold a call on February 4 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time to update our capital management strategy. Similar to what we've done in the -- for the last 2 years on this topic, Kevin March will provide insight into our strategy and also answer some of the most frequently asked questions.
Turning to our earnings update. The fourth quarter marked another quarter of strong progress. Our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing grew again, with combined revenue up 13% from a year ago. Revenue of $3.27 billion came in at the middle of the expected range that we communicated to you in October. Earnings per share were $0.76 and included a $0.05 benefit for the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit and a $0.02 benefit from gains on sales of assets. Without these 2 items, our earnings would have been in the middle of our expected range.
In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the year was $3.5 billion, up 18% from a year ago. Free cash flow was 27% of revenue, consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30%. This is a 3-percentage-point increase -- improvement from a year ago period. We believe this reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300-millimeter output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business.
In 2014, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. 
In the fourth quarter, TI revenue grew 8% from a year ago, with growth in both Analog and Embedded Processing.
Analog revenue grew 14% from a year ago, led by Power Management. High Volume Analog & Logic, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog also grew. This is the sixth quarter in a row of year-over-year growth for Analog. 
Embedded Processing revenue grew 11% from a year ago due to growth in processors, microcontrollers and connectivity, each of which increased by about the same amount. It is notable that connectivity grew at the fastest rate as we continue to see more products being connected. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for Embedded Processing.
In our Other segment, revenue declined 14% from a year ago due to legacy Wireless and custom ASIC products.
Turning to distribution. Resales increased 14% from a year ago, consistent with our combined revenue growth of Analog and Embedded Processing. Weeks of inventory decreased by 1 week from a year ago to a historically low level of just under 4.5 weeks. This level has decreased over the past 2 years because we've structurally changed how our inventory is managed in the distribution channel with our consignment program. This quarter, we continue to support more of our distribution sales from consignment inventory and now have about 60% of our distribution revenue on consignment, up about 15 percentage points from a year ago. 
With this program, inventory sits on TI's balance sheet and revenue is recognized when our distributors pull products from our consignment inventory that's stored at the distributors' locations. We carry higher levels of inventory on TI's balance sheet with this program, which has several benefits such as minimizing impact due to changes in distribution channel inventory and giving us greater flexibility to meet customer demand.
Turning to our end markets. In 2014, industrial and automotive combined were 44% of TI's revenue, up a couple of percentage points from last year. Specifically, industrial made up 31% of TI's revenue; automotive, 13%; personal electronics, 29%; communications equipment, 17%; enterprise systems, 6%; and other, 4%. We continue to refine our understanding of our customers' end markets with better tools and software. On our website, we've included the last 2 years of updated market estimates, and we've identified the sectors inside of each of those markets for your reference.
Finally, let me make a few observations about the year overall. For 2014, Analog and Embedded Processing revenue grew a combined 12%, with Analog up 13% and Embedded up 12%. We gained market share in both businesses again in 2014. These 2 key businesses were 83% of TI's revenue for the year, up from 79% in 2013. Because they now make up more of our revenue, they're driving top line growth for the company. TI revenue overall grew 7% in 2014.
Now Kevin will review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $1.90 billion or 58% of revenue. Gross profit increased 16% from the year ago quarter. This gross profit reflects higher revenue, increased factory loadings and an improved product portfolio focused on Analog and Embedded Processing that benefits from our efficient manufacturing strategy.
Moving to operating expenses. Combined R&D and SG&A expense of $740 million was down $67 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflects the targeted reductions in Embedded Processing and Japan that were previously announced. That restructuring is now essentially complete, and we achieved a little more than our estimated annualized savings.
Acquisition charges were $82 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, a noncash expense. Restructuring and other charges were a $27 million benefit due to gains on sales of assets. 
Operating profit was $1.10 billion or 33.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 60% from the year-ago quarter. 
Operating margin for Analog was 38.7%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 17.0%, more than doubling from a year ago as we benefit from our investments for growth and as we executed our restructuring plan to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing. While this is solid progress, we still have work to do in this business. We expect Embedded operating margins to continue to increase as our investments in R&D and SG&A will continue to drive top line growth while we hold these expenses flat.
Net income in the fourth quarter was $825 million or $0.76 per share. As a reminder, earnings per share included a $0.05 benefit for the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit and a benefit of $0.02 from the gains on sales of assets.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.27 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 117, slightly above our model range but a number that we are quite comfortable with. It is consistent with the growing portion of our product demands being supported with consignment inventory versus customer-owned inventory. We believe these consignment arrangements give us better real-time feedback to end-market demand, allowing us to better manage our factories and maintain short lead times. We'll expect consignment inventory to continue to increase over the coming years as distribution becomes a growing portion of our business. We will monitor the appropriateness of our current model of 105 to 115 days of inventory and possibly update this model in the next year or so.
Capital expenditures were $125 million in the quarter. In 2014, cash flow from operations was $3.89 billion, up 15% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $385 million or 3% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue.
Free cash flow for the year was $3.50 billion or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 18% higher than a year ago. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. As we've noted, our intention is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt retirement.
In the fourth quarter, TI paid $356 million in dividends and repurchased $698 million of our stock, for a total return of $1.05 billion. Total cash returned in 2014 was $4.15 billion, which is 3% higher than the prior year. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.3% over the past 12 months and by 39% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash and (sic) [are] our cash management and our tax practices. We need the fourth -- ended the fourth quarter with $3.54 billion of cash and short-term investments. TI's U.S. entities own 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock.
TI orders in the quarter were $3.18 billion, up 11% from a year ago.
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion in the first quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would increase 7% from a year ago. We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.67. Restructuring charges will be essentially 0. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million to $85 million per quarter for the next 5 years.
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the first quarter and for the year. The rate is higher than last year because of an expected increase in profits and does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.
In summary, the fourth quarter demonstrates the growing strength of TI's business model. Our strategy is anchored in Analog and Embedded Processing and is bolstered by an efficient manufacturing operation and a broad sales channel. The result is diverse and long-lived positions in many markets. We remain intent on excellence in execution, being disciplined in allocating our capital, and our firm belief that free cash flow per share is the best long-term indicator of shareholder value.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

So like in a weak market, it might be at the 30% level. In stronger markets, it would be in the 20% level. We're in a pretty good -- we're performing quite well on our markets right now, and so you're seeing that OpEx come down. In fact, most recently, in the second half of 2014, we were running around 23% of revenue. And so I would say that you would want to model us in the lower half of that range as you try to think about how much our OpEx spend will be in 2015."

Let me just talk a little bit more about what our inventory levels might look like and how that might drive us. We don't have an inventory forecast per se. But given the growth in consignment and the typically seasonally strong 2Q, we expect our factory loadings to increase as we move through the quarter, as I mentioned a moment ago. One of the things to keep in mind when you adjust your factory loadings, if your quarterly loadings are really for the following quarter's expectations, then if you think about the pattern of movement through the quarter, if you take your loadings coming into the fourth quarter, our loadings will be dropping coming into the quarter. And going into the first quarter, our loadings start to increase during the quarter. And so you're always going to have a bit of a lag when you try to track the GPM that follows with that, which I think is what you're asking for there, Stacy. I think more importantly, what we see going forward is that our margins we expect to continue to improve, along with our free cash flow, by virtue of the fact that Analog and Embedded Processing continue to become a larger portion of our total revenues and by virtue of the fact that 300-millimeter manufacturing continues to be a larger portion of our total production as we go forward.

The first is DLP. And I'd described that as a more steady business and one that may have some we'd describe as wild cards of new opportunities. The vast majority of that business is in front projectors today as well as in cinema. And we've got some what we call pico projectors or small form-factor projectors that make up the revenue. But there are some opportunities inside of automotive and other embedded opportunities that could provide growth in the future. The next biggest piece of that revenue is calculators. And that business has been, I'd say, flat to maybe slightly down over time. And then royalties have run steady, about $40 million to $50 million a quarter. And that's probably a good thing to look. And then we will have ASIC business that will transition over to EP over time. That is some business that's in communications infrastructure. And we believe that, that will move over.

You may recall that back in late '10 or early '11 time frame, we significantly stepped up our investments in that particular segment in order to accelerate our product introductions and therefore, begin to accelerate our revenue growth. And if you take a look at what happened over the last, as Dave mentioned in his opening remarks, 9 quarters of sequential -- or continuous year-over-year growth, that strategy has paid off. So those products are really beginning to take. And as you know, those kinds of products tend to have very long shelf lives. So we expect to see more of the same on that. While we took spending down this past year as a result of the restructuring actions we announced this time a year ago, we didn't eliminate them. The amount that we're investing is still quite high, and that's why the operating profit is still not quite where we think entitlement would take us to. So we continue to invest at quite a healthy level, just not at the level that you saw us invest in, in the prior few years.

Craig, one thing I'm recommending you maybe take a look at, if you do look at those 2 segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, their quarterly growth rates, I think that was the point you were making, they can vary quite markedly from one another. If you look at the 2 of them on a year-over-year basis, they actually are much more correlated than you might expect. They're both gaining share, as Dave was mentioning, and they're both growing quite nicely on a year-over-year basis. So if you do some measurements for those 2 segments on year-over-year growth rates and compare that back over the last half dozen quarters or so, I think you might be pleasantly surprised to see they grow pretty similar to each other."

As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations",849,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI strolls to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Revenue growth of 6% from a year ago was within the range of expectations we provided in January. Automotive and industrial markets were strong as we expected they would be. However, revenue was in the bottom half of the range for 2 reasons: First, was weak demand in the last month of the quarter in our personal electronics market, particularly PCs and in our communications market, particularly Wireless infrastructure equipment. We believe these market specific issues were due to delay of investments by carriers and capacity upgrades for wireless infrastructure equipment and a weaker-than-expected refresh cycle for Windows XP.
The second reason a steep decline in the current exchange rate for the euro relative to the U.S. dollar. The euro dropped about 10% during the quarter and even though only about 5% of TI's revenues transacted in euros, it was a sharp enough drop that it negatively impacted our revenue by about $20 million more than we had anticipated.
Even with these pockets of weaknesses, our core business of Analog and Embedded Processing turned in their seventh and 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, respectively. Combined, these businesses grew 9% every were 86% of our total revenue.
Earnings per share were $0.61, reflecting our continued attention to cost controls. Although the vast majority of our revenue was transacted in U,S. dollar, ROE negatively impacted revenues by $20 million which translated to only about $5 million of impact to earnings and therefore, cash flow. This is due to a partial natural hedge against negative currency fluctuations due to our non-U.S.-based operations. It's nice to have a position -- to be in this when you have almost 90% of our revenue comes outside of the U.S.
With that, as a backdrop, Kevin and I will move on with our report on business performance that we believe continues to represent the ongoing strength of TI's business model.
In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $609 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.6 billion, up 17% from the year ago.
Free cash flow was 27% of consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. This is a 2-percentage-point improvement from a year ago period and we believe reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300-millimeter output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand.
We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if its returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business.
For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends.
In the first quarter, TI revenue grew 6% from a year ago with growth in both Analog and Embedded Processing. Analog revenue grew 11% from a year ago, primarily due to Power Management and High Volume Analog & Logic. Silicon Valley Analog and High Performance Analog also grew. As we mentioned earlier, this is the seventh quarter of year-over-year growth for Analog.
Embedded Processing revenue grew 2% from a year ago due to microcontrollers and connectivity. Processor revenue declined, which is impacted by the weakness in Wireless infrastructure. And again as I mentioned earlier, this is the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for Embedded Processing.
In our Other segment, revenue declined 10% a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC products, which also are heavy in Wireless infrastructure as well as DLP products.
In distribution, resales increased 11% from a year ago. Weeks of inventory remained at historically low levels of just under 4.5 weeks, which is a decrease by more than a week from a year ago and is even with the fourth quarter. This level has decreased over the past few years because we have structurally changed how our inventory in the distribution channel with our consignment program.
From an end-market perspective versus a year ago, automotive grew, with most sectors inside this market, growing at double sector rates. Industrial had broad-based growth. Personal electronics group, although growth PCs was lower than we expected. Communications equipment declined due to Wireless infrastructure and enterprise systems group.
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit increased to 13% from the year-ago quarter and gross margin was up almost 4 points. Gross profit reflects higher revenue, increased factory loadings and benefits from our efficient manufacturing strategy as we build more Analog chips on 300-millimeter wafers.
Moving to operating expenses. Combined R&D and SG&A expenses of $777 million were down $68 million from the year ago. The decline primarily reflects the targeted reductions in Embedded Processing in Japan that were previously announced. As we said, that restructuring was essentially complete at the end of last year.
Acquisition charges were $83 million, almost all of which with the ongoing of the amortization of intangibles, which is noncash expense. Operating profit was $958 million or 30.4% of revenue. Operating profit was up 39% in the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 35.4%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 18.3%, more than doubling from a year ago, as we executed our restructuring plan to better align resources with the opportunities we are pursuing an important for growth.
Net income in the first quarter was $656 million or $0.61 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $609 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 124, about 3 days more than planned due to revenue coming in at the bottom half of our expectations. Capital expenditures were $123 million in the quarter.
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow operations was $4.04 billion, up 16% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $431 million or 3% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectations for capital expenditures were to be about 4% of revenue, which includes our $8 billion 300-millimeter Analog plan discussed our recent capital mentioned call.
Free cash flow in the past 12 months was $3.61 billion or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 17% higher than a year ago. As we said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds we receive from the exercise of equity compensation minus net debt retirement.
In the first quarter, TI paid $356 million in dividend and repurchased $670 million of our stock for a total return of $1.03 billion. Total cash returned in the past 12 months was $4.14 billion.
Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.2% over the past 12 months and by 39% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter with $3.30 billion of cash and short-term investments. TI's U.S. entities owned 80% -- 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock.
TI orders in the quarter were $3.21 billion, up 5% from a year ago.
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.12 billion to $3.38 billion in the second quarter. This represents continuing weakness in our communications equipment and personal electronics markets, particularly for Wireless infrastructure and PCs, respectively. We also do not expect a near-term rebound in foreign currency exchange rates.
We expect second quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.70. Acquisition charges, which are our noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million to $85 million per quarter for the next 5 years.
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate for 2015 remains about 30%, and this is the tax rate your should use for the second quarter and for the year.
In summary, we believe that the first quarter demonstrates the strength of TI's business model. While we are not immune to demand and currency changes, their effects are softened by the diversity of our portfolio and our markets.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

And those advantages include that we've got the broadest portfolio in the industry, which really means engineered design work by looking at us first. We enjoy very low cost manufacturing for all the reasons that you've heard us talk about for the last few years, including our 300-millimeter wafer fabs. We've got the broader sales channel, in fact, probably 3x to 4x larger than our nearest competitor. And we play in an [indiscernible] diverse set of markets with long-live products that enjoy significant cash return for our shareholders in the long time.

So there's usually a significant build as OEMs are planning to bid for the operators spend, and then it typically surprises us and there's an overbuild that occurs. So 1 kind that begets the other. We think that the Wireless infrastructure market obviously, long term is a good market for us and we've got a good position in. And just as the numbers come down, they'll come up again 1 day. On the PC side, that's only a couple of percent of our revenues. I don't think we really have any unique insight on that. We believe that, that weakness is due to the inventory that's created because there wasn't as much demand in the XP refresh cycle. But really nothing, nothing beyond that. And we'll see how the rest of this quarter goes before we start making predictions on the back half. I'll just take it 1 quarter at a time. So you have a follow-on?"

So I have no history from which to try to get a reference point to answer your question like that. I think, we're just all going to have to wait and see where this takes us. I think, the encouraging part is, especially in industrial and automotive, is that the silicon content going to those spaces continues to increase year-over-year. And so despite ROE impacts, I don't think that's going to slow down the silicon content increase on those spaces. And frankly, if you look at the pricing of those end equipment, the cost of a $0.50 Analog chip going to $0.55 is pretty irrelevant to an automotive customer, I think. So if -- if you look at the more macro effects and especially where we see growth from semiconductors and auto and industrial, it doesn't seem likely that we would see a sharp impact in demand cause just because of ROE. There may be other factors that may lead to that kind of difference."

As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations",851,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Revenue growth of 6% from a year ago was within the range of expectations we provided in January. Automotive and industrial markets were strong, as we expected they would be. However, revenue was in the bottom half of the range for 2 reasons. First was weak demand in the last month of the quarter in our personal electronics market, particularly PCs, and in our communications equipment market, particularly wireless infrastructure equipment. We believe these market-specific issues were due to delay of investments by carriers in capacity upgrades for wireless infrastructure equipment and a weaker-than-expected refresh cycle for Windows XP.
The second reason was a steep decline in the currency exchange rate for the euro relative to the U.S. dollar. The euro dropped about 10% during the quarter, and even though only about 5% of TI's revenue is transacted in euros, it was a sharp enough drop that it negatively impacted our revenue by about $20 million more than we had anticipated.
Even with these pockets of weaknesses, our core business of Analog and Embedded Processing turned in their seventh and 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, respectively. Combined, these businesses grew 9% and were 86% of our total revenue.
Earnings per share were $0.61, reflecting our continued attention to cost controls. Although the vast majority of our revenue was transacted in U.S. dollars, ROE negatively impacted revenue by $20 million, which translated to only about $5 million of impact to earnings and, therefore, cash flow. This is due to a partial natural hedge against negative currency fluctuations due to our non-U.S.-based operations. It's nice to have a position -- to be in this when you have almost 90% of our revenue comes outside of the U.S.
With that as backdrop, Kevin and I will move on with our report on business performance that we believe continues to represent the ongoing strength of TI's business model.
In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $609 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.6 billion, up 17% from a year ago.
Free cash flow was 27% revenue, consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. This is a 2-percentage-point improvement from a year-ago period and we believe reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300-millimeter output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand.
We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the businesses. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends.
In the first quarter, TI revenue grew 6% from a year ago with growth in both Analog and Embedded Processing. 
Analog revenue grew 11% from a year ago, primarily due to Power Management and High Volume Analog & Logic. Silicon Valley Analog and High Performance Analog also grew. As we mentioned earlier, this is the seventh quarter of year-over-year growth for Analog.
Embedded Processing revenue grew 2% from a year ago due to Microcontrollers and Connectivity. Processor revenue declined, which was impacted by the weakness in wireless infrastructure. And again, as I mentioned earlier, this is the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for Embedded Processing.
In our Other segment, revenue declined 10% from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC products, which also are heavy in wireless infrastructure, as well as DLP products.
In distribution, resales increased 11% from a year ago. Weeks of inventory remained at historically low levels of just under 4.5 weeks, which is a decrease by more than a week from a year ago and is even with the fourth quarter. This level has decreased over the past few years because we have structurally changed how our inventory is managed in the distribution channel with our consignment program.
From an end-market perspective versus a year ago, automotive grew, with most sectors inside this market growing at double-digit rates; industrial had broad-based growth; personal electronics grew, although growth in PCs was lower than we expected; communications equipment declined due to wireless infrastructure; and enterprise systems grew.
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit increased 13% from the year-ago quarter and gross margin was up almost 4 points. Gross profit reflects higher revenue, increased factory loadings and benefits from our efficient manufacturing strategy as we build more Analog chips on 300-millimeter wafers.
Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expenses of $777 million were down $68 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflects the targeted reductions in Embedded Processing in Japan that were previously announced. As we said, that restructuring was essentially complete at the end of last year.
Acquisition charges were $83 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $958 million or 30.4% of revenue. Operating profit was up 39% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 35.4%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 18.3%, more than doubling from a year ago as we executed our restructuring plan to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing as we benefit from our investments for growth.
Net income in the first quarter was $656 million or $0.61 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. 
Cash flow from operations was $609 million in the quarter. 
Inventory days were 124, about 3 days more than planned due to revenue coming in at the bottom half of our expectations. 
Capital expenditures were $123 million in the quarter.
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow operations was $4.04 billion, up 16% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $431 million or 3% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes our $8 billion 300-millimeter Analog plan discussed our recent capital mentioned call.
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.61 billion or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 17% higher than a year ago. 
As we said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from the exercise of equity compensation minus net debt retirement.
In the first quarter, TI paid $356 million in dividends and repurchased $670 million of our stock for a total return of $1.03 billion. Total cash returned in the past 12 months was $4.14 billion.
Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.2% over the past 12 months and by 39% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter with $3.30 billion of cash and short-term investments. TI's U.S. entities owned 80% -- 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock.
TI orders in the quarter were $3.21 billion, up 5% from a year ago.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.12 billion to $3.38 billion in the second quarter. This represents continuing weakness in our communications equipment and personal electronics markets, particularly for wireless infrastructure equipment and PCs, respectively. We also do not expect a near-term rebound in foreign currency exchange rates.
We expect second quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.70. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million to $85 million per quarter for the next 5 years.
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 remains about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the second quarter and for the year.
In summary, we believe that the first quarter demonstrates the strength of TI's business model. While we are not immune to demand and currency changes, their effects are softened by the diversity of our portfolio and our markets.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

So as you kind of tick through the things that you typically look at from a cyclical standpoint, we look at channel inventories are down a week from a year ago, they're lean at just under 4.5 weeks. Lead times are remaining consistent. Our cancellations and reschedules are very low. In addition, we're continuing to deliver on time and very consistently with that. So we've got a couple of pockets of weaker-than-expected demand, as we talked about specifically in wireless infrastructure and PCs. At the same time, we're seeing automotive and industrial continuing to be strong as we expect. So that's what we know, that's what we can see. The debates will continue on, on how cyclical our industry will be or won't be."

And those advantages include that we've got the broadest portfolio in the industry, which really means engineers start their design work by looking at us first. We enjoy a very low cost manufacturing for all the reasons that you've heard us talk about for the last few years, including our 300-millimeter wafer fabs. We have the broadest sales channel, in fact, probably 3x to 4x larger than our nearest competitor. And we play in an extremely diverse set of markets with long-lived products that enjoy a significant cash return for our shareholders for a long time. So we think that's what's really important to deal with whatever may be happening in market cycles and just really make sure that we're a lot more competitively advantaged than everybody else."

So again, very, very broad. Of course, we'll always see pockets of strength and weaknesses. But overall, that industrial is doing well. We've seen growth in almost all those sectors that I've described. Okay, thank you."

If you remember, it was benefiting from several world events, one of them like the World Cup. Well, that won't repeat, so that'll be weaker than it was a year ago and will continue for the rest of the year. But inside of that bucket, we'll continue to have puts and takes.

The yen is down 14%. We roughly average about 5% of our revenue in euros and around 3% in yen. So clearly with that kind of weakness, on a year-over-year compare, that's going to continue to be an issue that's going to just affect that kind of math. It doesn't affect our ability to sell in those markets. We'll continue to remain very competitive in those spaces as we enjoy a lot of design wins. But unless the ROE moves back and the dollar weakens, then certainly with that kind of dramatic decline in those 2 major currencies, that will be, at least on the fringes, a year-over-year compare headwind for us."

Those pay and benefit increases kick in, in February. So it's really only 2 months' worth inside the OpEx right now in the first quarter. So we'll have the full 3 months. So you'll see just a very slight increase going into the second quarter."

But clearly, as we move to more and more consignment, as we move to keeping lead times very short across the vast abundance of our portfolio, that dictates that we've got to carry more inventory than we have in the past.

I think the encouraging part is, especially in industrial and automotive, is that the silicon content going into those spaces continues to increase year-over-year. And so despite ROE impacts, I don't think that's going to slow down the silicon content increases in those spaces. And frankly, if you look at the pricing of those end equipment, the cost of a $0.50 Analog chip going to $0.55 is pretty irrelevant to an automotive customer, I think. So if -- if you look at the more macro effects and especially where we see growth from semiconductors and auto and industrial, it doesn't seem likely that we would see a sharp impact in demand caused just because of ROE.

I will remind you though on the Capital Management call, I did discuss for our fab in particular, that we have the majority of equipment necessary to support the buildout of that factory to a $5 billion revenue level. And that, in 2014, we had achieved about $2 billion worth of build for revenue in support of that. So call that roughly 40% utilized. But at the same time, we're also converting DMOS6 from its exclusive use by Embedded Processing to also be able to be used by Analog. And that'll add another $3 billion of 300-millimeter Analog capacity in DMOS6. So you could say in a sense that our utilization of 300-millimeter may actually decline, but that's not because of loadings, that's because of increasing our capacity."

As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Revenue growth of 6% from a year ago was within the range of expectations we provided in January. Automotive and industrial markets were strong, as we expected they would be. However, revenue was in the bottom half of the range for 2 reasons. First was weak demand in the last month of the quarter in our personal electronics market, particularly PCs, and in our communications equipment market, particularly wireless infrastructure equipment. We believe these market-specific issues were due to delay of investments by carriers in capacity upgrades for wireless infrastructure equipment and a weaker-than-expected refresh cycle for Windows XP.
The second reason was a steep decline in the currency exchange rate for the euro relative to the U.S. dollar. The euro dropped about 10% during the quarter, and even though only about 5% of TI's revenue is transacted in euros, it was a sharp enough drop that it negatively impacted our revenue by about $20 million more than we had anticipated.
Even with these pockets of weaknesses, our core business of Analog and Embedded Processing turned in their seventh and 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, respectively. Combined, these businesses grew 9% and were 86% of our total revenue.
Earnings per share were $0.61, reflecting our continued attention to cost controls. Although the vast majority of our revenue was transacted in U.S. dollars, ROE negatively impacted revenue by $20 million, which translated to only about $5 million of impact to earnings and, therefore, cash flow. This is due to a partial natural hedge against negative currency fluctuations due to our non-U.S.-based operations. It's nice to have a position -- to be in this when you have almost 90% of our revenue comes outside of the U.S.
With that as backdrop, Kevin and I will move on with our report on business performance that we believe continues to represent the ongoing strength of TI's business model.
In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $609 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.6 billion, up 17% from a year ago.
Free cash flow was 27% of revenue, consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. This is a 2-percentage-point improvement from a year-ago period and we believe reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300-millimeter output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand.
We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the businesses. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends.
In the first quarter, TI revenue grew 6% from a year ago with growth in both Analog and Embedded Processing. 
Analog revenue grew 11% from a year ago, primarily due to Power Management and High Volume Analog & Logic. Silicon Valley Analog and High Performance Analog also grew. As we mentioned earlier, this is the seventh quarter of year-over-year growth for Analog.
Embedded Processing revenue grew 2% from a year ago due to Microcontrollers and Connectivity. Processor revenue declined, which was impacted by the weakness in wireless infrastructure. And again, as I mentioned earlier, this is the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for Embedded Processing.
In our Other segment, revenue declined 10% from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC products, which also are heavy in wireless infrastructure, as well as DLP products.
In distribution, resales increased 11% from a year ago. Weeks of inventory remained at historically low levels of just under 4.5 weeks, which is a decrease by more than 1 week from 1 year ago and is even with the fourth quarter. This level has decreased over the past few years because we have structurally changed how our inventory is managed in the distribution channel with our consignment program.
From an end-market perspective versus a year ago, automotive grew, with most sectors inside this market growing at double-digit rates; industrial had broad-based growth; personal electronics grew, although growth in PCs was lower than we expected; communications equipment declined due to wireless infrastructure; and enterprise systems grew.
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit increased 13% from the year-ago quarter and gross margin was up almost 4 points. Gross profit reflects higher revenue, increased factory loadings and benefits from our efficient manufacturing strategy as we build more Analog chips on 300-millimeter wafers.
Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expenses of $777 million were down $68 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflects the targeted reductions in Embedded Processing in Japan that were previously announced. As we said, that restructuring was essentially complete at the end of last year.
Acquisition charges were $83 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $958 million or 30.4% of revenue. Operating profit was up 39% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 35.4%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 18.3%, more than doubling from a year ago as we executed our restructuring plan to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing as we benefit from our investments for growth.
Net income in the first quarter was $656 million or $0.61 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. 
Cash flow from operations was $609 million in the quarter. 
Inventory days were 124, about 3 days more than planned due to revenue coming in at the bottom half of our expectations. 
Capital expenditures were $123 million in the quarter.
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.04 billion, up 16% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $431 million or 3% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes our $8 billion 300-millimeter Analog plan discussed our recent capital mentioned call.
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.61 billion or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 17% higher than a year ago. 
As we said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from the exercise of equity compensation minus net debt retirement.
In the first quarter, TI paid $356 million in dividends and repurchased $670 million of our stock for a total return of $1.03 billion. Total cash returned in the past 12 months was $4.14 billion.
Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.2% over the past 12 months and by 39% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter with $3.30 billion of cash and short-term investments. TI's U.S. entities owned 80% -- 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock.
TI orders in the quarter were $3.21 billion, up 5% from a year ago.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.12 billion to $3.38 billion in the second quarter. This represents continuing weakness in our communications equipment and personal electronics markets, particularly for wireless infrastructure equipment and PCs, respectively. We also do not expect a near-term rebound in foreign currency exchange rates.
We expect second quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.70. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million to $85 million per quarter for the next 5 years.
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 remains about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the second quarter and for the year.
In summary, we believe that the first quarter demonstrates the strength of TI's business model. While we are not immune to demand and currency changes, their effects are softened by the diversity of our portfolio and our markets.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

And obviously, we're not assuming that we see a rebound in those rates. We'll still see and expect to see the weakness in PCs and wireless infrastructure. And kind of the balance of the business is, as you know, there's always puts and takes. As an example, second quarter a year ago, DLP was very strong. If you remember, it was benefiting from several world events, one of them like the World Cup. Well, that won't repeat, so that'll be weaker than it was a year ago and will continue for the rest of the year. But inside of that bucket, we'll continue to have puts and takes. Do you have a -- the other comment that I'd just made on that, although we see those pockets of weakness, if you look at the core businesses of Analog and Embedded, we do believe that those will continue to perform well.

The yen is down 14%. We roughly average about 5% of our revenue in euros and around 3% in yen. So clearly with that kind of weakness, on a year-over-year compare, that's going to continue to be an issue that's going to just affect that kind of math. It doesn't affect our ability to sell in those markets. We continue to remain very competitive in those spaces as we enjoy a lot of design wins. But unless the ROE moves back and the dollar weakens, then certainly with that kind of dramatic decline in those 2 major currencies, that will be, at least on the fringes, a year-over-year compare headwind for us."

We are going to use 2015 to really kind of monitor the effect of all the changes we've been doing with the portfolio and with our operations to model what we think is a more appropriate overall level of average inventories to carry. What we did conclude was that the prior model, which has worked for us quite well, of 105 to 115 days was appropriate given the mix that we had. But clearly, as we move to more and more consignment, as we move to keeping lead times very short across the vast abundance of our portfolio, that dictates that we've got to carry more inventory than we have in the past. And so what we use in 2015 to run various tests on what the appropriate level of inventories are to meet the service metrics that our customers have come to expect from us. And then probably by the time we get to early next year when we do our capital management update, we'll go ahead and articulate a new model at that point in time."

So I have no history from which to try to get a reference point to answer a question like that. I think we're just all going to have to wait and see where this takes us. I think the encouraging part is, especially in industrial and automotive, is that the silicon content going into those spaces continues to increase year-over-year. And so despite ROE impacts, I don't think that's going to slow down the silicon content increases in those spaces. And frankly, if you look at the pricing of those end equipments, the cost of a $0.50 Analog chip going to $0.55 is pretty irrelevant to an automotive customer, I think. So if -- if you look at the more macro effects and especially where we see growth for semiconductors and auto and industrial, it doesn't seem likely that we would see a sharp impact in demand caused just because of ROE. There may be other factors that may lead to that kind of difference."

But at the same time, we're also converting DMOS6 from its exclusive use by Embedded Processing to also be able to be used by Analog.

As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue declined 2% from a year ago, inclusive of notably weak demand in communications equipment and continued strong demand in automotive. In the quarter, we also had about a $45 million negative impact year-over-year from currency exchange rates as expected. Even in this environment, our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing, together grew slightly year-over-year and comprised 85% of second quarter revenue. 
Analog delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Earnings per share were $0.65, up $0.03 from a year ago with that, backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model.
In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $820 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.6 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 27% of revenue, consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30%. This is a 2 percentage point improvement from a year ago period and we believe reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy. The latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand. 
We also believe that free cash flow will only be valued at its return to shareholders or productively invested in the business. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends.
Analog revenue grew 3% from a year ago due to High Volume Analog & Logic. Our management also grew, Silicon Valley Analog was even and High Performance Analog declined. As mentioned earlier, this is the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for Analog. Embedded Processing revenue declined 2% from a year ago, after 10 consecutive quarters of year-on-year growth. This decline was due to the weakness in wireless infrastructure equipment for the Processor product line. In contrast, the Connectivity and Microcontroller product lines grew. 
In our Other segment, revenue declined 17% from a year ago due to custom basic products, which are highly concentrated in Wireless infrastructure equipment. DLP products also declined while calculators grew. In distribution, resales increased 8% from a year ago. Weeks of inventory decreased by 1 week to just above 3.5 weeks, which is a historically low level. We believe this inventory level reflects an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times, which together drive have high customer service metrics. It's also important to note that inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years because we've structurally changed how inventory is managed with our consignment program. 
Now I'll provide some insight into our revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago, which in total, resulted in the revenue in the bottom half of our range due to more significant softness in communications equipment and incremental softness in industrial. Specifically, by end market, automotive had strong growth with almost all sectors inside this market growing at double-digit rates. Industrial revenue was about flat in contrast to last quarter's year-over-year growth and was incrementally weaker than we expected. More specifically, there was growth in about half the sectors inside of industrial, but these were offset by declines in others. 
Personal electronics grew, in total, due to 1 large customer. Outside of this customer, almost every sector inside the personal electronics declined, including PCs as we expected. Communications equipment declined primarily due to the Wireless Infrastructure sector, which was down about 50% from a year ago, even weaker than we had expected going into the quarter. And enterprise systems declined due to DLP projectors as we had expected. 
In general, as we look through the third quarter, the strength and demand varies by end markets, but our market in total is expected to be weaker year-over-year and our outlook for TI revenue and earnings is consistent with this environment. While we don't control the near-term environment of our markets, we do control the focus on making TI stronger through our approach to manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. These 4 attributes, taken together, are at the core of what makes TI unique and capable of long-term free cash flow growth. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."
140283,278350268,836104,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2015",2015-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Texas Instruments Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.88 billion or 58.2% of revenue. Gross profit was even from a year ago quarter despite lower revenue as we benefited from lower manufacturing costs. Gross margin was up 110 basi",876,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.88 billion or 58.2% of revenue. Gross profit was even from a year ago quarter despite lower revenue as we benefited from lower manufacturing costs. Gross margin was up 110 basis points. 
Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expenses of $790 million, down $31 million from a year ago. The decline reflects the targeted reductions in Embedded Processing in Japan, which have been completed. Acquisition charges were $82 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $1.01 billion, up 3% from the year-ago quarter. Operating profit margin was 31.3% of revenue, up 150 basis points from a year ago. Operating profit margin for Analog was 35.5%. Operating profit margin for Embedded Processing was 19.6%, almost 5 percentage points higher from a year ago, as we focus our investments for growth and now see the benefit from our plan to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing. Net income in the second quarter was $696 million or $0.65 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $820 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 126, as we had expected. our business model has evolved, we continue to evaluate our inventory model. Capital expenditures were $125 million in the quarter. 
As a reminder, in April, we retired $250 million of debt. In addition, we issued $500 million of 5-year debt at a coupon rate of 1.75%, including the $750 million of debt due in August of this year, we'll have retired $1 billion while having issued $500 million in debt this year. This is consistent with our practice over the past few years. This will leave total debt of $4.125 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.3%. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.1 billion, up 14% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $476 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes a 300-millimeter Analog plan, discussed in our February capital management call. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.61 billion or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 13% higher than a year ago. 
As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or productively invested in the businesses. And it is noted, our interest to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from the exercise of equity compensation minus net debt retirement. 
In the second quarter, we paid $354 million in dividends and repurchased $654 million of our stock for a total return of $1.01 billion. Total cash returned in the past 12 months was $4.08 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.1% over the past 12 months and by 40% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the second quarter with $3.31 billion of cash and short-term investments. TI's U.S. entities own 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI's orders in the quarter were $3.26 billion, down 2% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.15 billion to $3.41 billion in the third quarter. As we said, while strength in demand varies by end markets, our market in total, is expected to be weaker year-over-year in the third quarter than it was in the second. This includes a negative impact of about $40 million due to the changes in currency exchange rates. We expect third quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.72. 
Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charge, will remain even and hold at about $80 million per quarter until the third quarter of 2019. It will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 remains about 30% and this is the tax rate you should use for the third quarter and for the year. 
In summary, even a weaker market environment such as we saw in the second quarter and expect in the third, our business model, which is built upon the 4 attributes that Dave mentioned earlier, delivered strong free cash flow. As a reminder, these attributes are our approach to manufacturing technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. We believe these attributes in combination are unique to TI and they are sustainable, giving us the ability to provide continued return to our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave"

I think that what we're seeing right now is basically customers adjusting their expectations as to the growth rates for the remainder of the year, and just pointing down a little bit on where they're at. We actually believe that what we're seeing is more a symptom of like a macro-based kind of events. Barkers get a bit more cautious especially with all the news flow in the financial markets, things you heard in Europe and you heard of China. But the fact is, the signs that we're seeing suggest to us that we're in a traditional kind of market macro-driven, not necessarily a semicycle per se. We continue to see lead times reflect work, cancellations remain low, inventory at historically low levels as Dave mentioned. So all things put together, I think what we're just seeing is a growth rate on a macro level that's probably slower going into the second half than what people thought coming into the first half. As for comparisons in 2011 and 2012, there were too many things going on back then. We had earthquake events in Japan, if I can recall. We had flooding in Thailand. I don't think there's really comparable events that we can talk about on that front, Cris."

Industrial revenue was flat just contrasting that to last quarter's year-over-year growth. We didn't see growth there and it was incrementally weaker than we had expected. And as we had talked about inside of there, we really saw about half of the sectors increase. And that of course, was offset by declines in the other sectors. Our personal electronics, as we talked about, grew in total, due to specifically 1 large customer. And outside of the customer, actually saw almost every sector decline, including PCs as we were expected. Comms infrastructure, as we mentioned, was impacted by -- or comps equipment was impacted by Wireless infrastructure and that was down 50% from a year ago. So, and that actually was weaker than what we had expected when we started the quarter. And then the last, enterprise systems declined due to DLP projectors as we had expected. So that's kind of a summary of what we saw by end market. So thanks, Chris."

It's then a question of, what do you think GDP is going to do over the long-term? The global GDP. And clearly, it does appear that in certainly in the last 3 or 4 years and probably the next few years, it has been slower than what we saw in the prior decade or decade before that. So the overall industry, again in our view, will probably grow at about 2x global GDP and the global GDP is the real wild card here. Its trying to figure out how fast that will grow and we're preparing ourselves for the fact that it probably doesn't see any robust growth to help us and therefore, we have to focus on execution to making ourselves stronger internally."

More of it will be in third quarter. But we also had lower overall manufacturing cost, as we begin to see depreciation starting to slowly trickle off. We're becoming much more efficient and our factories were getting more and more of our revenue off of much lower cost, 300-millimeter.

We have dialed back some of the investments a year or so ago, inside of Embedded Processing, but that's really a view that, that market over time, that carrier CapEx won't -- isn't going to go up, that it probably will decline slightly as we look over the next 5 and 10 years, and perhaps longer. But carrier CapEx isn't going to 0, and that revenue will return. It has been notoriously just a choppy market and it's just the dynamics of the market, the way the tenders go out and the way the OEMs have to prepare to deliver that product.

So that's probably a secular growth market that I would suggest would probably add for a decade or more. So that's a great opportunity for the industry in general and for us, in particular because we've been focused there for a number of years now. And then there's the broader industrial market where we're seeing an increase in usage of semiconductors and equipments in those markets that simply we've never used before. And as people are using semiconductor in those spaces, they're finding new applications and needs for more semiconductors.

I don't think it's going to be mechanically imposed into a formula with precision. As we look out for the reasons that we talked about, increasing penetration in certain markets, especially in auto and industrial, that will continue to require some magnitude of content and there'll be growth inside that.

For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue declined 2% from a year ago, inclusive of notably weak demand in communications equipment and continued strong demand in automotive. In the quarter, we also had about a $45 million negative impact year-over-year from currency exchange rates, as expected. Even in this environment, our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing together grew slightly year-over-year and comprised 85% of second quarter revenue. 
Analog delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Earnings per share were $0.65, up $0.03 from a year ago. With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model.
In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $820 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.6 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 27% of revenue, consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30%. This is a 2 percentage point improvement from a year ago period and we believe reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy. The latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand. 
We also believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends.
Analog revenue grew 3% from a year ago due to High Volume Analog & Logic. Power Management also grew. Silicon Valley Analog was even and High Performance Analog declined. As mentioned earlier, this is the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for Analog. Embedded Processing revenue declined 2% from a year ago, after 10 consecutive quarters of year-on-year growth. This decline was due to the weakness in wireless infrastructure equipment for the Processor product line. In contrast, the Connectivity and Microcontroller product lines grew. 
In our Other segment, revenue declined 17% from a year ago due to custom ASIC products, which are highly concentrated in wireless infrastructure equipment. DLP products also declined while calculators grew. In distribution, resales increased 8% from a year ago. Weeks of inventory decreased by 1 week to just above 3.5 weeks, which is a historically low level. We believe this inventory level reflects an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times, which together drive high customer service metrics. It's also important to note that inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years because we've structurally changed how inventory is managed with our consignment program. 
Now I'll provide some insight into our revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago, which in total, resulted in the revenue in the bottom half of our range due to more significant softness in communications equipment and incremental softness in industrial. Specifically, by end market, automotive had strong growth with almost all sectors inside this market growing at double-digit rates. Industrial revenue was about flat in contrast to last quarter's year-over-year growth and was incrementally weaker than we expected. More specifically, there was growth in about half the sectors inside of industrial, but these were offset by declines in others. 
Personal electronics grew, in total, due to 1 large customer. Outside of this customer, almost every sector inside of personal electronics declined, including PCs, as we expected. Communications equipment declined, primarily due to the wireless infrastructure sector, which was down about 50% from a year ago, even weaker than we had expected going into the quarter. And enterprise systems declined due to DLP projectors, as we had expected. 
In general, as we look to the third quarter, the strength in demand varies by end markets, but our market in total is expected to be weaker year-over-year and our outlook for TI revenue and earnings is consistent with this environment. While we don't control the near-term environment of our markets, we do control the focus on making TI stronger through our approach to manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. These 4 attributes, taken together, are at the core of what makes TI unique and capable of long-term free cash flow growth. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit was even from the year ago quarter despite lower revenue, as we benefited from lower manufacturing costs. Gross margin was up 110 basis points. 
Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expenses of $790 million, were down $31 million from a year ago. The decline reflects the targeted reductions in Embedded Processing in Japan, which have been completed. Acquisition charges were $82 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $1.01 billion, up 3% from the year-ago quarter. Operating profit margin was 31.3% of revenue, up 150 basis points from a year ago. Operating profit margin for Analog was 35.5%. Operating profit margin for Embedded Processing was 19.6%, almost 5 percentage points higher from a year ago, as we focused our investments for growth and now see the benefit from our plan to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing. Net income in the second quarter was $696 million or $0.65 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $820 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 126, as we had expected. As our business model has evolved, we continue to evaluate our inventory model. Capital expenditures were $125 million in the quarter. 
As a reminder, in April, we retired $250 million of debt. In addition, we issued $500 million of 5-year debt at a coupon rate of 1.75%. Including the $750 million of debt due in August of this year, we'll have retired $1 billion, while having issued $500 million in debt this year. This is consistent with our practice over the past few years. This will leave total debt of $4.125 billion, with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.3%. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.1 billion, up 14% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $476 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes a 300-millimeter Analog plan discussed in our February capital management call. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.61 billion or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 13% higher than a year ago. 
As we said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or productively invested in the businesses. And as we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from the exercise of equity compensation, minus net debt retirement. 
In the second quarter, we paid $354 million in dividends and repurchased $654 million of our stock for a total return of $1.01 billion. Total cash returned in the past 12 months was $4.08 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.1% over the past 12 months and by 40% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the second quarter with $3.31 billion of cash and short-term investments. TI's U.S. entities own 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI's orders in the quarter were $3.26 billion, down 2% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.15 billion to $3.41 billion in the third quarter. As we said, while strength in demand varies by end markets, our market in total is expected to be weaker year-over-year in the third quarter than it was in the second. This includes a negative impact of about $40 million due to the changes in currency exchange rates. We expect third quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.72. 
Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charge, will remain even and hold at about $80 million per quarter until the third quarter of 2019. It will then decline to about $15 million per quarter for 2 additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 remains about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the third quarter and for the year. 
In summary, even in a weaker market environment such as we saw in the second quarter and expect in the third, our business model, which is built upon the 4 attributes that Dave mentioned earlier, delivered strong free cash flow. As a reminder, these attributes are our approach to manufacturing technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. We believe these attributes in combination are unique to TI and they are sustainable, giving us the ability to provide continuing returns to our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave"

I think that what we're seeing right now is basically customers adjusting their expectations as to the growth rates for the remainder of the year and just toning down a little bit on where they're at. We actually believe that what we're seeing is more a symptom of like a macro-based kind of events. Markets getting a bit more cautious, especially with all the news flow in the financial markets, things you heard in Europe, things you heard in China. But the fact is the signs that we're seeing suggest to us that we're in a traditional kind of market macro-driven, not necessarily a semi-cycle per se. We continue to see lead times reflect work, cancellations remain low, distributor inventory is at historically low levels, as Dave mentioned. So all things put together, I think, what we're just seeing is a growth rate on a macro level that's probably slower going into the second half than what people thought coming into the first half. As to comparisons to 2011, 2012, there were too many things going on back then. We had earthquake events in Japan that I can recall. We had flooding in Thailand. I don't think there's really comparable events that we can talk about on that front, Chris."

Clearly, at some of the prices today that you might see at certain companies out there, and you factor in a premium, I'm looking at -- what I've seen in some other companies, getting the 3% return, 4% return doesn't seem like a good long-term strategy for maximizing shareholder value.

Let's call it 2x the global GDP. And that's on increased content into industrial and automotive that will continue to drive demand. It's then a question of what do you think GDP is going to do over the long-term, the global GDP? And clearly, it does appear that in, certainly, in the last 3 or 4 years and probably the next few years, it has been slower than what we saw in the prior decade or decade before that. So the overall industry, again, in our view, will probably grow at about 2x global GDP, and the global GDP is the real wildcard here just trying to figure out how fast that will grow. And we're preparing ourselves for the fact that it probably doesn't see any real robust growth to help us. And therefore, we have to focus on execution to making ourselves stronger internally."

You are correct in that utilization changes don't have an immediate impact, they tend to -- it takes a few months for it to roll through the system, so some of that was in the second quarter. More of it will be in third quarter. We also have lower overall manufacturing cost. As we begin to see depreciation starting to slowly trickle off, we're becoming much more efficient in our factories, we're getting more and more of our revenue off of much lower cost 300-millimeter.

As we work our way through the reports and some of the anecdotal from last quarter's reports as well as the anecdotal information that we get from our sales teams, and of course, there's always the exceptions like within wireless infrastructure as that market goes through its adjustments. So it is -- with inventory in our distributors at 3.5 weeks, that is a historically low period in my tenure as well as Kevin's, so -- and we really think that's reflective, Chris, of confidence from distributors that they believe that they can get the product that they need from us. Obviously, it's driven overall because of the consignment programs that allow them just operationally to run at those levels. And I think there is a belief that, that confidence and stable lead times and the availability of product is probably working its way out into the customer base as well. Harder for us to actually have that direct visibility. As Kevin talked about, we're talking about 100,000 customers, so it's hard to have that collectively. So thanks, Chris."

So the examples you just offered, if in fact they turn out to be in a secular decline, the offsetting markets for that, the most obvious one is automotive, where we're seeing significant content growth, not just us, but many in the industry seeing significant content growth. And we're still in the very early stages of that content, penetrating automobiles. So that's probably a secular growth market that I would suggest would probably add for a decade or more. So that's a great opportunity for the industry in general, and for us in particular because we've been focused there for a number of years now. And then, there's the broader industrial market where we're seeing an increasing usage of semiconductors and equipment in those markets that simply were never used before. And as people are using semiconductors in those spaces, they're finding new applications and needs for more semiconductors. So while there may be some markets or sectors that could be in secular decline, there are others that are in secular growth.

For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue declined 2% from a year ago, inclusive of notably weak demand in communications equipment and continued strong demand in automotive. In the quarter, we also had about a $45 million negative impact year-over-year from currency exchange rates, as expected. Even in this environment, our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing together grew slightly year-over-year and comprised 85% of second quarter revenue. 
Analog delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Earnings per share were $0.65, up $0.03 from a year ago. With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model.
In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $820 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.6 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 27% of revenue, consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30%. This is a 2 percentage point improvement from a year ago period and we believe reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy. The latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand. 
We also believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends.
Analog revenue grew 3% from a year ago due to High Volume Analog & Logic. Power Management also grew. Silicon Valley Analog was even and High Performance Analog declined. As mentioned earlier, this is the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for Analog. Embedded Processing revenue declined 2% from a year ago, after 10 consecutive quarters of year-on-year growth. This decline was due to the weakness in wireless infrastructure equipment for the Processor product line. In contrast, the Connectivity and Microcontroller product lines grew. 
In our Other segment, revenue declined 17% from a year ago due to custom ASIC products, which are highly concentrated in wireless infrastructure equipment. DLP products also declined while calculators grew. In distribution, resales increased 8% from a year ago. Weeks of inventory decreased by 1 week to just above 3.5 weeks, which is a historically low level. We believe this inventory level reflects an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times, which together drive high customer service metrics. It's also important to note that inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years because we've structurally changed how inventory is managed with our consignment program. 
Now I'll provide some insight into our revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago, which in total, resulted in the revenue in the bottom half of our range due to more significant softness in communications equipment and incremental softness in industrial. Specifically, by end market, automotive had strong growth with almost all sectors inside this market growing at double-digit rates. Industrial revenue was about flat in contrast to last quarter's year-over-year growth and was incrementally weaker than we expected. More specifically, there was growth in about half the sectors inside of industrial, but these were offset by declines in others. 
Personal electronics grew, in total, due to 1 large customer. Outside of this customer, almost every sector inside of personal electronics declined, including PCs, as we expected. Communications equipment declined, primarily due to the wireless infrastructure sector, which was down about 50% from a year ago, even weaker than we had expected going into the quarter. And enterprise systems declined due to DLP projectors, as we had expected. 
In general, as we look to the third quarter, the strength in demand varies by end markets, but our market in total is expected to be weaker year-over-year and our outlook for TI revenue and earnings is consistent with this environment. While we don't control the near-term environment of our markets, we do control the focus on making TI stronger through our approach to manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. These 4 attributes, taken together, are at the core of what makes TI unique and capable of long-term free cash flow growth. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $1.88 billion or 58.2% of revenue. Gross profit was even from the year ago quarter despite lower revenue, as we benefited from lower manufacturing costs. Gross margin was up 110 b",879,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.88 billion or 58.2% of revenue. Gross profit was even from the year ago quarter despite lower revenue, as we benefited from lower manufacturing costs. Gross margin was up 110 basis points. 
Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expenses of $790 million, were down $31 million from a year ago. The decline reflects the targeted reductions in Embedded Processing in Japan, which have been completed. Acquisition charges were $82 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $1.01 billion, up 3% from the year-ago quarter. Operating profit margin was 31.3% of revenue, up 150 basis points from a year ago. Operating profit margin for Analog was 35.5%. Operating profit margin for Embedded Processing was 19.6%, almost 5 percentage points higher from a year ago, as we focused our investments for growth and now see the benefit from our plan to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing. Net income in the second quarter was $696 million or $0.65 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $820 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 126, as we had expected. As our business model has evolved, we continue to evaluate our inventory model. Capital expenditures were $125 million in the quarter. 
As a reminder, in April, we retired $250 million of debt. In addition, we issued $500 million of 5-year debt at a coupon rate of 1.75%. Including the $750 million of debt due in August of this year, we'll have retired $1 billion, while having issued $500 million in debt this year. This is consistent with our practice over the past few years. This will leave total debt of $4.125 billion, with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.3%. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.1 billion, up 14% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $476 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes a 300-millimeter Analog plan discussed in our February capital management call. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.61 billion or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 13% higher than a year ago. 
As we said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or productively invested in the businesses. And as we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from the exercise of equity compensation, minus net debt retirement. 
In the second quarter, we paid $354 million in dividends and repurchased $654 million of our stock for a total return of $1.01 billion. Total cash returned in the past 12 months was $4.08 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.1% over the past 12 months and by 40% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the second quarter with $3.31 billion of cash and short-term investments. TI's U.S. entities own 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI's orders in the quarter were $3.26 billion, down 2% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.15 billion to $3.41 billion in the third quarter. As we said, while strength in demand varies by end markets, our market in total is expected to be weaker year-over-year in the third quarter than it was in the second. This includes a negative impact of about $40 million due to the changes in currency exchange rates. We expect third quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.72. 
Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charge, will remain even and hold at about $80 million per quarter until the third quarter of 2019. It will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 remains about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the third quarter and for the year. 
In summary, even in a weaker market environment such as we saw in the second quarter and expect in the third, our business model, which is built upon the 4 attributes that Dave mentioned earlier, delivered strong free cash flow. As a reminder, these attributes are our approach to manufacturing technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. We believe these attributes in combination are unique to TI and they are sustainable, giving us the ability to provide continuing returns to our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave"

I think that what we're seeing right now is basically customers adjusting their expectations as to the growth rates for the remainder of the year and just toning down a little bit on where they're at. We actually believe that what we're seeing is more a symptom of like a macro-based kind of events. Markets getting a bit more cautious, especially with all the news flow in the financial markets, things you heard in Europe, things you heard in China. But the fact is the signs that we're seeing suggest to us that we're in a traditional kind of market macro-driven, not necessarily a semi-cycle per se. We continue to see lead times that are quite short, cancellations remain low, distributor inventory is at historically low levels, as Dave mentioned. So all things put together, I think, what we're just seeing is a growth rate on a macro level that's probably slower going into the second half than what people thought coming into the first half. As to comparisons to 2011, 2012, there were too many things going on back then. We had earthquake events in Japan that I can recall. We had flooding in Thailand. I don't think there's really comparable events that we can talk about on that front, Chris."

It's then a question of what do you think GDP is going to do over the long-term, the global GDP? And clearly, it does appear that in, certainly, in the last 3 or 4 years and probably the next few years, it has been slower than what we saw in the prior decade or decade before that. So the overall industry, again, in our view, will probably grow at about 2x global GDP, and the global GDP is the real wildcard here just trying to figure out how fast that will grow. And we're preparing ourselves for the fact that it probably doesn't see any real robust growth to help us. And therefore, we have to focus on execution to making ourselves stronger internally."

But carrier CapEx isn't going to 0, and that revenue will return.

So that's a great opportunity for the industry in general, and for us in particular because we've been focused there for a number of years now. And then, there's the broader industrial market where we're seeing an increasing usage of semiconductors and equipment in those markets that simply were never used before.

This year, it's apt to grow less than global GDP. So I think, you're just going to have that kind of noise to deal with. I don't think that they can be biomechanically imposed into a formula with precision. As we look out for the reasons that we talked about, increasing penetration in certain markets, especially auto and industrial, that will continue to require some magnitude of content and there'll be growth inside that. From a market share standpoint, we'll be able to answer that at the end of the year, but I'd say we're off to a darn good start so far."

As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectation. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue declined 2% from a year ago. While our overall demand remained weak, most areas were stronger than we had expected especially wireless infrastructure and industrial. In addition, our demand for automotive continued to be strong. I'll elaborate in a few moments. Even in this environment, each of our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing grew year-over-year. Together, they comprised 85% of third quarter revenue and have delivered 9 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth. Earnings per share were $0.76. 
With that, backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.6 billion, up 4% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28% of revenue, up from 27% a year ago and consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. 
We continue to benefit from our improved products portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase ahead of demand. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. 
Analog revenue, which achieved a record level in the quarter, increased 2% from a year ago. The growth was due to High Volume Analog & Logic, Silicon Valley Analog also grew, Power Management was about even and High Performance Analog declined. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 2% from a year ago due to Microcontrollers and Connectivity. Processor's declined. Our investments in Embedded are translating into tangible results as this quarter's revenue is also a record. 
In our Other segment, revenue declined 19% from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC products and DLP products. Compared with a year ago, distribution resales increased 6% and inventory decreased by less than 1 week to just below 4 weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times, which together drive high customer service metrics. 
As a reminder, inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years because of our consignment program. Now I'll move -- I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago. Automotive remains strong with all sectors growing and 3 of the 5 sectors growing double-digits. Industrial revenue was about even with about half of the 14 sectors growing and about half declining. 
Personal electronics was up because of demand from 1 customer. Excluding that 1 customer, Personal Electronics was down. Communications equipment was down, driven by Wireless infrastructure was down about 30% from a year ago. Although weak, it did growth, sequentially. And finally, enterprise systems declined primarily due to DLP projectors. We continue to focus on making TI stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. These 4 attributes taken together are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies, capable of long-term free cash flow growth. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.00 billion or 58.2% of revenue. Gross profit declined 2% due to lower revenue. Operating expenses were a total of $750 million, down $45 million a year ago primarily an SG&A. Th",808,"Thanks, Dave and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.00 billion or 58.2% of revenue. Gross profit declined 2% due to lower revenue. Operating expenses were a total of $750 million, down $45 million a year ago primarily an SG&A. The decline reflects continued cost management across the company, including the previously announced targeted reductions in Embedded Processing in Japan. Acquisition charges were $83 million, almost all of which with the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $1.16 billion or 33.9% of revenue. Operating profit was down 1% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 37.2%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 24.0%, 8 percentage points higher versus a year ago as we focused our investments on investment growth opportunities. Net income in the third quarter was $798 million or $0.76 per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.41 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 111, down 15 days, sequentially. This reduction was a combination of our lower factory starts as well as higher than expected revenue in the quarter. 
As our business and model evolves we continue to evaluate our inventory model. We plan to provide an update on our inventory model to you on our capital management call next February. 
Capital expenditures were $139 million in the quarter. As a reminder, in the second quarter, the retired $250 million of debt and issued $500 million of 5-year debt at a coupon rate of 1.75%. In August, we retired an additional $750 million of debt. As a result, we have reduced the net debt by $500 million this year, which is consistent with our practice over the past few years. This leaves total debt of $4.125 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.3%. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.11 billion, up 8% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $512 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity as discussed in our capital management call this year. 
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.60 billion or 28% of revenue. Free cash flow was 4% higher than a year ago. As we said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important in maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. 
As we've noted, our 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive in any exercise of equity compensation minus net debt requirement. In September, we announced our quarterly dividend increase of $0.04, a 12% increase. This was the 12th consecutive year in which we've increased the dividend to our shareholders. We also announced a $7.5 billion increase to our share buyback authorization. In the third quarter, TI paid $348 million in dividends and repurchased $790 million of our stock for a total return of $1.14 billion. 
Total cash returned in the past 12 months was $4.23 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.5% over the past 12 months and by 41% since the end of 2004. These returns demonstrates our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. Fundamental to our equipment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the third quarter with $2.74 billion of cash and short-term investments for TI's U.S. entities owning 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI orders in the quarter were $3.44 billion, up 3% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion in the fourth quarter, which includes about a $35 million negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates versus a year ago. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.74. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold about $80 million to $85 million per quarter until the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. 
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 remains about 30% and this is the tax rate that you should use for the fourth quarter and for the year. In summary we believe our third quarter results demonstrate the strength of TI's business model. With that, let me turn it back to Dave"

Of course, we acquired National back in 2011, so we probably got ahead of the game versus where people are at today. But we spent the intervening time period really driving hard to accelerate 4 attributes that we think in combination are pretty unique to TI and differentiate us quite a bit from our competitors, which may be impacting how some of they're thinking about how to approach their markets. And those 4 attributes are approach to a low cost manufacture and advanced technology. The sheer breadth of our overall portfolio, the reach we have to our customers through our market channels especially with arguably the largest sales force than anybody out there. And the diversity and long-lived positions that we enjoy in the markets with the products that we have. If we look at most companies that are doing today from an M&A front, it appears that some of them are maybe changing their focus and some of them are maybe trying to build scale. We already have what we believe is a significant scale advantage and we believe we're focused on the 2 best opportunities out there, being Analog and Embedded Processing. So we don't -- those 2 reasons are motivating us to think differently about M&A. When we think about M&A, our approach is really to focus on the right strategic fit, one that can generate long term returns and excess free cash flows. So we will focus on the numbers but then acquisition might lead us to and buy strategic fit, I'm talking really our bias is towards Analog. We look at an acquisition and will probably be a company that's broad and catalog, and the diverse customer base and have a large percentage of the revenue coming from industrial and automotive probably have a very talented R&D team. Those will be the sort of attributes that we would look at from a standpoint. From a return standpoint, we look at several metrics, including really making sure that the return on our investment is accretive to our weighted average cost of capital in say 4 years or so. And we also want to make sure that whatever we acquire will continue to expand our free cash flow. So with all that said, and we take a look at what's out there, we have been actually buying our favorite [indiscernible] semiconductor company. I know you don't like to hear it that way, but there are our home stock buybacks. Today, by buying back those share, we are given a 7% free cash flow yield on those acquisitions and we don't have any integration risk and no banker fees, just a whole lot easier way to run the business and focus on customers."

In addition to that, we continue to see an expansion of revenue that's coming out of the industrial automotive space as a percent of total, and those tend to come through at higher gross margins as well as digital roll catalogs products versus custom products inside our mix. And then the last item is that as we talked about for a couple of years now, our CapEx has been running under our depreciation by a couple of points, and that is slowly beginning to close. And in fact, you can see that gap close in -- just in the past 12-month comparison period.

So really didn't see much different. The second thing I'll add is that a lot of times, we're asked by investors, what our exposure to China is or to a particular market. And in our 10-K, we give a very precise number of what we shipped into China, being 44%. But we always like to point out that if you're looking for what exposure to a particular market is, I think most investors are asking, how much of our products is actually consumed there. And so it's a very different number than 44, it's much lower than that because obviously, some of those products that we ship there end up getting shipped into other regions. I'll also point out that we may ship product into a Tier 2 OEM that gets into a European automobile in Europe and then shipped into China, so you can't really look at any of our regional results and understand that. So but overall, probably a good proxy to begin to start the analysis would be to look at what China is as a percentage of GDP and any kind of starter analysis from there."

As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectation. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue declined 2% from a year ago. While our overall demand remained weak, most areas were stronger than we had expected, especially wireless infrastructure and industrial. In addition, our demand for automotive continued to be strong. I'll elaborate in a few moments. Even in this environment, each of our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing grew year-over-year. Together, they comprised 85% of third quarter revenue and have delivered 9 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth. Earnings per share were $0.76. 
With that, backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. 
In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.6 billion, up 4% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28% of revenue, up from 27% a year ago and consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. 
We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. 
Analog revenue, which achieved a record level in the quarter, increased 2% from a year ago. The growth was due to High Volume Analog & Logic. Silicon Valley Analog also grew. Power Management was about even and High Performance Analog declined. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 2% from a year ago due to Microcontrollers and Connectivity. Processors declined. Our investments in Embedded are translating into tangible results as this quarter's revenue is also a record. 
In our Other segment, revenue declined 19% from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC products and DLP products. Compared with a year ago, distribution resales increased 6% and inventory decreased by less than 1 week to just below 4 weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times, which together drive high customer service metrics. 
As a reminder, inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years because of our consignment program. Now I'll move -- I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive remains strong with all sectors growing and 3 of the 5 sectors growing double digits. Industrial revenue was about even with about 1/2 of the 14 sectors growing and about 1/2 declining. 
Personal electronics was up because of demand from 1 customer. Excluding that 1 customer, Personal Electronics was down. Communications equipment was down, driven by Wireless infrastructure, which was down about 30% from a year ago. Although weak, it did grow sequentially. And finally, enterprise systems declined primarily due to DLP projectors. 
We continue to focus on making TI stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. These 4 attributes taken together are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies, capable of long-term free cash flow growth. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.00 billion or 58.2% of revenue. Gross profit declined 2% due to lower revenue. Operating expenses were a total of $750 million, down $45 million from a year ago primarily in SG&",810,"Thanks, Dave and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.00 billion or 58.2% of revenue. Gross profit declined 2% due to lower revenue. Operating expenses were a total of $750 million, down $45 million from a year ago primarily in SG&A. The decline reflects continued cost management across the company, including the previously announced targeted reductions in Embedded Processing and Japan. Acquisition charges were $83 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $1.16 billion or 33.9% of revenue. Operating profit was down 1% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 37.2%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 24.0%, 8 percentage points higher versus a year ago as we focused our investments on the best growth opportunities. Net income in the third quarter was $798 million or $0.76 per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.41 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 111, down 15 days, sequentially. This reduction was the combination of lower factory starts as well as higher-than-expected revenue in the quarter. 
As our business model evolves we continue to evaluate our inventory model. We plan to provide an update on our inventory model to you in our Capital Management call next February. 
Capital expenditures were $139 million in the quarter. As a reminder, in the second quarter, we retired $250 million of debt and issued $500 million of 5-year debt at a coupon rate of 1.75%. In August, we retired an additional $750 million of debt. As a result, we have reduced net debt by $500 million this year, which is consistent with our practice over the past few years. This leaves total debt of $4.125 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.3%. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.11 billion, up 8% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $512 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity as discussed in our Capital Management call earlier this year. 
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.60 billion or 28% of revenue. Free cash flow was 4% higher than a year ago. As we said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. 
As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt requirement. 
In September, we announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.04, a 12% increase. This was the 12th consecutive year in which we've increased the dividend to our shareholders. We also announced a $7.5 billion increase to our share buyback authorization. In the third quarter, TI paid $348 million in dividends and repurchased $790 million of our stock for a total return of $1.14 billion. Total cash returned in the past 12 months was $4.23 billion. 
Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.5% over the past 12 months and by 41% since the end of 2004. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the third quarter with $2.74 billion of cash and short-term investments with TI's U.S. entities owning 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI orders in the quarter were $3.44 billion, up 3% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion in the fourth quarter, which includes about a $35 million negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates versus a year ago. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.74. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold about $80 million to $85 million per quarter until the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. 
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 remains about 30% and this is the tax rate that you should use for the fourth quarter and for the year. In summary we believe our third quarter results demonstrate the strength of TI's business model. With that, let me turn it back to Dave"

Of course, we acquired National back into 2011, so we probably got ahead of the game versus where people are at today. But we spent the intervening time period really driving hard to accelerate 4 attributes that we think in combination are pretty unique to TI and differentiate us quite a bit from our competitors, which may in fact be impacting some of those thinking about how they approach their markets. And those 4 attributes are our approach to low cost manufacture and advanced technology. The sheer breadth of our overall product portfolio, the reach we have to our customers through our market channels especially with arguably the largest sales force of anybody out there and the diversity and long-lived positions that we enjoy in the markets with the products that we have. If we look at what most companies are doing today from an M&A front, it appears that some of them are maybe changing their focus and some of them are maybe trying to build scale. We already have what we believe is a significant scale advantage and we believe we're focused on the 2 best opportunities that are out there today being Analog and Embedded Processing. So we don't -- those 2 reasons aren't [ph] motivating us to think differently about M&A. When we do think about M&A, our approach is really to focus on the right strategic fit, one that can generate long term returns and excess free cash flows. So we really do focus on the numbers that, that acquisition might lead us to. And by strategic fit, I'm talking really our bias is towards Analog. If we ever look at an acquisition it will probably be a company that's going to be broad and catalog and a diverse customer base and have a large percentage of its revenue coming from industrial and automotive, probably have a very talented R&D team. Those will be the sort of attributes we'd look at from a strategic standpoint. From a return standpoint, we look at several metrics including really making sure that the return on our investment is accretive to our weighted average cost to capital within, say, 4 years or so. And we also want to make sure that whatever we acquire can continue to expand our free cash flow. So with all that said, and we take a look at what's out there, we have been actually buying our favorite semiconductor company. I know you don't like to hear it that way but through our own stock buybacks. Today, by buying back those shares, we're given a 7% free cash flow yield on those acquisitions of those shares and we don't have any integration risk and no banker fees, just a whole lot easier way to run the business and focus on customers."

So that will certainly benefit our gross margin line. In addition to that, we continue to see an expansion of revenue that's coming out of the industrial and automotive space as a percent of total, and those tend to come through at higher gross margins as well as digital roll catalog products versus custom products inside our mix. And then the last item is that as we talked about for a couple of years now, our CapEx has been running under our depreciation by a couple of points, and that is slowly beginning to close.

I think that's also telling us that as handsets overall grow, it will really becoming the larger piece of the personal electronic space. And so what's important is to have a lot of different chips that you're selling into, a lot of different customers you sell into that space and that's exactly what we have. And so from that standpoint, if it we're going to participate in personal electronics, you're going to be participating in handsets and there are a lot of very attractive chip opportunities inside handsets, unlike what we had a number of years ago, as you remembered, with base band and processors where those parts were basically standardized and then commoditized in and your ability to differentiate was diminished. And therefore, your ability to attract profits from selling those parts was diminished. So consequently, I see this as kind of different today, given the diversity of products that we're talking about here than the example over the base band of processors 5-plus years ago."

If you look at the broader China market, it really wasn't down differently than what the broader Asia was, and that was kind of down, consistent with our overall revenue, so really didn't see much different. The second thing I'll add is that a lot of times we're asked by investors, what our exposure to China is or to a particular market, and in our 10-K, we give a very precise number of what we shipped into China, being 44%. But we always like to point out that if you're looking for what exposure to a particular market is, I think most investors are asking how much of our products is actually consumed there. And so it's a very different number than 44, it's much lower than that because, obviously, some of those products that we ship there end up getting shipped into other regions. I'll also point out that we may ship product into a Tier 2 OEM that gets put into a European automobile in Europe and then shipped into China, so you can't really look at any of our regional results and understand that. So but overall, probably a good proxy to begin to start an analysis would be to look at what China is as a percentage of GDP and any kind of -- start an analysis from there."

As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectation. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue declined 2% from a year ago. While our overall demand remained weak, most areas were stronger than we had expected, especially wireless infrastructure and industrial. In addition, our demand for automotive continued to be strong. I'll elaborate in a few moments. Even in this environment, each of our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing grew year-over-year. Together, they comprised 85% of third quarter revenue and have delivered 9 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth. Earnings per share were $0.76. 
With that, backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. 
In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.6 billion, up 4% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28% of revenue, up from 27% a year ago and consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. 
We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. 
Analog revenue, which achieved a record level in the quarter, increased 2% from a year ago. The growth was due to High Volume Analog & Logic. Silicon Valley Analog also grew. Power Management was about even and High Performance Analog declined. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 2% from a year ago due to Microcontrollers and Connectivity. Processors declined. Our investments in Embedded are translating into tangible results as this quarter's revenue is also a record. 
In our Other segment, revenue declined 19% from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC products and DLP products. Compared with a year ago, distribution resales increased 6% and inventory decreased by less than 1 week to just below 4 weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times, which together drive high customer service metrics. 
As a reminder, inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years because of our consignment program. Now I'll move -- I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive remains strong with all sectors growing and 3 of the 5 sectors growing double digits. Industrial revenue was about even with about 1/2 of the 14 sectors growing and about 1/2 declining. 
Personal Electronics was up because of demand from 1 customer. Excluding that 1 customer, Personal Electronics was down. Communications equipment was down, driven by Wireless infrastructure, which was down about 30% from a year ago. Although weak, it did grow sequentially. And finally, enterprise systems declined primarily due to DLP projectors. 
We continue to focus on making TI stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. These 4 attributes taken together are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies, capable of long-term free cash flow growth. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.00 billion or 58.2% of revenue. Gross profit declined 2% due to lower revenue. Operating expenses were a total of $750 million, down $45 million from a year ago primarily in SG&",812,"Thanks, Dave and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.00 billion or 58.2% of revenue. Gross profit declined 2% due to lower revenue. Operating expenses were a total of $750 million, down $45 million from a year ago primarily in SG&A. The decline reflects continued cost management across the company, including the previously announced targeted reductions in Embedded Processing and Japan. Acquisition charges were $83 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $1.16 billion or 33.9% of revenue. Operating profit was down 1% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 37.2%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 24.0%, 8 percentage points higher versus a year ago as we focused our investments on the best growth opportunities. Net income in the third quarter was $798 million or $0.76 per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.41 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 111, down 15 days, sequentially. This reduction was the combination of lower factory starts as well as higher-than-expected revenue in the quarter. 
As our business model evolves we continue to evaluate our inventory model. We plan to provide an update on our inventory model to you in our Capital Management call next February. 
Capital expenditures were $139 million in the quarter. As a reminder, in the second quarter, we retired $250 million of debt and issued $500 million of 5-year debt at a coupon rate of 1.75%. In August, we retired an additional $750 million of debt. As a result, we have reduced net debt by $500 million this year, which is consistent with our practice over the past few years. This leaves total debt of $4.125 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.3%. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.11 billion, up 8% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $512 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity as discussed in our Capital Management call earlier this year. 
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.60 billion or 28% of revenue. Free cash flow was 4% higher than a year ago. As we said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. 
As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt requirement. 
In September, we announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.04 per share, a 12% increase. This was the 12th consecutive year in which we've increased the dividend to our shareholders. We also announced a $7.5 billion increase to our share buyback authorization. In the third quarter, TI paid $348 million in dividends and repurchased $790 million of our stock for a total return of $1.14 billion. Total cash returned in the past 12 months was $4.23 billion. 
Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.5% over the past 12 months and by 41% since the end of 2004. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the third quarter with $2.74 billion of cash and short-term investments with TI's U.S. entities owning 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI orders in the quarter were $3.44 billion, up 3% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion in the fourth quarter, which includes about a $35 million negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates versus a year ago. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.74. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold about $80 million to $85 million per quarter until the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. 
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 remains about 30% and this is the tax rate that you should use for the fourth quarter and for the year. In summary we believe our third quarter results demonstrate the strength of TI's business model. With that, let me turn it back to Dave"

Of course, we acquired National back into 2011, so we probably got ahead of the game versus where people are at today. But we spent the intervening time period really driving hard to accelerate 4 attributes that we think in combination are pretty unique to TI and differentiate us quite a bit from our competitors, which may in fact be impacting some of their thinking about how they approach their markets. And those 4 attributes are our approach to low cost manufacturing and advanced technology, the sheer breadth of our overall product portfolio, the reach we have to our customers through our market channels especially with arguably the largest sales force of anybody out there and the diversity and long-lived positions that we enjoy in the markets with the products that we have. If we look at what most companies are doing today from an M&A front, it appears that some of them are maybe changing their focus and some of them are maybe trying to build scale. We already have what we believe is a significant scale advantage and we believe we're focused on the 2 best opportunities that are out there today being Analog and Embedded Processing. So we don't -- those 2 reasons aren't motivating us to think differently about M&A. When we do think about M&A, our approach is really to focus on the right strategic fit, one that can generate long term returns and excess free cash flows. So we really do focus on the numbers that, that acquisition might lead us to. And by strategic fit, I'm talking really our bias is towards Analog. If we ever look at an acquisition it will probably be a company that's going to be broad in catalog, have a diverse customer base and have a large percentage of its revenue coming from industrial and automotive, probably have a very talented R&D team. Those will be the sort of attributes we'd look at from a strategic standpoint. From a return standpoint, we look at several metrics including really making sure that the return on our investment is accretive to our weighted average cost to capital within, say, 4 years or so. And we also want to make sure that whatever we acquire can continue to expand our free cash flow. So with all that said, and we take a look at what's out there, we have been actually buying our favorite semiconductor company. I know you don't like to hear it that way, but through our own stock buybacks. Today, by buying back those shares, we're given a 7% free cash flow yield on those acquisitions of those shares and we don't have any integration risk and no banker fees, just a whole lot easier way to run the business and focus on customers."

But under that scenario, I think we would -- I doubt that we'd see a whole lot of change in operating expenditures other than just normal annual pay and benefit increases. But on the margin side, on the gross margin side, we'll probably continue to see benefit as we see more and more of our production moving to 300-millimeter, which as you recall gives us about a 40% chip cost reduction, an overall cost of goods standpoint. So that will certainly benefit our gross margin line. In addition to that, we continue to see an expansion of revenue that's coming out of the industrial and automotive space as a percent of total, and those tend to come through at higher gross margins as well as just overall catalog products versus custom products inside our mix. And then the last item is that as we talked about for a couple of years now, our CapEx has been running under our depreciation by a couple of points, and that is slowly beginning to close. In fact, you can even see that gap close in just in this past 12-month comparison period. So as we look out into 2016, you'll see that gap close a bit more. So those in combination will give us continued tailwind on the gross margin line, it should follow all the way through to the operating margin."

And so what's important is to have a lot of different chips that you're selling into, a lot of different customers you sell into that space and that's exactly what we have. And so from that standpoint, if it we're going to participate in personal electronics, you're going to be participating in handsets and there are a lot of very attractive chip opportunities inside handsets, unlike what we had a number of years ago, as you remembered, with base band and processors where those parts were basically standardized and then commoditized in and your ability to differentiate was diminished.

If you look at the broader China market, it really wasn't down differently than what the broader Asia was, and that was kind of down, consistent with our overall revenue, so really didn't see much different. The second thing I'll add is that a lot of times we're asked by investors what our exposure to China is or to a particular market, and in our 10-K, we give a very precise number of what we shipped into China, being 44%. But we always like to point out that if you're looking for what exposure to a particular market is, I think most investors are asking how much of our products is actually consumed there. And so it's a very different number than 44%, it's much lower than that because, obviously, some of those products that we ship there end up getting shipped into other regions. I'll also point out that we may ship product into a Tier 2 OEM that gets put into a European automobile in Europe and then shipped into China, so you can't really look at any of our regional results and understand that. So but overall, probably a good proxy to begin to start an analysis would be to look at what China is as a percentage of GDP and any kind of -- start an analysis from there."

Importantly, they're strong contributor to our free cash flow growth and just as our free cash flow at the company level tends to be weaker in the first of couple of quarters and stronger in the second couple of quarters, I don't think it's any different from when we take a look at how some of the business units underneath will be performing that metric, being as though they're the ones contributing to that free cash flow. We tend to look at these things over a longer period of time because quarter-to-quarter can be pretty noisy. But I think that team has done a very good job of getting those margins up to where we think its entitlement is at, and they should be performing at that level in the foreseeable future, in fact in the long term, is what we would expect on them."

And I'll just add that as Kevin mentioned, the growth has been coming through from the investments that we've made. We've highlighted that they, as well as Analog, had achieved record levels of revenue as a result of those investments. Together, Analog and Embedded have grown for 9 quarters in a row year-over-year. And I think there was 1 quarter where Embedded actually did well, but didn't grow year-over-year and that was last quarter that it had the big headwind from Wireless Infrastructure. But other parts of that business, obviously, did very well. Okay, I think we have time for one last caller, operator."
