So today I'm going to start wit",1658,"Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone.
During our last earnings call, we articulated 5 strategic actions to reignite our growth and committed to providing you on an update on our progress as we move forward into 2015. So today I'm going to start with some highlights from our fourth quarter performance and then review the progress we've made against our 5 strategic actions.
For those of you following our webcast, you can see our quarterly performance on our new scorecard on Slide 4. Overall, our performance came in slightly ahead of where we had previously expected. This was driven by some net positives above the operating income line, slightly offset by higher-than-expected currency remeasurement impacting profit before tax.
At the top line, structurally adjusted comparable currency-neutral net revenues grew 4% in the quarter, driven by a balance between volume and underlying price/mix in what was a challenging macro environment.
At the profit level, structurally adjusted comparable currency-neutral operating income grew 7% in the quarter while we continue to invest heavily behind our media with double-digit increases in the quarter and full year.
Importantly, there are some highlights for the quarter. We continue to focus pricing and revenue realization in key developed markets, with North America and Europe both delivering positive price/mix in the quarter and for the full year. Our core strategies and our diversified global portfolio enables us to gain global value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink sparkling beverages as well as still beverages in the quarter. This is a key metric for us particularly in a challenging macro environment.
As we announced last week, we also continue to strengthen our overall portfolio of billion-dollar brands and in particular, our still brands. Gold Peak, a premium tea brand in the United States, benefited from great marketing, strong media and stepped-up execution to achieve this status. Furthermore, Fuze Tea, partnered with our tea brand, now available in nearly 40 markets around the world reached the status in less than 3 years, demonstrating the strength of our system's marketing and executional capabilities. And finally, I LOHAS, our innovative water brand in Japan, regained billion-dollar brand status in 2014. This brings our total number of billion-dollar brands to 20, out of which 14 are still brands. Just 5 years ago, we had 14 billion-dollar brands. Since 2010, on average, we've added more than 1 new billion-dollar bra each year to the list.
Checking back for our quarterly performance, I'd like to talk about the bigger picture in 2014, the year of significant change for our company that will continue in 2015. Specifically, I want to discuss our 5 strategic actions to reignite our growth, which are: first, targeting disciplined brand and gross investment; second, driving revenue and profit growth with clear portfolio rolls across our markets; thirdly, refocusing on our core business model; fourth, driving efficiencies through more aggressive productivity; and fifth, last but not least, streamline and simplify our organization.
While we're making solid progress, we have more to do. In 2014, we invested significantly in both our brands and in incremental growth opportunities. We substantially increased our media investments in markets and categories where our media was underfunded relative to the market opportunity, where we had the right price-back channel architectures and where we had clear executional alignment with our bottlers. The quality of our media has been increasing, and we intend to improve it even further under the leadership of our new global Chief Executive Officer Marcus. We're seeing initial success as exemplified by North America where our incremental media investments, coupled with our segmented price-back strategies, grow revenue growth in our sparkling portfolio through strong 4% price/mix in the second half of the year.
This gives us confidence that when we invest in our brands, align on our system plan and focus on our execution, we do see positive results.
Looking beyond our existing portfolio, we continue to focus on expanding our participation across a range of consumption occasions. Today, the average household globally consumes 26 beverages per day. And of these 26 beverages, only 1/4 are Coca-Cola company brands. Our opportunity to capture more beverage occasions is just immense. And for that reason, we've announced strategic investments in Keurig Green Mountain and Monster Beverage Corporation. Both of these investments underscore not only our ability to adapt to a changing -- to changing consumer trends but also our commitment to accelerate innovation.
Next, we expanded our market segmentation, recognizing that each of our market has a specific role in order to drive sustainable revenue growth. Some markets focus on price realization, others on volume, and the remainder on a balance of the 2. Importantly, our proxy statement will be coming out in the coming weeks, and you will see the revised incentive metrics which will add revenue growth directly aligned to those market roles.
We also made headway in refranchising our bottling operations both in the United States and internationally. In North America, we closed several refranchising transactions in 2014 and laid out a clear path and timeline to refranchise the remaining territories. Specifically, we refranchised territories representing approximately 5% of the U.S. bottlers delivered business in 2014 and have already signed definitive agreements to continue refranchise similar amount in the first half of 2015. These agreements, along with our ongoing work, give us confidence that we will continue to accelerate our rate of refranchising each year and achieve our goal to retain a maximum of 1/3 of U.S. bottler delivered business by the end of 2017. And it is our intent to refranchise the remaining territories by 2020 at the latest.
As we reach the end of -- as we reach the end state in North America, these actions will drive higher operating margins, lower capital spending and invested capital and improve ROIC for our company.
Outside of North America, we announced 2 transformative changes to our bottling landscape in critical high-growth markets around the world. First, in Indonesia, we announced a joint venture in Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia that will help our system to capture the long-term opportunity in this extremely attractive emerging market. We also entered into a agreement to rearchitect our African bottling system with the creation of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which will serve 12 [ph] Southern and East African countries and will be a top 10 global bottler once the transaction is completed. Importantly, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa will have the scale, resources and efficiencies to fund the investment required to capture the strong long-term growth potential in Africa. These markets will be long-term growth engines for our company so it is absolutely critical that we invest efficiently today to prime those engines for decades to come.
In order to reinvest our business and deliver against our long-term financial targets, we embarked upon an expanded productivity plan that will result in a total of $3 billion in annualized savings by 2019. As Kathy discussed in detail during our modeling call in December, this represents a significant reduction to our addressable spend base, and our efforts are on track.
As you've seen in the press, we've begun work on reducing positions that are no longer aligned to our growth priorities or are deemed redundant as we streamline our operations. While this is never an easy process, it is absolutely essential to ensuring that our business is wired for greater speed, responsiveness as well as innovation. And importantly, it also frees up the resources to -- we need to reinvest in the business to accelerate our growth.
This and finally, towards the end of 2014, we began the process of streamlining and simplifying our operating model. We announced the streamlining of group functional layers and began 3 key processes across our businesses. This will not only reduce our cost structure, but more importantly, will create a more nimble organization that is wired to act swiftly and rapidly in today's dynamic landscape.
In summary, I am confident that these strategic actions are laying the groundwork for accelerated top and bottom line growth in the future and delivering the long-term shareholder value you expect. Looking ahead, we will continue to make progress against our actions to regain momentum. But as we've said before, 2015 will be a transition year for the company as we implement our new operating model, and our incremental media investments in both 2014 and 2015 takes time to pay off in full.
Further, we expect the global consumer environment to remain volatile. Geopolitical hotspots around the world and potential deflationary environment in Europe and continued softness in many developing and emerging markets around the world could be partially offset by an improving environment in the United States.
So against this backdrop, what remains to be seen is how quickly and to what extent lower oil prices trickled down to impact consumer discretionary spending in both importing as well as exporting -- oil-exporting nations. Therefore, we will focus on what we can control. We will implement our strategies with focus on conviction, investing for the long-term in emerging markets as well as taking advantage of opportunities to solidify our position in the growth market of today and tomorrow.
While in 2015, we expect to grow comparable currency-neutral EPS mid-single digits, from 2016 on, we intend to be back to delivering again a long-term target of high single digit comparable currency-neutral EPS growth. We will our leading brands through incremental media investment and best-in-class marketing campaign, we will deliver [indiscernible] productivity and complete the majority of North America franchises, both of which will drive growth and improve our margin structure. And finally, we will continue to enhance our market-leading capabilities to provide our customers and consumers with the innovative and refreshing products they expect from The Coca-Cola Company.
I will now hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our financial performance as well as an outlook on our business for 2015."
26642,281794083,758260,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2015",2015-02-10,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone.Our performance in the fourth quarter was slightly ahead of our expectations due primarily to 3 factors: First, several markets around the world delivered slightly better top line performance, thanks to a st",1074,"Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone.
Our performance in the fourth quarter was slightly ahead of our expectations due primarily to 3 factors: First, several markets around the world delivered slightly better top line performance, thanks to a strong finish during the holiday season; second, gross margins came in slightly better than anticipated; and third, operating expenses were lower than expected, which led to comparable currency-neutral margin expansions.
We are pleased with where the quarter landed. Structurally adjusted comparable currency-neutral revenue growth was driven by a 3% growth in concentrate shipment and 2% underlying price/mix. Concentrate shipment outpaced the unit cases in the quarter, driven by an extra selling day. However, for the full year, concentrate shipments were in line with unit cases.
Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by pricing initiative in North America, Latin America and Europe. Importantly, as we've done throughout 2014, we continue to invest behind our brands. During the quarter, our marketing grew high single digits, resulting in mid-single digit growth for the year. This increase in annual marketing expenditures was driven by a double-digit increase in media investment as we continue to drive efficiencies within our overall marketing budget to put against our media spend.
Our fourth quarter comparable EPS was $0.44, which included a 10-point currency headwind. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, our EPS grew 5% in both the quarter and the full year.
Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to the impact of changing the exchange rate used to remeasure our Venezuelan subsidiaries net monetary assets into U.S. dollar, a write-down on the concentrate sales receivables from our bottling partner in Venezuela, noncash charges related to refranchising certain territories in North America; and costs associated with our previously announced $3 billion productivity program.
Given increased uncertainty and lack of liquidity in Venezuela, we our bolivar net monetary assets at the end of the quarter using the [indiscernible] exchange rate. We are also using exchange rate to translate our Venezuelan subsidiaries local currency income statement into U.S. dollars beginning in January 2015. The receivable write-down was recorded as results were revised as testament of the U.S. dollar value we expect to receive. Despite a difficult operating environment in Venezuela, the Coca-Cola system remains committed to the market and will continue producing and selling our products that Venezuelan consumers enjoy on a daily basis.
As you saw on our scorecard, full year free cash flow was $8.2 billion, [ph] up 3% primarily due to the efficient management of working capital and cycling incremental pension contributions last year, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the deconsolidation of the company's Brazilian bottling operations in July 2013.
For the year, cash return on invested capital declined 32 basis points due to the $1.5 billion investment we made in Keurig Green Mountain.
As we look ahead to 2015, we anticipate continued macroeconomic conditions in many markets around the world. Despite this, we are on track with the actions we laid out during our last earnings call, and we remain confident in the outlook we provided in December. Therefore, we expect our comparable currency-neutral EPS growth in 2015 to be mid single digits, roughly in line with our growth rate in 2014.
As you will recall from our modeling call in December, there are many puts and takes our P&L in 2015. With the exception of currency, these have not changed. Therefore, I'm not going to detail on this call, but you can see the various line items on Slide 13. After considering our hedge position current spot rates and the cycling of our prior-year rates, we now expect an approximate 5-point currency headwind on net revenue with a 7 to 8-point headwind on profit before tax for the full year 2015. This is a stronger headwind than the previously communicated 5 to 6 points for profit before tax due primarily to the effect from translating our bolivar denominated profits at the and the recent decline in to several emerging market currencies which we do not hedge.
In terms of coverage, we are fully hedged on the euro, yen and sterling for 2015. We also have near-term coverage in place across several other major currencies.
There are a couple of in items you should consider when modeling the first quarter. Due to our fiscal calendar, there are 6 additional days in the first quarter 2015 as compared to the first quarter of 2014. Although that will benefit revenue, variable costs such as marketing, sales and distribution expenses will also occur to a much greater degree in the first quarter. We expect the Venezuelan pricing provision will continue to negatively impact our net revenue and operating income in the first quarter of 2015 as we began to recognize the impact in the second quarter of last year. And we expect structural items, primarily related to North America, to be a headwind in the first quarter.
Taken together, we expect structural adjustment and the Venezuelan pricing provision to be in an approximate 2-point headwind on net revenue and an approximate 3-point headwind on profit before tax.
In addition, we will cycle the timing of expenses in the first quarter of last year when we had 4 points of operating leverage. Therefore, we expect the comparable currency-neutral operating leverage will be negative in the first quarter.
Finally, we currently expect currency will be in approximate 6-point headwind on net revenue and an approximate 8-point headwind on profit before tax in the first quarter as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior year.
We currently anticipate closing the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation at the beginning of the second quarter. Note that this is slightly later than our initial expectations of the first quarter due to various closing considerations. at this stage, we do not anticipate any material changes to our structural guidance from December, and of course we will update you along the way if they are changed.
In closing, we are confident in our strategies and in the actions we have already taken to regain our momentum. 2015 will be a transition year as we implement significant change in our company and continue to reinvest in our business. We absolutely believe that The Coca-Cola Company is best positioned to capture growth in the nonalcoholic beverages and to continue to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.

So rate of interest, currency certainly will add to the volatility. Growth gaps will, in some parts, are going -- versus some other parts are going to grow. Take for example the United States and Great Britain, 2 large Western economies starting the year 2015 strong, whereas the Eurozone, Japan and most of the emerging world starting the year slower. So there is this kind of gap and some catching up to do. We're gaining share across the world in sparkling juices, important categories. The industry -- we see some evidence that there's some things that are working for us. But we need to be cautious and take it quarter by quarter. I think that's really important. And as far as Latin America is concerned, I think Colombia seems to continue to do really well as an economy. And I think there's some -- so some more lifting to do in Mexico and Brazil and the South Kona. But I was recently in Latin America and I -- our business there continues to -- we have a fantastic group of bottling partners investing for the short-term and long-term growth, and we continue to gain share. We have a very strong packaged product channel segmentation and architecture and pricing, competitive but at the same time, great revenue growth strategies working there. And Europe, as per the last quarter, quarter 4 which we're just reporting on, the European countries continue to be challenged. Germany, our business was very much in the positive. Northern Europe had a better environment for us -- was a better environment for us than the South. And so -- and Eastern Europe is again challenged by some of the macro volatility that spills over across from the East. So I think that's how we would see it. And then Asia, I think we're still very bullish And Africa, you see the actions we've taken to reorganizing our bottling structure to even better suit the growth potential and opportunities there in both Indonesia, the fourth most populous nation in the world, as well as the very dynamic 1 plus billion dollars consumers in Africa."

Brian, the only thing I would add to Muhtar's is that volatility sort of comes on top of sort a slowdown. But what's working for us is that we're getting more and more traction on our plans and programs working with our bottlers. I was in about 4 or 5 different countries over the last couple of weeks. And even though we witnessed economic volatility or uncertainty even in Northern Europe, yes, there is quantitative easing, yes there's lower oil prices, but it is uncertain yet whether the consumer will really benefit from that. But even within that, our plans that address the right pricing and packaging and the right level of media investment and our alignment with our bottling system is giving us confidence that we could actually weather this volatility in line with the guidance that has been provided. So there are a couple of bright spots too. I was in India, probably 1 country where there is a lot of optimism inside the country in terms of economic environment. And as you know, we have an incredible momentum in India over the last 7 or 8 years, especially last year. And our plans continue to build on each other from year-to-year. So that's pretty -- so I was in Brazil, again a similar story. After the elections, there was some cautious optimism, and that sort of caution side of that continues. There's still a bit of optimism. But we do continue to deliver our results despite that environment. As you know, Brazil had a mid-single digit growth at the end of the quarter. Yes, it was cycling better numbers from last year, but we've also had some very strong share gains in Brazil. So I would say that is our story. There is volatility on top of a slowdown, but we do have traction with our plans and programs in the marketplace with close alignment with our bottlers."

During our last earnings call, we articulated 5 strategic actions to reignite our growth and committed to providing you an update on our progress as we move forward and into 2015. So today I'm going to start with some highlights from our fourth quarter performance and then review the progress we've made against our 5 strategic actions.
For those of you following our webcast, you can see our quarterly performance on our new scorecard on Slide 4. Overall, our performance came in slightly ahead of where we had previously expected. This was driven by some net positives above the operating income line, slightly offset by higher-than-expected currency remeasurement impacting profit before tax.
At the top line, structurally adjusted comparable currency-neutral net revenues grew 4% in the quarter, driven by a balance between volume and underlying price/mix in what was a challenging macro environment.
At the profit level, structurally adjusted comparable currency-neutral operating income grew 7% in the quarter while we continue to invest heavily behind our media, with double-digit increases in the quarter and full year.
Importantly, there are some highlights for the quarter. We continue to focus pricing and revenue realization in key developed markets, with North America and Europe both delivering positive price/mix in the quarter and for the full year. Our core strategies and our diversified global portfolio enabled us to gain global value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink sparkling beverages as well as still beverages in the quarter. This is a key metric for us, particularly in a challenging macro environment.
As we announced last week, we also continue to strengthen our overall portfolio of billion-dollar brands, and in particular, our still brands. Gold Peak, a premium tea brand in the United States, benefited from great marketing, strong media and stepped-up execution to achieve this status. Furthermore, Fuze Tea, our popular mainstream tea brand, now available in nearly 40 markets around the world, reached the status in less than 3 years, demonstrating the strength of our system's marketing and executional capabilities. And finally, I LOHAS, our innovative water brand in Japan, regained billion-dollar brand status in 2014. 
This brings our total number of billion-dollar brands to 20, out of which 14 are still brands. Just 5 years ago, we had 14 billion-dollar brands. Since 2010, on average, we've added more than one new billion-dollar brand each year to the list.
Stepping back from our quarterly performance, I'd like to talk about the bigger picture in 2014, a year of significant change for our company that will continue in 2015. Specifically, I want to discuss our 5 strategic actions to reignite our growth, which are: first, targeting disciplined brand and growth investments; second, driving revenue and profit growth with clear portfolio rolls across our markets; thirdly, refocusing on our core business model; fourth, driving efficiency through more aggressive productivity; and fifth, last but not least, streamline and simplify our organization.
While we're making solid progress, we have more to do. In 2014, we invested significantly in both our brands and in incremental growth opportunities. We substantially increased our media investments in markets and categories where our media was underfunded relative to the market opportunity, where we had the right price/pack channel architectures and where we had clear executional alignment with our bottlers. The quality of our media has been increasing, and we intend to improve it even further under the leadership of our new Global Chief Marketing Officer, Marcos de Quinto. We're seeing initial success, as exemplified by North America where our incremental media investments, coupled with our segmented price/pack strategies, drove revenue growth in our sparkling portfolio to a strong 4% price/mix in the second half of the year.
This gives us confidence that when we invest in our brands, align on our system plan and focus on execution, we do see positive results.
Looking beyond our existing portfolio, we continue to focus on expanding our participation across a range of consumption occasions. Today, the average household globally consumes 26 beverages per day. And of these 26 beverages, only 1.4 are Coca-Cola Company brands. Our opportunity to capture more beverage occasions is just immense. And for that reason, we've announced strategic investments in Keurig Green Mountain and Monster Beverage Corporation. Both of these investments underscore not only our ability to adapt to a changing -- to changing consumer trends, but also our commitment to accelerate innovation.
Next, we expanded our market segmentation, recognizing that each of our market has a specific role in order to drive sustainable revenue growth. Some markets focus on price realization, others on volume and the remainder on a balance of the 2. Importantly, our proxy statement will be coming out in the coming weeks and you will see the revised incentive metrics, which will add revenue growth directly aligned to those market roles.
We also made headway in refranchising our bottling operations both in the United States and internationally. In North America, we closed several refranchising transactions in 2014 and laid out a clear path and time line to refranchise the remaining territories. Specifically, we refranchised territories representing approximately 5% of the U.S. bottler-delivered business in 2014 and have already signed definitive agreements to continue refranchising a similar amount in the first half of 2015. These agreements, along with our ongoing work, give us confidence that we will continue to accelerate our rate of refranchising each year and achieve our goal to retain a maximum of about 1/3 of the U.S. bottler-delivered business by the end of 2017. And it is our intent to refranchise the remaining territories by 2020 at the latest.
As we reach the end of -- as we reach the end state in North America, these actions will drive higher operating margins, lower capital spending and invested capital and improve ROIC for our company.
Outside of North America, we announced 2 transformative changes to our bottling landscape in critical high-growth markets around the world. First, in Indonesia, we announced a joint venture in Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia that will help our system to capture the long-term opportunity in this extremely attractive emerging market. We also entered into an agreement to re-architect our African bottling system with the creation of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which will serve 12 Southern and East African countries and will be a top 10 global bottler once the transaction is completed. Importantly, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa will have the scale, resources and efficiencies to fund the investment required to capture the strong long-term growth potential in Africa. These markets will be long-term growth engines for our company, so it is absolutely critical that we invest efficiently today to prime those engines for decades to come.
In order to reinvest our business and deliver against our long-term financial targets, we embarked upon an expanded productivity plan that will result in a total of $3 billion in annualized savings by 2019. As Kathy discussed in detail during our modeling call in December, this represents a significant reduction to our addressable spend base, and our efforts are on track.
As you've seen in the press, we've begun work on reducing positions that are no longer aligned to our growth priorities or are deemed redundant as we streamline our operations. While this is never an easy process, it is absolutely essential to ensuring that our business is wired for greater speed, responsiveness as well as innovation. And importantly, it also frees up the resources to -- that we need to reinvest in the business to accelerate our growth.
And finally, towards the end of 2014, we began the process of streamlining and simplifying our operating model. We announced the streamlining of group functional layers and began standardizing 3 key processes across our business units. This will not only reduce our cost structure, but more importantly, will create a more nimble organization that is wired to act swiftly and rapidly in today's dynamic landscape.
In summary, I am confident that these strategic actions are laying the groundwork for accelerated top and bottom line growth in the future and delivering the long-term shareholder value you expect. Looking ahead, we will continue to make progress against our actions to regain momentum. But as we've said before, 2015 will be a transition year for the company, as we implement our new operating model and our incremental media investments in both 2014 and 2015 take time to pay off in full.
Further, we expect the global consumer environment to remain volatile. Geopolitical hotspots around the world and potential deflationary environment in Europe and continued softness in many emerging and developing markets around the world could be partially offset by an improving environment in the United States.
So against this backdrop, what remains to be seen is how quickly and to what extent lower oil prices trickle down to impact consumer discretionary spending in both importing as well as exporting -- oil-exporting nations. Therefore, we will focus on what we can control. We will implement our strategies with focus on conviction, investing for the long term in emerging markets as well as taking advantage of opportunities to solidify our position in the growth market of today and tomorrow.
While in 2015, we expect to grow comparable currency-neutral EPS mid-single digits. From 2016 on, we intend to be back to delivering again a long-term target of high-single-digit comparable currency-neutral EPS growth. We will strengthen our leading brands through incremental media investments and best-in-class marketing campaign. We will deliver a step-change in productivity and complete the majority of North America franchises, both of which will drive growth and improve our margin structure.
And finally, we will continue to enhance our market-leading capabilities to provide our customers and consumers with the innovative and refreshing products they expect from The Coca-Cola Company.
I will now hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our financial performance as well as an outlook on our business for 2015."
26642,281794083,758501,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2015",2015-02-10,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone.Our performance in the fourth quarter was slightly ahead of our expectations due primarily to 3 factors: First, several markets around the world delivered slightly better top line performance, thanks to a st",1095,"Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone.
Our performance in the fourth quarter was slightly ahead of our expectations due primarily to 3 factors: First, several markets around the world delivered slightly better top line performance, thanks to a strong finish during the holiday season. Second, gross margins came in slightly better than anticipated. And third, operating expenses were lower than expected, which led to comparable currency-neutral margin expansions.
We are pleased with where the quarter landed. Structurally adjusted comparable currency-neutral revenue growth was driven by a 3% growth in concentrate shipment and 2% underlying price/mix. Concentrate shipment outpaced the unit cases in the quarter, driven by an extra selling day. However, for the full year, concentrate shipments were in line with unit cases.
Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by pricing initiatives in North America, Latin America and Europe. Importantly, as we've done throughout 2014, we continue to invest behind our brands. During the quarter, our marketing expenditures grew high single digits, resulting in mid-single-digit growth for the year. This increase in annual marketing expenditures was driven by a double-digit increase in media investment as we continue to drive efficiencies within our overall marketing budget to put against our media spend.
Our fourth quarter comparable EPS was $0.44, which included a 10-point currency headwind. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, our EPS grew 5% in both the quarter and the full year.
Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to the impact of changing the exchange rate used to remeasure our Venezuelan subsidiaries net monetary assets into U.S. dollars, a write-down on the concentrate sales receivables from our bottling partner in Venezuela, noncash charges related to refranchising certain territories in North America and costs associated with our previously announced $3 billion productivity program.
Given increased uncertainty and lack of liquidity in Venezuela, we remeasured our bolivar-denominated net monetary assets at the end of the quarter using the SICAD 2 exchange rate. We are also using the SICAD 2 exchange rate to translate our Venezuelan subsidiaries local currency income statement into U.S. dollars beginning in January 2015. The receivable write-down was recorded as a result of a revised assessment of the U.S. dollar value we expect to receive. Despite a difficult operating environment in Venezuela, the Coca-Cola system remains committed to the market and will continue producing and selling our products that Venezuelan consumers enjoy on a daily basis.
As you saw on our scorecard, full year free cash flow was $8.2 billion, up 3% primarily due to the efficient management of working capital and cycling incremental pension contributions last year, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the deconsolidation of the company's Brazilian bottling operations in July 2013.
For the year, cash return on invested capital declined 32 basis points due to the $1.5 billion investment we made in Keurig Green Mountain.
As we look ahead to 2015, we anticipate continued challenging macroeconomic conditions in many markets around the world. Despite this, we are on track with the actions we laid out during our last earnings call, and we remain confident in the outlook we provided in December. Therefore, we expect our comparable currency-neutral EPS growth in 2015 to be mid single digits, roughly in line with our growth rate in 2014.
As you will recall from our modeling call in December, there are many puts and takes to our P&L in 2015. With the exception of currencies, these have not changed. Therefore, I'm not going to detail on this call, but you can see the various line items on Slide 13.
After considering our hedge position, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we now expect an approximate 5 point currency headwind on net revenues with a 7 to 8 point headwind on profit before tax for the full year 2015. This is a stronger headwind than the previously communicated 5 to 6 points for profit before tax, due primarily to the effect from translating our bolivar-denominated profits at the SICAD 2 rate and to the recent decline in several emerging market currencies, which we do not hedge.
In terms of coverage, we are fully hedged on the euro, yen and sterling for 2015. We also have near-term coverage in place across several other major currencies.
There are a couple of phasing items you should consider when modeling the first quarter. Due to our fiscal calendar, there are 6 additional days in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the first quarter of 2014. Although that will benefit revenue, variable costs, such as marketing, sales and distribution expenses, will also occur to a much greater degree in the first quarter. We expect the Venezuelan pricing provision will continue to negatively impact our net revenue and operating income in the first quarter of 2015 as we began to recognize the impact in the second quarter of last year. And we expect structural items, primarily related to North America, to be a headwind in the first quarter.
Taken together, we expect structural adjustment and the Venezuelan pricing provision to be an approximate 2 point headwind on net revenue and an approximate 3 point headwind on our profit before tax.
In addition, we will cycle the timing of expenses in the first quarter of last year when we had 4 points of operating leverage. Therefore, we expect the comparable currency-neutral operating leverage will be negative in the first quarter.
Finally, we currently expect currency will be an approximate 6 point headwind on net revenues and an approximate 8 point headwind on profit before tax in the first quarter as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior year.
We currently anticipate closing the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation at the beginning of the second quarter. Note that this is slightly later than our initial expectations of the first quarter due to various closing considerations. At this stage, we do not anticipate any material changes to our structural impact guidance from December. And of course, we will update you along the way if there were to be a change.
In closing, we are confident in our strategies and in the actions we have already taken to regain our momentum. 2015 will be a transition year as we implement significant change in our company and continue to reinvest in our business. We absolutely believe that The Coca-Cola Company is best positioned to capture growth in the nonalcoholic beverages and to continue to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.

So rate of interest, currencies certainly will add to the volatility. Growth gaps will -- in some parts, are going -- versus other parts are going to grow. Take for example the United States and Great Britain, 2 large Western economies starting the year 2015 strong, whereas the Eurozone, Japan and most of the emerging world starting the year slower. So there is this kind of gap and some catching up to do. We are gaining share across the world in sparkling juices, important categories. The industry -- we see some evidence that there's some things that are working for us. But we need to be cautious and take it quarter-by-quarter. I think that's really important. And as far as Latin America is concerned, I think Colombia seems to do -- continue to do really well as an economy. And I think there's some more lifting to do in Mexico and Brazil and the South Cone. But I was recently in Latin America and I -- our business there continues to -- we have a fantastic group of bottling partners investing for the short- and long-term growth, and we continue to gain share. We have a very strong package, product channel segmentation and architecture and pricing. Competitive, but at the same time, great revenue growth management strategies working there. And so -- and Europe, as per the last quarter, quarter 4, which we're just reporting on, the Southern European countries continue to be challenged. Germany, our business was very much in the positive. Northern Europe had a better environment for us -- was a better environment for us than the South. And so -- and Eastern Europe is again challenged by some of the macro volatility that spills over across from the East. So I think that's how we would see it. And then Asia, I think we're very -- still very bullish and Africa. And you see the actions we've taken related to reorganizing our bottling structure to even better suit the growth potential and the opportunities there in both Indonesia, the fourth most populous nation in the world, as well as a very dynamic 1-plus billion consumers in Africa."

Bryan, the only thing I would add to Muhtar's characterization is that volatility sort of comes on top of sort of a slowdown. But what's working for us is that we're getting more and more traction on our plans and programs working with our bottlers. I was in about 4 or 5 different countries over the last couple of weeks. And even though we witnessed economic volatility or uncertainty even in Northern Europe -- yes, there is quantitative easing. Yes, there's lower oil prices. But it is uncertain yet whether the consumer will really benefit from that. But even within that, our plans that address the right pricing and packaging and the right level of media investment and our alignment with our bottling system is giving us confidence that we could actually weather this volatility in line with the guidance that has been provided. So there are a couple of bright spots, too. I was in India, probably one country where there is a lot of optimism inside the country in terms of economic development. And as you know, we have an incredible momentum in India over the last 7 or 8 years, especially last year. And our plans continue to build on each other from year-to-year. So that's pretty -- so I was in Brazil. Again, a similar story. After the elections, there was some cautious optimism, and that sort of caution side of that continues. There's still a bit of optimism. But we do continue to deliver our results despite that environment. As you know, Brazil had a mid-single-digit growth at the end of the quarter. Yes, it was cycling better numbers from last year, but we've also had very strong share gains in Brazil. So I would say that is our story. There is volatility on top of a slowdown, but we do have traction with our plans and programs in the marketplace with close alignment with our bottlers."

First, obviously, there are a lot of moving parts driving price and mix in the quarter globally. I want to hear you just focus in on rate increases and talk about trends there because my guess is that rate lagged overall price/mix in North America, which you talked about, but Europe, the bottling investment group, Latin America and then rate was probably stronger than price/mix in Eurasia, Africa, Pacific and across the whole company. So any help there would be great, just parsing out overall rate trends. And then more broadly, it sounds like your productivity targets remain unchanged from last fall, which isn't really surprising as it's only been a few months. But at the same time, we've already seen announcements of headcount reductions that likely were not envisioned prior to your October update. So I'm wondering why we're not seeing more incrementality sooner on that front or perhaps we are, just being absorbed by the macro headwinds. So if you could clarify that, that would be great."

During our last earnings call, we articulated 5 strategic actions to reignite our growth and committed to providing you an update on our progress as we move forward and into 2015. So today I'm going to start with some highlights from our fourth quarter performance and then review the progress we've made against our 5 strategic actions.
For those of you following our webcast, you can see our quarterly performance on our new scorecard on Slide 4. Overall, our performance came in slightly ahead of where we had previously expected. This was driven by some net positives above the operating income line, slightly offset by higher-than-expected currency remeasurement impacting profit before tax.
At the top line, structurally adjusted comparable currency-neutral net revenues grew 4% in the quarter, driven by a balance between volume and underlying price/mix in what was a challenging macro environment.
At the profit level, structurally adjusted comparable currency-neutral operating income grew 7% in the quarter while we continue to invest heavily behind our media, with double-digit increases in the quarter and full year.
Importantly, there are some highlights for the quarter. We continue to focus pricing and revenue realization in key developed markets, with North America and Europe both delivering positive price/mix in the quarter and for the full year. Our core strategies and our diversified global portfolio enabled us to gain global value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink sparkling beverages as well as still beverages in the quarter. This is a key metric for us, particularly in a challenging macro environment.
As we announced last week, we also continue to strengthen our overall portfolio of billion-dollar brands, and in particular, our still brands. Gold Peak, a premium tea brand in the United States, benefited from great marketing, strong media and stepped-up execution to achieve this status. Furthermore, Fuze Tea, our popular mainstream tea brand, now available in nearly 40 markets around the world, reached the status in less than 3 years, demonstrating the strength of our system's marketing and executional capabilities. And finally, I LOHAS, our innovative water brand in Japan, regained billion-dollar brand status in 2014. 
This brings our total number of billion-dollar brands to 20, out of which 14 are still brands. Just 5 years ago, we had 14 billion-dollar brands. Since 2010, on average, we've added more than one new billion-dollar brand each year to the list.
Stepping back from our quarterly performance, I'd like to talk about the bigger picture in 2014, a year of significant change for our company that will continue in 2015. Specifically, I want to discuss our 5 strategic actions to reignite our growth, which are: first, targeting disciplined brand and growth investments; second, driving revenue and profit growth with clear portfolio rolls across our markets; thirdly, refocusing on our core business model; fourth, driving efficiency through more aggressive productivity; and fifth, last but not least, streamline and simplify our organization.
While we're making solid progress, we have more to do. In 2014, we invested significantly in both our brands and in incremental growth opportunities. We substantially increased our media investments in markets and categories where our media was underfunded relative to the market opportunity, where we had the right price/pack channel architectures and where we had clear executional alignment with our bottlers. The quality of our media has been increasing, and we intend to improve it even further under the leadership of our new Global Chief Marketing Officer, Marcos de Quinto. We're seeing initial success, as exemplified by North America where our incremental media investments, coupled with our segmented price/pack strategies, drove revenue growth in our sparkling portfolio to a strong 4% price/mix in the second half of the year.
This gives us confidence that when we invest in our brands, align on our system plan and focus on execution, we do see positive results.
Looking beyond our existing portfolio, we continue to focus on expanding our participation across a range of consumption occasions. Today, the average household globally consumes 26 beverages per day. And of these 26 beverages, only 1.4 are Coca-Cola Company brands. Our opportunity to capture more beverage occasions is just immense. And for that reason, we've announced strategic investments in Keurig Green Mountain and Monster Beverage Corporation. Both of these investments underscore not only our ability to adapt to a changing -- to changing consumer trends, but also our commitment to accelerate innovation.
Next, we expanded our market segmentation, recognizing that each of our markets has a specific role in order to drive sustainable revenue growth. Some markets focus on price realization, others on volume and the remainder on a balance of the 2. Importantly, our proxy statement will be coming out in the coming weeks and you will see the revised incentive metrics, which will add revenue growth directly aligned to those market roles.
We also made headway in refranchising our bottling operations both in the United States and internationally. In North America, we closed several refranchising transactions in 2014 and laid out a clear path and time line to refranchise the remaining territories. Specifically, we refranchised territories representing approximately 5% of the U.S. bottler-delivered business in 2014 and have already signed definitive agreements to continue refranchising a similar amount in the first half of 2015. These agreements, along with our ongoing work, give us confidence that we will continue to accelerate our rate of refranchising each year and achieve our goal to retain a maximum of about 1/3 of the U.S. bottler-delivered business by the end of 2017. And it is our intent to refranchise the remaining territories by 2020 at the latest.
As we reach the end of -- as we reach the end state in North America, these actions will drive higher operating margins, lower capital spending and invested capital and improve ROIC for our company.
Outside of North America, we announced 2 transformative changes to our bottling landscape in critical high-growth markets around the world. First, in Indonesia, we announced a joint venture in Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia that will help our system to capture the long-term opportunity in this extremely attractive emerging market. We also entered into an agreement to re-architect our African bottling system with the creation of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which will serve 12 Southern and East African countries and will be a top 10 global bottler once the transaction is completed. Importantly, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa will have the scale, resources and efficiencies to fund the investment required to capture the strong long-term growth potential in Africa. These markets will be long-term growth engines for our company, so it is absolutely critical that we invest efficiently today to prime those engines for decades to come.
In order to reinvest our business and deliver against our long-term financial targets, we embarked upon an expanded productivity plan that will result in a total of $3 billion in annualized savings by 2019. As Kathy discussed in detail during our modeling call in December, this represents a significant reduction to our addressable spend base, and our efforts are on track.
As you've seen in the press, we've begun work on reducing positions that are no longer aligned to our growth priorities or are deemed redundant as we streamline our operations. While this is never an easy process, it is absolutely essential to ensuring that our business is wired for greater speed, responsiveness as well as innovation. And importantly, it also frees up the resources to -- that we need to reinvest in the business to accelerate our growth.
And finally, towards the end of 2014, we began the process of streamlining and simplifying our operating model. We announced the streamlining of group functional layers and began standardizing 3 key processes across our business units. This will not only reduce our cost structure, but more importantly, will create a more nimble organization that is wired to act swiftly and rapidly in today's dynamic landscape.
In summary, I am confident that these strategic actions are laying the groundwork for accelerated top and bottom line growth in the future and delivering the long-term shareholder value you expect. Looking ahead, we will continue to make progress against our actions to regain momentum. But as we've said before, 2015 will be a transition year for the company, as we implement our new operating model and our incremental media investments in both 2014 and 2015 take time to pay off in full.
Further, we expect the global consumer environment to remain volatile. Geopolitical hotspots around the world and potential deflationary environment in Europe and continued softness in many emerging and developing markets around the world could be partially offset by an improving environment in the United States.
So against this backdrop, what remains to be seen is how quickly and to what extent lower oil prices trickle down to impact consumer discretionary spending in both importing as well as exporting -- oil-exporting nations. Therefore, we will focus on what we can control. We will implement our strategies with focus and conviction, investing for the long term in emerging markets as well as taking advantage of opportunities to solidify our position in the growth markets of today and tomorrow.
While in 2015, we expect to grow comparable currency-neutral EPS mid-single digits. From 2016 on, we intend to be back to delivering against our long-term target of high-single-digit comparable currency-neutral EPS growth. We will strengthen our leading brands through incremental media investments and best-in-class marketing campaign. We will deliver a step-change in productivity and complete the majority of North America franchises, both of which will drive growth and improve our margin structure.
And finally, we will continue to enhance our market-leading capabilities to provide our customers and consumers with the innovative and refreshing products they expect from The Coca-Cola Company.
I will now hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our financial performance as well as an outlook on our business for 2015."
26642,281794083,758751,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2015",2015-02-10,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone.Our performance in the fourth quarter was slightly ahead of our expectations due primarily to 3 factors: First, several markets around the world delivered slightly better top line performance, thanks to a st",1095,"Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone.
Our performance in the fourth quarter was slightly ahead of our expectations due primarily to 3 factors: First, several markets around the world delivered slightly better top line performance, thanks to a strong finish during the holiday season. Second, gross margins came in slightly better than anticipated. And third, operating expenses were lower than expected, which led to comparable currency-neutral margin expansions.
We are pleased with where the quarter landed. Structurally adjusted comparable currency-neutral revenue growth was driven by a 3% growth in concentrate shipment and 2% underlying price/mix. Concentrate shipment outpaced the unit cases in the quarter, driven by an extra selling day. However, for the full year, concentrate shipments were in line with unit cases.
Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by pricing initiatives in North America, Latin America and Europe. Importantly, as we've done throughout 2014, we continue to invest behind our brands. During the quarter, our marketing expenditures grew high single digits, resulting in mid-single-digit growth for the year. This increase in annual marketing expenditures was driven by a double-digit increase in media investment as we continue to drive efficiencies within our overall marketing budget to put against our media spend.
Our fourth quarter comparable EPS was $0.44, which included a 10-point currency headwind. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, our EPS grew 5% in both the quarter and the full year.
Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to the impact of changing the exchange rate used to remeasure our Venezuelan subsidiaries net monetary assets into U.S. dollars, a write-down on the concentrate sales receivables from our bottling partner in Venezuela, noncash charges related to refranchising certain territories in North America and costs associated with our previously announced $3 billion productivity program.
Given increased uncertainty and lack of liquidity in Venezuela, we remeasured our bolivar-denominated net monetary assets at the end of the quarter using the SICAD 2 exchange rate. We are also using the SICAD 2 exchange rate to translate our Venezuelan subsidiaries local currency income statement into U.S. dollars beginning in January 2015. The receivable write-down was recorded as a result of a revised assessment of the U.S. dollar value we expect to receive. Despite a difficult operating environment in Venezuela, the Coca-Cola system remains committed to the market and will continue producing and selling our products that Venezuelan consumers enjoy on a daily basis.
As you saw on our scorecard, full year free cash flow was $8.2 billion, up 3% primarily due to the efficient management of working capital and cycling incremental pension contributions last year, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the deconsolidation of the company's Brazilian bottling operations in July 2013.
For the year, cash return on invested capital declined 32 basis points due to the $1.5 billion investment we made in Keurig Green Mountain.
As we look ahead to 2015, we anticipate continued challenging macroeconomic conditions in many markets around the world. Despite this, we are on track with the actions we laid out during our last earnings call, and we remain confident in the outlook we provided in December. Therefore, we expect our comparable currency-neutral EPS growth in 2015 to be mid single digits, roughly in line with our growth rate in 2014.
As you will recall from our modeling call in December, there are many puts and takes to our P&L in 2015. With the exception of currencies, these have not changed. Therefore, I'm not going to detail on this call, but you can see the various line items on Slide 13.
After considering our hedge position, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we now expect an approximate 5 point currency headwind on net revenues with a 7 to 8 point headwind on profit before tax for the full year 2015. This is a stronger headwind than the previously communicated 5 to 6 points for profit before tax, due primarily to the effect of translating our bolivar-denominated profits at the SICAD 2 rate and to the recent decline in several emerging market currencies, which we do not hedge.
In terms of coverage, we are fully hedged on the euro, yen and sterling for 2015. We also have near-term coverage in place across several other major currencies.
There are a couple of phasing items you should consider when modeling the first quarter. Due to our fiscal calendar, there are 6 additional days in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the first quarter of 2014. Although that will benefit revenue, variable costs, such as marketing, sales and distribution expenses, will also occur to a much greater degree in the first quarter. We expect the Venezuelan pricing provision will continue to negatively impact our net revenue and operating income in the first quarter of 2015 as we began to recognize the impact in the second quarter of last year. And we expect structural items, primarily related to North America, to be a headwind in the first quarter.
Taken together, we expect structural adjustment and the Venezuelan pricing provision to be an approximate 2 point headwind on net revenue and an approximate 3 point headwind on our profit before tax.
In addition, we will cycle the timing of expenses in the first quarter of last year when we had 4 points of operating leverage. Therefore, we expect the comparable currency-neutral operating leverage will be negative in the first quarter.
Finally, we currently expect currency will be an approximate 6 point headwind on net revenues and an approximate 8 point headwind on profit before tax in the first quarter as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior year.
We currently anticipate closing the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation at the beginning of the second quarter. Note that this is slightly later than our initial expectations of the first quarter due to various closing considerations. At this stage, we do not anticipate any material changes to our structural impact guidance from December. And of course, we will update you along the way if there were to be a change.
In closing, we are confident in our strategies and in the actions we have already taken to regain our momentum. 2015 will be a transition year as we implement significant change in our company and continue to reinvest in our business. We absolutely believe that The Coca-Cola Company is best positioned to capture growth in the nonalcoholic beverages and to continue to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.

So rate of interest, currencies certainly will add to the volatility. Growth gaps will -- in some parts, are going -- versus other parts are going to grow. Take for example the United States and Great Britain, 2 large Western economies starting the year 2015 strong, whereas the Eurozone, Japan and most of the emerging world starting the year slower. So there is this kind of gap and some catching up to do. We are gaining share across the world in sparkling juices, important categories. The industry -- we see some evidence that there's some things that are working for us. But we need to be cautious and take it quarter-by-quarter. I think that's really important. And as far as Latin America is concerned, I think Colombia seems to do -- continue to do really well as an economy. And I think there's some more lifting to do in Mexico and Brazil and the South Cone. But I was recently in Latin America and I -- our business there continues to -- we have a fantastic group of bottling partners investing for the short- and long-term growth, and we continue to gain share. We have a very strong package, product channel segmentation and architecture and pricing. Competitive, but at the same time, great revenue growth management strategies working there. And so -- and Europe, as per the last quarter, quarter 4, which we're just reporting on, the Southern European countries continue to be challenged. Germany, our business was very much in the positive. Northern Europe had a better environment for us -- was a better environment for us than the South. And so -- and Eastern Europe is again challenged by some of the macro volatility that spills over across from the East. So I think that's how we would see it. And then Asia, I think we're very -- still very bullish and Africa. And you see the actions we've taken related to reorganizing our bottling structure to even better suit the growth potential and the opportunities there in both Indonesia, the fourth most populous nation in the world, as well as a very dynamic 1-plus billion consumers in Africa."

Bryan, the only thing I would add to Muhtar's characterization is that volatility sort of comes on top of sort of a slowdown. But what's working for us is that we're getting more and more traction on our plans and programs working with our bottlers. I was in about 4 or 5 different countries over the last couple of weeks. And even though we witnessed economic volatility or uncertainty even in Northern Europe -- yes, there is quantitative easing. Yes, there's lower oil prices. But it is uncertain yet whether the consumer will really benefit from that. But even within that, our plans that address the right pricing and packaging and the right level of media investment and our alignment with our bottling system is giving us confidence that we could actually weather this volatility in line with the guidance that has been provided. So there are a couple of bright spots, too. I was in India, probably one country where there is a lot of optimism inside the country in terms of economic development. And as you know, we have an incredible momentum in India over the last 7 or 8 years, especially last year. And our plans continue to build on each other from year-to-year. So that's pretty -- so I was in Brazil. Again, a similar story. After the elections, there was some cautious optimism, and that sort of caution side of that continues. There's still a bit of optimism. But we do continue to deliver our results despite that environment. As you know, Brazil had a mid-single-digit growth at the end of the quarter. Yes, it was cycling better numbers from last year, but we've also had very strong share gains in Brazil. So I would say that is our story. There is volatility on top of a slowdown, but we do have traction with our plans and programs in the marketplace with close alignment with our bottlers."

Yes, in the fourth quarter last year, we were trending some lower numbers, where we had some heavy promotional activity. But when you look over the half year, as Muhtar said, we grew pricing 4%. So we feel very good about the actions we're taking. We're feeling very good about how the trade is reacting.

First, obviously, there are a lot of moving parts driving price and mix in the quarter globally. I want to hear you just focus in on rate increases and talk about trends there because my guess is that rate lagged overall price/mix in North America, which you talked about, but Europe, the bottling investment group, Latin America and then rate was probably stronger than price/mix in Eurasia, Africa, Pacific and across the whole company. So any help there would be great, just parsing out overall rate trends. And then more broadly, it sounds like your productivity targets remain unchanged from last fall, which isn't really surprising as it's only been a few months. But at the same time, we've already seen announcements of headcount reductions that likely were not envisioned prior to your October update. So I'm wondering why we're not seeing more incrementality sooner on that front or perhaps we are, just being absorbed by the macro headwinds. So if you could clarify that, that would be great."

During our last earnings call, we articulated 5 strategic actions to reignite our growth and committed to providing you an update on our progress as we move forward and into 2015. So today I'm going to start with some highlights from our fourth quarter performance and then review the progress we've made against our 5 strategic actions.
For those of you following our webcast, you can see our quarterly performance on our new scorecard on Slide 4. Overall, our performance came in slightly ahead of where we had previously expected. This was driven by some net positives above the operating income line, slightly offset by higher-than-expected currency remeasurement impacting profit before tax.
At the top line, structurally adjusted comparable currency-neutral net revenues grew 4% in the quarter, driven by a balance between volume and underlying price/mix in what was a challenging macro environment.
At the profit level, structurally adjusted comparable currency-neutral operating income grew 7% in the quarter while we continue to invest heavily behind our media, with double-digit increases in the quarter and full year.
Importantly, there are some highlights for the quarter. We continue to focus pricing and revenue realization in key developed markets, with North America and Europe both delivering positive price/mix in the quarter and for the full year. Our core strategies and our diversified global portfolio enabled us to gain global value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink sparkling beverages as well as still beverages in the quarter. This is a key metric for us, particularly in a challenging macro environment.
As we announced last week, we also continue to strengthen our overall portfolio of billion-dollar brands, and in particular, our still brands. Gold Peak, a premium tea brand in the United States, benefited from great marketing, strong media and stepped-up execution to achieve this status. Furthermore, Fuze Tea, our popular mainstream tea brand, now available in nearly 40 markets around the world, reached the status in less than 3 years, demonstrating the strength of our system's marketing and executional capabilities. And finally, I LOHAS, our innovative water brand in Japan, regained billion-dollar brand status in 2014. 
This brings our total number of billion-dollar brands to 20, out of which 14 are still brands. Just 5 years ago, we had 14 billion-dollar brands. Since 2010, on average, we've added more than one new billion-dollar brand each year to the list.
Stepping back from our quarterly performance, I'd like to talk about the bigger picture in 2014, a year of significant change for our company that will continue in 2015. Specifically, I want to discuss our 5 strategic actions to reignite our growth, which are: first, targeting disciplined brand and growth investments; second, driving revenue and profit growth with clear portfolio rolls across our markets; thirdly, refocusing on our core business model; fourth, driving efficiency through more aggressive productivity; and fifth, last but not least, streamline and simplify our organization.
While we're making solid progress, we have more to do. In 2014, we invested significantly in both our brands and in incremental growth opportunities. We substantially increased our media investments in markets and categories where our media was underfunded relative to the market opportunity, where we had the right price/pack channel architectures and where we had clear executional alignment with our bottlers. The quality of our media has been increasing, and we intend to improve it even further under the leadership of our new Global Chief Marketing Officer, Marcos de Quinto. We're seeing initial success, as exemplified by North America where our incremental media investments, coupled with our segmented price/pack strategies, drove revenue growth in our sparkling portfolio to a strong 4% price/mix in the second half of the year.
This gives us confidence that when we invest in our brands, align on our system plan and focus on execution, we do see positive results.
Looking beyond our existing portfolio, we continue to focus on expanding our participation across a range of consumption occasions. Today, the average household globally consumes 26 beverages per day. And of these 26 beverages, only 1.4 are Coca-Cola Company brands. Our opportunity to capture more beverage occasions is just immense. And for that reason, we've announced strategic investments in Keurig Green Mountain and Monster Beverage Corporation. Both of these investments underscore not only our ability to adapt to a changing -- to changing consumer trends, but also our commitment to accelerate innovation.
Next, we expanded our market segmentation, recognizing that each of our markets has a specific role in order to drive sustainable revenue growth. Some markets focus on price realization, others on volume and the remainder on a balance of the 2. Importantly, our proxy statement will be coming out in the coming weeks and you will see the revised incentive metrics, which will add revenue growth directly aligned to those market roles.
We also made headway in refranchising our bottling operations both in the United States and internationally. In North America, we closed several refranchising transactions in 2014 and laid out a clear path and time line to refranchise the remaining territories. Specifically, we refranchised territories representing approximately 5% of the U.S. bottler-delivered business in 2014 and have already signed definitive agreements to continue refranchising a similar amount in the first half of 2015. These agreements, along with our ongoing work, give us confidence that we will continue to accelerate our rate of refranchising each year and achieve our goal to retain a maximum of about 1/3 of the U.S. bottler-delivered business by the end of 2017. And it is our intent to refranchise the remaining territories by 2020 at the latest.
As we reach the end of -- as we reach the end state in North America, these actions will drive higher operating margins, lower capital spending and invested capital and improve ROIC for our company.
Outside of North America, we announced 2 transformative changes to our bottling landscape in critical high-growth markets around the world. First, in Indonesia, we announced a joint venture in Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia that will help our system to capture the long-term opportunity in this extremely attractive emerging market. We also entered into an agreement to re-architect our African bottling system with the creation of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which will serve 12 Southern and East African countries and will be a top 10 global bottler once the transaction is completed. Importantly, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa will have the scale, resources and efficiencies to fund the investment required to capture the strong long-term growth potential in Africa. These markets will be long-term growth engines for our company, so it is absolutely critical that we invest efficiently today to prime those engines for decades to come.
In order to reinvest our business and deliver against our long-term financial targets, we embarked upon an expanded productivity plan that will result in a total of $3 billion in annualized savings by 2019. As Kathy discussed in detail during our modeling call in December, this represents a significant reduction to our addressable spend base, and our efforts are on track.
As you've seen in the press, we've begun work on reducing positions that are no longer aligned to our growth priorities or are deemed redundant as we streamline our operations. While this is never an easy process, it is absolutely essential to ensuring that our business is wired for greater speed, responsiveness as well as innovation. And importantly, it also frees up the resources to -- that we need to reinvest in the business to accelerate our growth.
And finally, towards the end of 2014, we began the process of streamlining and simplifying our operating model. We announced the streamlining of group functional layers and began standardizing 3 key processes across our business units. This will not only reduce our cost structure, but more importantly, will create a more nimble organization that is wired to act swiftly and rapidly in today's dynamic landscape.
In summary, I am confident that these strategic actions are laying the groundwork for accelerated top and bottom line growth in the future and delivering the long-term shareholder value you expect. Looking ahead, we will continue to make progress against our actions to regain momentum. But as we've said before, 2015 will be a transition year for the company, as we implement our new operating model and our incremental media investments in both 2014 and 2015 take time to pay off in full.
Further, we expect the global consumer environment to remain volatile. Geopolitical hotspots around the world and potential deflationary environment in Europe and continued softness in many emerging and developing markets around the world could be partially offset by an improving environment in the United States.
So against this backdrop, what remains to be seen is how quickly and to what extent lower oil prices trickle down to impact consumer discretionary spending in both importing as well as exporting -- oil-exporting nations. Therefore, we will focus on what we can control. We will implement our strategies with focus and conviction, investing for the long term in emerging markets as well as taking advantage of opportunities to solidify our position in the growth markets of today and tomorrow.
While in 2015, we expect to grow comparable currency-neutral EPS mid-single digits. From 2016 on, we intend to be back to delivering against our long-term target of high-single-digit comparable currency-neutral EPS growth. We will strengthen our leading brands through incremental media investments and best-in-class marketing campaign. We will deliver a step-change in productivity and complete the majority of North America franchises, both of which will drive growth and improve our margin structure.
And finally, we will continue to enhance our market-leading capabilities to provide our customers and consumers with the innovative and refreshing products they expect from The Coca-Cola Company.
I will now hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our financial performance as well as an outlook on our business for 2015."
26642,281794083,758976,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2015",2015-02-10,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone.Our performance in the fourth quarter was slightly ahead of our expectations due primarily to 3 factors: First, several markets around the world delivered slightly better top line performance, thanks to a st",1094,"Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone.
Our performance in the fourth quarter was slightly ahead of our expectations due primarily to 3 factors: First, several markets around the world delivered slightly better top line performance, thanks to a strong finish during the holiday season. Second, gross margins came in slightly better than anticipated. And third, operating expenses were lower than expected, which led to comparable currency-neutral margin expansions.
We are pleased with where the quarter landed. Structurally adjusted comparable currency-neutral revenue growth was driven by a 3% growth in concentrate shipment and 2% underlying price/mix. Concentrate shipment outpaced the unit cases in the quarter, driven by an extra selling day. However, for the full year, concentrate shipments were in line with unit cases.
Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by pricing initiatives in North America, Latin America and Europe. Importantly, as we've done throughout 2014, we continue to invest behind our brands. During the quarter, our marketing expenditures grew high single digits, resulting in mid-single-digit growth for the year. This increase in annual marketing expenditures was driven by a double-digit increase in media investment as we continue to drive efficiencies within our overall marketing budget to put against our media spend.
Our fourth quarter comparable EPS was $0.44, which included a 10-point currency headwind. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, our EPS grew 5% in both the quarter and the full year.
Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to the impact of changing the exchange rate used to remeasure our Venezuelan subsidiaries net monetary assets into U.S. dollars, a write-down on the concentrate sales receivables from our bottling partner in Venezuela, noncash charges related to refranchising certain territories in North America and costs associated with our previously announced $3 billion productivity program.
Given increased uncertainty and lack of liquidity in Venezuela, we remeasured our bolivar-denominated net monetary assets at the end of the quarter using the SICAD 2 exchange rate. We are also using the SICAD 2 exchange rate to translate our Venezuelan subsidiaries local currency income statement into U.S. dollars beginning in January 2015. The receivable write-down was recorded as a result of a revised assessment of the U.S. dollar value we expect to receive. Despite a difficult operating environment in Venezuela, the Coca-Cola system remains committed to the market and will continue producing and selling our products that Venezuelan consumers enjoy on a daily basis.
As you saw on our scorecard, full year free cash flow was $8.2 billion, up 3% primarily due to the efficient management of working capital and cycling incremental pension contributions last year, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the deconsolidation of the company's Brazilian bottling operations in July 2013.
For the year, cash return on invested capital declined 32 basis points due to the $1.5 billion investment we made in Keurig Green Mountain.
As we look ahead to 2015, we anticipate continued challenging macroeconomic conditions in many markets around the world. Despite this, we are on track with the actions we laid out during our last earnings call, and we remain confident in the outlook we provided in December. Therefore, we expect our comparable currency-neutral EPS growth in 2015 to be mid-single digits, roughly in line with our growth rate in 2014.
As you will recall from our modeling call in December, there are many puts and takes to our P&L in 2015. With the exception of currencies, these have not changed. Therefore, I'm not going to detail on this call, but you can see the various line items on Slide 13.
After considering our hedge position, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we now expect an approximate 5 point currency headwind on net revenues with a 7 to 8 point headwind on profit before tax for the full year 2015. This is a stronger headwind than the previously communicated 5 to 6 points for profit before tax, due primarily to the effect of translating our bolivar-denominated profits at the SICAD 2 rate and to the recent decline in several emerging market currencies, which we do not hedge.
In terms of coverage, we are fully hedged on the euro, yen and sterling for 2015. We also have near-term coverage in place across several other major currencies.
There are a couple of phasing items you should consider when modeling the first quarter. Due to our fiscal calendar, there are 6 additional days in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the first quarter of 2014. Although that will benefit revenue, variable costs, such as marketing, sales and distribution expenses, will also occur to a much greater degree in the first quarter. We expect the Venezuelan pricing provision will continue to negatively impact our net revenue and operating income in the first quarter of 2015 as we began to recognize the impact in the second quarter of last year. And we expect structural items, primarily related to North America, to be a headwind in the first quarter.
Taken together, we expect structural adjustment and the Venezuelan pricing provision to be an approximate 2 point headwind on net revenue and an approximate 3 point headwind on our profit before tax.
In addition, we will cycle the timing of expenses in the first quarter of last year when we had 4 points of operating leverage. Therefore, we expect the comparable currency-neutral operating leverage will be negative in the first quarter.
Finally, we currently expect currency will be an approximate 6 point headwind on net revenues and an approximate 8 point headwind on profit before tax in the first quarter as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior year.
We currently anticipate closing the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation at the beginning of the second quarter. Note that this is slightly later than our initial expectations of the first quarter due to various closing considerations. At this stage, we do not anticipate any material changes to our structural impact guidance from December. And of course, we will update you along the way if there were to be a change.
In closing, we are confident in our strategies and in the actions we have already taken to regain our momentum. 2015 will be a transition year as we implement significant change in our company and continue to reinvest in our business. We absolutely believe that The Coca-Cola Company is best positioned to capture growth in the nonalcoholic beverages and to continue to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.

So rate of interest, currencies certainly will add to the volatility. Growth gaps will -- in some parts, are going -- versus other parts are going to grow. Take for example the United States and Great Britain, 2 large Western economies starting the year 2015 strong, whereas the Eurozone, Japan and most of the emerging world starting the year slower. So there is this kind of gap and some catching up to do. We are gaining share across the world in sparkling juices, important categories. The industry -- we see some evidence that there's some things that are working for us. But we need to be cautious and take it quarter-by-quarter. I think that's really important. And as far as Latin America is concerned, I think Colombia seems to do -- continue to do really well as an economy. And I think there's some more lifting to do in Mexico and Brazil and the South Cone. But I was recently in Latin America and I -- our business there continues to -- we have a fantastic group of bottling partners investing for the short- and long-term growth, and we continue to gain share. We have a very strong package, product channel segmentation and architecture and pricing. Competitive, but at the same time, great revenue growth management strategies working there. And so -- and Europe, as per the last quarter, quarter 4, which we're just reporting on, the Southern European countries continue to be challenged. Germany, our business was very much in the positive. Northern Europe had a better environment for us -- was a better environment for us than the South. And so -- and Eastern Europe is again challenged by some of the macro volatility that spills over across from the East. So I think that's how we would see it. And then Asia, I think we're very -- still very bullish and Africa. And you see the actions we've taken related to reorganizing our bottling structure to even better suit the growth potential and the opportunities there in both Indonesia, the fourth most populous nation in the world, as well as a very dynamic 1-plus billion consumers in Africa."

Bryan, the only thing I would add to Muhtar's characterization is that volatility sort of comes on top of sort of a slowdown. But what's working for us is that we're getting more and more traction on our plans and programs working with our bottlers. I was in about 4 or 5 different countries over the last couple of weeks. And even though we witnessed economic volatility or uncertainty even in Northern Europe -- yes, there is quantitative easing. Yes, there's lower oil prices. But it is uncertain yet whether the consumer will really benefit from that. But even within that, our plans that address the right pricing and packaging and the right level of media investment and our alignment with our bottling system is giving us confidence that we could actually weather this volatility in line with the guidance that has been provided. So there are a couple of bright spots, too. I was in India, probably one country where there is a lot of optimism inside the country in terms of economic development. And as you know, we have an incredible momentum in India over the last 7 or 8 years, especially last year. And our plans continue to build on each other from year-to-year. So that's pretty -- so I was in Brazil. Again, a similar story. After the elections, there was some cautious optimism, and that sort of caution side of that continues. There's still a bit of optimism. But we do continue to deliver our results despite that environment. As you know, Brazil had a mid-single-digit growth at the end of the quarter. Yes, it was cycling better numbers from last year, but we've also had very strong share gains in Brazil. So I would say that is our story. There is volatility on top of a slowdown, but we do have traction with our plans and programs in the marketplace with close alignment with our bottlers."

Yes, in the fourth quarter last year, we were trending some lower numbers, where we had some heavy promotional activity. But when you look over the half year, as Muhtar said, we grew pricing 4%.

First, obviously, there are a lot of moving parts driving price and mix in the quarter globally. I want to hear you just focus in on rate increases and talk about trends there because my guess is that rate lagged overall price/mix in North America, which you talked about, but Europe, the bottling investment group, Latin America and then rate was probably stronger than price/mix in Eurasia, Africa, Pacific and across the whole company. So any help there would be great, just parsing out overall rate trends. And then more broadly, it sounds like your productivity targets remain unchanged from last fall, which isn't really surprising as it's only been a few months. But at the same time, we've already seen announcements of headcount reductions that likely were not envisioned prior to your October update. So I'm wondering why we're not seeing more incrementality sooner on that front or perhaps we are, just being absorbed by the macro headwinds. So if you could clarify that, that would be great."

But any comments on that would be very much appreciated."

First, apologies for the state of my voice. I have a cold so please bear with me. I'm going to start with some highlights from our first quarter performance and then reveal the progress we've made against our 5 strategic actions we laid out last October to reignite growth. Finally, I will touch on our outlook for the remainder of the year before I turn the call over to Kathy to take you through more details on the financial results. 
Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased to report early momentum in the beginning of 2015, a year of transition for the company. We delivered promising first quarter results, especially in light of the significant macroeconomic volatility in many regions around the world and the productivity and rewiring initiatives we are implementing this year. For those of you following our webcast, you can see our quarterly performance scorecard on Slide 4. Our performance was largely driven by the strength of our global brand portfolio and the strong distribution capabilities of our bottling partners as evidenced by our continued global share gains in NARTD, sparkling beverages as well as still beverages in the quarter. While certain markets face significant currency devaluation, economic slowdown or political unrest, our focus on improving our execution enabled us to deliver overall solid results. We grew our top line and bottom line due to initial improvements in underlying business, the timing of Easter and 6 extra days in our fiscal quarter. Importantly, net revenues grew 8% on an organic basis driven by the extra selling days and positive 3% price/mix globally. While it's still early in the year, we are pleased with the 3% global price/mix and the 2% price/mix in North America, both ahead of full year 2014 results. This price/mix is a result of disciplined implementation of our price/pack channel strategies, which is a key and consistent portion of our long-term approach to creating value for consumers, customers, bottlers and ourselves. 
Productivity initiatives. The 9 commodity costs and favorable product mix in key markets drove gross and operating margin improvement, and we continue to invest substantially behind advertising, leading to double-digit increase in marketing spend. The bottom line result was double-digit growth in comparable currency-neutral income before tax. 
Now turning to the 5 strategic actions we laid out for this year. One of our key strategic initiatives is making disciplined brand and growth investments. As mentioned earlier, we increased our media investments double digits in the quarter as we work towards believe fully funding brand plants -- fully funded brand plans in markets around the world while at the same time enhancing the quality of our advertising. Great example of this is the new Coca-Cola marketing campaign during the Chinese New Year, which helped our China business grow brand Coca-Cola volume 9% despite slowing economic conditions. As we said previously, media investments take about 12 to 24 months to realize their full value. So while we are seeing initial positive results, we're even more encouraged by the knowledge of it is still early in the process and we have tremendous runway for continued improvement in our top line growth. We remain resolutely focused on driving cost out of the business and embedding a culture of productivity into our DNA, which is enabling us to fund our brand and growth investments. This change in culture is reflected in incorporating zero-based work processes into all phases of our annual planning cycles. We remain on track across all spend areas to deliver more than $0.5 billion in savings this year and $3 billion in annualized savings by 2019. The difficult but necessary changes made during the end of 2014 are now accounted for in our budgets and tied to our objectives and goals. The initial implementation of our new operating model is on track, and the previously announced headcount reductions associated with this change are well underway. We're continuing to work through the rewiring of business processes within the entire organization. So for example, we've eliminated and layered in many of our functions at the group levels in different geographies and linked our Corporate Center directly to our business units. In R&D, this means connecting our corporate R&D efforts directly to our global development centers and linking both of these to service our business across business units across the world. So this allows us to scale our efforts in innovation, share new developments faster and accelerate development from new products. In addition, we're also rewiring our marketing organization around consumer clusters to drive speed, to drive efficiency and effectiveness. This will allow us to better leverage learnings from similar markets regardless of the geographic location and improve the quality of our advertising through our network marketing model. A great example of this is how we are strategically leveraging the hundredth anniversary of our Coca-Cola bottle to drive our business forward through integrated marketing, commercial and innovation under 1 umbrella to reach approximately 140 markets. This campaign centers on the magic of drinking a Coke with the emphasis on the experience as much as the bottle. And as such, it's focused on driving profitable immediate consumption packages and purchase transactions. And as part of this campaign, our system is investing in glass bottles all around the world, while introducing the next generation contour PET bottle and expanding supply of our premium aluminum bottles in key developed markets. Importantly, this is not simply a global campaign, rather it's a new way of network marketing that has led to a creation of 20 marketing assets that markets can use, leverage in a more cost-effective modular manner. Some of our markets will leverage the campaign throughout the year while others quarter by quarter. As a result, we have significantly been able to reduce our production and development costs for gross rating point allowing more dollars to be focused against the consumer. 
We're seeing initial positive results in the market that have already launched the campaign such as South Africa, Australia and Latin Center. And across the entire company, our deeper market segmentation strategy is also starting to yield early results. Two examples are North America and India here. In North America, we're focused on generating revenue through a greater reliance on price realization. Increased media investments, coupled with our segmented price back strategies, drove revenue growth in our sparkling portfolio through a strong 3% price/mix and a 1% increase in transactions. Simply put, more consumers are enjoying our products more often and are increasingly choosing smaller packages, including our iconic contour bottle. Whereas in India, where our revenue growth strategy is focused on expanding distribution and recruiting new consumers, we drove double-digit unit case volume growth in both our sparkling as well as still portfolio. 
Turning to our focus on our core business model. We continue to make progress on our North America refranchising efforts in the quarter. First, we remain on track with our previously announced territory transfers to existing partners. During the quarter, we transitioned 4 territories to Coca-Cola Consolidated and are on track to transfer additional territories in Kentucky and Tennessee to Consolidated and Coca-Cola this year. We are slightly ahead of schedule to close the previously announced transactions with new entrants into our bottling network. So territory transfers to both Troy Taylor in Central Florida and Reyes Holdings in Chicago are slated to close in the second quarter. Together, the territories expecting to transition to these 2 new partners will represent approximately 5% of U.S. bottle can volume. 
Finally, just this morning, we announced the signing of new letters of intent with existing bottling partners for territories covering more than 5% of bottle can volume. In aggregate, territories transitioned to date and those covered by definitive agreements or letters of intent represent a little over 15% of total U.S. bottle can volume. Further, as we continue to transition territory, we're getting better and faster, which is why we are confident that our previously stated timeline to have 2/3 of bottle/can volume distributed by our independent bottling partners by 2017 is very much on track. Looking outside of North America, we closed our joint venture with Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia in early April. I was in Jakarta earlier this year with the Indonesian bottling -- bottler to celebrate this new venture. This investment will help us capture the growth opportunity in 1 of the largest and most dynamic countries in the world as we enable our system to be even more responsive to consumer and customer needs. 
So we're off to a solid start in 2015, and we are on track to deliver against our full year currency-neutral EPS expectation of mid-single digit growth. Importantly, I'm encouraged by the progress we have made, and we remain confident that we have the right strategies in place to create sustainable shareholder value. However, there is still much work ahead of us. We continue to expect that the benefits from the announced initiatives will take time to fully materialize. Further, we're operating in a very challenging environment. The cautious recovery in the U.S. is offset by our relatively sluggish expansion in Europe and Japan, as well as weaknesses in emerging markets, notably Brazil and Russia as well as China slowing down. Therefore, we remain cautious in our outlook, so we will continue to focus on what we can control and execute against our strategic initiatives to emerge stronger and better positioned to capture growth in the global nonalcoholic beverage industries. I will now hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our financial performance as well as update on our outlook on our business for 2015."

As I am going to spend a few minutes discussing the quarter and then our outlook for 2015 as Muhtar just stated. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and encouraged by some of the early signs of success. Our positive pricing continues as we focus on driving revenue in the marketplace, and our reinvestment in brand Coca-Cola starting to yield results. 
Focusing on the quarter. Organic revenue growth was driven by 5% growth in concentrate shipments and 3 points of positive price/mix. The concentrate shipment growth benefited from the 6 extra days in the area. These extra days will reverse in the fourth quarter, so you will see a corresponding impact in that period. After adjusting for the 6 extra days in this quarter, concentrate shipment lagged unit cases primarily due to the timing of shipments in our international markets. For the full year, we expect concentrate shipments to be generally in line with unit cases. 
Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing and product mix initiative across many of our markets. In addition, we benefited from positive geographic mix as markets where shipments lagged reported unit cases were in revenue for CSC markets. As we move through the year, I would like to remind you a couple of points: First, we move again to cycle better underlying pricing; and second, as we catch up from the timing of shipments in international markets, we will see negative pressure in the geographic mix in the consolidated level. Therefore, while we remain resolutely focused on driving revenue in our market, we do expect price/mix to moderate from the current level. 
Our comparable growth margins improved about 75 basis points on a consolidated basis. This increase was driven primarily by better margins in North America due to positive pricing and business mix as well as moderately lower commodity costs. As we think about the remainder of the year, we would also expect many of these drivers to moderate as we begin to cycle more difficult comparison. Therefore, our full year outlook on gross margins has not changed from our prior guidance. 
Comparable currency-neutral operating leverage came in better than anticipated in the quarter, primarily due to the stronger growth in gross profit driven by the factors just mentioned. Comparable currency-neutral income before tax grew 13%. The combined impact of structural items and the provision in Venezuela resulted in a 3-point headwind on income before tax, which was consistent with our previous outlook. 
Our first quarter comparable EPS was $0.48, which included a 6-point currency headwind. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, our EPS grew 15% in the quarter. With 6-point currency headwind, it was slightly less than our original expectation, primarily due to the benefit from foreign exchange gains associated with the euro-denominated debt issued during the quarter. Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debts, costs associated with our previously announced $3 billion productivity program and charges related to our Venezuelan operations. As many of you know, the Venezuelan government introduced a new floating exchange rate mechanism called Simadi in mid-February. We remeasured our Bolivar-denominated net monetary assets at the end of the first quarter using the new Simadi floating exchange rate of approximately VEF 193 to the dollar and translated our Venezuelan subsidiary's local currency income statement into U.S. dollars using that same rate. We generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, up 72%, primarily due to the efficient management of working capital, the impact of 6 additional days and the timing of capital expenditure, that's partially offset by an unfavorable impact from currency exchange rate. We returned $1.8 billion to shareowners in the form of dividends and net share repurchases during the quarter, which is reflective of our commitment to share return cash to shareholders. In 2015, we increased our annual dividend by 8% to $1.32 per share, and it's worth noting that we had increased our dividend every year for more than half a century. 
Turning to outlook. While we are encouraged by some of the early signs of success, it is still early in the year, and global economic growth remains constrained by challenges in many markets as evidenced in regions like Brazil, Russia and China. Therefore, we are maintaining our underlying full year currency-neutral growth expectations as previously provided. However, we are updating the expected impacts from structural items and currency. During our last call, we said we expect the transaction with Monster Beverage Corp. to close in early Q2. We now expect closing to happen in the latter half of the second quarter as the parties work to satisfy contractual closing considerations. However, distribution of Monster products in the U.S. has already begun transitioning to the KO system. Finally, we are slightly ahead of schedule on closing the U.S. territory transfers to Troy Taylor and Reyes Holdings. We now estimate that the net impact of structural items on full year 2015 results will be a slight headwind on net revenue growth with no material change to our prior outlook on income before tax. Therefore, consistent with what we said in February, for the full year 2015, we continue to expect mid-single digit comparable currency-neutral EPS growth. However, we do see a slight change in the impact from currency exchange rates. After considering our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we now expect an approximate 6-point currency headwind on net revenue and approximate 10-point currency headwind on operating income and an approximate 7-point headwind on income before tax for the full year 2015. The currency impact on income before tax remains roughly the same as our previous outlook as the foreign exchange gains associated with our euro-denominated debt issued this quarter is offset by the effects from translating our Bolivar-denominated profit as the Simadi exchange rate as well as the continued decline in several emerging and developing market currencies. 
So we're modeling the second quarter, there are couple of phasing items you should consider. The timing of Easter benefited the first quarter this year while it benefited the second quarter of last year. We expect structural items to be roughly neutral impact on net revenue and a 1- to 2-point headwind on income before tax. And then finally, we can expect currency will be an approximate 7-point headwind on net revenue and approximate 10-point headwind on operating income and a 5- to 6-point headwind on income before tax in the second quarter as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior year. The variance between the currency headwinds and operating income and the income before tax is primarily due to the foreign exchange rates associated with our euro debt. 
In closing, we are cautiously optimistic about the progress we see in the business, which gives us increased confidence that our strategies and actions are working. With that said, it is still early days in a transition year as we implement significant change in our company amidst a volatile and challenging operating environment. But we absolutely believe that The Coca-Cola Company's best positioned to capture growth in nonalcoholic beverages and to continue to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

It sounds like you're sort of tracking pretty well in terms of cost savings and redeploying or spending more marketing. I guess, when we think about the factors that are outside of your control, which would be, I guess, some of the macro factors, the change in the Venezuela exchange rate some of the markets are moving, I'm not sure if we have a great sense for maybe what's worse or what's better.

It's Muhtar here. Good morning again. So in North America, I'll start with North America, I'd say that the outlook appears to be trending a little positive, raising hopes to potential wage growth and lower fuel prices could translate into consumer spending. In Latin America, Mexico's -- the best way I'd say it is relatively stable and continues to track closer to the United States because there are some closely linked. Brazil continues to deteriorate faster than we expect it, I would say that. Venezuela continues to increase in the concern given the growing difficulty on maintaining supply in the marketplace. And Argentina continues to be challenging. And Columbia is, again, is kind of a star in Latin America in terms of performance in macro conditions. So in Europe, I think there are also some green shoots on the back of monetary easing. But it's early days, that's just started, but deflation still remains a concern this year. And overall, consumer spending in Europe, I'd say, is still sluggish as it will still take time for, I think, monetary easing to flow to the consumer pockets and translate it into increased consumer spending. And then risk to recovery remain still volatile environment and, of course, you got the possible Greek exit issues lingering on. In Eurasia and Africa, Russia continues to see significant challenges -- the Russian consumer, and we expect it to continue to remain challenging throughout the year, this year. Sub-Saharan Africa is a strong bright spot and we're seeing that in our results. And then Middle East, we've got some pockets where it's defying geopolitical environment but overall, obviously, increased geopolitical risks there. And then in Asia and Pacific China continues the disposable incomes, consumer spending CSE in China continues to decelerate. We saw that happening in Q1 versus the stated GDP of 7%. Japan remains sluggish, I'd say similar to Europe, although we are starting to see some green shoots in the economy. And finally, in Asia Pacific, India continues to be a bright spot, I'd say, inside the brick markets, the corporate markets. So that's the sort of walk through in terms of -- and then the consumer -- the commodity environment, again talking about what we control and what we can't remains fairly benign compared to previous years, stable and benign. And so given the value growth for us is highly correlated to PCE growth. I hope I've been able to give you a sort of quick walk-through of what's good and what's not so good and what's more stable."

And that's exactly what we've been doing and what we continue to plan to do with a lot of discipline and focus. As you look at the first quarter, if you look at each business by themselves, we met our pricing objectives in the first quarter.

We're following exactly the same strategy of managing our product mix and price versus volume around markets international. In fact, we're getting some pretty good results in many of our big markets, specifically in Europe. One must remember that last year, we had some fairly aggressive pricing, which resulted in our view somewhat of an imbalanced progression of our business where we have lost some market share but get -- got great pricing. So we were saying before that we will be moderating that somewhat this year so we have a more balanced growth of volume and revenue. So what you saw in the first quarter is a result of that sort of moderation. But we do believe that we would be achieving reasonable price/mix in Europe in the course of this year."

And when you adjust for and you adjust for currency, cost of goods is really in line with concentrate shipments, and then the other issue then would just be commodities.

And then on a related note, I was wondering if you could also mention for us a profit contribution to this price/mix you're getting because clearly if it was all rates, pure rate, that it would sort of flow-through 100% to profit all else equal. But given that a lot of us are seeing category mix and direction of new package types, I'm wondering how to think about that proper contribution. Should we assume 50% as a rule of thumb roughly?

You saw in Nielsen very strong price growth. Some of that was driven by wholesale improvement that we were achieving with our customers. Some of it was lapping some really aggressive promotional activity that happened in the end of February and early March, and some of it were our customers making more money in that category. So the net effect of it was a really good start to the year in line with our plan. If you cross our business over into our chilled business, we saw a price realization there. We launched some new items that drove incremental revenue. And then as I mentioned, the fountain business was stronger than we expected at the beginning of the year which creates a business mix drag overall. What I'd say from a profitability standpoint is that the combination of rate and mix was in line with our expectations. But I'd also point out that as we get into the second half of the year, you're going to see more difficult pricing comparisons, and we will continue our strategy of rigorous and disciplined and focused price volume management, but we'll be lapping ourselves and we'll be continuing to do so but against a little bit tougher comparison.

And then assuming so, how much of that 180-basis-point improvement was driven by some of the better pricing realization, the better productivity, commodities that can kind of continue as a run rate versus time and benefits in the quarter related to the Easter and the calendar shift?

And as you know, as we look at it from a perspective, we have constructionally just to pull them out, you pulled out the benefit so we put it back on and apples-to-apples basis year-over-year. So there is not a big difference at operating versus PBT in our North American operations at this point. And so the margin expansion, that is basically really good pricing as we get rid of the pricing in the fourth quarter last year. They're very focused on pricing, that will continue.

First, apologies for the state of my voice. I have a cold, so please bear with me. 
I'm going to start with some highlights from our first quarter performance and then reveal the progress we've made against our 5 strategic actions we laid out last October to reignite growth. Finally, I will touch on our outlook for the remainder of the year before I turn the call over to Kathy to take you through more details on the financial results. 
Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased to report early momentum in the beginning of 2015, a year of transition for the company. We delivered promising first quarter results, especially in light of the significant macroeconomic volatility in many regions around the world and the productivity and rewiring initiatives we are implementing this year. 
For those of you following our webcast, you can see our quarterly performance scorecard on Slide 4. Our performance was largely driven by the strength of our global brand portfolio and the strong distribution capabilities of our bottling partners as evidenced by our continued global value share gains in NARTD, sparkling beverages as well as still beverages in the quarter. While certain markets faced significant currency devaluation, economic slowdown or political unrest, our focus on improving our execution enabled us to deliver overall solid results. We grew our top line and bottom line due to initial improvements in the underlying business, the timing of Easter and 6 extra days in our fiscal quarter. Importantly, net revenues grew 8% on an organic basis, driven by the extra selling days and positive 3% price/mix globally. While it's still early in the year, we are pleased with the 3% global price/mix and the 2% price/mix in North America, both ahead of full year 2014 results. This price/mix is the result of disciplined implementation of our price/pack channel strategies, which is a key and consistent portion of our long-term approach to creating value for consumers, customers, bottlers and ourselves. 
Productivity initiatives. Benign commodity costs and favorable product mix in key markets drove gross and operating margin improvement, and we continue to invest substantially behind advertising, leading to double-digit increase in marketing spend. The bottom line result was double-digit growth in comparable currency-neutral income before tax. 
Now turning to the 5 strategic actions we laid out for this year. One of our key strategic initiatives is making disciplined brand and growth investments. As mentioned earlier, we increased our media investments double digits in the quarter as we worked towards fully funding brand plans -- fully funded brand plans in markets around the world while, at the same time, enhancing the quality of our advertising. Great example of this is the new Coca-Cola marketing campaign during the Chinese New Year, which helped our China business grow brand Coca-Cola volume 9% despite slowing economic conditions. As we said previously, media investments take about 12 to 24 months to realize their full value. So while we are seeing initial positive results, we're even more encouraged by the knowledge that it is still early in the process, and we have tremendous runway for continued improvement in our top line growth. We remain resolutely focused on driving cost out of the business and embedding a culture of productivity into our DNA, which is enabling us to fund our brand and growth investments. This change in culture is reflected in incorporating zero-based work processes into all phases of our annual planning cycles. We remain on track across all spend areas to deliver more than $0.5 billion in savings this year and $3 billion in annualized savings by 2019. The difficult but necessary changes made during the end of 2014 are now accounted for in our budgets and tied to our objectives and goals. The initial implementation of our new operating model is on track, and the previously announced headcount reductions associated with this change are well underway. We're continuing to work through the rewiring of business processes within the entire organization. So for example, we've eliminated a layer in many of our functions at the group levels in different geographies and linked our Corporate Center directly to our business units. In R&D, this means connecting our corporate R&D efforts directly to our global development centers and linking both of these to service our business across -- business units across the world. So this allows us to scale our efforts in innovation, share new developments faster and accelerate development of new products. 
In addition, we're also rewiring our marketing organization around consumer clusters to drive speed, to drive efficiency and effectiveness. This will allow us to better leverage learnings from similar markets regardless of the geographic location and improve the quality of our advertising through our networked marketing model. A great example of this is how we are strategically leveraging the 100th anniversary of our contour Coca-Cola bottle to drive our business forward through integrating marketing, commercial and innovation under one umbrella to reach approximately 140 markets. This campaign centers on the magic of drinking a Coke with the emphasis on the experience as much as the bottle. And as such, it's focused on driving profitable immediate consumption packages and purchase transactions. And as part of this campaign, our system is investing in glass bottles all around the world while introducing the next-generation contour PET bottle and expanding the supply of our premium aluminum bottles in key developed markets. Importantly, this is not simply a global campaign. Rather, it's a new way of networked marketing that has led to the creation of 20 marketing assets that markets can use, leverage in a more cost-effective modular manner. Some of our markets will leverage the campaign throughout the year, while others, quarter by quarter. As a result, we have significantly been able to reduce our production and development cost per gross rating point, allowing more dollars to be focused against the consumer. 
We're seeing initial positive results in the markets that have already launched the campaign such as South Africa, Australia and Latin Center. And across the entire company, our deeper market segmentation strategy is also starting to yield early results. Two examples are North America and India here. In North America, we're focused on generating revenue through a greater reliance on price realization. Increased media investments, coupled with our segmented price/back strategies, drove revenue growth in our sparkling portfolio through a strong 3% price/mix and a 1% increase in transactions. Simply put, more consumers are enjoying our products more often and are increasingly choosing smaller packages, including our iconic contour bottle. Whereas in India, where our revenue growth strategies focus on expanding distribution and recruiting new consumers, we drove double-digit unit case volume growth in both our sparkling as well as still portfolio. 
Turning to our focus on our core business model. We continue to make progress on our North America refranchising efforts in the quarter. First, we remain on track with our previously announced territory transfers to existing partners. During the quarter, we transitioned 4 territories to Coca-Cola Consolidated and are on track to transfer additional territories in Kentucky and Tennessee to Consolidated and Corinth -- Coca-Cola Corinth this year. We are slightly ahead of schedule to close the previously announced transactions with new entrants into our bottling network. So territory transfers to both Troy Taylor in Central Florida and Reyes Holdings in Chicago are slated to close in the second quarter. Together, the territories pending to transition to these 2 new partners will represent approximately 5% of U.S. bottle/can volume. 
Finally, just this morning, we announced the signing of new letters of intent with existing bottling partners for territories covering more than 5% of bottle/can volume. In aggregate, territories transitioned to date and those covered by definitive agreements or letters of intent represent a little over 15% of total U.S. bottle/can volume. Further, as we continue to transition territories, we're getting better and faster, which is why we are confident that our previously stated timeline to have 2/3 of bottle/can volume distributed by our independent bottling partners by 2017 is very much on track. 
Looking outside of North America, we closed our joint venture with Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia in early April. I was in Jakarta earlier this year with the Indonesian bottling -- bottler to celebrate this new venture. This investment will help us capture the growth opportunity in one of the largest and most dynamic countries in the world as we enable our system to be even more responsive to consumer and customer needs. 
So we are off to a solid start in 2015, and we are on track to deliver against our full year currency-neutral EPS expectation of mid-single-digit growth. Importantly, I'm encouraged by the progress we have made, and we remain confident that we have the right strategies in place to create sustainable shareholder value. However, there is still much work ahead of us. We continue to expect that the benefits from the announced initiatives will take time to fully materialize. Further, we're operating in a very challenging environment. The cautious recovery in the U.S. is offset by a relatively sluggish expansion in Europe and Japan as well as weaknesses in emerging markets, notably Brazil and Russia, as well as China slowing down. Therefore, we remain cautious in our outlook, so we will continue to focus on what we can control and execute against our strategic initiatives to emerge stronger and better positioned to capture growth in the global nonalcoholic beverage industry. 
I will now hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our financial performance as well as update on our outlook on our business for 2015."
26642,288941683,792046,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2015",2015-04-22,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. So I am going to spend a few minutes discussing the quarter and then our outlook for 2015, as Muhtar just stated. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and encouraged by some of the earl",1218,"Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. So I am going to spend a few minutes discussing the quarter and then our outlook for 2015, as Muhtar just stated. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and encouraged by some of the early signs of success. Our positive pricing continues as we focus on driving revenue in the marketplace, and our reinvestment in brand Coca-Cola is starting to yield results. 
Focusing on the quarter, organic revenue growth was driven by 5% growth in concentrate shipments and 3 points of positive price/mix. The concentrate shipment growth benefited from the 6 extra days in the period. These extra days will reverse in the fourth quarter, so you will see a corresponding impact in that period. After adjusting for the 6 extra days in this quarter, concentrate shipments lagged unit cases primarily due to the timing of shipments in our international markets. For the full year, we expect concentrate shipments to be generally in line with unit cases. 
Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing and product mix initiative across many of our markets. In addition, we benefited from positive geographic mix as markets where shipments lagged reported unit cases were in lower revenue for CSD markets. As we move through the year, I would like to remind you a couple of points. First, we move again to cycle better underlying pricing; and second, as we catch up from the timing of shipments in international markets, we will see negative pressure from geographic mix at the consolidated level. Therefore, while we remain resolutely focused on driving revenue in our market, we do expect price/mix to moderate from the current level. 
Our comparable gross margins improved about 75 basis points on a consolidated basis. This increase was driven primarily by better margins in North America due to positive pricing and business mix as well as moderately lower commodity costs. As we think about the remainder of the year, we would also expect many of these drivers to moderate as we begin to cycle more difficult comparisons. Therefore, our full year outlook on gross margins has not changed from our prior guidance. 
Comparable currency-neutral operating leverage came in better than anticipated in the quarter primarily due to the stronger growth in gross profit, driven by the factors just mentioned. Comparable currency-neutral income before tax grew 13%. The combined impact of structural items and the provision in Venezuela resulted in a 3-point headwind on income before tax, which was consistent with our previous outlook. 
Our first quarter comparable EPS was $0.48, which included a 6-point currency headwind. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, our EPS grew 15% in the quarter. The 6-point currency headwind was slightly less than our original expectation primarily due to the benefit from foreign exchange gains associated with the euro-denominated debt issued during the quarter. Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt, costs associated with our previously announced $3 billion productivity program and charges related to our Venezuelan operations. As many of you know, the Venezuelan government introduced a new floating exchange rate mechanism called SIMADI in mid-February. We remeasured our bolivar-denominated net monetary assets at the end of the first quarter using the new SIMADI floating exchange rate of approximately VEF 193 to the dollar and translated our Venezuelan subsidiary's local currency income statement into U.S. dollars using that same rate. 
We generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, up 72%, primarily due to the efficient management of working capital, the impact of 6 additional days and the timing of capital expenditures, and was partially offset by an unfavorable impact from currency exchange rate. We returned $1.8 billion to shareowners in the form of dividends and net share repurchases during the quarter, which is reflective of our commitment to return cash to shareowners. In 2015, we increased our annual dividend by 8% to $1.32 per share, and it's worth noting that we have increased our dividend every year for more than half a century. 
Turning to outlook. While we are encouraged by some of the early signs of success, it is still early in the year, and global economic growth remains constrained by challenges in many markets, as evidenced in regions like Brazil, Russia and China. Therefore, we are maintaining our underlying full year currency-neutral growth expectations as previously provided. However, we are updating the expected impacts from structural items and currency. During our last call, we said we expected the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation to close in early Q2. We now expect closing to happen in the latter half of the second quarter as the parties work to satisfy contractual closing considerations. However, distribution of Monster products in the U.S. has already begun transitioning to the KO system. Finally, we are slightly ahead of schedule on closing the U.S. territory transfers to Troy Taylor and Reyes Holdings. We now estimate that the net impact of structural items on full year 2015 results will be a slight headwind on net revenue growth, with no material change to our prior outlook on income before tax. Therefore, consistent with what we said in February, for the full year 2015, we continue to expect mid-single-digit comparable currency-neutral EPS growth. However, we do see a slight change in the impact from currency exchange rates. After considering our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we now expect an approximate 6-point currency headwind on net revenue, an approximate 10-point currency headwind on operating income and an approximate 7-point headwind on income before tax for the full year 2015. The currency impact on income before tax remains roughly the same as our previous outlook as the foreign exchange gains associated with our euro-denominated debt issued this quarter is offset by the effects from translating our bolivar-denominated profit at the SIMADI exchange rate as well as the continued decline in several emerging and developing market currencies. 
So when modeling the second quarter, there are a couple of phasing items you should consider. The timing of Easter benefited the first quarter this year, while it benefited the second quarter of last year. We expect structural items to be roughly neutral impact on net revenue and a 1- to 2-point headwind on income before tax. And then finally, we currently expect currency will be an approximate 7-point headwind on net revenues, an approximate 10-point headwind on operating income and a 5- to 6-point headwind on income before tax in the second quarter as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior year. The variance between the currency headwind at operating income and at income before tax is primarily due to the foreign exchange gains associated with our euro debt. 
In closing, we are cautiously optimistic about the progress we see in the business, which gives us increased confidence that our strategies and actions are working. With that said, it is still early days in a transition year as we implement significant change in our company amidst a volatile and challenging operating environment. So we absolutely believe that The Coca-Cola Company is best positioned to capture growth in nonalcoholic beverages and to continue to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. 
Operator, we are now ready for questions."

It sounds like the refranchising in North America is pacing maybe a little faster. Closing the Monster transaction is taking a little bit longer. And it sounds like you're sort of tracking pretty well in terms of cost savings and redeploying or spending more marketing. I guess when we think about the factors that are outside of your control, which would be, I guess, some of the macro factors, the change in the Venezuela exchange rate, how some of the markets are moving, I'm not sure if we have a great sense for maybe what's worse or what's better.

So in North America, I'll start with North America, I'd say that the outlook appears to be trending a little positive, raising hopes that potential wage growth and lower fuel prices could translate into consumer spending. In Latin America, Mexico, the best way I'd say, is relatively stable and continues to track closer to the United States because they're closely linked. Brazil continues to deteriorate faster than we expected. I would say that. Venezuela continues to increase as a concern given the growing difficulty on maintaining supply in the marketplace. And Argentina just continues to be challenging. And Colombia is, again, is kind of a star in Latin America in terms of performance and macro conditions. So in Europe, I think there are also some green shoots on the back of monetary easing, but it's early days. That just started. But deflation still remains a concern this year. And overall, consumer spending in Europe, I'd say, is still sluggish as it will take time for, I think, monetary easing to flow to the consumer pockets and translate into increased consumer spending. And then risk to recovery remain a still volatile environment. And then, of course, you got the possible Greece exit issues lingering on. In Eurasia and Africa, Russia continues to see significant challenges, the Russian consumer, and we expect it to continue to remain challenging throughout the year, this year. Sub-Saharan Africa is a strong bright spot, and we're seeing that in our results. And then Middle East, we've got some pockets where it's defying the geopolitical environment, but overall, obviously, increased geopolitical risks there. And then in Asia and Pacific, China continues -- the disposable incomes, consumer spending, CSC [ph] in China continues to decelerate. We saw that happening in Q1 versus the stated GDP of 7%. Japan remains sluggish, I'd say similar to Europe, although we are starting to see some green shoots in the economy. And finally, in Asia Pacific, India continues to be a bright spot, I'd say, inside the BRIC end markets, the corporate markets. So that's the sort of walk-through in terms of -- and then the commodity environment, again, talking about what we can control and what we can't, remains fairly benign compared to previous years, stable and benign. And so given that value growth for us is highly correlated to PCE growth, I hope I've been able to give you a sort of quick walk-through of what's good and what's not so good and what's more stable."

One must remember that last year, we've had some fairly aggressive pricing, which resulted in our view somewhat of an imbalanced progression of our business, where we have lost some market share but got great pricing. So we were saying before that we will be moderating that somewhat this year so that we have a more balanced growth of volume and revenue.

You saw in Nielsen very strong price growth. Some of that was driven by wholesale improvement that we were achieving with our customers. Some of it was lapping some really aggressive promotional activity that happened in the end of February and early March, and some of it was our customers making more money in the category. So the net effect of it was a really good start to the year in line with our plan. If you cross our business over into our chilled Minute Maid business, we saw price realization there. We launched some new items that drove some incremental revenue. And then as I mentioned, the fountain business was stronger than we expected at the beginning of the year, which creates a business mix drag overall. What I'd say from a profitability standpoint is that the combination of rate and mix was in line with our expectations. But I'd also point out that as we get into the second half of the year, you're going to see more difficult pricing comparisons.

So as far as the refranchising is concerned, I wouldn't expect to see much benefit at this point from the sub-bottling payments. And as you know, if you look at it from an  [indiscernible] perspective, we have constructionally adjusted those and pulled them out. You pull out the benefit so that we put it back on an apples-to-apples basis year-over-year. So there is not a big difference at operating versus PBT in our North American operations at this point.

The only thing you said was that we're on track for $500 million of cost savings this year. But we're not hearing or seeing a lot of that flowing through, even offsetting things. I'm not saying probably the bottom line, but at least offsetting some of your investments. So when can we start hearing more about that savings offsetting your investments?"

So I'd just say to you, had it not been for the productivity, we certainly would not be able to enable our organization to generate the kind of momentum so that you see beginning to come back in. That's clear. There's no question about that. And so this is not a 4 or 5 sequential kind of compartments. This is a very integrated sort of approach to how we bring more momentum into our business. And everything that I mentioned is happening at the same time, a better wired organization, better marketing, marketing that works around clusters, more effective marketing linked to social media as well as into a better cost per GRP, all of that funded by incremental productivity. And so I think that's how you need to see our entire sort of different buckets of our strategy coming to life."

First, apologies for the state of my voice. I have a cold, so please bear with me. 
I'm going to start with some highlights from our first quarter performance and then review the progress we've made against our 5 strategic actions we laid out last October to reignite growth. Finally, I will touch on our outlook for the remainder of the year before I turn the call over to Kathy to take you through more details on the financial results. 
Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased to report early momentum in the beginning of 2015, a year of transition for the company. We delivered promising first quarter results, especially in light of the significant macroeconomic volatility in many regions around the world and the productivity and rewiring initiatives we are implementing this year. 
For those of you following our webcast, you can see our quarterly performance scorecard on Slide 4. Our performance was largely driven by the strength of our global brand portfolio and the strong distribution capabilities of our bottling partners as evidenced by our continued global value share gains in NARTD, sparkling beverages as well as still beverages in the quarter. While certain markets faced significant currency devaluation, economic slowdown or political unrest, our focus on improving our execution enabled us to deliver overall solid results. We grew our top line and bottom line due to initial improvements in the underlying business, the timing of Easter and 6 extra days in our fiscal quarter. Importantly, net revenues grew 8% on an organic basis, driven by the extra selling days and positive 3% price/mix globally. While it's still early in the year, we are pleased with the 3% global price/mix and the 2% price/mix in North America, both ahead of full year 2014 results. This price/mix is the result of disciplined implementation of our price/pack channel strategies, which is a key and consistent portion of our long-term approach to creating value for consumers, customers, bottlers and ourselves. 
Productivity initiatives. Benign commodity costs and favorable product mix in key markets drove gross and operating margin improvement, and we continue to invest substantially behind advertising, leading to double-digit increase in marketing spend. The bottom line result was double-digit growth in comparable currency-neutral income before tax. 
Now turning to the 5 strategic actions we laid out for this year. One of our key strategic initiatives is making disciplined brand and growth investments. As mentioned earlier, we increased our media investments double digits in the quarter as we work towards fully funding brand plans -- fully funded brand plans in markets around the world while, at the same time, enhancing the quality of our advertising. Great example of this is the new Coca-Cola marketing campaign during the Chinese New Year, which helped our China business grow brand Coca-Cola volume 9% despite slowing economic conditions. As we said previously, media investments take about 12 to 24 months to realize their full value. So while we are seeing initial positive results, we're even more encouraged by the knowledge that it is still early in the process, and we have tremendous runway for continued improvement in our top line growth. We remain resolutely focused on driving cost out of the business and embedding a culture of productivity into our DNA, which is enabling us to fund our brand and growth investments. This change in culture is reflected in incorporating zero-based work processes into all phases of our annual planning cycles. We remain on track across all spend areas to deliver more than $0.5 billion in savings this year and $3 billion in annualized savings by 2019. The difficult but necessary changes made during the end of 2014 are now accounted for in our budgets and tied to our objectives and goals. The initial implementation of our new operating model is on track, and the previously announced headcount reductions associated with this change are well underway. We're continuing to work through the rewiring of business processes within the entire organization. So for example, we've eliminated a layer in many of our functions at the group levels in different geographies and linked our Corporate Center directly to our business units. In R&D, this means connecting our corporate R&D efforts directly to our global development centers and linking both of these to service our business across -- business units across the world. So this allows us to scale our efforts in innovation, share new developments faster and accelerate development of new products. 
In addition, we're also rewiring our marketing organization around consumer clusters to drive speed, to drive efficiency and effectiveness. This will allow us to better leverage learnings from similar markets regardless of the geographic location and improve the quality of our advertising through our networked marketing model. A great example of this is how we are strategically leveraging the 100th anniversary of our contour Coca-Cola bottle to drive our business forward through integrating marketing, commercial and innovation under one umbrella to reach approximately 140 markets. This campaign centers on the magic of drinking a Coke with the emphasis on the experience as much as the bottle. And as such, it's focused on driving profitable immediate consumption packages and purchase transactions. And as part of this campaign, our system is investing in glass bottles all around the world, while introducing the next-generation contour PET bottle and expanding the supply of our premium aluminum bottles in key developed markets. Importantly, this is not simply a global campaign. Rather, it's a new way of networked marketing that has led to the creation of 20 marketing assets that markets can use, leverage in a more cost-effective modular manner. Some of our markets will leverage the campaign throughout the year, while others, quarter by quarter. As a result, we have significantly been able to reduce our production and development cost per gross rating point, allowing more dollars to be focused against the consumer. 
We're seeing initial positive results in the markets that have already launched the campaign such as South Africa, Australia and Latin Center. And across the entire company, our deeper market segmentation strategy is also starting to yield early results. Two examples are North America and India here. In North America, we're focused on generating revenue through a greater reliance on price realization. Increased media investments, coupled with our segmented price/back strategies, drove revenue growth in our sparkling portfolio through a strong 3% price/mix and a 1% increase in transactions. Simply put, more consumers are enjoying our products more often and are increasingly choosing smaller packages, including our iconic contour bottle. Whereas in India, where our revenue growth strategies focus on expanding distribution and recruiting new consumers, we drove double-digit unit case volume growth in both our sparkling as well as still portfolio. 
Turning to our focus on our core business model. We continue to make progress on our North America refranchising efforts in the quarter. First, we remain on track with our previously announced territory transfers to existing partners. During the quarter, we transitioned 4 territories to Coca-Cola Consolidated and are on track to transfer additional territories in Kentucky and Tennessee to Consolidated and Corinth -- Coca-Cola Corinth this year. We are slightly ahead of schedule to close the previously announced transactions with new entrants into our bottling network. So territory transfers to both Troy Taylor in Central Florida and Reyes Holdings in Chicago are slated to close in the second quarter. Together, the territories pending to transition to these 2 new partners will represent approximately 5% of U.S. bottle/can volume. 
Finally, just this morning, we announced the signing of new letters of intent with existing bottling partners for territories covering more than 5% of bottle/can volume. In aggregate, territories transitioned to-date and those covered by definitive agreements or letters of intent represent a little over 15% of total U.S. bottle/can volume. Further, as we continue to transition territories, we're getting better and faster, which is why we are confident that our previously stated timeline to have 2/3 of bottle/can volume distributed by our independent bottling partners by 2017 is very much on track. 
Looking outside of North America, we closed our joint venture with Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia in early April. I was in Jakarta earlier this year with the Indonesian bottling -- bottler to celebrate this new venture. This investment will help us capture the growth opportunity in one of the largest and most dynamic countries in the world, as we enable our system to be even more responsive to consumer and customer needs. 
So we are off to a solid start in 2015, and we are on track to deliver against our full year currency-neutral EPS expectation of mid-single-digit growth. Importantly, I'm encouraged by the progress we have made, and we remain confident that we have the right strategies in place to create sustainable shareholder value. However, there is still much work ahead of us. We continue to expect that the benefits from the announced initiatives will take time to fully materialize. Further, we're operating in a very challenging environment. The cautious recovery in the U.S. is offset by a relatively sluggish expansion in Europe and Japan, as well as weaknesses in emerging markets, notably Brazil and Russia, as well as China slowing down. Therefore, we remain cautious in our outlook, so we will continue to focus on what we can control and execute against our strategic initiatives to emerge stronger and better positioned to capture growth in the global nonalcoholic beverage industry. 
I will now hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our financial performance as well as update on our outlook on our business for 2015."
26642,288941683,792151,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2015",2015-04-22,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. So I am going to spend a few minutes discussing the quarter and then our outlook for 2015, as Muhtar just stated. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and encouraged by some of the earl",1218,"Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. So I am going to spend a few minutes discussing the quarter and then our outlook for 2015, as Muhtar just stated. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and encouraged by some of the early signs of success. Our positive pricing continues as we focus on driving revenue in the marketplace, and our reinvestment in brand Coca-Cola is starting to yield results. 
Focusing on the quarter, organic revenue growth was driven by 5% growth in concentrate shipments and 3 points of positive price/mix. The concentrate shipment growth benefited from the 6 extra days in the period. These extra days will reverse in the fourth quarter, so you will see a corresponding impact in that period. After adjusting for the 6 extra days in this quarter, concentrate shipments lagged unit cases, primarily due to the timing of shipments in our international markets. For the full year, we expect concentrate shipments to be generally in line with unit cases. 
Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing and product mix initiatives across many of our markets. In addition, we benefited from positive geographic mix as markets where shipments lagged reported unit cases were in lower revenue for CSD markets. As we move through the year, I would like to remind you a couple of points. First, we move again to cycle better underlying pricing; and second, as we catch up from the timing of shipments in international markets, we will see negative pressure from geographic mix at the consolidated levels. Therefore, while we remain resolutely focused on driving revenue in our markets, we do expect price/mix to moderate from the current level. 
Our comparable gross margins improved about 75 basis points on a consolidated basis. This increase was driven primarily by better margins in North America due to positive pricing and business mix as well as moderately lower commodity costs. As you think about the remainder of the year, we would also expect many of these drivers to moderate as we begin to cycle more difficult comparisons. Therefore, our full year outlook on gross margins has not changed from our prior guidance. 
Comparable currency-neutral operating leverage came in better than anticipated in the quarter primarily due to the stronger growth in gross profit, driven by the factors just mentioned. Comparable currency-neutral income before tax grew 13%. The combined impact of structural items and the provision in Venezuela resulted in a 3-point headwind on income before tax, which was consistent with our previous outlook. 
Our first quarter comparable EPS was $0.48, which included a 6-point currency headwind. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, our EPS grew 15% in the quarter. The 6-point currency headwind was slightly less than our original expectation primarily due to the benefit from foreign exchange gains associated with the euro-denominated debt issued during the quarter. Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt, costs associated with our previously announced $3 billion productivity program and charges related to our Venezuelan operations. As many of you know, the Venezuelan government introduced a new floating exchange rate mechanism called SIMADI in mid-February. We remeasured our bolivar-denominated net monetary assets at the end of the first quarter using the new SIMADI floating exchange rate of approximately VEF 193 to the dollar and translated our Venezuelan subsidiary's local currency income statement into U.S. dollars using that same rate. 
We generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, up 72%, primarily due to the efficient management of working capital, the impact of 6 additional days and the timing of capital expenditures, and was partially offset by an unfavorable impact from currency exchange rate. We returned $1.8 billion to shareowners in the form of dividends and net share repurchases during the quarter, which is reflective of our commitment to return cash to shareowners. In 2015, we increased our annual dividend by 8% to $1.32 per share, and it's worth noting that we have increased our dividend every year for more than half a century. 
Turning to outlook. While we are encouraged by some of the early signs of success, it is still early in the year, and global economic growth remains constrained by challenges in many markets, as evidenced in regions like Brazil, Russia and China. Therefore, we are maintaining our underlying full year currency-neutral growth expectations as previously provided. However, we are updating the expected impacts from structural items and currency. During our last call, we said we expected the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation to close in early Q2. We now expect closing to happen in the latter half of the second quarter as the parties work to satisfy contractual closing considerations. However, distribution of Monster products in the U.S. has already begun transitioning to the KO system. Finally, we are slightly ahead of schedule on closing the U.S. territory transfers to Troy Taylor and Reyes Holdings. We now estimate that the net impact of structural items on full year 2015 results will be a slight headwind on net revenue growth, with no material change to our prior outlook on income before tax. Therefore, consistent with what we said in February, for the full year 2015, we continue to expect mid-single-digit comparable currency-neutral EPS growth. However, we do see a slight change in the impact from currency exchange rates. After considering our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we now expect an approximate 6-point currency headwind on net revenue, an approximate 10-point currency headwind on operating income and an approximate 7-point headwind on income before tax for the full year 2015. The currency impact on income before tax remains roughly the same as our previous outlook as the foreign exchange gains associated with our euro-denominated debt issued this quarter is offset by the effects from translating our bolivar-denominated profit at the SIMADI exchange rate, as well as the continued decline in several emerging and developing market currencies. 
So when modeling the second quarter, there are a couple of phasing items you should consider. The timing of Easter benefited the first quarter this year, while it benefited the second quarter of last year. We expect structural items to be roughly neutral impact on net revenue and a 1- to 2-point headwind on income before tax. And then finally, we currently expect currency will be an approximate 7-point headwind on net revenues, an approximate 10-point headwind on operating income and a 5- to 6-point headwind on income before tax in the second quarter as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior year. The variance between the currency headwind at operating income and at income before tax is primarily due to that foreign exchange gains associated with our euro debt. 
In closing, we are cautiously optimistic about the progress we see in the business, which gives us increased confidence that our strategies and actions are working. With that said, it is still early days in a transition year as we implement significant change in our company amidst a volatile and challenging operating environment. So we absolutely believe that The Coca-Cola Company is best positioned to capture growth in nonalcoholic beverages and to continue to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. 
Operator, we are now ready for questions."

It sounds like the refranchising in North America is pacing maybe a little faster. Closing the Monster transaction is taking a little bit longer. And it sounds like you're sort of tracking pretty well in terms of cost savings and redeploying or spending more on marketing. I guess when we think about the factors that are outside of your control, which would be, I guess, some of the macro factors, the change in the Venezuela exchange rate, how some of the markets are moving, I'm not sure if we have a great sense for maybe what's worse or what's better.

In",422,"Sure, Bryan. It's Muhtar here. So in North America, I'll start with North America, I'd say that the outlook appears to be trending a little positive, raising hopes that potential wage growth and lower fuel prices could translate into consumer spending. In Latin America, Mexico, the best way I'd say, is relatively stable and continues to track closer to the United States because they're closely linked. Brazil continues to deteriorate faster than we expected. I would say that. Venezuela continues to increase as a concern given the growing difficulty on maintaining supply in the marketplace. And Argentina just continues to be challenging. And Colombia is, again, is kind of a star in Latin America in terms of performance and macro conditions. So in Europe, I think there are also some green shoots on the back of monetary easing, but it's early days. That just started. But deflation still remains a concern this year. And overall, consumer spending in Europe, I'd say, is still sluggish as it will take time for, I think, monetary easing to flow to the consumer pockets and translate into increased consumer spending. And then risk to recovery remain a still volatile environment. And then, of course, you got the possible Greece exit issues lingering on. In Eurasia and Africa, Russia continues to see significant challenges, the Russian consumer, and we expect it to continue to remain challenging throughout the year, this year. Sub-Saharan Africa is a strong bright spot, and we're seeing that in our results. And then Middle East, we've got some pockets where it's defying the geopolitical environment, but overall, obviously, increased geopolitical risks there. And then in Asia and Pacific, China continues -- the disposable incomes, consumer spending, CSE [ph] in China continues to decelerate. We saw that happening in Q1 versus the stated GDP of 7%. Japan remains sluggish, I'd say similar to Europe, although we are starting to see some green shoots in the economy. And finally, in Asia Pacific, India continues to be a bright spot, I'd say, inside the BRIC end markets, the 4 BRIC markets. So that's the sort of walk-through in terms of -- and then the commodity environment, again, talking about what we can control and what we can't, remains fairly benign compared to previous years, stable and benign. And so given that value growth for us is highly correlated to PCE growth, I hope I've been able to give you a sort of quick walk-through of what's good and what's not so good and what's more stable."

So guys, on North America, the price realization was solid, but it was actually a little lower than I, at least, had expected just based on market data. And I know you were lapping some fairly intense retailer promotions, so maybe that played a role. Maybe it was, again, negative mix from stills. I know you mentioned fountain dynamics, Sandy. But I was hoping you could just expand on the trends there and whether you think 2% is a representative number for the year at least in terms of kind what you're targeting at. And then on a related note, I was wondering if you'd also dimension for us the profit contribution to this price/mix you're getting because clearly, if it was all rates, pure rate, then it would sort of flow through 100% to profit, all else equal. But given that a lot of what we're seeing is category mix and the introduction of new package types, I'm wondering how to think about that profit contribution. Should we be assuming 50% as a rule of thumb roughly? Or are there reasons to be more optimistic or cautious related to extrapolating price/mix to profit flow-through?"

You saw in Nielsen very strong price growth. Some of that was driven by wholesale improvement that we were achieving with our customers. Some of it was lapping some really aggressive promotional activity that happened in the end of February and early March, and some of it was our customers making more money in the category. So the net effect of it was a really good start to the year in line with our plan. If you cross our business over into our chilled Minute Maid business, we saw price realization there. We launched some new items that drove some incremental revenue. And then as I mentioned, the fountain business was stronger than we expected at the beginning of the year, which creates a business mix drag overall. What I'd say from a profitability standpoint is that the combination of rate and mix was in line with our expectations. But I'd also point out that as we get into the second half of the year, you're going to see more difficult pricing comparisons. And we will continue our strategy of rigorous and disciplined and focused price-volume management, but we'll be lapping ourselves and will be continuing to do so but against a little bit tougher comparison. So net-net, off to the start we'd hoped to. Irial, any additional dimension?"

But I was wondering if you could comment, a, if there was any material benefit from sub-bottling payments in the quarter; and b, if OI margin trends would have been sort of -- would have mirrored PBT. And then assuming so, how much of that 180 basis points improvement was driven by some of the better pricing realization, the better productivity, commodities that can kind of continue as a run rate versus timing benefits in the quarter related to the Easter and the calendar shift? So if 180 is representative of sort of the underlying OI trends, and then what's the real run rate that we should be thinking about as sort of expected margin improvement on the year?"

We are -- we had higher comps in the back half of the year for pricing that we have to cycle. So as far as the refranchising is concerned, I wouldn't expect to see much benefit at this point from the sub-bottling payments. And as you know, if you look at it from an  [indiscernible] perspective, we have -- we structurally adjust those -- we pulled them out. We pull out the benefit so that we put it back on an apples-to-apples basis year-over-year. So there is not a big difference at operating versus PBT in our North American operations at this point. And so the margin expansion, that is basically because we've got really good pricing as we get rid of the pricing in the fourth quarter of last year. They're very focused on pricing. That will continue. But we are cycling higher prices in the back half of this year."

While many markets around the world faced macroeconomic challenges, our focus on improving our execution enabled us to deliver improved top results. Net revenues grew 4% on an organic basis driven by positive price/mix and 3% growth in concentrate shipments as outlined on our second quarter performance scorecard on Slide 4. 
Our top line performance was broad-based with each operating segment delivering positive organic revenue growth, demonstrating the strength of our global brand portfolio and the robust distribution capabilities of our bottling partners. As a result, we once again gained global value share in nonalcoholic register drink beverages in the quarter with gains in both sparkling and still beverages. 
This represents the 32nd quarter in a row where we've gained NARTD value share, an important metric for us, particularly in the top macroeconomic environment. Notably, the levels of our volume and value share gains are accelerating versus the second quarter of last year. Unit case volume grew 2% in the quarter cycling [ph] 3% in the prior-year. We've seen an improvement with all operating groups growing despite a shift in Easter holiday sales from the second quarter last year into the first quarter this year as well as challenges in key emerging markets, most notably Brazil, Russia and India. 
During the quarter, we continued our strong focus on controlling operating expenses even with a double-digit increase in our media spend, we were able to deliver a 50-basis-point improvement in our operating margin on a comparable currency-neutral basis and grow our comparable currency-neutral operating income and PBT by 6% and 3%, respectively in the quarter. 
Finally, we generated record cash from operations and grew free cash flow 16% on a year-to-date basis, due in part to the 6 extra days in the first quarter, but also due to effective working capital initiatives, something Kathy will talk about later in the call.
Last year, we took decisive action to reinvigorate our growth and increased profitability. Halfway through our transition year, we're pleased with the progress we are making, but recognize that we still have much to do. We're acting with speed, with urgency against each of our 5 strategic initiatives. 
First and foremost, our enhanced focus on revenue growth across markets is delivering value share gains ahead of volume share gains on a consolidated basis as well as in our International and North American business. Our North American business delivered a very strong quarter with 5% growth in organic revenues and 8% in comparable income before tax. This performance reflect increased marketing, a disciplined approach to managing volume price and mix as well as the shift of July 4 holiday sales and our Share a Coke campaign in the second quarter this year versus the third quarter last year. Importantly, North America -- in North America, we delivered revenue growth in our sparkling portfolio in the quarter through the further expansion of our pricing strategy resulting in 4% sparkling price/mix. 
Our disciplined price/back strategy has seen wide and option across all retail channels as we emphasized smaller, proprietary packages while also raising prices on traditional packages, including 12-ounce cans and 2-liter bottles. While sparkling unit case volume grew 1%, transactions increased 2% due to strong growth in the smaller packages, which are on trend with consumer preferences such as our mini cans, which grew volume double-digits during the quarter. 
The second action to remedy growth is to increase our media investments globally to fully fund our brands across our markets around the world while enhancing the quality of our advertising at the same time. In the markets where we are investing more with better quality, we are seeing better performance. Let me just give you an example of how marketing, along with solid execution by our bottling partners, is driving top line growth across our emerging, developing and developed markets. 
Starting with our emerging markets. Despite a soft macroeconomic environment in China, we grew brand Coca-Cola volume double-digits, a record 20 million consumers participated in China's Coca-Cola break consumer promotion, which along with the third edition of the Share a Coke campaign, fueled our growth. Turning to our developing markets. In Argentina, we gained both volume and value share and importantly, gained value share ahead of volume share for the second quarter in a row, due in part to integrated marketing campaigns around America, the main international football tournament for national teams in South America. Finally, both the quality -- quantity and quality of marketing in North America helped us realize 4 points of sparkling price/mix, resulting in solid revenue performance. 
The trends we're seeing in these markets as well as initial results in other markets, gives us continued confidence that our step-up investments are working. Further, we still have significant opportunity in many other markets where we began increasing media investment towards the end of 2014. Given the typical 12- to 24-month time periods for these investments to deliver their full return, it will be 2016 before we see real results in some of these other regions. 
Turning to productivity. We remain focused on fueling our reinvestments through embedding productivity into our DNA. We're on track across all spend areas to hit key milestones this year and deliver $3 billion in annualized savings by 2019. One area, which we are seeing momentum is supply chain related saving, which benefited our gross margin in the quarter. Year-to-date, we consolidated 3 distribution centers and closed 1 plant in North America as well as began the process of installing inline molding equipment. Further, we recently kicked off the next phase of our 0-based work, which consists of a launch in our international market and a second year of this work in Corporate as well as in North America. Zero-based work is a mechanism that helps our leaders make very tough choices to free up resources that can be redeployed and reinvested to fund growth. As we go through this process, we are working to ensure that the priorities we are funding to drive growth in our business unit are also seamlessly across our entire -- prioritized across our entire system. 
The implementation of our new operating model is on track, and we had made significant headway on the previously announced headcount reductions. This now includes Europe where we began implementing changes this quarter following the appropriate consultations. As we begin operating within our new structure, we are actively engaging and connecting our global organization and implementing our standard processes. 
Finally, focusing on our core business model, we continue to make progress in our North America refranchising efforts. During the quarter, we transitioned territories representing over 5% of the U.S. bottle/can volume. Additionally, we announced the signing of new letters of intent for territories covering close to another 10% of the U.S. bottle/can volume. In aggregate, territories transitioned to date, and those covered by definitive agreements or letters of intent, represent approximately 25% of the total U.S. bottle/can volume.
We're getting better. We're getting faster, which is why we are confident we're going to achieve our previously stated goal to have approximately 2/3 of U.S. bottle/can volume distributed by our independent bottlers by the end of 2017. Our bottling partners are critical to our success. We held our annual global system meeting in May this past year -- this year, and I can tell you that the level of engagement among our bottling partners was very high. They're encouraged by our plans and have committed to support our investment with further enhanced focus on local markets execution. 
To conclude, I would like to address the macroenvironment given the challenges many CPG companies are encountering today and the fact that approximately 75% of our operating income is generated overseas. The global economic recovery remains uneven given the continued slowdown of the Chinese economy, the prospective U.S. tightening cycle as the U.S. preparers to increase interest rates, and the ongoing uncertainties surrounding Greece and its place in the Eurozone. Additionally, many emerging markets, large or small, remain challenged as evidenced by our low single-digit volume declines in both Brazil and Russia this quarter.
While we have the right strategic plans in place to navigate through the volatile operating environment, we're not fully immune. With that said, as we pass the midpoint of 2015, we're broadly where we expect it to be. I remain encouraged by our progress to date, but also acknowledge that there is still much work ahead of us. We're confident in our strategies and execution, and remain on track to deliver against our full year comparable currency-neutral growth expectations.
I'll now hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our financial performance as well as update on our outlook for 2015."

Organic revenue growth was driven by 3% growth in concentrate shipment and 1 point positive price/mix. Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing and product mix initiatives across many of our markets, partially offset by negative geographic mix consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter. Concentrate shipment outpaced communications in the quarter, primarily due to the timing of shipments in our Asia Pacific group. After adjusting for the additional days in the first quarter, year-to-date concentrate shipment was generally in line with unit cases on a consolidated basis. Our comparable book margin declined on a consolidated basis as positive pricing, productivity savings and a slightly lower commodity costs were offset by currency headwinds and structural changes. Positive comparable currency-neutral operating leverage was driven primarily by the impact of structural items, which unfavorably impacted gross margins, but was roughly neutral at operating income and income before taxes. 
For the quarter, comparable currency-neutral operating income grew 6%, including a mid-single-digit increase in net G&A. Below the operating line, our comparable currency-neutral basis, net interest income, equity income and other income were, lower resulting in 3% growth in comparable currency-neutral income before tax. Consistent with the outlook we provided on the last call, on a comparable basis, other income benefited from foreign exchange gains associated with the euro-denominated debt issued during the first quarter.
Our second quarter comparable EPS was $0.63, which included a 6-point currency headwind. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, our EPS grew 4% in the quarter. Items impacting comparability in the quarter was primarily related to a net gain recognized in connection with the closing of the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation. During the first 6 months of the year, we generated $4 billion [ph] in free cash flow, up 16% primarily due to the efficient management of working capital and the impact of 6 additional days, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from currency exchange rates. We returned $3.8 billion to shareowners in the form of dividends and net share repurchases during the first 6 months. 
I'd like to take a moment to talk about working capital management, which we view as another key focus of productivity as it is incremental to our P&L targets and it adds significant value to our company and shareowners by targeting cash flow improvement. In 2013, we initiated a program to better manage our working capital with an initial focus on our trained receivables and payables. As a result of this program, we have improved our cash conversion cycle, which resulted in $400 million of incremental cash flow for the first 6 months of 2015 versus the prior year. 
Turning to outlook, halfway through our transition year, we are where we expected to be, recognizing that economic growth remains challenging in many markets, notably Brazil, Russia and China. For the full year 2015, our comparable currency-neutral outlook remains unchanged, although there are a few adjustments to specific items. Our outlook for net interest is slightly more favorable, offset by a slightly larger impact from structural items at the profit before tax line. We estimate an increase in the currency impact in the back half of the year based on the latest exchange rates and after considering our hedge position, current spot rates and the spiking of our prior year rates, we now expect an approximately 6-point currency headwind on net revenue, 11-point headwind on operating income and a 7- to 8-point headwind on income before tax for the full year 2015. And we expect net share repurchases for the year to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.
In addition, there are a couple of saving items you should consider when modeling the third quarter. Due to the timing of our fiscal quarter-end, the benefits associated with the July 4 holiday sale in the second quarter this year versus the third quarter last year. We expect structural items to be a slight headwind on net revenue and a 1- to 2-point headwind on income before tax. We currently estimate currency will be an approximate 7-point headwind on net revenues, 13-point headwind on operating income and a 10-point headwind on income before tax in the third quarter as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior year. The variance between the currency headwind on operating income and on income before taxes primarily due to the cycling losses in the prior year. 
Finally, while not a third quarter consideration, I wanted to remind you that in 2015, our fourth quarter will have 6 fewer selling days. In summary, we are seeing initial progress based on our plan to reinvigorate top line growth while recognizing that we continue to operate in a challenging macroenvironment. Therefore, while currency headwinds are increasing, we see no change to our full year comparable currency-neutral growth expectations.

I'll just say a few top line remarks about it, and then also ask both Sandy and Ahmet to give some more specific details on their -- in specific markets. I'd say overall, pleased with our initial results. But as we've previously discussed, and as I have just recently said, it takes some time anywhere from 12 to 18 months to realize the full value and in terms of a return on those investments, we found that disciplined quality marketing investments drive growth better than any other strategy or action. We're seeing good initial results in markets that have received the incremental media investments and also have improved the quality of marketing in our case and other marketing investments in North America is a great point, which is a clear contributing factor in the strong performance in the quarter, continued strong performance in North America and the performance is getting better with 5% growth in organic revenues and 4% price/mix. That price/mix and that volume and that -- therefore, growth in organic revenue would not have been achieved, clearly without the infusion of that marketing and the quality and the quantity. In China, also seeing positive trends. Strong marketing activation, as I mentioned in my remarks, sparkling growing at 7%, Diet Coke growing at double-digits in the quarter, allowing us to gain -- continued to gain significant share in that market. And additionally, we're seeing accelerating trend in our value share gains where you compare them against our trends a year ago. So with that said, clear that it will take some time for the full benefit on a quarterly basis as these investments take some time to ramp up, also challenges -- challenging consumer environments and macroenvironments. And so those are really what I would say, and in terms of our results, you'll see year-to-date, our marketing investments are growing and our margin is expanding by 50 basis points. So I think the key is to be able to achieve both, and we are confident that we can -- that we will continue to see more positive results. So with that, let me turn for some more specifics to Sandy and then to Ahmet for international example."

But underneath that, a metric that you can watch also is just the price elasticity of our brands and how volume reacts to price over time. And that's a good metric to pay off advertising along with the efforts of our bottlers in the marketplace. As we look ahead, we see advertising as an important proactive item to grow the business, but as you start to see in North America over the past few quarters, we're now leveraging the P&L, so that the infusion of advertising is coming from the accelerated top line growth and expense efficiency across the total business.

The working capital has allowed us to basically focus on share repurchases even with the significant currency headwinds, so the productivity initiative we are on track. We didn't get specific initiatives that we were working on for this year. You know about the people initiatives that we had and we said we were going to be on target for the $500 million for this year. They are still coming from the 3 areas, so we're still actively working on reducing our cost of goods sold and moving DME from promotional activities into media spend. So we are basically on track. I don't know -- I can't give you any other specifics other than we are basically on track for the $500 million that we anticipated, that we would have for this year."

But the impact on categories and particularly categories that are appealing to diet-oriented positioning has been pretty negative. Inside our particular portfolio, we have brands growing and have brands struggling, Coke Zero as Muhtar mentioned, grew in the quarter, Diet Coke continues to struggle. Our near-term improvements though, we're starting to see the consumer base stabilize. We have an incredible number of very loyal drinkers in Diet Coke, that love Diet Coke. And our milestone that we're seeking to achieve soon is to level our revenue, to match price and volume such the Diet Coke's revenue gets to flat and then starts to grow again. As we look ahead, what I would tell you about Diet Coke is that we believe strongly in the Diet Coke franchise. Diet Coke, the brand is the #1 diet beverage in the United States, and it will be for a very long time to come. We are also looking at changes in the category, our largest competitors is changing their formula and they'll be launching that in August, and that'll create a lot of buzz in the category. Some of it is good, as a good science of the safety of non-neutral sweeteners get out of the marketplace and is reinforced. We are looking at multiple programs to not only strengthen Diet Coke, but to offer consumers adjacent innovation in the Diet Coke franchise, and we're excited about the long-term future.

But the small packages, clearly are driving a tremendous amount of positive growth. Some of it is cannibalistic, but the cannibalistic nature of it accrues the higher margin. So the mix shift is positive and then you have the incremental transaction growth that's being driven there. And the primary reason is that the consumers want smaller packages, that's why they're buying more cokes. Our marketing model is about more people enjoying more cokes more often for a little bit more money, and that's what we seek to accomplish in the marketing and execution of our brand. And what you can see by the mid-teen growth of the smaller packages is that they're driving that transaction growth and transaction performance positive, so the net effect of it is that it's positive in net-net. The other comment I'd make is that we have data in some of our retail partnerships that shows that moms, in particular, like small packs and are returning to the category to use small packs as a way of giving treats to teenagers and others in the household, and it's a particularly positive thing because moms can do that with a pack that isn't too big, where as many years in the category, we marketed packages that were too big, that were either wasted or over consumed.

Value share, particularly which is very important and the value share is driven again by the actions that we're taking. So based on your question, have you seen the bottom? I'd say we're about where we expected to be and we see that what we're doing is continuing to help keep that equation in place at an improving trend.

While many markets around the world faced macroeconomic challenges, our focus on improving our execution enabled us to deliver improved top line results. Net revenues grew 4% on an organic basis, driven by positive price/mix and 3% growth in concentrate shipments, as outlined on our second quarter performance scorecard on Slide 4. 
Our top line performance was broad-based, with each operating segment delivering positive organic revenue growth, demonstrating the strength of our global brand portfolio and the robust distribution capabilities of our bottling partners. As a result, we once again gained global value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in the quarter, with gains in both sparkling and still beverages. This represents the 32nd quarter in a row that we've gained NARTD value share, an important metric for us, particularly in a tough macroeconomic environment. Notably, the levels of our volume and value share gains are accelerating versus the second quarter of last year. 
Unit case volume grew 2% in the quarter, cycling 3% in the prior year. We've seen an improvement, with all operating groups growing despite a shift in Easter holiday sales from the second quarter last year into the first quarter this year as well as challenges in key emerging markets, most notably Brazil, Russia and India. 
During the quarter, we continued our strong focus on controlling operating expenses. Even with a double-digit increase in our media spend, we were able to deliver a 50 basis point improvement in our operating margin on a comparable currency-neutral basis and grow our comparable currency-neutral operating income and PBT by 6% and 3%, respectively, in the quarter. 
Finally, we generated record cash from operations and grew free cash flow 16% on a year-to-date basis due in part to the 6 extra days in the first quarter but also due to effective working capital initiatives, something Kathy will talk about later in the call.
Last year, we took decisive action to reinvigorate our growth and increase profitability. Halfway through our transition year, we're pleased with the progress we are making but recognize that we still have much to do. We're acting with speed, with urgency against each of our 5 strategic initiatives. 
First and foremost, our enhanced focus on revenue growth across markets is delivering value share gains ahead of volume share gains on a consolidated basis as well as in our International and North America business. Our North America business delivered a very strong quarter with 5% growth in organic revenues and 8% in comparable income before tax. This performance reflects increased marketing; a disciplined approach to managing volume, price and mix; as well as the shift of July 4 holiday sales and our Share a Coke campaign into the second quarter this year versus the third quarter last year. Importantly, North America -- in North America, we delivered revenue growth in our sparkling portfolio in the quarter through the further expansion of our pricing strategy, resulting in 4% sparkling price/mix. 
Our disciplined price/pack strategy has seen wide adoption across all retail channels as we emphasized smaller, proprietary packages while also raising prices on traditional packages, including 12-ounce cans and 2-liter bottles. While sparkling unit case volume grew 1%, transactions increased 2% due to strong growth in the smaller packages, which are on trend with consumer preferences such as our mini cans, which grew volume double digits during the quarter. 
The second action to reinvigorate growth is to increase our media investments globally to fully fund our brands across our markets around the world while enhancing the quality of our advertising at the same time. In the markets where we are investing more with better quality, we're seeing better performance. Let me just give you an example of how marketing, along with solid execution by our bottling partners, is driving top line growth across our emerging, developing and developed markets. 
Starting with our emerging markets. Despite a soft macro environment in China, we grew brand Coca-Cola volume double digits. A record 20 million consumers participated in China's Coca-Cola break consumer promotion, which, along with the third edition of the Share a Coke campaign, fueled our growth. 
Turning to our developing market. In Argentina, we gained both volume and value share and importantly, gained value share ahead of volume share for the second quarter in a row due in part to integrated marketing campaigns around Copa America, the main international football tournament for national teams in South America. 
Finally, both the quality -- quantity and quality of marketing in North America helped us realize 4 points of sparkling price/mix, resulting in solid revenue performance. 
The trends we're seeing in these markets as well as initial results in other markets gives us continued confidence that our stepped-up investments are working. Further, we still have significant opportunity in many other markets where we began increasing media investment towards the end of 2014. Given the typical 12- to 24-month time periods for these investments to deliver their full return, it will be 2016 before we see real results in some of these other regions. 
Turning to productivity. We remain focused on fueling our reinvestments through embedding productivity into our DNA. We're on track across all spend areas to hit key milestones this year and deliver $3 billion in annualized savings by 2019. One area which we are seeing momentum is supply chain-related savings, which benefited our gross margin in the quarter. Year-to-date, we consolidated 3 distribution centers and closed 1 plant in North America as well as began the process of installing in-line blow molding equipment. Further, we recently kicked off the next phase of our zero-based work, which consists of a launch in our international market and a second year of this work in corporate as well as in North America. Zero-based work is a mechanism that helps our leaders make very tough choices to free up resources that can be redeployed and reinvested to fund growth. As we go through this process, we are working to ensure that the priorities we are funding to drive growth in our business unit are also seamlessly across our entire -- prioritized across our entire system.  
The implementation of our new operating model is on track, and we had made significant headway on the previously announced headcount reductions. This now includes Europe, where we began implementing changes this quarter following the appropriate consultations. As we begin operating within our new structure, we are actively engaging and connecting our global organization and implementing our standard processes. 
Finally, focusing on our core business model, we continue to make progress on our North America re-franchising efforts. During the quarter, we transitioned territories representing over 5% of the U.S. bottle/can volume. Additionally, we announced the signing of new letters of intent for territories covering close to another 10% of the U.S. bottle/can volume. In aggregate, territories transitioned to date and those covered by definitive agreements or letters of intent represent approximately 25% of the total U.S. bottle/can volume. We're getting better. We're getting faster, which is why we are confident we're going to achieve our previously stated goal to have approximately 2/3 of U.S. bottle/can volume distributed by our independent bottlers by the end of 2017. Our bottling partners are critical to our success. We held our annual global system meeting in May this past year -- this year, and I can tell you that the level of engagement among our bottling partners was very high. They're encouraged by our plans and have committed to support our investment with further enhanced focus on local market execution. 
To conclude, I would like to address the macro environment given the challenges many CPG companies are encountering today and the fact that approximately 75% of our operating income is generated overseas. The global economic recovery remains uneven given the continued slowdown of the Chinese economy, the prospective U.S. tightening cycle as the U.S. prepares to increase interest rate and the ongoing uncertainties surrounding Greece and its place in the Eurozone. Additionally, many emerging markets, large and small, remain challenged, as evidenced by our low single-digit volume declines in both Brazil and Russia this quarter.
While we have the right strategic plans in place to navigate through the volatile operating environment, we're not fully immune. With that said, as we pass the midpoint of 2015, we're broadly where we expected to be. I remain encouraged by our progress to date but also acknowledge that there is still much work ahead of us. We're confident in our strategies and execution and remain on track to deliver against our full year comparable currency-neutral growth expectations.
I'll now hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our financial performance as well as update on our outlook for 2015."
26642,304353758,835826,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2015",2015-07-22,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter came in broadly as we expected. Organic revenue growth was driven by 3% growth in concentrate shipment and 1 point of positive price/mix. Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by",837,"Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter came in broadly as we expected. Organic revenue growth was driven by 3% growth in concentrate shipment and 1 point of positive price/mix. Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing and product mix initiatives across many of our markets, partially offset by negative geographic mix, consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter. Concentrate shipment outpaced unit cases in the quarter primarily due to the timing of shipments in our Asia-Pacific group. After adjusting for the additional days in the first quarter, year-to-date concentrate shipment was generally in line with unit cases on a consolidated basis. Our comparable gross margin declined on a consolidated basis as positive pricing, productivity savings and a slightly lower commodity cost were offset by currency headwinds and structural changes. Positive comparable currency-neutral operating leverage was driven primarily by the impact of structural items which unfavorably impacted gross margins but was roughly neutral at operating income and income before taxes. 
For the quarter, comparable currency-neutral operating income grew 6%, including a mid-single-digit increase in DME. Below the operating line, on a comparable currency-neutral basis, net interest income, equity income and other income were lower, resulting in 3% growth in comparable currency-neutral income before tax. Consistent with the outlook we provided on the last call, on a comparable basis, other income benefited from foreign exchange gains associated with the euro-denominated debt issued during the first quarter.
Our second quarter comparable EPS was $0.63, which included a 6 point currency headwind. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, our EPS grew 4% in the quarter. Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to a net gain recognized in connection with the closing of the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation. During the first 6 months of the year, we generated $4 billion in free cash flow, up 16% primarily due to the efficient management of working capital and the impact of 6 additional days, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from currency exchange rates. We returned $3.8 billion to shareowners in the form of dividends and net share repurchases during the first 6 months. 
I'd like to take a moment to talk about working capital management, which we view as another key focus of productivity as it is incremental to our P&L targets and it adds significant value to the company and shareowners by targeting cash flow improvement. In 2013, we initiated a program to better manage our working capital with an initial focus on our trade receivables and payables. As a result of this program, we have improved our cash conversion cycle, which resulted in $400 million of incremental cash flow for the first 6 months of 2015 versus the prior year. 
Turning to outlook. Halfway through our transition year, we are where we expected to be, recognizing that economic growth remains challenging in many markets, notably Brazil, Russia and China. For the full year 2015, our comparable currency-neutral outlook remains unchanged, although there are a few adjustments to specific items. Our outlook for net interest is slightly more favorable, offset by a slightly larger impact from structural items at the profit before tax line. We estimate an increase in the currency impact in the back half of the year based on the latest exchange rates. And after considering our hedge position, current spot rate and the cycling of our prior year rates, we now expect an approximate 6 point currency headwind on net revenue, 11 point headwind on operating income and a 7 to 8 point headwind on income before tax for the full year 2015. And we expect net share repurchases for the year to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.
In addition, there are a couple of phasing items you should consider when modeling the third quarter. Due to the timing of our fiscal quarter-end, the benefit associated with the July 4 holiday fell in the second quarter this year versus the third quarter last year. We expect structural items to be a slight headwind on net revenue and a 1 to 2 point headwind on income before tax. We currently estimate currency will be an approximate 7 point headwind on net revenues, 13 point headwind on operating income and a 10 point headwind on income before tax in the third quarter as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior year. The variance between the currency headwind on operating income and on income before tax is primarily due to the cycling remeasurement losses in the prior year. 
Finally, while not a third quarter consideration, I wanted to remind you that in 2015, our fourth quarter will have 6 fewer selling days. 
In summary, we are seeing initial progress based on our plan to reinvigorate top line growth while recognizing that we continue to operate in a challenging macro environment. Therefore, while currency headwinds are increasing, we see no change to our full year comparable currency-neutral growth expectations.

I'll just say a few top line remarks about it and then also ask both Sandy and Ahmet to give some more specific details on their -- in specific markets. I'd say overall, pleased with our initial results. But as we've previously discussed and as I've just recently said, it takes some time anywhere from 12 to 18 months to realize the full value. And in terms of a return on those investments, we found that disciplined quality marketing investments drive growth better than any other strategy or action. We're seeing good initial results in markets that have received the incremental media investments and also have improved the quality of marketing in our case. And the marketing investments in North America is a great point, which is a clear contributing factor in the strong performance in the quarter, continued strong performance in North America. And the performance is getting better with 5% growth in organic revenues and 4% price/mix. That price/mix and that volume and that, therefore, growth in organic revenue would not have been achieved, clearly, without the infusion of that marketing and the quality and the quantity. In China, also seeing positive trends, strong marketing activation, as I mentioned in my remarks, sparkling growing at 7%, brand Coke growing at double digits in the quarter, allowing us to gain -- continue to gain significant share in that market. And additionally, we're seeing accelerating trends in our value share gains, where you compare them against our trends a year ago. So with that said, clear that it will take some time for the full benefit on a quarterly basis as these investments take some time to ramp up, also challenges -- challenging consumer environments and macro environments. And so those are, really, what I would say. And in terms of our results, you see year-to-date, our marketing investments are growing and our margin is expanding by 50 basis points. So I think the key is to be able to achieve both, and we are confident that we can -- that we will continue to see more positive results. So with that, let me turn now for some more specifics to Sandy and then to Ahmet for international example."

Inside our particular portfolio, we have brands growing and have brands struggling. Coke Zero, as Muhtar mentioned, grew in the quarter. Diet Coke continues to struggle. Our near-term improvements, though, we're starting to see the consumer base stabilize. We have an incredible number of very loyal drinkers in Diet Coke. They love Diet Coke. And our milestone that we're seeking to achieve soon is to level our revenue, to match price and volume such that Diet Coke's revenue gets to flat and then starts to grow again. As we look ahead, what I would tell you about Diet Coke is that we believe strongly in the Diet Coke franchise. Diet Coke, the brand, is the #1 diet beverage in the United States, and it will be for a long time to come. We also were looking at changes in the category. Our largest competitor is changing their formula, and they'll be launching that in August. And that'll create a lot of buzz in the category, some of it good as the good science of the safety of non-nutritive sweeteners gets out in the marketplace and is reinforced. We are looking at multiple programs to not only strengthen Diet Coke but to offer consumers adjacent innovation in the Diet Coke franchise, and we're excited about the long-term future.

This year, we see that balance beginning to come through, more favorable balance coming through. And then Sandy, if you want to talk about the smaller packages reference."

But the small packages, clearly, are driving a tremendous amount of positive growth. Some of it is cannibalistic, but the cannibalistic nature of it accrues to higher margin. So the mix shift is positive, and then you have the incremental transaction growth that's being driven there. And the primary reason is that the consumers want smaller packages. That's why they're buying more Cokes. Our marketing model is about more people enjoying more Cokes more often for a little bit more money, and that's what we seek to accomplish in the marketing and execution of our brand. And what you can see by the mid-teen growth of the smaller packages is they're driving that transaction growth and transaction performance positive, so the net effect of it is that it's positive in net-net. The other comment I'd make is that we have data in some of our retail partnerships that showed that moms, in particular, like small packs and are returning to the category to use small packs as a way of giving treats to teenagers and others in the household. And it's a particularly positive thing because moms can do that with a pack that isn't too big, whereas for many years in the category, we marketed packages that were too big that were either wasted or over consumed. Our package mix no longer does that, and it's one of the reasons why our growth is accelerating."

Value share, particularly, which is very important, and the value share is driven, again, by the actions that we're taking. So based on your question have you seen the bottom, I'd say we're about where we expected to be. And we see that what we're doing is continuing to help keep that equation in place at an improving trend, equation being if the marketing wasn't there, the volume wouldn't hold up where it was, and the price wouldn't hold up where it was.

While many markets around the world faced macroeconomic challenges, our focus on improving our execution enabled us to deliver improved top line results. Net revenues grew 4% on an organic basis, driven by positive price/mix and 3% growth in concentrate shipments, as outlined on our second quarter performance scorecard on Slide 4. 
Our top line performance was broad-based, with each operating segment delivering positive organic revenue growth, demonstrating the strength of our global brand portfolio and the robust distribution capabilities of our bottling partners. As a result, we once again gained global value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in the quarter, with gains in both sparkling and still beverages. This represents the 32nd quarter in a row that we've gained NARTD value share, an important metric for us, particularly in a tough macroeconomic environment. Notably, the levels of our volume and value share gains are accelerating versus the second quarter of last year. 
Unit case volume grew 2% in the quarter, cycling 3% in the prior year. We've seen an improvement, with all operating groups growing despite a shift in Easter holiday sales from the second quarter last year into the first quarter this year as well as challenges in key emerging markets, most notably Brazil, Russia and India. 
During the quarter, we continued our strong focus on controlling operating expenses. Even with a double-digit increase in our media spend, we were able to deliver a 50 basis point improvement in our operating margin on a comparable currency-neutral basis and grow our comparable currency-neutral operating income and PBT by 6% and 3%, respectively, in the quarter. 
Finally, we generated record cash from operations and grew free cash flow 16% on a year-to-date basis due in part to the 6 extra days in the first quarter but also due to effective working capital initiatives, something Kathy will talk about later in the call.
Last year, we took decisive action to reinvigorate our growth and increase profitability. Halfway through our transition year, we're pleased with the progress we are making but recognize that we still have much to do. We're acting with speed, with urgency against each of our 5 strategic initiatives. 
First and foremost, our enhanced focus on revenue growth across markets is delivering value share gains ahead of volume share gains on a consolidated basis as well as in our International and North America business. Our North America business delivered a very strong quarter with 5% growth in organic revenues and 8% in comparable income before tax. This performance reflects increased marketing; a disciplined approach to managing volume, price and mix; as well as the shift of July 4 holiday sales and our Share a Coke campaign into the second quarter this year versus the third quarter last year. Importantly, North America -- in North America, we delivered revenue growth in our sparkling portfolio in the quarter through the further expansion of our pricing strategy, resulting in 4% sparkling price/mix. 
Our disciplined price/pack strategy has seen wide adoption across all retail channels as we emphasized smaller, proprietary packages while also raising prices on traditional packages, including 12-ounce cans and 2-liter bottles. While sparkling unit case volume grew 1%, transactions increased 2% due to strong growth in the smaller packages, which are on trend with consumer preferences such as our mini cans, which grew volume double digits during the quarter. 
The second action to reinvigorate growth is to increase our media investments globally to fully fund our brands across our markets around the world while enhancing the quality of our advertising at the same time. In the markets where we are investing more with better quality, we're seeing better performance. Let me just give you an example of how marketing, along with solid execution by our bottling partners, is driving top line growth across our emerging, developing and developed markets. 
Starting with our emerging markets. Despite a soft macro environment in China, we grew brand Coca-Cola volume double digits. A record 20 million consumers participated in China's Coca-Cola break consumer promotion, which, along with the third edition of the Share a Coke campaign, fueled our growth. 
Turning to our developing market. In Argentina, we gained both volume and value share and importantly, gained value share ahead of volume share for the second quarter in a row due in part to integrated marketing campaigns around Copa America, the main international football tournament for national teams in South America. 
Finally, both the quality -- quantity and quality of marketing in North America helped us realize 4 points of sparkling price/mix, resulting in solid revenue performance. 
The trends we're seeing in these markets as well as initial results in other markets gives us continued confidence that our stepped-up investments are working. Further, we still have significant opportunity in many other markets where we began increasing media investment towards the end of 2014. Given the typical 12- to 24-month time periods for these investments to deliver their full return, it will be 2016 before we see real results in some of these other regions. 
Turning to productivity. We remain focused on fueling our reinvestments through embedding productivity into our DNA. We're on track across all spend areas to hit key milestones this year and deliver $3 billion in annualized savings by 2019. One area which we are seeing momentum is supply chain-related savings, which benefited our gross margin in the quarter. Year-to-date, we consolidated 3 distribution centers and closed 1 plant in North America as well as began the process of installing in-line blow molding equipment. Further, we recently kicked off the next phase of our zero-based work, which consists of a launch in our international market and a second year of this work in corporate as well as in North America. Zero-based work is a mechanism that helps our leaders make very tough choices to free up resources that can be redeployed and reinvested to fund growth. As we go through this process, we are working to ensure that the priorities we are funding to drive growth in our business unit are also seamlessly across our entire -- prioritized across our entire system.  
The implementation of our new operating model is on track, and we had made significant headway on the previously announced headcount reductions. This now includes Europe, where we began implementing changes this quarter following the appropriate consultations. As we begin operating within our new structure, we are actively engaging and connecting our global organization and implementing our standard processes. 
Finally, focusing on our core business model, we continue to make progress on our North America re-franchising efforts. During the quarter, we transitioned territories representing over 5% of the U.S. bottle/can volume. Additionally, we announced the signing of new letters of intent for territories covering close to another 10% of the U.S. bottle/can volume. In aggregate, territories transitioned to date and those covered by definitive agreements or letters of intent represent approximately 25% of the total U.S. bottle/can volume. We're getting better. We're getting faster, which is why we are confident we're going to achieve our previously stated goal to have approximately 2/3 of U.S. bottle/can volume distributed by our independent bottlers by the end of 2017. Our bottling partners are critical to our success. We held our annual global system meeting in May this past year -- this year, and I can tell you that the level of engagement among our bottling partners was very high. They're encouraged by our plans and have committed to support our investment with further enhanced focus on local market execution. 
To conclude, I would like to address the macro environment given the challenges many CPG companies are encountering today and the fact that approximately 75% of our operating income is generated overseas. The global economic recovery remains uneven given the continued slowdown of the Chinese economy, the prospective U.S. tightening cycle as the U.S. prepares to increase interest rate and the ongoing uncertainties surrounding Greece and its place in the Eurozone. Additionally, many emerging markets, large and small, remain challenged, as evidenced by our low single-digit volume declines in both Brazil and Russia this quarter.
While we have the right strategic plans in place to navigate through the volatile operating environment, we're not fully immune. With that said, as we pass the midpoint of 2015, we're broadly where we expected to be. I remain encouraged by our progress to date but also acknowledge that there is still much work ahead of us. We're confident in our strategies and execution and remain on track to deliver against our full year comparable currency-neutral growth expectations.
I'll now hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our financial performance as well as update on our outlook for 2015."

The second quarter came in broadly as we expected. Organic revenue growth was driven by 3% growth in concentrate shipment and 1 point of positive price/mix. Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by",836,"Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter came in broadly as we expected. Organic revenue growth was driven by 3% growth in concentrate shipment and 1 point of positive price/mix. Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing and product mix initiatives across many of our markets, partially offset by negative geographic mix, consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter. Concentrate shipment outpaced unit cases in the quarter primarily due to the timing of shipments in our Asia-Pacific group. After adjusting for the additional days in the first quarter, year-to-date concentrate shipment was generally in line with unit cases on a consolidated basis. Our comparable gross margin declined on a consolidated basis as positive pricing, productivity savings and a slightly lower commodity cost were offset by currency headwinds and structural changes. Positive comparable currency-neutral operating leverage was driven primarily by the impact of structural items which unfavorably impacted gross margins but was roughly neutral at operating income and income before taxes. 
For the quarter, comparable currency-neutral operating income grew 6%, including a mid-single-digit increase in DME. Below the operating line, on a comparable currency-neutral basis, net interest income, equity income and other income were lower, resulting in 3% growth in comparable currency-neutral income before tax. Consistent with the outlook we provided on the last call, on a comparable basis, other income benefited from foreign exchange gains associated with the euro-denominated debt issued during the first quarter.
Our second quarter comparable EPS was $0.63, which included a 6-point currency headwind. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, our EPS grew 4% in the quarter. Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to a net gain recognized in connection with the closing of the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation. During the first 6 months of the year, we generated $4 billion in free cash flow, up 16% primarily due to the efficient management of working capital and the impact of 6 additional days, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from currency exchange rates. We returned $3.8 billion to shareowners in the form of dividends and net share repurchases during the first 6 months. 
I'd like to take a moment to talk about working capital management, which we view as another key focus of productivity as it is incremental to our P&L targets and it adds significant value to the company and shareowners by targeting cash flow improvement. In 2013, we initiated a program to better manage our working capital with an initial focus on our trade receivables and payables. As a result of this program, we have improved our cash conversion cycle, which resulted in $400 million of incremental cash flow for the first 6 months of 2015 versus the prior year. 
Turning to outlook. Halfway through our transition year, we are where we expected to be, recognizing that economic growth remains challenging in many markets, notably Brazil, Russia and China. For the full year 2015, our comparable currency-neutral outlook remains unchanged, although there are a few adjustments to specific items. Our outlook for net interest is slightly more favorable, offset by a slightly larger impact from structural items at the profit before tax line. We estimate an increase in the currency impact in the back half of the year based on the latest exchange rates. And after considering our hedge position, current spot rate and the cycling of our prior year rates, we now expect an approximate 6 point currency headwind on net revenue, 11 point headwind on operating income and a 7 to 8 point headwind on income before tax for the full year 2015. And we expect net share repurchases for the year to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.
In addition, there are a couple of phasing items you should consider when modeling the third quarter. Due to the timing of our fiscal quarter-end, the benefit associated with the July 4 holiday fell in the second quarter this year versus the third quarter last year. We expect structural items to be a slight headwind on net revenue and a 1 to 2 point headwind on income before tax. We currently estimate currency will be an approximate 7 point headwind on net revenues, 13 point headwind on operating income and a 10 point headwind on income before tax in the third quarter as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior year. The variance between the currency headwind on operating income and on income before tax is primarily due to the cycling remeasurement losses in the prior year. 
Finally, while not a third quarter consideration, I wanted to remind you that in 2015, our fourth quarter will have 6 fewer selling days. 
In summary, we are seeing initial progress based on our plan to reinvigorate top line growth while recognizing that we continue to operate in a challenging macro environment. Therefore, while currency headwinds are increasing, we see no change to our full year comparable currency-neutral growth expectations.

I'll just say a few top line remarks about it and then also ask both Sandy and Ahmet to give some more specific details on their -- in specific markets. I'd say overall, pleased with our initial results. But as we've previously discussed and as I've just recently said, it takes some time anywhere from 12 to 18 months to realize the full value. And in terms of a return on those investments, we found that disciplined quality marketing investments drive growth better than any other strategy or action. We're seeing good initial results in markets that have received the incremental media investments and also have improved the quality of marketing in our case. And the marketing investments in North America is a great point, which is a clear contributing factor in the strong performance in the quarter, continued strong performance in North America. And the performance is getting better with 5% growth in organic revenues and 4% price/mix. That price/mix and that volume and that, therefore, growth in organic revenue would not have been achieved, clearly, without the infusion of that marketing and the quality and the quantity. In China, also seeing positive trends, strong marketing activation, as I mentioned in my remarks, sparkling growing at 7%, brand Coke growing at double digits in the quarter, allowing us to gain -- continue to gain significant share in that market. And additionally, we're seeing accelerating trends in our value share gains, where you compare them against our trends a year ago. So with that said, clear that it will take some time for the full benefit on a quarterly basis as these investments take some time to ramp up, also challenges -- challenging consumer environments and macro environments. And so those are, really, what I would say. And in terms of our results, you see year-to-date, our marketing investments are growing and our margin is expanding by 50 basis points. So I think the key is to be able to achieve both, and we are confident that we can -- that we will continue to see more positive results. So with that, let me turn now for some more specifics to Sandy and then to Ahmet for international example."

But underneath that, a metric that you can watch also is just the price elasticity of our brands and how volume reacts to price over time. And it's a good metric of the payoff of advertising along with the efforts of our bottlers in the marketplace. As we look ahead, we see advertising as an important proactive item to grow the business, but as you start to see in North America over the past few quarters, we're now leveraging the P&L so that the infusion of advertising is coming from the accelerated top line growth and expense efficiency across the total business. So net-net, it's part of our ongoing algorithm and an important part of the way we intend to drive growth going forward. Ahmet?"

Inside our particular portfolio, we have brands growing and have brands struggling. Coke Zero, as Muhtar mentioned, grew in the quarter. Diet Coke continues to struggle. Our near-term improvements, though, we're starting to see the consumer base stabilize. We have an incredible number of very loyal drinkers in Diet Coke. They love Diet Coke. And our milestone that we're seeking to achieve soon is to level our revenue, to match price and volume such that Diet Coke's revenue gets to flat and then starts to grow again. As we look ahead, what I would tell you about Diet Coke is that we believe strongly in the Diet Coke franchise. Diet Coke, the brand, is the #1 diet beverage in the United States, and it will be for a long time to come. We also were looking at changes in the category. Our largest competitor is changing their formula, and they'll be launching that in August. And that'll create a lot of buzz in the category, some of it good as the good science of the safety of non-nutritive sweeteners gets out in the marketplace and is reinforced. We are looking at multiple programs to not only strengthen Diet Coke but to offer consumers adjacent innovation in the Diet Coke franchise, and we're excited about the long-term future.

But the small packages, clearly, are driving a tremendous amount of positive growth. Some of it is cannibalistic, but the cannibalistic nature of it accrues to higher margin. So the mix shift is positive, and then you have the incremental transaction growth that's being driven there. And the primary reason is that the consumers want smaller packages. That's why they're buying more Cokes. Our marketing model is about more people enjoying more Cokes more often for a little bit more money, and that's what we seek to accomplish in the marketing and execution of our brand. And what you can see by the mid-teen growth of the smaller packages is they're driving that transaction growth and transaction performance positive, so the net effect of it is that it's positive in net-net. The other comment I'd make is that we have data in some of our retail partnerships that showed that moms, in particular, like small packs and are returning to the category to use small packs as a way of giving treats to teenagers and others in the household. And it's a particularly positive thing because moms can do that with a pack that isn't too big, whereas for many years in the category, we marketed packages that were too big that were either wasted or over consumed. Our package mix no longer does that, and it's one of the reasons why our growth is accelerating."

Value share, particularly, which is very important, and the value share is driven, again, by the actions that we're taking. So based on your question have you seen the bottom, I'd say we're about where we expected to be.

While many markets around the world faced macroeconomic challenges, our focus on improving our execution enabled us to deliver improved top line results. Net revenues grew 4% on an organic basis, driven by positive price/mix and 3% growth in concentrate shipments, as outlined on our second quarter performance scorecard on Slide 4. 
Our top line performance was broad-based, with each operating segment delivering positive organic revenue growth, demonstrating the strength of our global brand portfolio and the robust distribution capabilities of our bottling partners. As a result, we once again gained global value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in the quarter, with gains in both sparkling and still beverages. This represents the 32nd quarter in a row that we've gained NARTD value share, an important metric for us, particularly in a tough macroeconomic environment. Notably, the levels of our volume and value share gains are accelerating versus the second quarter of last year. 
Unit case volume grew 2% in the quarter, cycling 3% in the prior year. We've seen an improvement, with all operating groups growing despite a shift in Easter holiday sales from the second quarter last year into the first quarter this year as well as challenges in key emerging markets, most notably Brazil, Russia and India. 
During the quarter, we continued our strong focus on controlling operating expenses. Even with a double-digit increase in our media spend, we were able to deliver a 50 basis point improvement in our operating margin on a comparable currency-neutral basis and grow our comparable currency-neutral operating income and PBT by 6% and 3%, respectively, in the quarter. 
Finally, we generated record cash from operations and grew free cash flow 16% on a year-to-date basis due in part to the 6 extra days in the first quarter but also due to effective working capital initiatives, something Kathy will talk about later in the call.
Last year, we took decisive action to reinvigorate our growth and increase profitability. Halfway through our transition year, we're pleased with the progress we are making but recognize that we still have much to do. We're acting with speed, with urgency against each of our 5 strategic initiatives. 
First and foremost, our enhanced focus on revenue growth across markets is delivering value share gains ahead of volume share gains on a consolidated basis as well as in our International and North America business. Our North America business delivered a very strong quarter with 5% growth in organic revenues and 8% in comparable income before tax. This performance reflects increased marketing; a disciplined approach to managing volume, price and mix; as well as the shift of July 4 holiday sales and our Share a Coke campaign into the second quarter this year versus the third quarter last year. Importantly, North America -- in North America, we delivered revenue growth in our sparkling portfolio in the quarter through the further expansion of our pricing strategy, resulting in 4% sparkling price/mix. 
Our disciplined price/pack strategy has seen wide adoption across all retail channels as we emphasized smaller, proprietary packages while also raising prices on traditional packages, including 12-ounce cans and 2-liter bottles. While sparkling unit case volume grew 1%, transactions increased 2% due to strong growth in the smaller packages, which are on trend with consumer preferences such as our mini cans, which grew volume double digits during the quarter. 
The second action to reinvigorate growth is to increase our media investments globally to fully fund our brands across our markets around the world while enhancing the quality of our advertising at the same time. In the markets where we are investing more with better quality, we're seeing better performance. Let me just give you an example of how marketing, along with solid execution by our bottling partners, is driving top line growth across our emerging, developing and developed markets. 
Starting with our emerging markets. Despite a soft macro environment in China, we grew brand Coca-Cola volume double digits. A record 20 million consumers participated in China's Coca-Cola break consumer promotion, which, along with the third edition of the Share a Coke campaign, fueled our growth. 
Turning to our developing market. In Argentina, we gained both volume and value share and importantly, gained value share ahead of volume share for the second quarter in a row due in part to integrated marketing campaigns around Copa America, the main international football tournament for national teams in South America. 
Finally, both the quality -- quantity and quality of marketing in North America helped us realize 4 points of sparkling price/mix, resulting in solid revenue performance. 
The trends we're seeing in these markets as well as initial results in other markets gives us continued confidence that our stepped-up investments are working. Further, we still have significant opportunity in many other markets where we began increasing media investment towards the end of 2014. Given the typical 12- to 24-month time periods for these investments to deliver their full return, it will be 2016 before we see real results in some of these other regions. 
Turning to productivity. We remain focused on fueling our reinvestments through embedding productivity into our DNA. We're on track across all spend areas to hit key milestones this year and deliver $3 billion in annualized savings by 2019. One area which we are seeing momentum is supply chain-related savings, which benefited our gross margin in the quarter. Year-to-date, we consolidated 3 distribution centers and closed 1 plant in North America as well as began the process of installing in-line blow molding equipment. Further, we recently kicked off the next phase of our zero-based work, which consists of a launch in our international market and a second year of this work in corporate as well as in North America. Zero-based work is a mechanism that helps our leaders make very tough choices to free up resources that can be redeployed and reinvested to fund growth. As we go through this process, we are working to ensure that the priorities we are funding to drive growth in our business unit are also seamlessly across our entire -- prioritized across our entire system. 
The implementation of our new operating model is on track, and we had made significant headway on the previously announced headcount reductions. This now includes Europe, where we began implementing changes this quarter following the appropriate consultations. As we begin operating within our new structure, we are actively engaging and connecting our global organization and implementing our standard processes. 
Finally, focusing on our core business model, we continue to make progress on our North America re-franchising efforts. During the quarter, we transitioned territories representing over 5% of the U.S. bottle/can volume. Additionally, we announced the signing of new letters of intent for territories covering close to another 10% of the U.S. bottle/can volume. In aggregate, territories transitioned to date and those covered by definitive agreements or letters of intent represent approximately 25% of the total U.S. bottle/can volume. We're getting better. We're getting faster, which is why we are confident we're going to achieve our previously stated goal to have approximately 2/3 of U.S. bottle/can volume distributed by our independent bottlers by the end of 2017. Our bottling partners are critical to our success. We held our annual global system meeting in May this past year -- this year, and I can tell you that the level of engagement among our bottling partners was very high. They're encouraged by our plans and have committed to support our investment with further enhanced focus on local market execution. 
To conclude, I would like to address the macro environment given the challenges many CPG companies are encountering today and the fact that approximately 75% of our operating income is generated overseas. The global economic recovery remains uneven given the continued slowdown of the Chinese economy, the prospective U.S. tightening cycle as the U.S. prepares to increase interest rate and the ongoing uncertainties surrounding Greece and its place in the Eurozone. Additionally, many emerging markets, large and small, remain challenged, as evidenced by our low single-digit volume declines in both Brazil and Russia this quarter.
While we have the right strategic plans in place to navigate through the volatile operating environment, we're not fully immune. With that said, as we pass the midpoint of 2015, we're broadly where we expected to be. I remain encouraged by our progress to date but also acknowledge that there is still much work ahead of us. We're confident in our strategies and execution and remain on track to deliver against our full year comparable currency-neutral growth expectations.
I'll now hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our financial performance as well as update on our outlook for 2015."

Organic revenue growth was driven by 3% growth in concentrate shipment and 1 point of positive price/mix. Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing and product mix initiatives across many of our markets, partially offset by negative geographic mix, consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter. Concentrate shipment outpaced unit cases in the quarter primarily due to the timing of shipments in our Asia-Pacific group. After adjusting for the additional days in the first quarter, year-to-date concentrate shipment was generally in line with unit cases on a consolidated basis. Our comparable gross margin declined on a consolidated basis as positive pricing, productivity savings and a slightly lower commodity cost were offset by currency headwinds and structural changes. Positive comparable currency-neutral operating leverage was driven primarily by the impact of structural items which unfavorably impacted gross margins but was roughly neutral at operating income and income before taxes. 
For the quarter, comparable currency-neutral operating income grew 6%, including a mid-single-digit increase in DME. Below the operating line, on a comparable currency-neutral basis, net interest income, equity income and other income were lower, resulting in 3% growth in comparable currency-neutral income before tax. Consistent with the outlook we provided on the last call, on a comparable basis, other income benefited from foreign exchange gains associated with the euro-denominated debt issued during the first quarter.
Our second quarter comparable EPS was $0.63, which included a 6-point currency headwind. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, our EPS grew 4% in the quarter. Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to a net gain recognized in connection with the closing of the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation. During the first 6 months of the year, we generated $4 billion in free cash flow, up 16% primarily due to the efficient management of working capital and the impact of 6 additional days, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from currency exchange rates. We returned $3.8 billion to shareowners in the form of dividends and net share repurchases during the first 6 months. 
I'd like to take a moment to talk about working capital management, which we view as another key focus of productivity as it is incremental to our P&L targets and it adds significant value to the company and shareowners by targeting cash flow improvement. In 2013, we initiated a program to better manage our working capital with an initial focus on our trade receivables and payables. As a result of this program, we have improved our cash conversion cycle, which resulted in $400 million of incremental cash flow for the first 6 months of 2015 versus the prior year. 
Turning to outlook. Halfway through our transition year, we are where we expected to be, recognizing that economic growth remains challenging in many markets, notably Brazil, Russia and China. For the full year 2015, our comparable currency-neutral outlook remains unchanged, although there are a few adjustments to specific items. Our outlook for net interest is slightly more favorable, offset by a slightly larger impact from structural items at the profit before tax line. We estimate an increase in the currency impact in the back half of the year based on the latest exchange rates. And after considering our hedge position, current spot rate and the cycling of our prior year rates, we now expect an approximate 6 point currency headwind on net revenue, 11 point headwind on operating income and a 7 to 8 point headwind on income before tax for the full year 2015. And we expect net share repurchases for the year to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.
In addition, there are a couple of phasing items you should consider when modeling the third quarter. Due to the timing of our fiscal quarter-end, the benefit associated with the July 4 holiday fell in the second quarter this year versus the third quarter last year. We expect structural items to be a slight headwind on net revenue and a 1 to 2 point headwind on income before tax. We currently estimate currency will be an approximate 7 point headwind on net revenues, 13 point headwind on operating income and a 10 point headwind on income before tax in the third quarter as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior year. The variance between the currency headwind on operating income and on income before tax is primarily due to the cycling remeasurement losses in the prior year. 
Finally, while not a third quarter consideration, I wanted to remind you that in 2015, our fourth quarter will have 6 fewer selling days. 
In summary, we are seeing initial progress based on our plan to reinvigorate top line growth while recognizing that we continue to operate in a challenging macro environment. Therefore, while currency headwinds are increasing, we see no change to our full year comparable currency-neutral growth expectations.
Operator, we are now ready for questions."

I'd say overall, pleased with our initial results. But as we've previously discussed and as I've just recently said, it takes some time anywhere from 12 to 18 months to realize the full value. And in terms of a return on those investments, we found that disciplined quality marketing investments drive growth better than any other strategy or action. We're seeing good initial results in markets that have received the incremental media investments and also have improved the quality of marketing in our case. And the marketing investments in North America is a great point, which is a clear contributing factor in the strong performance in the quarter, continued strong performance in North America. And the performance is getting better with 5% growth in organic revenues and 4% price/mix. That price/mix and that volume and that, therefore, growth in organic revenue would not have been achieved, clearly, without the infusion of that marketing and the quality and the quantity. In China, also seeing positive trends, strong marketing activation, as I mentioned in my remarks, sparkling growing at 7%, brand Coke growing at double digits in the quarter, allowing us to gain -- continue to gain significant share in that market. And additionally, we're seeing accelerating trends in our value share gains, where you compare them against our trends a year ago. So with that said, clear that it will take some time for the full benefit on a quarterly basis as these investments take some time to ramp up, also challenges -- challenging consumer environments and macro environments. And so those are, really, what I would say. And in terms of our results, you see year-to-date, our marketing investments are growing and our margin is expanding by 50 basis points. So I think the key is to be able to achieve both, and we are confident that we can -- that we will continue to see more positive results. So with that, let me turn now for some more specifics to Sandy and then to Ahmet for international example."

And it's a good metric of the payoff of advertising along with the efforts of our bottlers in the marketplace. As we look ahead, we see advertising as an important proactive item to grow the business, but as you start to see in North America over the past few quarters, we're now leveraging the P&L so that the infusion of advertising is coming from the accelerated top line growth and expense efficiency across the total business.

It's getting into years now. As the consumer -- the U.S. consumer moves really strongly to fresh, it's a good dietary change, actually, for the country. But the impact on categories and particularly, categories that are appealing to diet-oriented positionings has been pretty negative. Inside our particular portfolio, we have brands growing and have brands struggling. Coke Zero, as Muhtar mentioned, grew in the quarter. Diet Coke continues to struggle. Our near-term improvements, though, we're starting to see the consumer base stabilize. We have an incredible number of very loyal drinkers in Diet Coke. They love Diet Coke. And our milestone that we're seeking to achieve soon is to level our revenue, to match price and volume such that Diet Coke's revenue gets to flat and then starts to grow again. As we look ahead, what I would tell you about Diet Coke is that we believe strongly in the Diet Coke franchise. Diet Coke, the brand, is the #1 diet beverage in the United States, and it will be for a long time to come. We also were looking at changes in the category. Our largest competitor is changing their formula, and they'll be launching that in August. And that'll create a lot of buzz in the category, some of it good as the good science of the safety of non-nutritive sweeteners gets out in the marketplace and is reinforced. We are looking at multiple programs to not only strengthen Diet Coke but to offer consumers adjacent innovation in the Diet Coke franchise, and we're excited about the long-term future. But as we say around here, it's work in progress and a lot more work to do, but we still are very optimistic about the long term."

And could you -- is there any way you could outline for us if geographic mix also had a negative effect on profit margins or profitability? I know there's a lot of moving parts in the P&L, but when you kind of look at it currency-neutral, you saw some margin expansion. My thought is you actually had -- within that margin expansion, you actually had some negative geographic mix on margins, so any help on that would be helpful. And then I guess related to that, as we're modeling out the balance of this year, and I guess it goes back to Mark Swartzberg's question about the Pacific region, should we continue to expect to model in negative price -- geographic price/mix into our model for Pacific at the back half of the year?"

Whether you take Indonesia or whether you take Southeast Asia, whether you take China, sparkling is getting stronger, and momentum on sparkling is getting better.

So I think there's a balance there, and I think we're happy to see that balance coming through. I just want to mention that. That's important. This year, we see that balance beginning to come through, more favorable balance coming through. And then Sandy, if you want to talk about the smaller packages reference."

But the small packages, clearly, are driving a tremendous amount of positive growth. Some of it is cannibalistic, but the cannibalistic nature of it accrues to higher margin. So the mix shift is positive, and then you have the incremental transaction growth that's being driven there. And the primary reason is that the consumers want smaller packages. That's why they're buying more Cokes. Our marketing model is about more people enjoying more Cokes more often for a little bit more money, and that's what we seek to accomplish in the marketing and execution of our brand. And what you can see by the mid-teen growth of the smaller packages is they're driving that transaction growth and transaction performance positive, so the net effect of it is that it's positive in net-net. The other comment I'd make is that we have data in some of our retail partnerships that showed that moms, in particular, like small packs and are returning to the category to use small packs as a way of giving treats to teenagers and others in the household. And it's a particularly positive thing because moms can do that with a pack that isn't too big, whereas for many years in the category, we marketed packages that were too big that were either wasted or over consumed. Our package mix no longer does that, and it's one of the reasons why our growth is accelerating."

China disposable income levels haven't improved significantly. But importantly, improving trends on share, we're at all-time high in many markets. Value share, particularly, which is very important, and the value share is driven, again, by the actions that we're taking. So based on your question have you seen the bottom, I'd say we're about where we expected to be. And we see that what we're doing is continuing to help keep that equation in place at an improving trend, equation being if the marketing wasn't there, the volume wouldn't hold up where it was, and the price wouldn't hold up where it was. See it in that respect, both being propped up by the investments that we're putting into the marketplace and those investments being driven by the zero-based work that we're generating."

Since then, our company has undergone substantial change while navigating a slowing global macro economic environment.
Before handing the call over to James Quincey, our recently announced President and Chief Operating Officer, to review our third quarter performance results, let me recap the decisive actions we have taken over the past year as well as highlight why we believe The Coca-Cola Company is well positioned to continue winning in the vibrant nonalcoholic beverage industry.
First, we said we would drive revenue and profit growth with clear portfolio rolls across our markets. We have and will continue to do so. We segmented our market to develop long-term revenue growth strategies based on clear volume price investment and profit expectations, which were built into our 2015 plans and strategies going forward. Importantly, we revised our annual incentive metrics to include revenue growth and tie them directly to these clear portfolio roles in order to drive the right behavior in each market.
Second, we said we would target disciplined brand and growth investments. Last year, we significantly increased our media investments, and we're doing so again this year. Also under the leadership of Marcus who was named Chief Marketing Officer at the beginning of this year, we've improved the quality of our advertising while rewiring our marketing organization around consumer clusters to drive speed, efficiency and effectiveness, and we are seeing results with year-to-date value share performance accelerating across several markets. 
In addition, the incremental marketing is helping to accelerate revenue growth in some of our markets -- key markets, including North America. We also made investments in new growth platforms. We've closed the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation to compete more effectively in the global energy category. And just recently, our brand's launch on the code system had home dispense in the home dispensing platform.
In China, we have announced plans to expand into plant-based protein drinks through the acquisition of the beverage business of China Green Beverages Holding that recently received regulatory approval. In the United States, we invested in and signed a distribution agreement with a high-growth organic cold-pressured juice company -- cold-pressed juice company. All these are long-term investments that we believe will allow us to add profitable new transactions in the nonalcoholic beverage company.
Third, we said we would drive efficiency through more aggressive productivity. Our current $3 billion productivity program touches every part of our business and organization from our operating model to cost-of-goods sold to marketing expenses. We're driving these savings through a disciplined process that involve our entire leadership team and associates. And ultimately, it's about building a culture that is focused on getting better every single day and challenging every dollar we spend. We're on track against our overall goals and importantly, have implemented a broad set of changes in 2015 that will help us continue progress into 2016 and beyond. These include the implementation of zero-based work across our entire company as well as our corporate center and operating units, as disciplined program management approach to drive cost of goods sold savings in everything from our formulas to our packaging to our day-to-day operations in our plans.
Fourth, we said we would streamline and simplify our organization. To date, we standardized key processes, linked our business units with our corporate center and eliminated group functional roles in order to speed up decision-making and enhance focus at the local level to drive growth.
Our previously announced headcount reductions are substantially completed, and we are operating within our new structure. Importantly, we are ahead in terms of scope and timing.
Finally, we said we would refocus on our core business model of building the world's greatest beverage brands and leading an unmatched global system. And over the past year, we made substantial progress in evolving and strengthening our bottling landscape. Starting in North America, so far, we have transferred or signed agreements for territories covering over 30% of U.S. bottle/can volume. And just recently, we announced the creation of the National Product Supply System in order to align on a clear path forward for our 21st century manufacturing footprint in the United States.
In Europe, we announced the creation of Coca-Cola European partners, which will transform the Western European bottling landscape. 
And looking outside the developed world, we've made critical changes to our bottling system in key emerging markets. At the end of last year, we entered into an agreement to rearchitect our African bottling system with the creation of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which will have the scale, resources and efficiencies to fund the investment required to capture the strong long-term growth potential in Africa. 
Also during the first quarter of this year, we invested in our Indonesian bottler to help our system capture the long-term opportunity in this attractive and large emerging market.
In short, our company has undergone a significant amount of streamlining and change these past 12 months. And while we are encouraged by our progress, we know we need to do more, which leads me to our most recent change. As we continue to increase our focus on improving global execution, we recently appointed James Quincey to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer. James has a deep knowledge of the global system and solid existing relationships with both bottlers and customers all around the world. He's uniquely qualified to accelerate the company's 5 strategic initiatives for growth in the months and years ahead.
I will now hand the call over to James, who will walk you through our quarterly performance."

In my 19 years with the company, I've seen our business evolve and grow while remaining strategically focused on did doing the right things to drive long-term sustainable growth.
As Muhtar referenced, we are resolutely focused on executing against the 5 strategic initiatives laid out last year. A significant part of my role will be ensuring that we deliver. 
Now during the quarter, we made 2 important announcements that provide clarity on the future of our distribution and bottling structures in the United States and in Europe.
First, in our flagship market, we announced the creation of the National Product Supply System or NPSS to strengthen and streamline U.S. production as part of our effort to refranchise bottling territories in North America. Our approach embodies the best of both worlds by encompassing a national production system that generates efficiencies and scale for our system in combination with regional production that leverages the expertise and local knowledge of our long-standing bottling partners, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Coca-Cola United as well as Coca-Cola USA. These bottlers will continue to own, operate their own plants and where applicable, acquire additional production assets from the company owned Coca-Cola Refreshments. This will provide a clear profit incentive to make the local operations as efficient as possible.
However, to ensure the benefits of scale remain, the NPSS will have a governing board with the power to implement measures to ensure the production assets owned by NPSS bottlers are ultimately deployed to produce the lowest cost benefiting the entire system. This board will focus on making decisions on infrastructure planning, innovation planning and optimal sourcing at the national level. The board will be comprised of representatives from Coca-Cola North America, Coca-Cola Refreshments and the 3 independent bottlers, which together, currently represent approximately 95% of the U.S. produced volume.
We believe this structure allows us to leverage our significant system scale with a unique competitive advantage of being able to act locally with speed. Together with our focus on driving revenue, this will result in system margin expansion over the coming years.
So in addition to systemwide benefits, this approach has the additional benefit for The Coca-Cola Company and that it accelerates our return to an asset-like model, which will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending and invested capital and improved return on invested capital for our company as we transition these production assets.
We also continued to make progress on the refranchising of the U.S. distribution territories. Just this morning, we announced that we signed nonbinding letters of intent on additional distribution territories in 7 states. As Muhtar referenced, this will bring the total amount of volume in territories transitioned to date, all covered by agreements, to over 30% of U.S. bottle/can volume.
Also during the quarter, we announced the merger of our company-owned German bottling operations with Coca-Cola Iberian partners and Coca-Cola Enterprises into a new company named Coca-Cola Company European Partners. This will transform our Western European bottling landscape and create the world's largest independent Coca-Cola bottler based on revenue. The creation of a larger unified bottling partner in Western Europe represents an important step in our global system's evolution, as we continue to adapt our business model to innovate, invest and grow along with the changing demands of the marketplace. This merger enhances alignment within the Coca-Cola system, enabling us to more effectively compete and drive growth across developed European markets. Importantly, the new company will position to deliver world-class execution and customer service by leveraging the best practices of each party to drive sustainable growth in multiple categories.
Now turning to the performance in this quarter. While the global economic environment remains challenging, as the slowdown in the Chinese economy and the lower oil prices are putting pressure on many commodity-dependent economies such as Australia, Brazil and Russia, while volatility rootling through the Middle East causes further economic uncertainty.
Despite these macroeconomic challenges, our 5-point plan and our focus on execution and reinvestment drove improved results, with both unit case volume and price/mix growing 3% each in the quarter, as outlined in our quarterly performance scorecard on Slide 11.
Organic revenues grew 3%, driven by the previously mentioned strong price/mix and slight growth in concentrate shipments. Our top line performance was broad-based with 5 of the 6 operating segments delivering organic revenue growth. North America continued its disciplined approach to volume, price and mix management, and I'm encouraged by the solid progress we've seen in this market over the past 2 years.
In Europe, we drove top line growth through strong commercial and marketing activities whilst also benefiting from some good weather in much of the region. We are seeing green shoots in Europe and our business in central and southern Europe delivered a particularly strong quarter due to investments in media, changes in our price/pack architecture and favorable weather.
For Latin America, we delivered double-digit organic revenue growth despite worsening conditions in Brazil. Our Mexico business unit helped to balance the weakness in Brazil by accelerating unit case volume growth to 4% in the quarter with growth across all the major categories.
In Eurasia and Africa, deteriorating conditions in Russia and volatility in the Middle East partially offset the solid performance in the Africa businesses.
Turning finally to the Asia-Pacific group. China and India both grew unit case volume mid-single digits in the quarter. In India, this marks a return to growth for our business after a tough second quarter, with our volume growth trends improving in each month. 
In China, our consistent strategy, our focus on execution led to continued value and volume share gains in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Notably, Trademark Coca-Cola reached its highest year-to-date share levels since 2011. 
In Japan, volume did decline driven by poor weather in the quarter as well as a move to focus on price realization by reducing discounting of certain low value packs. While this may have short-term consequences in volume and share, it is more important to improve our pricing in the marketplace.
Finally, as bottling -- our Bottling Investments Group delivered 3% organic revenue growth led by operations in Germany, India and Vietnam. As a result, we once again gained global value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in the quarter, with gains in both sparkling and still beverages worldwide.
In summary, our third quarter performance marks another positive step towards achieving our goal of accelerating top line growth with the company delivering both solid pricing and unit case volume growth. We are confident in our strategies and execution and remain on track to deliver against expectations for this year.
I will now hand over to Kathy, who'll provide you a more detailed look at our financial performance as well as our outlook on our business for the rest of 2015."
26642,312014951,878639,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2015",2015-10-21,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Organic revenue growth was driven by 3 points of positive price/mix. Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing and product mix initiatives across many of our key markets and benefite",698,"Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Organic revenue growth was driven by 3 points of positive price/mix. Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing and product mix initiatives across many of our key markets and benefited from positive geographic mix due to the strong volume growth in our Bottling Investments Group. After adjusting for the additional days in the third quarter, year-to-date concentrate shipments were slightly behind unit cases, primarily due to the timing of shipments in the prior year in our Asia Pacific and Eurasia and Africa group.
For the full year, we continue to expect concentrate shipments to be generally in line with unit cases. Our comparable currency neutral gross margin expanded on a consolidated basis due to positive pricing, productivity savings and a slightly lower commodity costs, partially offset by structural changes. Positive comparable currency neutral operating leverage was driven primarily by cycling the timing of marketing expenses, the impact of which we expect to reverse in the fourth quarter, as well as a continued focus on controlling our operating costs.
For the quarter, comparable currency neutral operating income grew 8%. Below the operating line, net interest income was lower versus prior year, resulting in 7% growth in comparable currency neutral income before tax, which included a 1 point structural headwind. Our third quarter comparable EPS was $0.51, which included a 12 point currency headwind. Our comparable currency neutral basis, our EPS grew 8% in the quarter.
Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to noncash charges related to the announced refranchising of territories in North America.
During the first 9 months of the year, we generated $6.7 billion in free cash flow, up 6%, primarily due to the efficient management of working capital and the impact of 6 additional days, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from currency exchange rates, the impact from refranchising territories in North America and the brand transfer agreement with Monster Beverage Corporation.
Our focus on improving working capital contributed an incremental $600 million of cash flow for the first 9 months of 2015 versus the prior year. We returned $5.6 billion to shareowners in the form of dividends and net share repurchases during the first 9 months.
Turning to outlook. We are broadly in line with our expectations for the first 9 months of the year. With 1 quarter remaining, we expect our full year comparable currency neutral EPS to grow 5%, in line with our previous expectation. However, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, we now expect the currency impact to be slightly more unfavorable. After considering our hedge positions current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we now expect an approximate 7-point currency headwind on net revenue, 11-point headwind on operating income and an 8-point headwind on income before tax for the full year 2015. Therefore, we expect our comparable EPS to decline 3% for the year.
Our full year outlook implies that our fourth quarter comparable currency neutral EPS will decline mid- to high single digits. 
There are a couple of points to consider when modeling the fourth quarter. As we communicated at the beginning of the year, our fourth quarter will have 6 fewer selling days this year. Due to the timing of expenses last year combined with the increase in media investments this year, we expect DME to increase substantially in the fourth quarter. We expect structural items to be a slight headwind on net revenue and a 10-point headwind on gross profit -- on both gross profit and income before tax. We currently estimate currency will be a 6-point headwind on net revenues, a 12-point headwind on operating income and a 10-point headwind on income before tax in the fourth quarter as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior year. As a reminder, these impacts are based on current spot rates and given the volatile currency environment, these amounts are subject to change.
In summary, as you heard from Muhtar and James, our financial performance is consistent with what we discussed early in the year, and we continue to execute as we outline.
Operator, we are now ready for questions."

And I was hoping you could just take a step back and give us a more detailed review of your progress on those fronts. How much top line growth is responding to these efforts relative to your expectations both in terms of the market share payback from the higher marketing as well as the demand elasticity from the higher pricing. And then just in terms of the quarter on an adjusted basis x the concentrate lag, it looks like underlying revenue results are returning to your long-term goals with 3% unit case for sold and 3% price/mix. So at this point, you feel comparable you generally need those long-term top line growth goals going forward x any timing issues? Or with emerging markets macros still decelerating and perhaps easy comps from this quarter, it's a bit too early to call for that?"

What I would say in general overall is, yes, we're pleased with the quarter and the progress we're making, but lots of more work to do. This is a transition year. When we talked to you about 12 months, we outlined to you that with the changes we're going to make, that our goal is to get to mid-single digit currency neutral revenue growth for the comparable revenue growth for the company overall. And I think if you look at our progress to date for the first 3 quarters of the year, we had some of the bottom end of that range, the mid-single digit. If you look at where we are into revenue in terms of currency neutral comparable and what we have posted in this past quarter, the third quarter, you'd see us, if you take those numbers that you mentioned in terms of volume growth of 3 and price/mix of 3 at the top end of that range. So in essence, we're pleased with the progress that we've -- with all the 5-point strategy and executing it diligently over the last 9 months and even stating at the end of last year has brought us to where we are. And so we feel that we've always said the marketing has a lag, the incremental marketing, there's a lag in terms of when we in pet it and the results that we're getting. But we see that the plant is working and we certainly see that we're taking a very strategic approach in terms of marketing spend versus optimal levels. Consistent quality investments in media continues to be one of the strongest drivers of our business, enabling us to generate those -- that revenue. We look at each market, how many weeks of consumer engagement there is. And the goal overtime is to apply the right pressure in the right way to each of our plans and each of the segments that you mentioned which is developed, developing and emerging. And the system alignment and our bottling system is matching our alignments with investments -- I'm sorry, with capabilities execution, out to development, cooler placement, et cetera, so we're pleased with what we see there. And of course, all of this being said, we have a volatile macroeconomic environment, which obviously is not getting any better anytime soon. We realized that the global growth for 2015 is projected to be below last year. And even that, having said that, the disposable income that the growth rates that projected. So yes, but in general, that's how why I would frame your question. And both James and I and Kathy believe that are incremental and better marketing is certainly giving us the results in terms of the top line currency neutral comparable top line growth."

All of those negotiations with our expanding bottlers took some time to achieve. They are all achieved that's why we're progressing with rapid -- rapidly with our refranchising program, which is working very well because when we have those processes in place, we can refranchise with confidence and speed and have the business continue to generate the results and the growth that we're seeing in revenue, particularly in the United States of America.

I think it's important to recognize 2 things as it comes to price/mix in the case of Europe. One is the general deflationary nature of the European market. Retail pricing is 0 to 1 at best in general. And then secondly, it's worth remembering that the starting point of pricing in Europe is in comparison to the U.S. higher. So the opportunities to drive price/mix on a sustained long-term basis in the sense we've already captured some of that in Europe and we will be chasing that in the U.S So I don't think we'll see the same sort of price/mix overtime in Europe giving our standing point."

One, I was hoping you could set people just more at ease around the closure of the gap and unit case volume to concentrate sales. Getting a lot of questions there. Is that -- if you're really comfortable with that if that's the case closest all the regions of the world. It only does look like there's an inflection point on the top line. But are we not comfortable enough to also start talking a little bit about perhaps across every point or an inflection point in the productivity savings being higher than the reinvestment rate as well, so margins can also look like they're expanding? It looks like you had flat operating margins here, including the FX effects there, but that's better than it's been in a little while as well. So can we clarify and give us a sense on the margin potential as well?"

If you look at Latin America on a year-to-date basis, they are in absolutely in line. And with Asia Pacific on a year-to-date basis, we expect them to be generally in line. So there's really no story there in terms of that gap. When you -- then moving on to productivity, so productivity initiative obviously, we are seeing some benefit from productivity. There is -- in our margins, there is an impact in our margins from basically the structural changes. So if you exclude structural changes, the operating -- so growth margins and operating margins would be higher and you would see margin expansion. When you look at the third quarter, when you look at sort of leverage come, so's we're getting some productivity but we also have an impact from timing of the DME from basically from prior year that's impacting the timing from this year that, by the way, turned around in the fourth quarter. So I think there are a lot of puts and takes going on around productivity. You are seeing some productivity coming through. We are -- we continue to reinvest behind our brands though. And -- but our margin expansion is masked right now by currency and structural. So if you pull those 2 things out, you can see there's margin expansion."

We have a national information system that is basically all with their own governance models, and they're very fluid and very flexible to suit the needs of the business today. And then at the same time, every piece of the United States that has those elements really are -- have enough size for scale and then we have the much smaller -- the smaller distributor bottling system that also -- the smaller guys are doing a great job in growing to business for us. And in Europe, basically what we have is the customer landscape in Europe is much, much more concentrated in Western Europe where just a handful of customers account for every large portion of the total future consumption of the retail business in Europe. And therefore, when you look at what we've created in Western Europe, it basically suits the -- our future needs in terms of working proactively with our customer partners and also it gives the scale and also it gives the local touch in each of the markets.

Since then, our company has undergone substantial change while navigating a slowing global macro economic environment.
Before handing the call over to James Quincey, our recently announced President and Chief Operating Officer, to review our third quarter performance results, let me recap the decisive actions we have taken over the past year as well as highlight why we believe The Coca-Cola Company is well positioned to continue winning in the vibrant nonalcoholic beverage industry.
First, we said we would drive revenue and profit growth with clear portfolio roles across our markets. We have and will continue to do so. We segmented our market to develop long-term revenue growth strategies based on clear volume price investment and profit expectations, which were built into our 2015 plans and strategies going forward. Importantly, we revised our annual incentive metrics to include revenue growth and tie them directly to these clear portfolio roles in order to drive the right behavior in each market.
Second, we said we would target disciplined brand and growth investments. Last year, we significantly increased our media investments, and we're doing so again this year. Also under the leadership of Marcos de Quinto, who was named Chief Marketing Officer at the beginning of this year, we've improved the quality of our advertising while rewiring our marketing organization around consumer clusters to drive speed, efficiency and effectiveness, and we are seeing results with year-to-date value share performance accelerating across several markets. 
In addition, the incremental marketing is helping to accelerate revenue growth in some of our markets -- key markets, including North America. We also made investments in new growth platforms. We've closed the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation to compete more effectively in the global energy category. And just recently, our brand's launch on the Keurig KOLD system at home -- in the home dispensing platform.
In China, we have announced plans to expand into plant-based protein drinks through the acquisition of the beverage business of China Green Culiangwang Beverages Holding that recently received regulatory approval. In the United States, we invested in and signed a distribution agreement with Suja, a high-growth organic, cold-pressured juice company -- cold-pressed juice company. All these are long-term investments that we believe will allow us to add profitable new transactions in the nonalcoholic beverage industry.
Third, we said we would drive efficiency through more aggressive productivity. Our current $3 billion productivity program touches every part of our business and organization from our operating model to cost-of-goods sold to marketing expenses. We're driving these savings through a disciplined process that involved our entire leadership team and associates. And ultimately, it's about building a culture that is focused on getting better every single day and challenging every dollar we spend. We're on track against our overall goals and importantly, have implemented a broad set of changes in 2015 that will help us continue progress into 2016 and beyond. These include the implementation of zero-based work across our entire company as well as our corporate center and operating units and disciplined program management approach to drive cost of goods sold savings in everything, from our formulas to our packaging to our day-to-day operations in our plans.
Fourth, we said we would streamline and simplify our organization. To date, we standardized key processes, linked our business units with our corporate center and eliminated group functional roles in order to speed up decision-making and enhance focus at the local level to drive growth.
Our previously announced headcount reductions are substantially completed, and we are operating within our new structure. Importantly, we are ahead in terms of scope and timing.
Finally, we said we would refocus on our core business model of building the world's greatest beverage brands and leading an unmatched global system. And over the past year, we made substantial progress in evolving and strengthening our bottling landscape. Starting in North America, so far, we have transferred or signed agreements for territories covering over 30% of U.S. bottle/can volume. And just recently, we announced the creation of the National Product Supply System in order to align on a clear path forward for our 21st century manufacturing footprint in the United States.
In Europe, we announced the creation of Coca-Cola European partners, which will transform the Western European bottling landscape. 
And looking outside the developed world, we've made critical changes to our bottling system in key emerging markets. At the end of last year, we entered into an agreement to rearchitect our African bottling system with the creation of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which will have the scale, resources and efficiencies to fund the investment required to capture the strong, long-term growth potential in Africa. 
Also during the first quarter of this year, we invested in our Indonesian bottler to help our system capture the long-term opportunity in this attractive and large emerging market.
In short, our company has undergone a significant amount of streamlining and change these past 12 months. And while we are encouraged by our progress, we know we need to do more, which leads me to our most recent change. 
As we continue to increase our focus on improving global execution, we recently appointed James Quincey to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer. James has a deep knowledge of the global system and solid existing relationships with both bottlers and customers all around the world. He's uniquely qualified to accelerate the company's 5 strategic initiatives for growth in the months and years ahead.
I will now hand the call over to James, who will walk you through our quarterly performance."

In my 19 years with the company, I've seen ou",1161,"Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. Let me start on this first earnings call by saying that it's a tremendous honor for me to serve as the President and Chief Operating Officer of the Coca-Cola Company. In my 19 years with the company, I've seen our business evolve and grow while remaining strategically focused on doing the right things to drive long-term, sustainable growth.
As Muhtar referenced, we are resolutely focused on executing against the 5 strategic initiatives laid out last year, and a significant part of my role will be ensuring that we deliver. 
Now during the quarter, we made 2 important announcements that provide clarity on the future of our distribution and bottling structures in the United States and in Europe.
First, in our flagship market, we announced the creation of the National Product Supply System or NPSS to strengthen and streamline U.S. production as part of our effort to refranchise bottling territories in North America. Our approach embodies the best of both worlds by encompassing a national production system that generates efficiencies and scale for our system in combination with regional production that leverages the expertise and local knowledge of our long-standing bottling partners, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Coca-Cola UNITED and Swire Coca-Cola USA. These bottlers will continue to own and operate their own plants and where applicable, acquire additional production assets from the company owned Coca-Cola Refreshments. This will provide a clear profit incentive to make the local operations as efficient as possible.
However, to ensure the benefits of scale remain, the NPSS will have a governing board with the power to implement measures to ensure the production assets owned by NPSS bottlers are ultimately deployed to produce the lowest cost benefiting the entire system. This board will focus on making decisions on infrastructure planning, innovation planning and optimal sourcing at the national level. The board will be comprised of representatives from Coca-Cola North America, Coca-Cola Refreshments and the 3 independent bottlers, which together, currently represent approximately 95% of the U.S. produced volume.
We believe this structure allows us to leverage our significant system scale with a unique competitive advantage of being able to act locally with speed. Together with our focus on driving revenue, this will result in system margin expansion over the coming years.
So in addition to systemwide benefits, this approach has the additional benefit for The Coca-Cola Company and that it accelerates our return to an asset-like model, which will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending and invested capital and improved return on invested capital for our company as we transition these production assets.
We also continue to make progress on the refranchising of the U.S. distribution territories. Just this morning, we announced that we signed nonbinding letters of intent on additional distribution territories in 7 states. As Muhtar referenced, this will bring the total amount of volume in territories transitioned to date, all covered by agreements, to over 30% of U.S. bottle/can volume.
Also during the quarter, we announced the merger of our company-owned German bottling operations with Coca-Cola Iberian Partners and Coca-Cola Enterprises into a new company named Coca-Cola European Partners. This will transform our Western European bottling landscape and create the world's largest independent Coca-Cola bottler based on revenue. The creation of a larger unified bottling partner in Western Europe represents an important step in our global system's evolution, as we continue to adapt our business model to innovate, invest and grow along with the changing demands of the marketplace. This merger enhances alignment within the Coca-Cola system, enabling us to more effectively compete and drive growth across developed European markets. Importantly, the new company will position to deliver world-class execution and customer service by leveraging the best practices of each party to drive sustainable growth in multiple categories.
Now turning to the performance in this quarter. Well, the global economic environment remains challenging, as the slowdown in the Chinese economy and the lower oil prices are putting pressure on many commodity-dependent economies such as Australia, Brazil and Russia, while volatility rippling through the Middle East causes further economic uncertainty.
Despite these macroeconomic challenges, our 5-point plan and our focus on execution and reinvestment drove improved results, with both unit case volume and price/mix growing 3% each in the quarter, as outlined in our quarterly performance scorecard on Slide 11.
Organic revenues grew 3%, driven by the previously mentioned strong price/mix and slight growth in concentrate shipments. Our top line performance was broad-based with 5 of the 6 operating segments delivering organic revenue growth. North America continued its disciplined approach to volume, price and mix management, and I'm encouraged by the solid progress we've seen in this market over the past 2 years.
In Europe, we drove top line growth through strong commercial and marketing activities whilst also benefiting from some good weather in much of the region. We are seeing green shoots in Europe, and our business in central and southern Europe delivered a particularly strong quarter due to investments in media, changes in our price/pack architecture and favorable weather.
In Latin America, we delivered double-digit organic revenue growth despite worsening conditions in Brazil. Our Mexico business unit helped to balance the weakness in Brazil by accelerating unit case volume growth to 4% in the quarter with growth across all the major categories.
In Eurasia and Africa, deteriorating conditions in Russia and volatility in the Middle East partially offset the solid performance in the Africa businesses.
Turning finally to the Asia Pacific group. China and India both grew unit case volume mid-single digits in the quarter. In India, this marks a return to growth for our business after a tough second quarter, with our volume growth trends improving in each month. 
In China, our consistent strategy and focus on execution led to continued value and volume share gains in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Notably, trademark Coca-Cola reached its highest year-to-date share levels since 2011. 
In Japan, volume did decline driven by poor weather in the quarter as well as a move to focus on price realization by reducing discounting of certain low-value multi-serve packs. Whilst this may have short-term consequences in volume and share, it is more important to improve our pricing in the marketplace.
Finally, our Bottling Investments Group delivered 3% organic revenue growth led by operations in Germany, India and Vietnam. As a result, we once again gained global value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in the quarter, with gains in both sparkling and still beverages worldwide.
In summary, our third quarter performance marks another positive step towards achieving our goal of accelerating top line growth with the company delivering both solid pricing and unit case volume growth. We are confident in our strategies and execution, and remain on track to deliver against expectations for this year.
I will now hand over to Kathy, who'll provide you a more detailed look at our financial performance as well as our outlook on our business for the rest of 2015."

Organic revenue growth was driven by 3 points of positive price/mix. Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing and product mix initiatives across many of our key markets, and benefit",698,"Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Organic revenue growth was driven by 3 points of positive price/mix. Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing and product mix initiatives across many of our key markets, and benefited from positive geographic mix due to the strong volume growth in our Bottling Investments Group. After adjusting for the additional days in the first quarter, year-to-date concentrate shipments were slightly behind unit cases, primarily due to the timing of shipments in the prior year in our Asia Pacific and Eurasia and Africa groups.
For the full year, we continue to expect concentrate shipments to be generally in line with unit cases. Our comparable currency neutral gross margin expanded on a consolidated basis due to positive pricing, productivity savings and a slightly lower commodity cost, partially offset by structural changes. Positive comparable currency neutral operating leverage was driven primarily by cycling the timing of marketing expenses, the impact of which we expect to reverse in the fourth quarter as well as a continued focus on controlling our operating costs.
For the quarter, comparable currency neutral operating income grew 8%. Below the operating line, net interest income was lower versus prior year, resulting in 7% growth in comparable currency neutral income before tax, which included a 1 point structural headwind. Our third quarter comparable EPS was $0.51, which included a 12-point currency headwind. On a comparable currency neutral basis, our EPS grew 8% in the quarter.
Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to noncash charges related to the announced refranchising of territories in North America.
During the first 9 months of the year, we generated $6.7 billion in free cash flow, up 6%, primarily due to the efficient management of working capital and the impact of 6 additional days, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from currency exchange rates, the impact from refranchising territories in North America and the brand transfer agreement with Monster Beverage Corporation.
Our focus on improving working capital contributed an incremental $600 million of cash flow for the first 9 months of 2015 versus the prior year. We returned $5.6 billion to shareowners in the form of dividends and net share repurchases during the first 9 months.
Turning to outlook. We are broadly in line with our expectations for the first 9 months of the year. With 1 quarter remaining, we expect our full year comparable currency neutral EPS to grow 5%, in line with our previous expectations. However, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, we now expect the currency impact to be slightly more unfavorable. After considering our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we now expect an approximate 7-point currency headwind on net revenue, 11-point headwind on operating income and an 8-point headwind on income before tax for the full year 2015. Therefore, we expect our comparable EPS to decline 3% for the year.
Our full year outlook implies that our fourth quarter comparable currency neutral EPS will decline mid- to high single digits. 
There are a couple of points to consider when modeling the fourth quarter. As we communicated at the beginning of the year, our fourth quarter will have 6 fewer selling days this year. Due to the timing of expenses last year combined with the increase in media investments this year, we expect DME to increase substantially in the fourth quarter. We expect structural items to be a slight headwind on net revenue and a 2-point headwind on gross profit -- on both gross profit and income before tax. We currently estimate currency will be a 6-point headwind on net revenues, a 12-point headwind on operating income and a 10-point headwind on income before tax in the fourth quarter as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior year. As a reminder, these impacts are based on current spot rates and given the volatile currency environment, these amounts are subject to change.
In summary, as you heard from Muhtar and James, our financial performance is consistent with what we discussed early in the year, and we continue to execute as we outline.

And I was hoping you could just take a step back and give us a more detailed review of your progress on those fronts. How much top line growth is responding to these efforts relative to your expectations, both in terms of the market share payback from the higher marketing as well as the demand elasticity from the higher pricing? And then just in terms of the quarter on an adjusted basis ex the concentrate lag, it looks like underlying revenue results are returning to your long-term goals with 3% unit case result and 3% price/mix. So at this point, do you feel comfortable you can generally meet those long-term top line growth goals going forward ex any timing issues? Or with emerging markets macros still decelerating and perhaps easy comps from this quarter, it's a bit too early to call for that?"

What I would say in general overall is, yes, we're pleased with the quarter and the progress we're making, but lots of more work to do. This is a transition year. When we talked to you about 12 months ago, we outlined to you that with the changes we're going to make, that our goal is to get to mid-single digit currency neutral revenue growth for the comparable revenue growth for the company overall. And I think if you look at our progress to date for the first 3 quarters of the year, we're at sort of the bottom end of that range, the mid-single digit. If you look at where we are in revenue in terms of currency neutral comparable and what we have posted in this past quarter, the third quarter, you would see us, if you take those numbers that you mentioned in terms of volume growth of 3% and price/mix of 3% at the top end of that range. So in essence, we're pleased with the progress that we've -- with all the 5-point strategy and executing it diligently over the last 9 months and even starting at the end of last year has brought us to where we are. And so we feel that we've always said the marketing has a lag, the incremental marketing, there's a lag in terms of when we input it and the results that we're getting. But we see that the plan is working, and we certainly see that we're taking a very strategic approach in terms of marketing spend versus optimal levels. Consistent quality investment in media continues to be one of the strongest drivers of our business, enabling us to generate those -- that revenue. We look at each market, how many weeks of consumer engagement there is. The goal over time is to apply the right pressure in the right way to each of our brands and each of the segments that you mentioned which is developed, developing and emerging. And the system alignment in our bottling system is matching our alignments with investment -- I'm sorry, with capabilities execution, output development, cooler placement, et cetera. So we're pleased with what we see there. And of course, all of this being said, we have a volatile macroeconomic environment, which obviously is not getting any better anytime soon. We realized that the global growth for 2015 is projected to be below last year. And even that, having said that, the disposable income are even lagging the growth rates that are projected. So yes, but in general, that's how I would frame your question. And both James and I and Kathy believe that the incremental and better marketing is certainly giving us the results in terms of the top line -- currency neutral comparable top line growth."

The franchise system, the alignment that, that brings, the value and trust between us and our bottling partners. But at the same time, create the mechanism, so to speak, the processes, flexible processes in the marketplace whether it be information systems, whether it be the customer management system so that we can speak with one voice to customers, coast to coast, in the United States and the National Product Supply System. All of those negotiations with our expanding bottlers took some time to achieve. They are all achieved, that's why we're progressing with rapid -- rapidly with our refranchising program, which is working very well because when we have those processes in place, we can refranchise with confidence and speed and have the business continue to generate the results and the growth that we are seeing in revenue, particularly in the United States of America.

I think it's important to recognize 2 things as it comes to price/mix in the case of Europe. One is the general deflationary nature of the European market. Retail pricing is 0 to 1, at best in general. And then secondly, it's worth remembering that the starting point of pricing in Europe is in comparison to the U.S. higher. So the opportunity is to drive price/mix on a sustained long-term basis in the sense we've already captured some of that in Europe, and we will be chasing that in the U.S. So I don't think we'll see the same sort of price/mix over time in Europe given our starting point."

Is that -- Look  if you're really comfortable with that, and if that's the case, that, that closes for all the regions of the world, it certainly does look like there's an inflection point on top line. But are we now comfortable enough to also start talking a little bit about perhaps a crossover point or inflection point in the productivity savings being higher than reinvestment rate as well, so margins can also look like they're expanding? It looks like you had flat operating margins here, including the FX effects there, but that's better than it's been in a little while as well. So can we clarify and give us a sense on a margin inflection potential as well?"

If you look at Latin America on a year-to-date basis, they are absolutely in line. And with Asia Pacific, on a year-to-date basis, we expect them to be generally in line. So there's really no story there in terms of that gap. When you -- then moving on to productivity, so productivity initiative, obviously, we are seeing some benefit from productivity. There is -- in our margins, there is an impact in our margins from, basically, the structural changes. So if you would exclude structural changes, the -- so gross margins and operating margins would be higher, and you would see margin expansion. When you look at the third quarter, when you look at the set of leverage, so we are getting some productivity, but we also have an impact from timing of the DME from -- basically, from prior year that's impacting the timing from this year that, by the way, turns around in the fourth quarter. So I think there are a lot of puts and takes going on around productivity. You are seeing some productivity coming through. We are -- we continue to reinvest behind our brands though. But our margin expansion is masked right now by currency and structural. So if you pull those 2 things out, you see very good margin expansion."

And then at the same time, every piece of the United States that has those elements really are -- have enough size for scale, and then we have the much smaller -- the smaller distributor bottling system that also -- the smaller guys are doing a great job in growing the business for us. And then in Europe, basically what we have is the customer landscape in Europe is much, much more concentrated in Western Europe, where just a handful of customers account for very large portion of the total future consumption, the retail business in Europe. And therefore, when you look at what we've created in Western Europe, it basically suits the -- our future needs in terms of working proactively with our customer partners, and also it gives the scale and also it gives the local touch in each of the markets.

We don't think that this is the silver bullet that anyone was looking for, and we think that the -- much more work needs to be done if indeed the solution is to be brought to bear on the whole obesity crisis, in which overconsumption of anything including soft drinks will be a contributor and are part of the problem.

Since then, our company has undergone substantial change while navigating a slowing global macro economic environment.
Before handing the call over to James Quincey, our recently announced President and Chief Operating Officer, to review our third quarter performance results, let me recap the decisive actions we have taken over the past year as well as highlight why we believe The Coca-Cola Company is well positioned to continue winning in the vibrant nonalcoholic beverage industry.
First, we said we would drive revenue and profit growth with clear portfolio roles across our markets. We have and will continue to do so. We segmented our markets to develop long-term revenue growth strategies based on clear volume price investment and profit expectations, which were built into our 2015 plans and strategies going forward. Importantly, we revised our annual incentive metrics to include revenue growth and tie them directly to these clear portfolio roles in order to drive the right behavior in each market.
Second, we said we would target disciplined brand and growth investments. Last year, we significantly increased our media investments, and we're doing so again this year. Also under the leadership of Marcos de Quinto, who was named Chief Marketing Officer at the beginning of this year, we've improved the quality of our advertising while rewiring our marketing organization around consumer clusters to drive speed, efficiency and effectiveness, and we are seeing results with year-to-date value share performance accelerating across several markets. 
In addition, the incremental marketing is helping to accelerate revenue growth in some of our markets -- key markets, including North America. We also made investments in new growth platforms. We've closed the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation to compete more effectively in the global energy category. And just recently, our brand has launched on the Keurig KOLD system at home -- in the home dispensing platform.
In China, we have announced plans to expand into plant-based protein drinks through the acquisition of the beverage business of China Green Culiangwang Beverages Holding that recently received regulatory approval. In the United States, we invested in and signed a distribution agreement with Suja, a high-growth organic, cold-pressured juice company -- cold-pressed juice company. All these are long-term investments that we believe will allow us to add profitable new transactions in the nonalcoholic beverage industry.
Third, we said we would drive efficiency through more aggressive productivity. Our current $3 billion productivity program touches every part of our business and organization from our operating model to cost-of-goods sold to marketing expenses. We're driving these savings through a disciplined process that involved our entire leadership team and associates. And ultimately, it's about building a culture that is focused on getting better every single day and challenging every dollar we spend. We're on track against our overall goals and importantly, have implemented a broad set of changes in 2015 that will help us continue progress into 2016 and beyond. These include the implementation of zero-based work across our entire company as well as our corporate center and operating units and disciplined program management approach to drive cost of goods sold savings in everything, from our formulas to our packaging to our day-to-day operations in our plans.
Fourth, we said we would streamline and simplify our organization. To date, we standardized key processes, linked our business units with our corporate center and eliminated group functional roles in order to speed up decision-making and enhance focus at the local level to drive growth.
Our previously announced headcount reductions are substantially completed, and we are operating within our new structure. Importantly, we are ahead in terms of scope and timing.
Finally, we said we would refocus on our core business model of building the world's greatest beverage brands and leading an unmatched global system. And over the past year, we made substantial progress in evolving and strengthening our bottling landscape. Starting in North America, so far, we have transferred or signed agreements for territories covering over 30% of U.S. bottle/can volume. And just recently, we announced the creation of the National Product Supply System in order to align on a clear path forward for our 21st century manufacturing footprint in the United States.
In Europe, we announced the creation of Coca-Cola European partners, which will transform the Western European bottling landscape. 
And looking outside the developed world, we've made critical changes to our bottling system in key emerging markets. At the end of last year, we entered into an agreement to rearchitect our African bottling system with the creation of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which will have the scale, resources and efficiencies to fund the investment required to capture the strong, long-term growth potential in Africa. 
Also during the first quarter of this year, we invested in our Indonesian bottler to help our system capture the long-term opportunity in this attractive and large emerging market.
In short, our company has undergone a significant amount of streamlining and change these past 12 months. And while we are encouraged by our progress, we know we need to do more, which leads me to our most recent change. 
As we continue to increase our focus on improving global execution, we recently appointed James Quincey to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer. James has a deep knowledge of the global system and solid existing relationships with both bottlers and customers all around the world. He's uniquely qualified to accelerate the company's 5 strategic initiatives for growth in the months and years ahead.
I will now hand the call over to James, who will walk you through our quarterly performance."
26642,312014951,878925,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2015",2015-10-21,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. Let me start on this first earnings call by saying that it's a tremendous honor for me to serve as the President and Chief Operating Officer of the Coca-Cola Company. In my 19 years with the company, I've seen ou",1161,"Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. Let me start on this first earnings call by saying that it's a tremendous honor for me to serve as the President and Chief Operating Officer of the Coca-Cola Company. In my 19 years with the company, I've seen our business evolve and grow while remaining strategically focused on doing the right things to drive long-term, sustainable growth.
As Muhtar referenced, we are resolutely focused on executing against the 5 strategic initiatives laid out last year, and a significant part of my role will be ensuring that we deliver. 
Now during the quarter, we made 2 important announcements that provide clarity on the future of our distribution and bottling structures in the United States and in Europe.
First, in our flagship market, we announced the creation of the National Product Supply System or NPSS to strengthen and streamline U.S. production as part of our effort to refranchise bottling territories in North America. Our approach embodies the best of both worlds by encompassing a national production system that generates efficiencies and scale for our system in combination with regional production that leverages the expertise and local knowledge of our long-standing bottling partners, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Coca-Cola UNITED and Swire Coca-Cola USA. These bottlers will continue to own and operate their own plants and where applicable, acquire additional production assets from the company owned Coca-Cola Refreshments. This will provide a clear profit incentive to make the local operations as efficient as possible.
However, to ensure the benefits of scale remain, the NPSS will have a governing board with the power to implement measures to ensure the production assets owned by NPSS bottlers are ultimately deployed to produce the lowest cost benefiting the entire system. This board will focus on making decisions on infrastructure planning, innovation planning and optimal sourcing at the national level. The board will be comprised of representatives from Coca-Cola North America, Coca-Cola Refreshments and the 3 independent bottlers, which together currently represent approximately 95% of the U.S. produced volume.
We believe this structure allows us to leverage our significant system scale with a unique competitive advantage of being able to act locally with speed. Together with our focus on driving revenue, this will result in system margin expansion over the coming years.
So in addition to systemwide benefits, this approach has the additional benefit for The Coca-Cola Company in that it accelerates our return to an asset-light model, which will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending and invested capital and improved return on invested capital for our company as we transition these production assets.
We also continue to make progress on the refranchising of the U.S. distribution territories. Just this morning, we announced that we signed nonbinding letters of intent on additional distribution territories in 7 states. As Muhtar referenced, this will bring the total amount of volume in territories transitioned to date, all covered by agreements, to over 30% of U.S. bottle/can volume.
Also during the quarter, we announced the merger of our company-owned German bottling operations with Coca-Cola Iberian Partners and Coca-Cola Enterprises into a new company named Coca-Cola European Partners. This will transform our Western European bottling landscape and create the world's largest independent Coca-Cola bottler based on revenue. The creation of a larger unified bottling partner in Western Europe represents an important step in our global system's evolution, as we continue to adapt our business model to innovate, invest and grow along with the changing demands of the marketplace. This merger enhances alignment within the Coca-Cola system, enabling us to more effectively compete and drive growth across developed European markets. Importantly, the new company will position to deliver world-class execution and customer service by leveraging the best practices of each party to drive sustainable growth in multiple categories.
Now turning to the performance in this quarter. Well, the global economic environment remains challenging, as the slowdown in the Chinese economy and the lower oil prices are putting pressure on many commodity-dependent economies such as Australia, Brazil and Russia, while volatility rippling through the Middle East causes further economic uncertainty.
Despite these macroeconomic challenges, our 5-point plan and our focus on execution and reinvestment drove improved results, with both unit case volume and price/mix growing 3% each in the quarter, as outlined in our quarterly performance scorecard on Slide 11.
Organic revenues grew 3%, driven by the previously mentioned strong price/mix and slight growth in concentrate shipments. Our top line performance was broad-based with 5 of the 6 operating segments delivering organic revenue growth. North America continued its disciplined approach to volume, price and mix management, and I'm encouraged by the solid progress we've seen in this market over the past 2 years.
In Europe, we drove top line growth through strong commercial and marketing activities whilst also benefiting from some good weather in much of the region. We are seeing green shoots in Europe, and our business in central and southern Europe delivered a particularly strong quarter due to investments in media, changes in our price/pack architecture and favorable weather.
In Latin America, we delivered double-digit organic revenue growth despite worsening conditions in Brazil. Our Mexico business unit helped to balance the weakness in Brazil by accelerating unit case volume growth to 4% in the quarter with growth across all the major categories.
In Eurasia and Africa, deteriorating conditions in Russia and volatility in the Middle East partially offset the solid performance in the Africa businesses.
Turning finally to the Asia Pacific group. China and India both grew unit case volume mid-single digits in the quarter. In India, this marks a return to growth for our business after a tough second quarter, with our volume growth trends improving in each month. 
In China, our consistent strategy and focus on execution led to continued value and volume share gains in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Notably, trademark Coca-Cola reached its highest year-to-date share levels since 2011. 
In Japan, volume did decline driven by poor weather in the quarter as well as a move to focus on price realization by reducing discounting of certain low-value multi-serve packs. Whilst this may have short-term consequences in volume and share, it is more important to improve our pricing in the marketplace.
Finally, our Bottling Investments Group delivered 3% organic revenue growth led by operations in Germany, India and Vietnam. As a result, we once again gained global value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in the quarter, with gains in both sparkling and still beverages worldwide.
In summary, our third quarter performance marks another positive step towards achieving our goal of accelerating top line growth with the company delivering both solid pricing and unit case volume growth. We are confident in our strategies and execution, and remain on track to deliver against expectations for this year.
I will now hand over to Kathy, who'll provide you a more detailed look at our financial performance as well as our outlook on our business for the rest of 2015."
26642,312014951,878925,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2015",2015-10-21,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Organic revenue growth was driven by 3 points of positive price/mix.

Organic revenue growth was driven by 3 points of positive price/mix. Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing and product mix initiatives across many of our key markets, and benefited from positive geographic mix due to the strong volume growth in our Bottling Investments Group. After adjusting for the additional days in the first quarter, year-to-date concentrate shipments were slightly behind unit cases, primarily due to the timing of shipments in the prior year in our Asia Pacific and Eurasia and Africa groups.
For the full year, we continue to expect concentrate shipments to be generally in line with unit cases. Our comparable currency neutral gross margin expanded on a consolidated basis due to positive pricing, productivity savings and a slightly lower commodity cost, partially offset by structural changes. Positive comparable currency neutral operating leverage was driven primarily by cycling the timing of marketing expenses, the impact of which we expect to reverse in the fourth quarter, as well as a continued focus on controlling our operating costs.
For the quarter, comparable currency neutral operating income grew 8%. Below the operating line, net interest income was lower versus prior year, resulting in 7% growth in comparable currency neutral income before tax, which included a 1 point structural headwind. Our third quarter comparable EPS was $0.51, which included a 12-point currency headwind. On a comparable currency neutral basis, our EPS grew 8% in the quarter.
Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to noncash charges related to the announced refranchising of territories in North America.
During the first 9 months of the year, we generated $6.7 billion in free cash flow, up 6%, primarily due to the efficient management of working capital and the impact of 6 additional days, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from currency exchange rates, the impact from refranchising territories in North America and the brand transfer agreement with Monster Beverage Corporation.
Our focus on improving working capital contributed an incremental $600 million of cash flow for the first 9 months of 2015 versus the prior year. We returned $5.6 billion to shareowners in the form of dividends and net share repurchases during the first 9 months.
Turning to outlook. We are broadly in line with our expectations for the first 9 months of the year. With 1 quarter remaining, we expect our full year comparable currency neutral EPS to grow 5%, in line with our previous expectations. However, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, we now expect the currency impact to be slightly more unfavorable. After considering our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we now expect an approximate 7-point currency headwind on net revenue, 11-point headwind on operating income and an 8-point headwind on income before tax for the full year 2015. Therefore, we expect our comparable EPS to decline 3% for the year.
Our full year outlook implies that our fourth quarter comparable currency neutral EPS will decline mid- to high single digits. 
There are a couple of points to consider when modeling the fourth quarter. As we communicated at the beginning of the year, our fourth quarter will have 6 fewer selling days this year. Due to the timing of expenses last year combined with the increase in media investments this year, we expect DME to increase substantially in the fourth quarter. We expect structural items to be a slight headwind on net revenue and a 2-point headwind on gross profit -- on both gross profit and income before tax. We currently estimate currency will be a 6-point headwind on net revenues, a 12-point headwind on operating income and a 10-point headwind on income before tax in the fourth quarter as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior year. As a reminder, these impacts are based on current spot rates and given the volatile currency environment, these amounts are subject to change.
In summary, as you heard from Muhtar and James, our financial performance is consistent with what we discussed early in the year, and we continue to execute as we outline.

And I was hoping you could just take a step back and give us a more detailed review of your progress on those fronts. How much top line growth is responding to these efforts relative to your expectations, both in terms of the market share payback from the higher marketing as well as the demand elasticity from the higher pricing? And then just in terms of the quarter on an adjusted basis ex the concentrate lag, it looks like underlying revenue results are returning to your long-term goals with 3% unit case result and 3% price/mix. So at this point, do you feel comfortable you can generally meet those long-term top line growth goals going forward ex any timing issues? Or with emerging markets macros still decelerating and perhaps easy comps from this quarter, it's a bit too early to call for that?"

What I would say in general overall is, yes, we're pleased with the quarter and the progress we're making, but lots of more work to do. This is a transition year. When we talked to you about 12 months ago, we outlined to you that with the changes we're going to make, that our goal is to get to mid-single digit currency neutral revenue growth for the comparable revenue growth for the company overall. And I think if you look at our progress to date for the first 3 quarters of the year, we're at sort of the bottom end of that range, the mid-single digit. If you look at where we are in revenue in terms of currency neutral comparable and what we have posted in this past quarter, the third quarter, you would see us, if you take those numbers that you mentioned in terms of volume growth of 3% and price/mix of 3% at the top end of that range. So in essence, we're pleased with the progress that we've -- with all the 5-point strategy and executing it diligently over the last 9 months and even starting at the end of last year has brought us to where we are. And so we feel that we've always said the marketing has a lag, the incremental marketing, there's a lag in terms of when we input it and the results that we're getting. But we see that the plan is working, and we certainly see that we're taking a very strategic approach in terms of marketing spend versus optimal levels. Consistent quality investment in media continues to be one of the strongest drivers of our business, enabling us to generate those -- that revenue. We look at each market, how many weeks of consumer engagement there is. The goal over time is to apply the right pressure in the right way to each of our brands and each of the segments that you mentioned which is developed, developing and emerging. And the system alignment in our bottling system is matching our alignments with investment -- I'm sorry, with capabilities execution, output development, cooler placement, et cetera. So we're pleased with what we see there. And of course, all of this being said, we have a volatile macroeconomic environment, which obviously is not getting any better anytime soon. We realized that the global growth for 2015 is projected to be below last year. And even that, having said that, the disposable incomes are even lagging the growth rates that are projected. So yes, but in general, that's how I would frame your question. And both James and I and Kathy believe that the incremental and better marketing is certainly giving us the results in terms of the top line -- currency neutral comparable top line growth."

The franchise system, the alignment that, that brings, the value and trust between us and our bottling partners. But at the same time, create the mechanism, so to speak, the processes, flexible processes in the marketplace whether it be information systems, whether it be the customer management system so that we can speak with one voice to customers, coast to coast, in the United States and the National Product Supply System. All of those negotiations with our expanding bottlers took some time to achieve. They are all achieved, that's why we're progressing with rapid -- rapidly with our refranchising program, which is working very well because when we have those processes in place, we can refranchise with confidence and speed and have the business continue to generate the results and the growth that we are seeing in revenue, particularly in the United States of America.

I think if you look at the longer-term trends, you can see that we're getting some volume growth in the year-to-date with the price/mixes bouncing around flat. I think it's important to recognize 2 things as it comes to price/mix in the case of Europe. One is the general deflationary nature of the European market. Retail pricing is 0 to 1, at best in general. And then secondly, it's worth remembering that the starting point of pricing in Europe is in comparison to the U.S. higher. So the opportunity is to drive price/mix on a sustained long-term basis in the sense we've already captured some of that in Europe, and we will be chasing that in the U.S. So I don't think we'll see the same sort of price/mix over time in Europe given our starting point."

If that -- look,  if you're really comfortable with that, and if that's the case, that, that closes for all the regions of the world, it certainly does look like there's an inflection point on top line. But are we now comfortable enough to also start talking a little bit about perhaps a crossover point or inflection point in the productivity savings being higher than reinvestment rate as well, so margins can also look like they're expanding? It looks like you had flat operating margins here, including the FX effects there, but that's better than it's been in a little while as well.

So there's really no story there in terms of that gap. When you -- then moving on to productivity, so the productivity initiative, obviously, we are seeing some benefit from productivity. There is -- in our margins, there is an impact in our margins from, basically, the structural changes. So if you would exclude structural changes, the -- so gross margins and operating margins would be higher, and you would see margin expansion. When you look at the third quarter, when you look at the set of leverage, so we are getting some productivity, but we also have an impact from timing of the DME from -- basically, from prior year that's impacting that timing from this year that, by the way, turns around in the fourth quarter. So I think there are a lot of puts and takes going on around productivity. You are seeing some productivity coming through. We are -- we continue to reinvest behind our brands though. But our margin expansion is masked right now by currency and structural. So if you pull those 2 things out, you see very good margin expansion."

And then at the same time, every piece of the United States that has those elements really are -- have enough size for scale, and then we have the much smaller -- the smaller distributor bottling system that also -- the smaller guys are doing a great job in growing the business for us. And then in Europe, basically what we have is the customer landscape in Europe is much, much more concentrated in Western Europe, where just a handful of customers account for a very large portion of the total future consumption, the retail business in Europe. And therefore, when you look at what we've created in Western Europe, it basically suits the -- our future needs in terms of working proactively with our customer partners, and also it gives the scale and also it gives the local touch in each of the markets.
