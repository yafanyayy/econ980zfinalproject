Welcome, everybody, to Bard's fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. And thank all of you for taking the time to join us today. I would expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 35 minutes or so. 
The agenda today will go as follows. I'll begin with an overview of the results for the fourth quarter. John Weiland, our President and COO, will review of fourth quarter product line revenue. John DeFord, our Senior Vice President of Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you an update on our product development outline. And then Christopher Holland, our Senior VP and CFO, will review the fourth quarter income statement, balance sheet and also provide our financial guidance for 2015. And then finally, we'll wrap it up with Q&A. 
Fourth quarter 2014 net sales totaled $867.2 million, that's up 10% over Q4 last year on an as-reported basis and up 11% on a constant currency basis. The currency impact for the quarter versus the same quarter of 2013 was unfavorable by about 140 basis points. 
The core royalty revenue in the quarter was approximately $38.6 million. The impact of the divestiture of our business, which occurred in Q4 2013 net of the impact of the Rochester medical acquisition in the same quarter was unfavorable by about 20 basis points growth for the quarter. Of that, that puts our organic growth rate for Q4 2014 at approximately 6.3% with a little over 200 basis points from the early approval and launch of the Lutonix drug-coated PTA balloon in the U.S. 
Net sales for the full year 2014 were $3.3 billion, that's up 9% as reported and on a constant currency basis, which exceeded our original guidance for the year. Net income for the fourth quarter was $134.2 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.72. I will remind you that we recognized the onetime gain from the Gore litigation in the prior year quarter. Excluding this and other items that affected the comparability of results between periods, which Chris will cover later, fourth quarter 2014 net income and diluted cash earnings per share, which excludes amortization of intangibles, were $158.9 million and $2.29, that's up 39% and 40%, respectively. 
Full year 2014 net income was $294.5 million and diluted EPS was $3.76. Excluding items again that affect comparability between periods, full year 2014 net income was $586 million and diluted cash EPS were $8.40 and that's up 23% and 29%, respectively from 2013, again, well in excess of our original guidance for the year. 
Looking at the fourth quarter revenue growth geographically compared to the prior year, on a constant currency basis. Net sales in the U.S. grew 14%, internationally, we grew 5%, with Europe up 3%; Japan up 2% and our other international geographics up 8%. Excluding the Gore royalty and divestiture impact, net sales in the U.S. grew 7% and total international sales were up 10%, with Europe up 10%; Japan up 3%; and the remaining geographies up 11%. 
As anticipated in our strategic investment plan, our emerging market sales continued to increase and represented about 9% of our total revenue in Q4. Looking back at 2014, we are pleased with the progress that we've made throughout the year. 2 years ago, I will remind you, we introduced our 3-year strategic investment plan and then on that same quarter, our organic growth rate was flat. We finished 2014 with organic growth rate of the portfolio in the mid-single digits, which is what we had projected. It's difficult to know precisely what's happening in real-time in the underlying markets. But we believe the market's organic growth continues to be in the low single digits. While many in our sector had stronger growth in Q3 than expected, some of those same companies themselves sequential deceleration of growth in Q4. In contrast, we continue to see sequential improvement on our organic growth rate. And we believe that the implementation and execution of our strategic investment planning contributed to this acceleration. 
As we look to 2015, wef expect the full year organic growth rate to again improve over the full year 2014. And to be clear, that assumes no benefit from any underlying market improvement. If the market improves as some are suggesting, then we should do better than that. 
2015 is an important year of execution, once again, for us. We expect our investments in emerging markets to continue to shift the mix of the portfolio on faster growing geographies. The key to this initiative is improved productivity from the teams that we build and additional product registrations in these markets. 
In 2015, we also anticipate we'll begin to see some returns from our R&D investments. Over the past couple of years, we significantly increased the level of R&D as we pursued expanded indications of current product platforms and introductions of new technologies. We remain in investment mode. The long-term objective is to drive above market revenue growth with a lower risk profile on a sustainable basis. There obviously remains significant uncertainty in the market, including unsettled issues in Washington. FX headwinds at this magnitude, frankly, are difficult and come up as quick as we've seen in years. The market acceptance, reimbursement decisions, competitive response on through drug-coated balloons in the U.S. could have a meaningful impact in our results. And we have no way of knowing whether Gore royalty will increase, decrease or be consistent compared to 2014 levels. 
However, amidst of these uncertainties, we remain focused on the execution of our strategic plan and the things we can control. We believe our investments will improve the organic engine of the company in both revenue and profitability. And as we said, we measure success over the long-term. If 2015 brings some tailwind in the market as some suggest, we would look for opportunities to invest any short-term outperformance back into the business for longer term benefit. 
Chris will give you more detail when he lays out his financial guidance. We continue to believe that the effective execution of our strategic investment plan will allow us to continue to increase shareholder value over the long term and on a sustainable basis. 
With that, as an introduction, let me turn you over to John Weiland to review of our fourth quarter product line revenue"

Before I start, as usual, I will be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. So let me start with Vascular. Total net sales in this category for the quarter were $244.6 million, an increase of 19% on an as-reported basis and 22% on a constant currency basis when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Excluding the Gore royalty and the impact of the EP divestiture, global Vascular sales were up 9%, with the United States business up 14% for the quarter and international up 3%. Sales in our Vascular graft category were down 6% in Q4. 
Excluding the Gore royalty, our Endovascular business grew 11% in the fourth quarter. Within Endovascular, our biopsy line was up 1%. 
Our peripheral PTA products were up 49% this quarter, driven by the early FDA approval of Lutonix drug-coated balloon in the United States on October 10. We're extremely pleased with how our Vascular sales, development and operations team executed the early launch of this first of the kind product in the United States. As you know, we were shipping product to customers on the day of approval with the first cases being performed the following day. 
The early market acceptance has been impressive and we look forward to expanded adoption of this technology longer-term as the market continues to develop. 
Our Stent business was down 10% in Q4, which is within the range of recent experience. As we've said, pricing headwinds continue to drive down ASPs in this category. 
And to complete the category, sales in our vena cava filter line were flat in the fourth quarter. 
Now let's move to Urology. Total net sales were $217.8 million, which is up 8% versus the Q4 of last year on an as a reported basis, and 9% on a constant currency basis. About 600 points of this global growth was related to the Rochester acquisition, which anniversary-ed in the quarter. The United States business was up 6%, while internationally, we grew 14%. 
The Targeted Temperature Management products saw strong double-digit growth this quarter. And we remain optimistic about the long-term growth prospects of this technology platform. 
Our basic drainage business was up 7% in Q4, with about 400 points of that growth coming from the acquired Rochester medical products. 
IC Foleys were down 2% globally with the United States down 4%. These results in basic drainage are fairly consistent with recent quarters. While some surveys and reports have suggested improvement in the United States hospital volumes, we haven't seen any underlying improvement reflected here so far. 
Our continence business grew 24% over the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of the acquired products, our legacy continence products were down 6% for the quarter, within the range of recent experience. 
Sales in the urological specialties were up 11% with the emerging markets growing close to 40% organically in this category. Our brachytherapy products were down 3% globally for the quarter. 
And finally, sales from our catheter stabilization line decreased 3% in the fourth quarter. 
Now let's turn to Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $237.5 million, an increase of 8% over the fourth quarter last year on as a reported basis and 9% on a constant currency basis. Net sales in the United States were up 7%, while outside the United States, sales were up 15%. 
Our frontline was up 5% versus the fourth quarter of last year with significant growth coming from the emerging markets. 
PICC revenue growth was 11% in Q4 with strong performance again in the United States and internationally. Our Vascular Access ultrasound product line was up 8% this quarter. And our dialysis catheter business was up 11% in the fourth quarter. 
And we'll finish with Surgical Specialties. Net sales in this category were $145.0 million in the fourth quarter, up 3% on as-reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis. United States sales increased 4%, while international sales were up 6%. As you know, we anniversary the 2013 acquisition of Medafor on the first day of the fourth quarter. Our biosurgical product portfolio grew double digits organically in the quarter and we're excited about the long-term potential here. 
Sales from our biosurgical products already exceed the combined sales of our fixation products and our natural tissue products. 
Our soft tissue repair business grew 5% overall in the fourth quarter. Our total synthetic hernia products were up double digits again this quarter, while our natural tissue products declined 15%. 
Closing out the surgical category, our fixation business was down 3% in the fourth quarter and our performance irrigation business was down 14% versus an above average quarter a year ago. 
This concludes our product line revenue discussion. I'll now turn you over to John DeFord."

We launched over 40 new products and our pipeline of launches in 2015 is also robust. 
Starting with the drug-coated balloons. We're making good progress on additional sizes and indications worldwide. We're in the follow-up phase of our Levant 2 Japan study and we expect to submit late this year for Japan approval. Enrollment continues in our below the knee IDE and in-stent restenosis studies and we are making good progress in our AV access IDE study with enrollment anticipated to start mid-2015. 
We're also expanding the clinical science of DCBs through our robust real world clinical experience. For example, at LINC this week, Dr.  Marcus Steen [ph] presented the first look at interim one year results from the Lutonix global SFA and popliteal registry of almost 700 patients. Lesion LINCs were over 100 millimeters and treated LINCs were almost 200 millimeters, while roughly 30% of lesions were located in the popliteal artery.  Primary patency was 81.7% and 88.5% of patients were free from the re-intervention of 1 year. 
The randomized study designs are quite different, making comparison of results very difficult across different studies, registry has provided a more balanced comparison across technologies. And we believe these results compare well to any of the competitive DCBs. 
Also in Vascular, we launched the LifeStream balloon expandable covered stent in Europe in Q4 and enrollment is going well in the IDE study to support an iliac artery disease indication in the U.S. 
Finally in Vascular, we're responding to some FDA questions and anticipate U.S. launch in Q1 of the first in the series of new Tru-Flo PTA catheters for use in valvuloplasty procedures. Tru-Flo has a unique flow-through design to allow blood to pass through a large channel in center of the balloon, promoting prolonged inflation, while potentially reducing the need for rapid pacing or other hemodynamic maneuvers used to reduce cardiac output during the time the balloon has expanded. 
Next, moving to Urology. We've just begun the rollout of our new skyline sub 2 French stone [ph] basket family. This new product in our endourology line provides the urologists with one of the smallest baskets in the industry, yet provides high strength and maneuverability along with highly visible atraumatic tip to aid in safe and accurate use. 
In our Targeted Temperature Management portfolio, we've just launched our new PAD systems for use with neonates and pediatric patients in the U.S. And we're rolling out a new software update to support enhanced functionality and additional languages. 
Moving to Oncology. We are anticipating U.S. regulatory clearance and launch about mid-year of our free hand stereotactic system for Vascular Access named Pinpoint GT. The technology will initially be offered on a new Site-Rite aid system and a planned single simultaneous launch. Pinpoint GT will also be backwards compatible to Site-Rite 6. 
In PICC we're now tracking towards submission around mid-year of our first family of thromboresistant devices. We plan to broaden the offering to our full line of PICC over the back half of 2015 and into 2016. Similarly, we anticipate submitting our first antimicrobial PICC in the second half of 2015 and launching upon regulatory clearance. This first product will be followed by a series of launches to support coated PICC in both our PowerPICC and PowerPICC solo configurations. 
Turning to midlines. We're making good progress in our next-generation POWERGLIDE family and currently anticipate our U.S. regulatory submission in Q4 with the first half of 2016 launch. 
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery. We informed you on the last call that we just received U.S. regulatory clearance of the first antibiotic-coated biologic XenMatrix AB and I'm pleased to tell you that product was launched in December. XenMatrix AB utilizes our proprietary coding, which is intended to preserve the integrity of the biologic graft and abdominal wall reconstruction procedures and has demonstrated a broad spectrum of safety and efficacy against several typically encountered bacteria. 
Moving to our BioSurgery product family. In early Q3, we filed our PMA supplement for our Progel sealant, seeking expanded use in video-assisted and robot-assisted thoracic surgery. We continue to be optimistic about approval and launch in the first half of this year. 
Also, we completed a follow-up early this year in our vascular sealant pivotal IDE study. The team is working toward PMA submission in the first half of the year and we anticipate approval and launch in mid 2016. 
And finally  in mesh fixation, we remain on track to launch in the first half of the year our new spring-loaded resorbable tack device named OPTIFIX. We also anticipate launching another fixation platform later in the year. 
As Tim said, we have a very important year of execution ahead of us and we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. As part of our effort for continuous improvement, we initiated a survey of investors last year. And one of the more common suggestions we received was to take a fresh look at the need to hold a formal analyst meeting every year. We've been clear about our growth drivers and the opportunities we're pursuing and our investment strategy has not changed. Because of that, we've determined that the resource and time-intensive effort, like the formal analyst meeting, is just not justified this year. We'll update you on our pipeline and growth drivers throughout the year if circumstances allow in the appropriate forum. Thanks very much for your attention. Now I will hand the discussion over to Chris"
254131,281166647,751766,"CR Bard Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","C. R. Bard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Let me start by covering the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods.

Let me start by covering the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. We had acquisition-related items of $7.5 million pretax, mostly related to Lutonix milestone accretion and $10.1 million pretax charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives. We also booked expense of $12.7 million, related to the judges order in the women's health litigation that we work up 500 cases simultaneously. 
And finally, we had a credit of $3.5 million pretax related to the medical device excise tax paid in 2013 after reaching an agreement with the IRS. These items are detailed in the notes to the financial statements and the reconciliation accompanying our Q4 earnings press release. 
Now let's go to the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $547.7 million in Q4 and $547.4 million on an adjusted basis or 63.1% of sales, up 230 basis points from the prior year with 170 basis points of that improvement related to the Gore royalty and about 120 basis points coming from cost of goods sold. We also had about 50 basis points of benefit when compared to the higher integration cost and investments in Q4 of 2013. 
Some headwinds to GPC in Q4 were new amortization of about 50 basis points, foreign exchange at about 10 basis points and mix of about 20 basis points. Pricing pressure was about 100 basis points of headwind on the revenue line and about 30 basis points in GP in Q4. We continue to expect the pricing pressure going forward between 100 and 150 basis points on the revenue line. 
For the full year 2014, that brings adjusted gross profit as a percentage of sales to 62.1%, up 110 basis points from 2013, much better than our original guidance of 30 to 60 basis points of improvement. 
While the Gore royalty did exceed our expectations, the effect on GP was only 10 to 20 basis points higher than our projections from a year ago. The over achievement was primarily driven by more favorable mix than originally expected. 
SG&A expenses were $257.5 million for the quarter or 29.7% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was $261 million even or 30.1% sales, down 170 basis points from the prior year period, driven by the Gore royalty being in a denominator as well as improving leverage from our emerging markets investments and the integration of our 2013 acquisitions. 
For the full year 2014, adjusted SG&A percentage of sales was 29.6%, a decrease of 40 basis points from the prior year. R&D expenditures totaled $79.2 million for the fourth quarter or 9.1% of sales. On an adjusted basis, R&D expense was $71.5 million or 8.2% of sales, a decrease of 70 basis points from the prior year period, mostly driven by the Gore royalty now in the denominator. 
For the full year 2014 on an adjusted basis, R&D expense was 8% of sales compared to 8.5% in 2013. However, without the Gore royalty and the revenue line, R&D expense would've been 8.4% of sales in 2014. 
Interest expense was $11.2 million for the fourth quarter and $44.8 million for the full year. Other income expense was $25.1 million of expense for the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, it was $2.2 million of expense for the quarter and $4.7 million of income for the full year. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.2%. On an adjusted basis, it was 21.1%, taking us to 24.3% for the full year. The quarter was lower than the full year average due to the renewal of the R&D tax credit in December. 
At the beginning of the year, we had told you to expect about 100 basis points of improvement in the effective tax rate in 2014 and we came in at 90 basis points of improvement, despite significantly stronger U.S. income than we had anticipated. That all adds up to cash EPS of $2.29 for Q4, excluding items affecting comparability, which brings us in at $8.40 for the full year on a same basis. That's a full $0.10 above the high end of our original guidance for the year and above our updated guidance as well, indicative of the strong performance we saw in 2014. 
We purchased about 785,000 shares of the company's stock during the fourth quarter, taking the total buybacks in 2014 to approximately 4.5 million shares at an average price of $146.67. Between buybacks and dividends, we returned approximately $725 million to shareholders over the course of 2014. 
The balance sheet as of December 31 reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1.01 billion versus $1.04 billion at September 30th. For the full year, AR days were down 7.3 days and inventory days were up 0.2 days. Capital expenditures totaled $36.6 million for the quarter and $126.6 million for the year. 
On the liability side, total debt was $1.5 billion as of December 31 versus $1.4 billion at September 30. Debt to total capital at the end of the fourth quarter was about 45% and total shareholder investment was $1.8 billion at December 31. 
So with a strong 2014 now in the books, let's turn to the financial guidance for 2015, excluding the impact of items that affect comparability. For revenue, we project 2015 constant currency organic revenue growth between 4% and 5%. Given the potential variability of the Gore royalty, our overall constant currency guidance is between 3% and 5%. As Tim said, this assumes no fundamental improvement in the market growth rates from where they have been the last couple of years, which we would characterize as low single digits. If the markets improve, as some suggest, then we would expect to do better. But with all of the uncertainties surrounding us, we believe it's too early to count on any improvement in the underlying markets. 
Obviously, foreign exchange rates are significant headwind for everyone as we head into 2015 and we are certainly not immune to that. We estimate that at current rates, we're looking at revenue headwind related to currency of about 3%. 
As far as constant currency revenue growth in our 4 disease state categories, in 2015, we expect Vascular revenue growth to be between 3% and 7%; urology to be between 1% and 4%; Oncology to grow between 3% and 6%; and our Surgical Specialties business to grow between 3% and 6% as well. We expect our overall gross margin percent to decline in 2015 by between 30 and 70 basis points compared to 2014. That reflects about 50 basis points of pressure from FX and about 20 basis points of incremental amortization from the U.S. approval of Lutonix in October of 2014. 
Pricing pressure continues to be a significant issue for us. And we estimate the impact on 2015 to be between 40 and 60 basis points of headwind to GP. Fortunately, our cost improvement programs are projected to once again contribute about 50 basis points of benefits to GP and we expect mix to be favorable between 20 to 40 basis points. 
So organic constant currency gross margins are expected to improve in 2014 as we projected, when we first introduced our strategic investment plan 2 years ago. And again, as we said, we expect to see improving operating leverage in 2015. While we continue to increase investments in emerging markets, we expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to decline between 50 and 100 basis points in 2015. And we expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the mid-7% range, both excluding items that affect the comparability. We expect interest expense in 2015 to be between $45 million and $47 million. We expect the effective tax rate to improve again, this time, between 0 and 50 basis points for the full year and this does assume the renewal of the R&D tax credit for 2015. 
All of that adds up to adjusted cash at 2015, excluding items that affect comparability between $8.95 and $9.05 per share. That includes a negative currency impact of about $0.25 based on today's rates. So without this very atypical currency situation, we would have been forecasting at or above our target of 10% GPS growth. 
While we evaluate alternatives that could increase earnings for 2015, given the expected FX magnitude and the fact that this is not a Bard specific issue, we don't think it would be wise for short-term benefits to scale back investments and possibly interrupt the momentum in organic growth that we achieved during 2014. 
In the end, we believe that maintaining our flexibility and continuing to focus on the longer-term organic growth profile of the company builds better value for our shareholders. 
In Q1, we expect constant currency sales growth between 4% and 5% and adjusted cash EPS between $2.04 and $2.08. As for capital expenditures, we expect 2015 to be similar to 2014, between $120 million and $140 million. And we expect operating cash flow to be in the $700 million range, again in 2015. 
I'd like to conclude my comments by reminding you that the objective of our strategy is to position Bard of from a portfolio standpoint to deliver above market revenue growth for years to come. The key measure of success for this transition plan will be the improvement in the organic engine. This plan was never about maximizing EPS in a given year, but the strength of the business for the long-term in a disciplined and thoughtful way. We believe that we are doing that. While we expect further improvement in our operating margins in 2015, we intend to remain in investment mode with the desired outcome of positioning the company for long-term success to enhance shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Tim"

Obviously, the market's volatility and especially as you grow into more and varied geographies, the market growth rates can be even more complex. We, as we stated, don't anticipate any change in the external environment for this year. If this happens, we'll do better than that. We stated a couple of years ago that our goal was to be 200 to 300 basis points above what the market growth rate was and the competitive aspect of that within the sector. That would still be our goal. We're big believers that sustainable revenue growth drives shareholder value and that's what we're about. So we remain fixated on that as a strategic objective. We do think that there's a lot of leverage for us with the investments we made in some of the emerging markets. Just to put in perspective, that represents almost 1/3 of our total sales headcount but as we mentioned, 9% of revenue. So we think there's a lot of room to grow into that. And those markets are growing clearly above what we called out as the market average in total. So to the extent we can accelerate growth in those segments that are growing faster, we should continue the momentum that we demonstrated last year."

I guess, what's really interesting is in the period CR Bard was decelerating, there was this commentary that utilization was one of the factors. And what's really fascinating is on the acceleration, your underlying growth this quarter was 4.5% that puts you well above peers' underlying growth rate. And you're not doing it with contribution from Foley and some of the key utilization sensitive markets. So it looks like frankly some good old-fashioned not market driven. So market obviously is upside. So Tim as you sort of think about the underlying business performance, where you think the 2 or 3 areas that you feel most confident last 2 years have driven that underlying performance, given it doesn't appear to come from the market at all?"

Clearly, the underlying market growth rates in emerging markets are faster than the total average, probably closer to a double-digit kind of growth rate underlying underlying market growth rates. The acquisitions that we've made over the last several years were all of this platforms here for us to invest in because those were faster growing segments. And then the R&D segments that we've made across the board have also been faster growing segments. So as we execute and those things start to pay off and come to fruition, the plan called for the growth rates to be higher and that's what you're seeing.

We think that's still possible probably later in the year, just based on the way enrollments are going on right now. And in-stent restenosis indication, there is another one that we -- I want to hold back a little bit on that. We talked a little bit about it in 2017, late 2017 kind of time frame in the past. But we're trying to see where we can get information and more data that could give us other opportunities. So I don't want to commit to anything at this point. But there are ways out for indications. Now as far as the publication goes, I can tell you no one is more frustrated at the timing than I am. But this is purely something that's not within our control. As we understand it, the author's investigators have the manuscript on the rent you with the journal. It's not within our control as much as I'd like it to be.

First, off, I think were trying to track inpatient versus outpatient use. We don't have great visibility to that, frankly. But we believe that this is primarily outpatient use, which is typical for SFA kind of procedures. So we think that's probably sort of in the 60% range or so. On the reimbursement, we think it is an issue. There are certainly -- certain value conscious buyers that would be holding off until they hear more about reimbursement. Obviously, we're getting picked up in spite of that at this stage. But there are, as John mentioned earlier, for reimbursement. And there's the outpatient reimbursement piece, which CMS, there's really no official time line. They can work within whatever they want. We think in April time frame is a reasonable. Again, CMS is not obligated to work within that time frame. But typically, sort of a couple of cycles of review is common. And we are in that time period from when we submitted our documentation to CMS last fall. Now as far as the inpatient piece goes, I just saw today, actually on the CMS website, the agenda for a meeting next week at town hall meeting where drug-coated balloons will be reviewed and I think that's the last step, as my understanding, at least, the last public step in the review process for the inpatient piece. But remember, inpatient only receives the approval or changes one time a year, which is typically the October time frame. So John alluded to the Q4 inpatient time period, which is what we think it would be sort of the reasonable customary time frame. But again, CMS is not obligated to work with any of that."

I'd like to welcome, everybody, to Bard's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call, and thank all of you for taking the time to join us today. I would expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 35 minutes or so.
The agenda today will go as follows. I'll begin with an overview of the results for the fourth quarter. John Weiland, our President and COO, will review our fourth quarter product line revenue. John DeFord, our Senior VP of Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you an update on our product development pipeline. And then Chris Holland, our Senior VP and CFO, will review the fourth quarter income statement balance sheet and also provide our financial guidance for 2015. And then finally, we'll wrap it up with Q&A. 
Fourth quarter 2014 net sales totaled $867.2 million, that's up 10% over Q4 last year on an as-reported basis and up 11% on a constant currency basis. The currency impact for the quarter versus the same quarter of 2013 was unfavorable by about 140 basis points.
The Gore royalty revenue in the quarter was approximately $38.6 million. The impact of the divestiture of our EP business, which occurred in Q4 2013, net of the impact of the Rochester Medical acquisition in the same quarter, was unfavorable by about 20 basis points to growth for the quarter. That all puts our organic growth rate for Q4 2014 at approximately 6.3%, with a little over 200 basis points from the early approval and launch of the Lutonix drug-coated PTA balloon in the U.S.
Net sales for the full year 2014 were $3.3 billion, that's up 9% as reported and on a constant currency basis, which exceeded our original guidance for the year. Net income for the fourth quarter was $134.2 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.72. I will remind you that we recognized the onetime gain from the Gore litigation in the prior year quarter. Excluding this and other items that affected the comparability results between periods, which Chris will cover later, fourth quarter 2014 net income and diluted cash earnings per share, which excludes amortization of intangibles, were $158.9 million and $2.29, that's up 39% and 40%, respectively.
Full year 2014 net income was $294.5 million and diluted EPS was $3.76. Excluding items again that affect comparability between periods, full year 2014 net income was $586 million and diluted cash EPS were $8.40, and that's up 23% and 29%, respectively, from 2013. Again, well in excess of our original guidance for the year.
Looking at fourth quarter revenue growth geographically compared to the prior year, on a constant currency basis, net sales in the U.S. grew 14%. Internationally, we grew 5%, with Europe up 3%; Japan up 2% and our other international geographies up 8%. Excluding the Gore royalty and EP divestiture impact, net sales in the U.S. grew 7% and total international sales were up 10%, with Europe up 10%; Japan up 3%; and the remaining geographies up 11%.
As anticipated in our strategic investment plan, our emerging market sales continued to increase and represented about 9% of our total revenue in Q4. Looking back in 2014, we're pleased with the progress that we've made throughout the year. 2 years ago, to remind you, we introduced our 3-year strategic investment plan and then on that same quarter, our organic growth rate was flat. We finished 2014 with our organic growth rate of our other portfolio in the mid-single digits, which is what we had projected. It's difficult to know precisely what's happening in real time in the underlying markets, but we believe the market organic growth continues to be in the low single digits. While many in our sector had stronger growth in Q3 than expected, some of those same companies then saw sequential deceleration of growth in Q4. In contrast, we continue to see sequential improvement on organic growth rate. And we believe that the implementation and execution of our strategic investment planning contributed to this acceleration.
As we look to 2015, we expect the full year organic growth rate to again improve over the full year 2014. And to be clear, that assumes no benefit from any underlying market improvement. If the market improves as some are suggesting, then we should do even better than that.
2015 is an important year of execution, once again, for us. We expect our investments in emerging markets to continue to shift the mix of the portfolio of faster growing geographies. The key to this initiative is improved productivity from the teams that we've built and additional product registrations in these markets.
In 2015, we also anticipate we'll begin to see some returns from our R&D investments. Over the past couple of years, we significantly increased the level of R&D as we pursued expanded indications of current product platforms and introductions of new technologies. We remain in investment mode. The long-term objective is to drive above market revenue growth with a lower risk profile on a sustainable basis. There obviously remains significant uncertainty in the market, including unsettled issues in Washington. FX headwinds at this magnitude, frankly, are as difficult and come up as quick as we've seen in years. The market acceptance, reimbursement decisions, competitive response from drug-coated balloons in the U.S. could have a meaningful impact in our results. And we have no way of knowing whether Gore royalty will increase, decrease or be consistent compared to 2014 levels.
However, amidst these uncertainties, we remain focused on the execution of our strategic plan and the things we can control. We believe our investments will improve the organic engine of the company in both revenue and profitability. And as we said, we measure success over the long term. If 2015 brings some tailwinds in the market as some suggest, we would look for opportunities to invest any short-term out-performance back into the business for longer-term benefit.
Chris will give you more details when he lays out our financial guidance. We continue to believe that the effective execution of our strategic investment plan will allow us to continue to increase shareholder value over the long term and on a sustainable basis.
With that as an introduction, let me turn you over to John Weiland for a review of our fourth quarter product line revenue."

Before I start, as usual, I will be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. So let's start with Vascular. Total net sales in this category for the quarter were $244.6 million, an increase of 19% on an as-reported basis and 22% on a constant currency basis when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Excluding the Gore royalty and the impact of the EP divestiture, global Vascular sales were up 9%, with the United States business up 14% for the quarter and international up 3%. Sales in our Vascular graft category were down 6% in Q4.
Excluding the Gore royalty, our Endovascular business grew 11% in the fourth quarter. Within Endovascular, our biopsy line was up 1%.
Our peripheral PTA products were up 49% this quarter, driven by the early FDA approval of the Lutonix drug-coated balloon in the United States on October 10. We're extremely pleased with how our Vascular sales, development and operations team executed the early launch of this first-of-a-kind product in the United States. As you know, we were shipping product to customers on the day of approval with the first cases being performed the following day.
The early market acceptance has been impressive and we look forward to expanded adoption of this technology longer term as the market continues to develop.
Our Stent business was down 10% in Q4, which is within the range of recent experience. As we've said, pricing headwinds continue to drive down ASPs in this category.
And to complete the category, sales in our vena cava filter line were flat in the fourth quarter.
Now let's move to Urology. Total net sales were $217.8 million, which is up 8% versus the Q4 of last year on an as-reported basis, and 9% on a constant currency basis. About 600 points of this global growth was related to the Rochester acquisition, which anniversary-ed in the quarter. The United States business was up 6%, while internationally, we grew 14%.
The Targeted Temperature Management products saw strong double-digit growth this quarter, and we remain optimistic about the long-term growth prospects of this technology platform.
Our basic drainage business was up 7% in Q4, with about 400 points of that growth coming from the acquired Rochester Medical products. 
I.C. Foleys were down 2% globally, with the United States down 4%. These results in basic drainage are fairly consistent with recent quarters. While some surveys and reports have suggested improvement in the United States hospital volumes, we haven't seen any underlying improvement reflected here so far.
Our continence business grew 24% over the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of the acquired products, our legacy continence products were down 6% for the quarter, within the range of recent experience.
Sales in urological specialties were up 11% with emerging markets growing close to 40% organically in this category. Our brachytherapy products were down 3% globally for the quarter.
And finally, sales from our StatLock catheter stabilization line decreased 3% in the fourth quarter.
Now let's turn to Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $237.5 million, an increase of 8% over the fourth quarter last year on as a reported basis and 9% on a constant currency basis. Net sales in the United States were up 7%, while outside the United States sales were up 15%.
Our port line was up 5% versus the fourth quarter of last year with significant growth coming from emerging markets.
PICC revenue growth was 11% in Q4 with strong performance again in the United States and internationally. Our vascular access ultrasound product line was up 8% this quarter. And our dialysis catheter business was up 11% in the fourth quarter.
And we'll finish with Surgical Specialties. Net sales in this category were $145.0 million in the fourth quarter, up 3% on an as-reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis. United States sales increased 4%, while international sales were up 6%. As you know, we anniversary-ed the 2013 acquisition of Medafor on the first day of the fourth quarter. Our biosurgical product portfolio grew double digits organically in the quarter, and we're excited about the long-term potential here.
Sales from our biosurgical products already exceed the combined sales of our fixation products and our natural tissue products.
Our soft tissue repair business grew 5% overall in the fourth quarter. Our total synthetic hernia products were up double digits again this quarter, while our natural tissue products declined 15%.
Closing out the surgical category, our fixation business was down 3% in the fourth quarter and our performance irrigation business was down 14% versus an above average quarter 1 year ago.
This concludes our product line revenue discussion. I'll now turn you over to John DeFord."

We launched over 40 new products and our pipeline of launches in 2015 is also robust.
Starting with drug-coated balloons. We're making good progress on additional sizes and indications worldwide. We're in the follow-up phase of our Levant 2 Japan study and we expect to submit late this year for Japan approval. Enrollment continues in our Below the Knee IDE and in-stent restenosis studies and we are making good progress in our AV access IDE study with enrollment anticipated to start mid-2015.
We're also expanding the clinical science of DCBs through our robust real world clinical experience. For example, at LINC this week, Dr. Markus Stein presented the first look at interim 1 year results from the Lutonix global SFA and popliteal registry of almost 700 patients. Lesion lengths were over 100 millimeters and treated lengths were almost 200 millimeters, while roughly 30% of lesions were located in the popliteal artery. Primary patency was 81.7% and 88.5% of patients were free from a re-intervention at 1 year.
The randomized study designs are quite different, making comparison of results very difficult across different studies. Registry has provided a more balanced comparison across technologies, and we believe these results compare well to any of the competitive DCBs.
Also in Vascular, we launched the LifeStream Balloon Expandable Covered Stent in Europe in Q4 and enrollment is going well in the IDE study to support an iliac artery disease indication in the U.S.
Finally in Vascular, we're responding to some FDA questions and anticipate U.S. launch in Q1 of the first in the series of new Tru-Flo PTA Catheters for use in valvuloplasty procedures. Tru-Flo has a unique flow-through design to allow blood to pass through a large channel in center of the balloon, promoting prolonged inflation, while potentially reducing the need for rapid pacing or other hemodynamic maneuvers used to reduce cardiac output during the time the balloon has expanded.
Next, moving to Urology. We've just begun the rollout of our new skyline sub 2 per inch stone basket family. This new product in our endourology line provides the urologists with one of the smallest baskets in the industry that provides high strength and maneuverability, along with a highly visible atraumatic tip to aid in safe and accurate use.
In our Targeted Temperature Management portfolio, we've just launched our new PAD systems for use with neonates and pediatric patients in the U.S. And we're rolling out a new software update to support enhanced functionality and additional languages.
Moving to Oncology. We're anticipating U.S. regulatory clearance and launch about midyear of our freehand stereotactic system for Vascular Access named Pinpoint GT. The technology will initially be offered on a new Site-Rite 8 system in a planned simultaneous launch. Pinpoint GT will also be backwards compatible to Site-Rite 6.
In PICCs, we're now tracking towards submission around midyear of our first family of thromboresistant devices. We plan to broaden the offering to our full line of PICCs over the back half of 2015 and into 2016. Similarly, we anticipate submitting our first antimicrobial PICC in the second half of 2015 and launching upon regulatory clearance. This first product will be followed by a series of launches to support coated PICCs in both our PowerPICC and PowerPICC SOLO configurations.
Turning to midlines. We're making good progress in our next-generation POWERGLIDE family and currently anticipate our U.S. regulatory submission in Q4 with the first half 2016 launch.
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery. We informed you on the last call that we just received U.S. regulatory clearance of the first antibiotic-coated biologic mesh, XenMatrix AB, and I'm pleased to tell you that product was launched in December. XenMatrix AB utilizes our proprietary coding, which is intended to preserve the integrity of the biologic graft in abdominal wall reconstruction procedures and has demonstrated broad spectrum safety and efficacy against several typically-encountered bacteria.
Moving to our BioSurgery product family. In early Q3, we filed our PMA supplement for our Progel sealant, seeking expanded use in video-assisted and robot-assisted thoracic surgery. We continue to be optimistic about approval and launch in the first half of this year.
Also, we completed a follow-up early this year in our TRIDYNE vascular sealant pivotal IDE study. The team is working toward PMA submission in the first half of the year and we anticipate approval and launch in mid-2016.
And finally, in mesh fixation, we remain on track to launch in the first half of the year, our new spring-loaded resorbable tack device named OPTIFIX. We also anticipate launching another fixation platform later in the year.
As Tim said, we have a very important year of execution ahead of us and we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. As part of our effort for continuous improvement, we initiated a survey of investors last year. And one of the more common suggestions we received was to take a fresh look at the need to hold a formal analyst meeting every year. We've been clear about our growth drivers and the opportunities we're pursuing and our investment strategy has not changed. Because of that, we have determined that a resource and time-intensive effort, like a formal analyst meeting, is just not justified this year. We'll update you on our pipeline and growth drivers throughout the year if circumstances allow in the appropriate forum. Thanks very much for your attention. Now I will hand the discussion over to Chris."
254131,281166647,752054,"CR Bard Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","C. R. Bard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Let me start by covering the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods.

Let me start by covering the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. We had acquisition-related items of $7.5 million pretax, mostly related to Lutonix milestone accretion and a $10.1 million pretax charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives. We also booked expense of $12.7 million, related to the judges order in the women's health litigation that we work up 500 cases simultaneously.
And finally, we had a credit of $3.5 million pretax related to the medical device excise tax paid in 2013 after reaching an agreement with the IRS. These items are detailed in the notes to the financial statements and the reconciliation accompanying our Q4 earnings press release.
Now let's go to the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $547.7 million in Q4 and $547.4 million on an adjusted basis or 63.1% of sales, up 230 basis points from the prior year, with 170 basis points of that improvement related to the Gore royalty and about 120 basis points coming from cost improvements. We also had about 50 basis points of benefit when compared to the higher integration costs and investments in Q4 of 2013.
Some headwinds to GPs in Q4 were new amortization of about 50 basis points, foreign exchange at about 10 basis points and mix of about 20 basis points. Pricing pressure was about 100 basis points of headwind on the revenue line and about 30 basis points in GP in Q4. We continue to expect the pricing pressure going forward between 100 and 150 basis points on the revenue line.
For the full year 2014, that brings adjusted gross profit as a percentage of sales to 62.1%, up 110 basis points from 2013, much better than our original guidance of 30 to 60 basis points of improvement.
While the Gore royalty did exceed our expectations, the effect on GP was only 10 to 20 basis points higher than our projections from 1 year ago. The overachievement was primarily driven by more favorable mix than originally expected.
SG&A expenses were $257.5 million for the quarter or 29.7% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was $261 million even or 30.1% of sales, down 170 basis points from the prior year period, driven by the Gore royalty being in the denominator as well as improving leverage from our emerging markets investments and the integration of our 2013 acquisitions.
For the full year 2014, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales was 29.6%, a decrease of 40 basis points from the prior year. R&D expenditures totaled $79.2 million for the fourth quarter or 9.1% of sales. On an adjusted basis, R&D expense was $71.5 million or 8.2% of sales, a decrease of 70 basis points from the prior year period, mostly driven by the Gore royalty now in the denominator.
For the full year of 2014 on an adjusted basis, R&D expense was 8% of sales compared to 8.5% in 2013. However, without the Gore royalty and the revenue line, R&D expense would've been 8.4% of sales in 2014.
Interest expense was $11.2 million for the fourth quarter and $44.8 million for the full year. Other income and expense was $25.1 million of expense for the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, it was $2.2 million of expense for the quarter and $4.7 million of income for the full year.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.2%. On an adjusted basis, it was 21.1%, taking us to 24.3% for the full year. The quarter was lower than the full year average due to the renewal of the R&D tax credit in December.
At the beginning of the year, we had told you to expect about 100 basis points of improvement in the effective tax rate in 2014 and we came in at 90 basis points of improvement, despite significantly stronger U.S. income than we had anticipated. That all adds up to cash EPS of $2.29 for Q4, excluding items affecting comparability, which brings us in at $8.40 for the full year on the same basis. That's a full $0.10 above the high end of our original guidance for the year and above our updated guidance as well, indicative of the strong performance we saw in 2014.
We purchased about 785,000 shares of the company's stock during the fourth quarter, taking the total buybacks in 2014 to approximately 4.5 million shares at an average price of $146.67. Between buybacks and dividends, we returned approximately $725 million to shareholders over the course of 2014.
The balance sheet as of December 31 reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1.01 billion versus $1.04 billion at September 30. For the full year, AR days were down 7.3 days and inventory days were up 0.2 days. Capital expenditures totaled $36.6 million for the quarter and $126.6 million for the year.
On the liability side, total debt was $1.5 billion as of December 31 versus $1.4 billion at September 30. Debt to total capital at the end of the fourth quarter was about 45% and total shareholder investment was $1.8 billion at December 31.
So with the strong 2014 now in the books, let's turn to financial guidance for 2015, excluding the impact of items that affect comparability. For revenue, we project 2015 constant currency organic revenue growth between 4% and 5%. Given the potential variability of the Gore royalty, our overall constant currency revenue guidance is between 3% and 5%. As Tim said, this assumes no fundamental improvement in the market growth rates from where they have been the last couple of years, which we would characterize as low single digits. If the markets improve as some suggest, then we would expect to do better. But with all of the uncertainties surrounding us, we think it's too early to count on any improvement in the underlying markets.
Obviously, foreign exchange rates are significant headwind for everyone as we head into 2015 and we are certainly not immune to that. We estimate that at current rates, we're looking at a revenue headwind related to currency of about 3%.
As far as constant currency revenue growth in our 4 disease state categories, in 2015, we expect Vascular revenue growth to be between 3% and 7%; Urology to be between 1% and 4%; Oncology to grow between 3% and 6%; and our Surgical Specialties business to grow between 3% and 6% as well. We expect our overall gross margin percent to decline in 2015 by between 30 and 70 basis points compared to 2014. That reflects about 50 basis points of pressure from FX and about 30 basis points of incremental amortization from the U.S. approval of Lutonix in October of 2014.
Pricing pressure continues to be a significant issue for us. And we estimate the impact on 2015 to be between 40 and 60 basis points of headwind to GP. Fortunately, our cost improvement programs are projected to once again contribute about 50 basis points of benefits to GP and we expect mix to be favorable between 20 to 40 basis points.
So organic constant currency gross margins are expected to improve in 2014 as we projected when we first introduced our strategic investment plan 2 years ago. And again, as we said, we expect to see improving operating leverage in 2015. While we continue to increase investment in emerging markets, we expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to decline between 50 and 100 basis points in 2015. And we expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the mid-7% range, both excluding items that affect comparability. We expect interest expense in 2015 to be between $45 million and $47 million. We expect the effective tax rate to improve again, this time, between 0 and 50 basis points for the full year and this does assume the renewal of the R&D tax credit for 2015.
All of that adds up to adjusted cash EPS for 2015, excluding items that affect comparability between $8.95 and $9.05 per share. That includes a negative currency impact of about $0.25 based on today's rates. So without this very atypical currency situation, we would have been forecasting at or above our target of 10% EPS growth.
While we evaluated alternatives that could increase earnings for 2015, given the expected FX magnitude and the fact that this is certainly not a Bard-specific issue, we don't think it would be wise for a short-term benefit to scale back investments and possibly interrupt the momentum in organic growth that we achieved during 2014.
In the end, we believe maintaining our flexibility and continuing to focus on the longer-term organic growth profile of the company builds better value for our shareholders.
In Q1, we expect constant currency sales growth between 4% and 5% and adjusted cash EPS between $2.04 and $2.08. As for capital expenditures, we expect 2015 to be similar to 2014, between $120 million and $140 million. And we expect operating cash flow to be in the $700 million range again in 2015.
I'd like to conclude my comments by reminding you that the objective of our strategy is to position Bard from a portfolio standpoint to deliver above market revenue growth for years to come. The key measure of success for this transition plan will be the improvement in the organic engine. This plan was never about maximizing EPS in a given year, but the strength in the business for the long-term in a disciplined and thoughtful way. We believe we are doing that. While we expect further improvement in our operating margins in 2015, we intend to remain in investment mode with the desired outcome of positioning the company for long-term success to enhance shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Tim."

Obviously, the market's volatile and especially as you grow into more and varied geographies, the underlying market growth rates can be even more complex. We, as we stated, don't anticipate any change in the external environment for this year. If it happens, we'll do better than that. We stated a couple of years ago that our goal was to be 200 to 300 basis points above what the market growth rate was and the competitive aspect of that within the sector. That would still be our goal. We're big believers that sustainable revenue growth drives shareholder value and that's what we're about. So we remain fixated on that as a strategic objective. We do think that there's a lot of leverage for us with the investments we've made in some of the emerging markets. Just to put in perspective, that represents almost 1/3 of our total sales headcount but as we mentioned, 9% of revenue. So we think there's a lot of room to grow into that. And those markets are growing clearly above what we called out as the market average in total. So to the extent we can accelerate growth in those segments that are growing faster, we should continue the momentum that we demonstrated last year."

I think first of all, our team did an excellent job preparing for this launch literally over the last year in great detail. And I'd evidence that by the comments that we made where we had approval on a Friday, we were shipping that Friday, and our first case was done on Saturday. And I think that the knowledge base of physicians in the United States and anticipation of the technology was significant. And I think that our team has done an excellent job helping to continue educate physicians since the October launch. We have 2 thresholds for payment reimbursement changes potentially in the second quarter and fourth quarter, one for inpatient and one for outpatient. All of our submissions are in the CMS at this point in time. And we'll see what develops there. We have no reason to believe that they're not looking at this very favorably at this point in time. In terms of market size, the -- we had already said that the European market was about $80 million. That's not changed substantially. And we could all take a -- have a pull on what the United States will end up at, at the end of 2015. We're certainly working hard to make it as large as we possibly can. But I think that will be a wildcard, and we'll see how the whole market develops now that a competitor is approved as well."

And the objective, as we look at the model, is to drive 50 to 100 basis points of operating margin improvement annually. So we're making a nice downpayment on returning to those levels in '15. That will be the objective again in '16 and the objective for several years. So we feel good about the trajectory. Again, the portfolio moves that just lowered the jumping off point, we believe, were absolutely the right things to do for the company.

Again, we don't think there's a level of upside that again moves the guidance, which is why it's still at 5% rounded on the high end. It certainly could continue at the current level, or as we've always said, it could decline. It's absolutely out of our control. And as we have said and we'll repeat again now, we don't have any information that leads us to believe that it will decline. But we wait, and on a quarterly basis, understand what sales were and what the royalties were. So we're trying to be prudent and make commitments to you guys that we can deliver on within a range of scenarios. And certainly, as we think about potential upside, we're giving you bottom line commitments that we're committed to delivering. We'd certainly like the ability to reinvest any upside back into the business while still delivering bottom line commitments. So we're trying to take in what we think are the likely scenarios and then make commitments that we're going to hit within those scenarios."

First off, I think we're trying to track inpatient versus outpatient use. We don't have great visibility to that, frankly. But we believe that this is primarily outpatient use, which is typical for SFA popliteal kind of procedures. So we think that's probably sort of in the 60% range or so. On reimbursement, we think it is an issue. There are certainly certain value-conscious buyers that would be holding off until they hear more about reimbursement. Obviously, we're getting pickup in spite of that at this stage. But there are, as John mentioned earlier, 2 paths for reimbursement. And there's the outpatient reimbursement piece, which CMS, there's really no official time line. They can work within whatever they want. We think an April time frame is reasonable. Again, CMS is not obligated to work within that time frame. But typically, sort of a couple of cycles of review is common. And we're in that time period from when we submitted our documentation to CMS last fall. Now as far as the inpatient piece goes, I just saw today, actually, on the CMS website the agenda for a meeting next week, a town hall meeting where drug-coated balloons will be reviewed. And I think that's the last step, as my understanding, at least, the last public step in the review process for the inpatient piece. But remember, inpatient only receives the approval or changes one time a year, which is typically the October time frame. So John alluded to the Q4 inpatient time period, which is what we think would be sort of the reasonable customary time frame. But again, CMS is not obligated to work within any of that."

I'd like to welcome, everybody, to Bard's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call, and thank all of you for taking the time to join us today. I would expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 35 minutes or so.
The agenda today will go as follows. I'll begin with an overview of the results for the fourth quarter. John Weiland, our President and COO, will review fourth quarter product line revenue. John DeFord, our Senior VP of Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you an update on our product development pipeline. And then Chris Holland, our Senior VP and CFO, will review the fourth quarter income statement balance sheet and also provide our financial guidance for 2015. And then finally, we'll wrap it up with Q&A. 
Fourth quarter 2014 net sales totaled $867.2 million, that's up 10% over Q4 last year on an as-reported basis and up 11% on a constant currency basis. The currency impact for the quarter versus the same quarter of 2013 was unfavorable by about 140 basis points.
The Gore royalty revenue in the quarter was approximately $38.6 million. The impact of the divestiture of our EP business, which occurred in Q4 2013, net of the impact of the Rochester Medical acquisition in the same quarter, was unfavorable by about 20 basis points to growth for the quarter. That all puts our organic growth rate for Q4 2014 at approximately 6.3%, with a little over 200 basis points from the early approval and launch of the Lutonix drug-coated PTA balloon in the U.S.
Net sales for the full year 2014 were $3.3 billion, that's up 9% as reported and on a constant currency basis, which exceeded our original guidance for the year. Net income for the fourth quarter was $134.2 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.72. I'll remind you that we recognized the onetime gain from the Gore litigation in the prior year quarter. Excluding this and other items that affected the comparability results between periods, which Chris will cover later, fourth quarter 2014 net income and diluted cash earnings per share, which excludes amortization of intangibles, were $158.9 million and $2.29, that's up 39% and 40%, respectively.
Full year 2014 net income was $294.5 million and diluted EPS were $3.76. Excluding items again that affect comparability between periods, full year 2014 net income was $586 million and diluted cash EPS were $8.40, and that's up 23% and 29%, respectively, from 2013. Again, well in excess of our original guidance for the year.
Looking at fourth quarter revenue growth geographically compared to the prior year, on a constant currency basis, net sales in the U.S. grew 14%. Internationally, we grew 5%, with Europe up 3%; Japan up 2% and our other international geographies up 8%. Excluding the Gore royalty and the EP divestiture impact, net sales in the U.S. grew 7% and total international sales were up 10%, with Europe up 10%; Japan up 3%; and the remaining geographies up 11%.
As anticipated in our strategic investment plan, our emerging market sales continued to increase and represented about 9% of our total revenue in Q4. Looking back on 2014, we're pleased with the progress that we've made throughout the year. 2 years ago, to remind you, we introduced our 3-year strategic investment plan and then that same quarter, our organic growth rate was flat. We finished 2014 with our organic growth rate of our other portfolio in the mid single digits, which is what we had projected. It's difficult to know precisely what's happening in real time in the underlying markets, but we believe the market organic growth continues to be in the low single digits. While many in our sector had stronger growth in Q3 than expected, some of those same companies then saw sequential deceleration of growth in Q4. In contrast, we continue to see sequential improvement on organic growth rate. And we believe the implementation and execution of our strategic investment planning contributed to this acceleration.
As we look to 2015, we expect the full year organic growth rate to again improve over the full year 2014. And to be clear, that assumes no benefit from any underlying market improvement. If the market improves as some are suggesting, then we should do even better than that.
2015 is an important year of execution, once again, for us. We expect our investments in emerging markets to continue to shift the mix of the portfolio of faster growing geographies. The key to this initiative is improved productivity from the teams that we've built and additional product registrations in these markets.
In 2015, we also anticipate we'll begin to see some returns from our R&D investments. Over the past couple of years, we've significantly increased the level of R&D as we pursued expanded indications of current product platforms and introductions of new technologies. We remain in investment mode. The long-term objective is to drive above market revenue growth with a lower risk profile on a sustainable basis. There obviously remains significant uncertainty in the market, including unsettled issues in Washington. FX headwinds at this magnitude, frankly, are as difficult and come up as quick as we've seen in years. The market acceptance, reimbursement decisions, competitive response around drug-coated balloons in the U.S. could have meaningful impact on our results. And we have no way of knowing whether Gore royalty will increase, decrease or be consistent compared to 2014 levels.
However, amidst these uncertainties, we remain focused on the execution of our strategic plan and the things we can control. We believe our investments will improve the organic engine of the company in both revenue and profitability. And as we said, we measure success over the long term. If 2015 brings some tailwinds to the market as some suggest, we would look for opportunities to invest any short-term out-performance back into the business for longer-term benefit.
Chris will give you more details when he lays out our financial guidance. We continue to believe that the effective execution of our strategic investment plan will allow us to continue to increase shareholder value over the long term and on a sustainable basis.
With that as an introduction, let me turn you over to John Weiland for a review of our fourth quarter product line revenue."

Before I start, as usual, I will be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. So let's start with Vascular. Total net sales in this category for the quarter were $244.6 million, an increase of 19% on an as-reported basis and 22% on a constant currency basis when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Excluding the Gore royalty and the impact of the EP divestiture, global Vascular sales were up 9%, with the United States business up 14% for the quarter and international up 3%. Sales in our Vascular graft category were down 6% in Q4.
Excluding the Gore royalty, our Endovascular business grew 11% in the fourth quarter. Within Endovascular, our biopsy line was up 1%.
Our peripheral PTA products were up 49% this quarter, driven by the early FDA approval of the Lutonix drug-coated balloon in the United States on October 10. We're extremely pleased with how our Vascular sales, development and operations team executed the early launch of this first-of-a-kind product in the United States. As you know, we were shipping product to customers on the day of approval with the first cases being performed the following day.
The early market acceptance has been impressive and we look forward to expanded adoption of this technology longer term as the market continues to develop.
Our Stent business was down 10% in Q4, which is within the range of recent experience. As we've said, pricing headwinds continue to drive down ASPs in this category.
And to complete the category, sales in our vena cava filter line were flat in the fourth quarter.
Now let's move to Urology. Total net sales were $217.8 million, which is up 8% versus the Q4 of last year on an as-reported basis, and 9% on a constant currency basis. About 600 points of this global growth was related to the Rochester acquisition, which anniversary-ed in the quarter. The United States business was up 6%, while internationally, we grew 14%.
The Targeted Temperature Management products saw strong double-digit growth this quarter, and we remain optimistic about the long-term growth prospects of this technology platform.
Our vesic [ph] drainage business was up 7% in Q4, with about 400 points of that growth coming from the acquired Rochester Medical products. 
I.C. Foleys were down 2% globally, with the United States down 4%. These results in vesic [ph] drainage are fairly consistent with recent quarters. While some surveys and reports have suggested improvement in United States hospital volumes, we haven't seen any underlying improvement reflected here so far.
Our continence business grew 24% over the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of the acquired products, our legacy continence products were down 6% for the quarter, within the range of recent experience.
Sales in urological specialties were up 11% with emerging markets growing close to 40% organically in this category. Our brachytherapy products were down 3% globally for the quarter.
And finally, sales from our StatLock catheter stabilization line decreased 3% in the fourth quarter.
Now let's turn to Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $237.5 million, an increase of 8% over the fourth quarter last year on an as reported basis and 9% on a constant currency basis. Net sales in the United States were up 7%, while outside the United States sales were up 15%.
Our port line was up 5% versus the fourth quarter of last year with significant growth coming from emerging markets.
PICC revenue growth was 11% in Q4, but strong performance again in the United States and internationally. Our vascular access ultrasound product line was up 8% this quarter. And our dialysis catheter business was up 11% in the fourth quarter.
And we'll finish with Surgical Specialties. Net sales in this category were $145.0 million in the fourth quarter, up 3% on an as-reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis. United States sales increased 4%, while international sales were up 6%. As you know, we anniversary-ed the 2013 acquisition of Medafor on the first day of the fourth quarter. Our biosurgical product portfolio grew double digits organically in the quarter, and we're excited about the long-term potential here.
Sales from our biosurgical products already exceed the combined sales of our fixation products and our natural tissue products.
Our soft tissue repair business grew 5% overall in the fourth quarter. Our total synthetic hernia products were up double digits again this quarter, while our natural tissue products declined 15%.
Closing out the surgical category, our fixation business was down 3% in the fourth quarter and our performance irrigation business was down 14% versus an above average quarter 1 year ago.
This concludes our product line revenue discussion. I'll now turn you over to John DeFord."

We launched over 40 new products and our pipeline of launches in 2015 is also robust.
Starting with drug-coated balloons. We're making good progress on additional sizes and indications worldwide. We're in the follow-up phase of our Levant 2 Japan study and we expect to submit late this year for Japan approval. Enrollment continues in our Below the Knee IDE and in-stent restenosis studies and we are making good progress in our AV access IDE study with enrollment anticipated to start mid-2015.
We're also expanding the clinical science of DCBs through our robust real world clinical experience. For example, at LINC this week, Dr. Markus Stein presented a first look at interim 1 year results from the Lutonix global SFA and popliteal registry of almost 700 patients. Lesion lengths were over 100 millimeters and treated lengths were almost 200 millimeters, while roughly 30% of lesions were located in the popliteal artery. Primary patency was 81.7% and 88.5% of patients were free from a re-intervention at 1 year.
Though randomized study designs are quite different, making comparison of results very difficult across different studies. Registries provide a more balanced comparison across technologies, and we believe these results compare well to any of the competitive DCBs.
Also in Vascular, we launched the LifeStream Balloon Expandable Covered Stent in Europe in Q4 and enrollment is going well in the IDE study to support an iliac artery disease indication in the U.S.
Finally in Vascular, we're responding to some FDA questions and anticipate U.S. launch in Q1 of the first in a series of new Tru-Flo PTA Catheters for use in valvuloplasty procedures. Tru-Flo has a unique flow-through design to allow blood to pass through a large channel in the center of the balloon, promoting prolonged inflation while potentially reducing the need for rapid pacing or other hemodynamic maneuvers used to reduce cardiac output during the time the balloon has expanded.
Next, moving to Urology. We've just begun the rollout of our new skyline sub 2 French stone basket family. This new product in our endourology line provides the urologists with one of the smallest baskets in the industry, yet provides high strength and maneuverability, along with a highly visible atraumatic tip to aid in safe and accurate use.
In our Targeted Temperature Management portfolio, we've just launched our new PAD systems for use with neonates and pediatric patients in the U.S. And we're rolling out a new software update to support enhanced functionality and additional languages.
Moving to Oncology. We're anticipating U.S. regulatory clearance and launch about midyear of our freehand stereotactic system for Vascular Access named Pinpoint GT. The technology will initially be offered on a new Site-Rite 8 system in a planned simultaneous launch. Pinpoint GT will also be backwards compatible to Site-Rite 6.
In PICCs, we're now tracking towards submission around midyear of our first family of thromboresistant devices. We plan to broaden the offering to our full line of PICCs over the back half of 2015 and into 2016. Similarly, we anticipate submitting our first antimicrobial PICC in the second half of 2015 and launching upon regulatory clearance. This first product will be followed by a series of launches to support coated PICCs in both our PowerPICC and PowerPICC SOLO configurations.
Turning to midlines. We're making good progress in our next-generation POWERGLIDE family and currently anticipate our U.S. regulatory submission in Q4 with a first half 2016 launch.
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery. We informed you on the last call that we just received U.S. regulatory clearance of the first antibiotic-coated biologic mesh, XenMatrix AB, and I'm pleased to tell you that product was launched in December. XenMatrix AB utilizes our proprietary coding, which is intended to preserve the integrity of the biologic graft in abdominal wall reconstruction procedures and has demonstrated broad spectrum safety and efficacy against several typically-encountered bacteria.
Moving to our BioSurgery product family. In early Q3, we filed our PMA supplement for our Progel sealant, seeking expanded use in video-assisted and robot-assisted thoracic surgery. We continue to be optimistic about approval and launch in the first half of this year.
Also, we completed a follow-up early this year in our TRIDYNE vascular sealant pivotal IDE study. The team is working toward PMA submission in the first half of the year and we anticipate approval and launch in mid-2016.
And finally, in mesh fixation, we remain on track to launch in the first half of the year, our new spring-loaded resorbable tack device named OPTIFIX. We also anticipate launching another fixation platform later in the year.
As Tim said, we have a very important year of execution ahead of us and we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. As part of our effort for continuous improvement, we initiated a survey of investors last year. And one of the more common suggestions we received was to take a fresh look at the need to hold a formal analyst meeting every year. We've been clear about our growth drivers and the opportunities we're pursuing and our investment strategy has not changed. Because of that, we have determined that a resource and time-intensive effort, like a formal analyst meeting, is just not justified this year. We'll update you on our pipeline and growth drivers throughout the year if circumstances allow in the appropriate forum. Thanks very much for your attention. Now I will hand the discussion over to Chris."
254131,281166647,752084,"CR Bard Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","C. R. Bard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Let me start by covering the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. We had acquisition-related items of $7.5 million pretax, mostly related to Lutonix milestone accretion and a $10.1 million pretax charge for",1630,"Thank you, John. Let me start by covering the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. We had acquisition-related items of $7.5 million pretax, mostly related to Lutonix milestone accretion and a $10.1 million pretax charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives. We also booked expense of $12.7 million, related to the judges order in the women's health litigation that we work up 500 cases simultaneously.
And finally, we had a credit of $3.5 million pretax related to the medical device excise tax paid in 2013 after reaching an agreement with the IRS. These items are detailed in the notes to the financial statements and the reconciliation accompanying our Q4 earnings press release.
Now let's go through the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $547.7 million in Q4 and $547.4 million on an adjusted basis or 63.1% of sales, up 230 basis points from the prior year, with 170 basis points of that improvement related to the Gore royalty and about 120 basis points coming from cost improvements. We also had about 50 basis points of benefit when compared to the higher integration costs and investments in Q4 of 2013.
Some headwinds to GPs in Q4 were new amortization of about 50 basis points, foreign exchange at about 10 basis points and mix of about 20 basis points. Pricing pressure was about 100 basis points of headwind on the revenue line and about 30 basis points in GP in Q4. We continue to expect pricing pressure going forward between 100 and 150 basis points on the revenue line.
For the full year 2014, that brings adjusted gross profit as a percentage of sales to 62.1%, up 110 basis points from 2013, much better than our original guidance of 30 to 60 basis points of improvement.
While the Gore royalty did exceed our expectations, the effect on GP was only 10 to 20 basis points higher than our projections from 1 year ago. The overachievement was primarily driven by more favorable mix than originally expected.
SG&A expenses were $257.5 million for the quarter or 29.7% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was $261 million even or 30.1% of sales, down 170 basis points from the prior year period, driven by the Gore royalty being in the denominator as well as improving leverage from our emerging markets investments and the integration of our 2013 acquisitions.
For the full year 2014, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales was 29.6%, a decrease of 40 basis points from the prior year. R&D expenditures totaled $79.2 million for the fourth quarter or 9.1% of sales. On an adjusted basis, R&D expense was $71.5 million or 8.2% of sales, a decrease of 70 basis points from the prior year period, mostly driven by the Gore royalty now in the denominator.
For the full year 2014 on an adjusted basis, R&D expense was 8% of sales compared to 8.5% in 2013. However, without the Gore royalty and the revenue line, R&D expense would've been 8.4% of sales in 2014.
Interest expense was $11.2 million for the fourth quarter and $44.8 million for the full year. Other income and expense was $25.1 million of expense for the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, it was $2.2 million of expense for the quarter and $4.7 million of income for the full year.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.2%. On an adjusted basis, it was 21.1%, taking us to 24.3% for the full year. The quarter was lower than the full year average due to the renewal of the R&D tax credit in December.
At the beginning of the year, we had told you to expect about 100 basis points of improvement in the effective tax rate in 2014 and we came in at 90 basis points of improvement, despite significantly stronger U.S. income than we had anticipated. That all adds up to cash EPS of $2.29 for Q4, excluding items affecting comparability, which brings us in at $8.40 for the full year on the same basis. That's a full $0.10 above the high end of our original guidance for the year and above our updated guidance as well, indicative of the strong performance we saw in 2014.
We purchased about 785,000 shares of the company's stock during the fourth quarter, taking the total buybacks in 2014 to approximately 4.5 million shares at an average price of $146.67. Between buybacks and dividends, we returned approximately $725 million to shareholders over the course of 2014.
The balance sheet as of December 31 reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1.01 billion versus $1.04 billion at September 30. For the full year, AR days were down 7.3 days and inventory days were up 0.2 days. Capital expenditures totaled $36.6 million for the quarter and $126.6 million for the year.
On the liability side, total debt was $1.5 billion as of December 31 versus $1.4 billion at September 30. Debt to total capital at the end of the fourth quarter was about 45% and total shareholder investment was $1.8 billion at December 31.
So with a strong 2014 now in the books, let's turn to financial guidance for 2015, excluding the impact of items that affect comparability. For revenue, we project 2015 constant currency organic revenue growth between 4% and 5%. Given the potential variability of the Gore royalty, our overall constant currency revenue guidance is between 3% and 5%. As Tim said, this assumes no fundamental improvement in the market growth rates from where they have been the last couple of years, which we would characterize as low single digits. If the markets improve as some suggest, then we would expect to do better. But with all of the uncertainties surrounding us, we think it's too early to count on any improvement in the underlying markets.
Obviously, foreign exchange rates are a significant headwind for everyone as we head into 2015 and we are certainly not immune to that. We estimate that at current rates, we're looking at a revenue headwind related to currency of about 3%.
As far as constant currency revenue growth in our 4 disease state categories, in 2015, we expect Vascular revenue growth to be between 3% and 7%; Urology to be between 1% and 4%; Oncology to grow between 3% and 6%; and our Surgical Specialties business to grow between 3% and 6% as well. We expect our overall gross margin percent to decline in 2015 by between 30 and 70 basis points compared to 2014. That reflects about 50 basis points of pressure from FX and about 30 basis points of incremental amortization from the U.S. approval of Lutonix in October of 2014.
Pricing pressure continues to be a significant issue for us. And we estimate the impact on 2015 to be between 40 and 60 basis points of headwind to GP. Fortunately, our cost improvement programs are projected to once again contribute about 50 basis points of benefits to GP and we expect mix to be favorable between 20 to 40 basis points.
So organic constant currency gross margins are expected to improve in 2015 as we projected when we first introduced our strategic investment plan 2 years ago. And again, as we said, we expect to see improving operating leverage in 2015. While we continue to increase investment in emerging markets, we expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to decline between 50 and 100 basis points in 2015. And we expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the mid-7% range, both excluding items that affect comparability. We expect interest expense in 2015 to be between $45 million and $47 million. We expect the effective tax rate to improve again, this time, between 0 and 50 basis points for the full year and this does assume the renewal of the R&D tax credit for 2015.
All of that adds up to adjusted cash EPS for 2015, excluding items that affect comparability between $8.95 and $9.05 per share. That includes a negative currency impact of about $0.25 based on today's rates. So without this very atypical currency situation, we would have been forecasting at or above our target of 10% EPS growth.
While we evaluated alternatives that could increase earnings for 2015, given the expected FX magnitude and the fact that this is certainly not a Bard-specific issue, we don't think it would be wise for short-term benefit to scale back investments and possibly interrupt the momentum in organic growth that we achieved during 2014.
In the end, we believe maintaining our flexibility and continuing to focus on the longer-term organic growth profile of the company builds better value for our shareholders.
In Q1, we expect constant currency sales growth between 4% and 5% and adjusted cash EPS between $2.04 and $2.08. As for capital expenditures, we expect 2015 to be similar to 2014, between $120 million and $140 million. And we expect operating cash flow to be in the $700 million range again in 2015.
I'd like to conclude my comments by reminding you that the objective of our strategy is to position Bard from a portfolio standpoint to deliver above market revenue growth for years to come. The key measure of success for this transition plan will be the improvement in the organic engine. This plan was never about maximizing EPS in a given year, but the strength in the business for the long-term in a disciplined and thoughtful way. We believe we are doing that. While we expect further improvement in our operating margins in 2015, we intend to remain in investment mode with the desired outcome of positioning the company for long-term success to enhance shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Tim."

Obviously, the market's volatile and especially as you grow into more and varied geographies, the underlying market growth rates get even more complex. We, as we stated, don't anticipate any change in the external environment for this year. If it happens, we'll do better than that. We stated a couple of years ago that our goal was to be 200 to 300 basis points above what the market growth rate was and the competitive aspect of that within the sector. That would still be our goal. We're big believers that sustainable revenue growth drives shareholder value and that's what we're about. So we remain fixated on that as a strategic objective. We do think that there's a lot of leverage for us with the investments we've made in some of the emerging markets. Just to put it in perspective, that represents almost 1/3 of our total sales headcount but as we mentioned, 9% of revenue. So we think there's a lot of room to grow into that. And those markets are growing clearly above what we called out as the market average in total. So to the extent we can accelerate growth in those segments that are growing faster, we should continue the momentum that we demonstrated last year."

The 4% to 5% organic growth guidance kind of x the Gore noise feels like it should be a little bit better than that this quarter, or think about the last few quarters, the kind of underlying business pre-Lutonix has been moving from what was 3% to moving closer to 4%, you have your first quarter of Lutonix out there, and Lutonix just adds over 200 basis points to the growth this quarter. So it feels like you're being a little bit conservative both on the base business as well as Lutonix. Like in the Oncology guidance, Oncology was up 7% constant currency in 2014 and you're guiding with 3% to 6%. So could you just spend a minute on the 4% to 5% and why that doesn't -- it feels conservative. Why is that not conservative?"

We certainly have ambitions to do very well, but we also want to make sure that we're maintaining the right level of caution. I think Europe, where we had a very strong 2014, we're somewhat cautious just given some of the macro challenges and headwinds that the continent is facing as well. And as Tim said, there's a lot of uncertainty surrounding us and the sector overall, including as it relates to the health care in the U.S. and as the Affordable Care Act continues to remain under some uncertainty longer term. So, or as we said, we're certainly going to try to do better and if we get some tailwind, we can. But we believe 4% to 5% as we exited '14 is absolutely the right place for us to be."

We're delighted with how well we've done in China since we embarked down this journey. We think we have an awful lot of runway yet ahead of us in China in many different product lines, especially new products that we have not yet launched in that specific geography. Emerging markets in -- within Europe, we're delighted with our uptick there across both Europe and Russia. And I'd say that we are anticipating the investments that we've made in Latin America yet to generate the results that we're expecting. So I think that '15 and '16 will be a particularly important year for us in the Latin American marketplace. We like the traction that we're getting around the world in the other markets that we've invested in. And I think that you'll continue to see this be a significant contributor to Bard's growth in the years to come. We don't have an upward limit in terms of this."

On reimbursement, we think it is an issue. There are certainly certain value-conscious buyers that would be holding off until they hear more about reimbursement. Obviously, we're getting pickup in spite of that at this stage. But there are, as John mentioned earlier, 2 paths for reimbursement. There's the outpatient reimbursement piece, which CMS, there's really no official time line. They can work within whatever they want. We think an April time frame is reasonable. Again, CMS is not obligated to work within that time frame. But typically, sort of a couple of cycles of review is common. And we're in that time period from when we submitted our documentation to CMS last fall. Now as far as the inpatient piece goes, I just saw today, actually, on the CMS website the agenda for a meeting next week, a town hall meeting where drug-coated balloons will be reviewed. And I think that's the last step, is my understanding, at least, the last public step in the review process for the inpatient piece. But remember, inpatient only receives the approval or changes one time a year, which is typically the October time frame. So John alluded to a Q4 inpatient time period, which is what we think would be sort of the reasonable customary time frame. But again, CMS is not obligated to work within any of that."

We do expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 25 minutes. I am going to try to keep the total call to about 1 hour or less. 
The discussion today will go as follows. I'll begin with an overview of the results for the first quarter. John Weiland, were President and COO will review first quarter product line revenue. John DeFord, our Senior VP of Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you an update in our productive development pipeline, after which Christopher Holland, our Senior VP and CFO, will cover the first quarter income statement and balance sheet as well as our expectations for Q2. And finally, we'll close with Q&A. 
First quarter 2015 net sales totaled $819.7 million. That's up 3% over Q1 last year on an as-reported basis and up 5% on a constant currency basis. The currency impact for the quarter versus last year was unfavorable by about 260 basis points. The quarterly royalty payment from Gore was $38.4 million, which represented slower growth than our product portfolio. So our organic revenue growth this quarter was about 5.3%, which was better than our guidance. 
Net income for the first quarter was $139.8 million. The diluted earnings per share were $1.82, that's down 6% and 2%, respectively, excluding certain items that affected the comparability of results between periods, which Chris will cover later. The first quarter 2015 net income was $142.4 million, up 6%. And diluted adjusted earnings per share, which excludes amortization, were $2.10, that's up 10%. This was also above our expectations despite the additional headwind from currency and represents a good start to what's an important year of execution for us. 
Looking at revenue growth geographically compared to the first quarter of last year. Q1 net sales in the U.S. grew 4% compared to a year ago. On a constant currency basis, in Europe, we were up 1%. Japan was up 5%. And our other international businesses were up 18%. 
We saw strong sales growth across all of our emerging market geographies in the first quarter as our investments over the last couple of years have strengthened our position in these faster growing markets. As a percentage of total sales in the first quarter, emerging markets represented between 8% and 9% of sales compared to just 7% a year ago. And while it's still small percentage of the portfolio in some of our major product lines, the actual dollar growth we saw in emerging markets exceeded the dollar growth of the same products in the U.S. this quarter. As you know, emerging markets is just one of the opportunities we've highlighted as a key long-term revenue growth driver for us. In fact, you'll hear as John takes you through the sales results, that each of the growth drivers we've highlighted as part of our strategic investment plan performed well this quarter. 
We remain focused on the execution of that plan and providing the expected returns on those investments in 2015 and beyond. Chris will provide the detail update to our guidance a bit later in the call, but I am pleased to tell you that our strong start to the year and our confidence in our ability to execute on the things we can control, we believe we can manage the challenging foreign exchange environment so far and maintain our original financial guidance for 2015. So with that, summary, let me now turn you over to John Weiland for a review of our product line revenue."

Before I start, let me point out that I'll be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $23",855,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, let me point out that I'll be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. 
So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $231.9 million, up 6% over last year on a reported basis and up 10% on a constant currency basis. U.S. Vascular sales were up 8% in Q1 and international sales were up 11%. 
Sales in our Surgical Graft category were down 4% this quarter, within the range of recent experience. Our Endovascular business was up 10% in the first quarter and it was up 12%, excluding the Gore royalty. 
Our biopsy products had a strong quarter, up 9%, driven by good growth internationally, especially in emerging markets. 
Our peripheral PTA line increased 32% in the first quarter, with sales of our Lutonix DCB exceeding our expectations. We saw a good acceleration in the daily usage of the device after some large initial stocking orders in the fourth quarter. 
In Q1, we worked with Boston Scientific to train their reps in our product and in Q2, received our first order from them. As you probably saw, hospital outpatient procedures are now eligible for reimbursement through CMS as of the beginning of the second quarter, an important milestone for the category. 
Our vena cava filter line grew 6% in Q1. Our Stent business declined 3% in Q1 compared to the prior year and we continue to expect significant price pressure in this category. 
Now let's move to Urology. Total net sales were $205.6 million, up 2% versus the first quarter of last year on a reported basis and up 5% on a constant currency basis. The United States business was up 4% and internationally, we grew 6%. We saw double-digit growth in our Targeted Temperature Management products again this quarter. And we remain encouraged by the long-term opportunity here. Our basic drainage business was up 4% in Q1 and up 2% in the United States. Within that category, our I.C. Foley business was up 1% globally and down 2% in the United States. 
Our continence business was up 7% in Q1, driven by double-digit growth in our Dignicare [ph] and male-external catheter sales. 
Our women's health product lines continue to decline but now make up less than 20% of continence category and less than 1/2 of a percent of Bard's total sales. 
Sales in Urological Specialties were down 1% in the first quarter, with our brachytherapy down 4%. And finally, standalone sales of our StatLock catheter stabilization line increased 5% in Q1. 
Next is Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $224.6 million, an increase of 3% over Q1 last year on a reported basis, and up 5% on a constant currency basis. Geographically, net sales in the United States were up 1% and international sales were up 15%. 
Our port business was down 3% over Q1 of last year. We forecast that significant United States pricing pressure here related to GPO contracts signed in 2014, which drove the decline, as units were essentially flat with prior year. 
Our PICC revenues were up 9% globally with good growth in the United States and even better growth internationally. And the closeout of the category, our vascular access ultrasound product line grew 12% this quarter and our dialysis catheter product line was up 8%. 
So then let's finish with Surgical Specialties. Total net sales in this category were $135.9 million, up 1% on a reported basis, and up 3% on a constant currency basis. U.S. sales were up 5% and international sales were down 4% in the quarter. Most of that international decline was driven by our performance irrigation business, which was down 34% globally due to the discontinuation of certain products in this category, which now represents less than 1% of total Bard's sales. 
Our soft tissue business -- soft tissue repair business grew 5% this quarter. Within soft tissue, our synthetic business grew 8% in Q1. In biologics, we were very pleased with the first full quarter of sales from our XenMatrix AB product, which is a graft with an antibiotic coating. Thanks to the contribution from this new first-of-its-kind device, our total biologic category was flat in Q1, reversing a trend of double-digit declines. 
We have the broadest portfolio in hernia repair across all types of products, from a wide range of synthetics to natural tissue and now antibiotic coated natural tissue. We are working with physicians to identify the right product for the right patient and provide a wide range of options for them. 
Our hernia fixation line declined 9% this quarter -- 7% this quarter, within the range of recent experience. As you'll hear from John DeFord, we have some new products in our pipeline that we believe will help us get back to growth in this category. 
We are well past the anniversaries of our acquisitions of BioSurgery and that business grew double digits again this quarter. We remain bullish on the long-term opportunity here. 
This concludes our product line revenue discussion. I'll now turn you over to John DeFord."

And as you'll hear in my update, our pipeline and plans show a very active 2015 and beyond. 
I'll start with drug-coated balloons, where we're making good progress on additional sizes and indications worldwide. We filed the PMA supplement for additional balloon sizes for use in the SFA and popliteal and anticipate launch in the back half of this year. 
In our clinical activities, we completed initial follow-up in our Levant 2 Japan study. We're in the data analysis phase and we expect to submit in the back half of the year for approval. Enrollment continues in our Below the Knee and in-stent restenosis IDE studies. And we recently submitted the IDE for our AV access study with enrollment anticipated to start in Q3. We're also working toward the start of our Levant China study and expect to begin enrollment in the back half of the year. The Levant 2 study design was described in detail in a recent publication authored by Dr. Michael and several investigators in the American Heart Journal. We also expect 24 months Levant 2 results to be presented at SBS in June. 
Also in Vascular, the LifeStream balloon expandable covered stent clinical study is recruiting quickly and we anticipate completing enrollment later this year. This IDE evaluates the technology for the treatment of iliac artery disease. 
In other stent graft news, our next-generation device for use in AV access is nearing completion and development and we anticipate launching in Europe in Q4. This product will require a clinical study for U.S. approval and we anticipate filing the IDE and initiating a study in the first half of 2016. 
We have a new venous stent project that is on a similar development pathway with launch anticipated in Europe in Q4 and an IDE study expected to begin around the end of the year. 
Next, moving to Urology. We've launched our new Skyline Sub 2 [ph]  French stone basket family and are working to expand the platform with 2.4 and 3 French versions expected later this year. 
Also in Endourology, we anticipate launching our new access sheath system in the back half of the year. We believe these new products provide the urologist with needed improvements to some of the tools they are currently using in this important interventional space. 
In home care, we are nearing the launch of a new intermittent self-catheterization product, the Magic 3 Touchless, slated for release in Q3. Magic 3 Touchless combines the comfort and insertion benefits of the Magic 3 platform, combined with our touchless closed system designed to reduce the risk of contamination and infection due to catheter insertion. We've got a couple of other products in our intermittent catheter family that are slated to launch later this year. But I'd hold back the details until we get closer to product release. 
Moving to Oncology. We recently received U.S. regulatory clearance for our free hand stereotactic system for Vascular Access, named Pinpoint GT. The Pinpoint GT technology would be offered on the new Site-Rite 8 ultrasound system, slated for launch later this year. We believe that the combination of the Site-Rite ultrasound, Pinpoint GT guidance and 3CG Diamond catheter tip confirmation in an integrated system will provide a complete clinical solution for vascular catheter placement. 
In PICC, we are on track for our Q3 regulatory submission for our new thromboresistant coating. Upon regulatory clearance, we plan to launch a broad line of catheters marketed under the Covert [ph] PICC trade name. We expect to follow the Covert PICC with a combined antimicrobial and thromboresistant coating, planned for launch in the back half of 2016. 
In midlines, we launched the 22 Gates PowerGlide catheter in Q1, completing our sizes in the PowerGlide product family. We're also making good progress on our next generation of midline catheters and anticipate our U.S. regulatory submission in Q4 with the first half 2016 launch. 
For the acute hemodialysis patient, we're expanding upon our market-leading Trialysis catheter family with the anticipated regulatory clearance on launch later this quarter of our new Trialysis slim. Trialysis slim incorporates superior flexibility, increased resistance and flow rates in excess of 400 milliliters per minute in a small 12-French triple lumen catheter configuration. 
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery. On our last call, we told you about our launch of the first antibiotic coated biologic XenMatrix AB. As John Weiland told you, the product is receiving excellent early feedback. And we are working hard to expand the size matrix available, with additional launches expected over the course of the next several quarters. 
We're also making good progress toward the launch of a new product family that incorporates our proven separate barrier technology with our bioresorbable mesh family to create the Phasix ST. Phasix ST is designed for intra-abdominal placement and is on track to launch in Q3. This new offering supplements XenMatrix AB, XenMatrix and Phasix to allow us to offer proprietary and differentiated products designed to address the entire spectrum of complex abdominal wall repairs. 
Moving onto our BioSurgery product family. In early Q3 of 2014, we filed our PMA supplement for our Progel sealant, seeking expanded use in video-assisted and robot-assisted thoracic surgery. We received approval from FDA earlier this quarter. And I'm pleased to announce the launch is underway ahead of schedule. 
Also in January of this year, we completed follow-up in our Tridyne vascular sealant pivotal IDE study. Analysis is complete and the team is working toward PMA submission this quarter. Following this time line, we anticipate approval and launch in mid-2016. 
And finally, in mesh fixation, we're gearing up for the launch in the next couple of weeks of our first spring-loaded resolvable tack device named OPTIFIX. OPTIFIX has been designed to employ stored energy for ease and efficiency of tact delivery while reducing tissue trauma that's been associated with some competitive devices. 
In past calls, I've told you that we have another fixation platform under development, but we've not disclose the details. Now the time is right and I'm pleased to announce that we anticipate launching our new permanent fixation device named Capture later this quarter. Capture is the result of several years of analysis of the permanent fixation market and was designed to reduce the risk of tissue injury due to exposed and concern over adhesions and reliability, while providing the functional requirements of a permanent including the ability to penetrate hard tissues such as ligament. With these 2 fixation launches, we're excited to move back to playing offense in this highly competitive space. 
Thanks for your attention today. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. Now I'll hand our discussion over to Chris."

Let me start by covering certain items that affect the comparability of our results between periods credit and acquisition-related items of $9.2 million pretax, a $3.9 million pretax charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives and we recorded expense of $10.3 million, primarily related to the judge's order in the women's health litigation that we work up 500 cases simultaneously. The P&L impact of these items is detailed in the notes to the financial statements and in the reconciliation accompanying our Q1 earnings press release. 
Now let's go to the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $508.5 million or 62% of sales for Q1. On an adjusted basis, GP was $498.6 million or 60.8% of sales, down 60 basis points from the prior year quarter, consistent with our guidance. FX costs us 30 basis points in GP this quarter and the new amortization from the Q4 2014 Lutonix approval was 40 basis points in Q1. 
Price pressure drove 130 basis points on the revenue line in Q1 and about 50 basis points of headwind on GP, consistent with our expectations. Our cost improvements drove about 40 basis points of benefit to GPs this quarter and mix was favorable by about 20 basis points. 
As we look to Q2, we expect gross margin to be similar to the Q2 2014 level, despite FX pressure and the incremental amortization. 
SG&A expenses were $235.7 million for the quarter or 28.8% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A as a percent of sales was 28.7%, a decrease of 90 basis points. We are on track with our annual guidance of delivering improved P&L leverage for the full year. 
R&D expenditures totaled $60.6 million for the first quarter or 7.4% of sales on both the reported and adjusted basis, consistent with our guidance. Interest expense was $11.3 million for the first quarter. 
Other income and expense was $16.3 million of expense for the first quarter as reported and $1.6 million of expense on an adjusted basis. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% on a reported basis and 24.9% on an adjusted basis, the same level as a year ago. And again, our full year guidance assumes the renewal of the R&D tax credit but that will not be included in the reported numbers until it is renewed. 
Diluted shares for the period were 75.8 million and we purchased 1.2 million shares during the first quarter. The net result is adjusted EPS of $2.10, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter. 
The balance sheet as of March 31 reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of approximately $1.03 billion versus $1.01 billion at December 31. For the quarter, accounts receivable days were up 0.7 days and inventory days were up 0.3 days. Capital expenditures totaled $29 million for the quarter. 
On the liability side, total debt was $1.6 billion as of March 31 compared to $1.5 billion at the end of December. Debt-to-total cap at the end of the first quarter was about 48% and total shareholder investment was $1.7 billion at March 31. 
In looking at Q2, we're expecting constant currency sales growth between 4.5% and 5.5% and we expect organic growth to be within the same range. We are now expecting currency headwinds based on exchange rates at the current levels to reduce reported sales by about 4% for Q2 and the full year, up from about 3% in original -- in our original guidance in January. 
From an adjusted EPS standpoint, excluding items affecting comparability and the amortization of intangibles, we see the second quarter in the $2.15 to $2.19 range. 
Despite the challenging and volatile FX environment, based on exchange rates at the current levels, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS between $8.95 and $9.05 for the full year of the 2015. 
And with that, I'll hand the call back to Tim."

As it relates to robotics thing, our view is we provide the products, the implants, et cetera, that would be used with the robotic mix. So I don't see it dramatically impacting the business. In fact, several of our products to the extent that there are people, I think there's more talk than action right now relative to that. But I -- we know that a couple of our products have become the product of choice to be used in some of those procedures. With that, I'll let John DeFord put some..."

Maybe you're alluding to in robotic surgeries fixation devices aren't typically needed because they can suit you with robotic device. And so again, I think we see that we are well-positioned. We don't see that happening overnight. And certainly, robotic surgery is pretty limited right now. There are some benefits, of course. You can close the abdominal wound before some of the fixation is required. You can do a few other things. But it's pretty limited in the procedures that you can use robotics in today. So we think we've got a good mix. As Tim and John had said earlier, we think we've got from a mesh or implant perspective, a great mix of products that work well with the robotic surgery as well as with laparoscopic and open. And we also think our fixation products are going to be useful in a number of different repairs that aren't necessarily meaningful to robotics today."

We'd expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 25 minutes. And we're going to try to keep the total call to about 1 hour or less. 
The discussion today will go as follows. I'll begin with an overview of the results for the first quarter. John Weiland, our President and COO will review first quarter product line revenue. John DeFord, our Senior VP of Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you an update on our productive development pipeline, after which, Chris Holland, our Senior VP and CFO, will cover the first quarter income statement and balance sheet as well as our expectations for Q2. And finally, we'll close with Q&A. 
First quarter 2015 net sales totaled $819.7 million. That's up 3% over Q1 last year on an as-reported basis and up 5% on a constant currency basis. The currency impact for the quarter versus last year was unfavorable by about 260 basis points. The quarterly royalty payment from Gore was $38.4 million, which represented slower growth than our product portfolio. So our organic revenue growth this quarter was about 5.3%, which was better than our guidance. 
Net income for the first quarter was $139.8 million, and diluted earnings per share were $1.82. That's down 6% and 2%, respectively, excluding certain items that affected the comparability of results between periods, which Chris will cover later. The first quarter 2015 net income was $142.4 million, up 6%. And diluted adjusted earnings per share, which exclude amortization, were $2.10. That's up 10%. This was also above our expectations despite the additional headwind from currency and represents a good start to what's an important year of execution for us. 
Looking at revenue growth geographically compared to the first quarter of last year. Q1 net sales in the U.S. grew 4% compared to a year ago. On a constant currency basis, in Europe, we were up 1%. Japan was up 5%. And our other international businesses were up 18%. 
We saw strong sales growth across all of our emerging market geographies in the first quarter as our investments over the last couple of years have strengthened our position in these faster growing markets. As a percentage of total sales in the first quarter, emerging markets represented between 8% and 9% of sales compared to just 7% a year ago. And while it's still a small percentage of portfolio, in some of our major product lines, the actual dollar growth we saw in emerging markets exceeded the dollar growth of the same products in the U.S. this quarter. 
As you know, emerging markets is just one of the opportunities we've highlighted as a key long-term revenue growth driver for us. In fact, you'll hear, as John Weiland takes you through the sales results, that each of the growth drivers we highlighted as part of our strategic investment plan performed well this quarter. 
We remain focused on the execution of that plan and providing the expected returns on those investments in 2015 and beyond. Chris will provide the detailed update to our guidance a bit later in the call, but I'm pleased to tell you that our strong start to the year and our confidence in our ability to execute on the things we can control, we believe we can manage the challenging foreign exchange environment so far and maintain our original financial guidance for 2015. 
So with that summary, let me now turn you over to John Weiland for a review of our product line revenue."

Before I start, let me point out that I'll be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. 
So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $231.9 million, up 6% over last year on a reported basis and up 10% on a constant currency basis. U.S. Vascular sales were up 8% in Q1 and international sales were up 11%. 
Sales in our Surgical Graft category were down 4% this quarter within the range of recent experience. Our Endovascular business was up 10% in the first quarter, and it was up 12%, excluding the Gore royalty. 
Our biopsy products had a strong quarter, up 9%, and driven by good growth internationally, especially in emerging markets. 
Our peripheral PTA line increased 32% in the first quarter, with sales of our Lutonix DCB exceeding our expectations. We saw a good acceleration in the daily usage of the device after some large initial stocking orders in the fourth quarter. 
In Q1, we worked with Boston Scientific to train their reps on the product and, in Q2, received our first order from them. As you probably saw, hospital outpatient procedures are now eligible for reimbursement through CMS as of the beginning of the second quarter, an important milestone for the category. 
Our vena cava filter line grew 6% in Q1. Our Stent business declined 3% in Q1 compared to the prior year, and we continue to expect significant price pressure in this category. 
Now let's move to Urology. Total net sales were $205.6 million, up 2% versus the first quarter of last year on a reported basis and up 5% on a constant currency basis. The United States business was up 4%, and internationally, we grew 6%. We saw double-digit growth in our Targeted Temperature Management products again this quarter. And we remain encouraged by the long-term opportunity here. Our basic drainage business was up 4% in Q1 and up 2% in the United States. Within that category, our I.C. Foley business was up 1% globally and down 2% in the United States. 
Our continence business was up 7% in Q1, driven by double-digit growth in our DIGNICARE and male-external catheter sales. 
Our women's health product lines continue to decline but now make up less than 20% of the continence category and less than 1/2 of a percent of Bard's total sales. 
Sales in Urological Specialties were down 1% in the first quarter, with our brachytherapy down 4%. And finally, standalone sales of our StatLock catheter stabilization line increased 5% in Q1. 
Next is Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $224.6 million, an increase of 3% over Q1 last year on a reported basis and up 5% on a constant currency basis. Geographically, net sales in the United States were up 1%, and international sales were up 15%. 
Our port business was down 3% over Q1 of last year. We forecast that significant United States pricing pressure here related to GPO contracts signed in 2014, which drove the decline as units were essentially flat with prior year. 
Our PICC revenues were up 9% globally with good growth in the United States and even better growth internationally. And to close out the category, our vascular access ultrasound product line grew 12% this quarter, and our dialysis catheter product line was up 8%. 
So then let's finish with Surgical Specialties. Total net sales in this category were $135.9 million, up 1% on a reported basis, and up 3% on a constant currency basis. U.S. sales were up 5%, and international sales were down 4% in the quarter. Most of that international decline was driven by our performance irrigation business, which was down 34% globally due to the discontinuation of certain products in this category, which now represents less than 1% of total Bard sales. 
Our soft tissue business -- soft tissue repair business grew 5% this quarter. Within soft tissue, our synthetic hernia business grew 8% in Q1. 
In biologics, we were very pleased with the first full quarter of sales from our XenMatrix AB product, which is a porcine graft with an antibiotic coating. Thanks to the contribution from this new first-of-its-kind device, our total biologic category was flat in Q1, reversing a trend of double-digit declines. 
We have the broadest portfolio in hernia repair across all types of products, from a wide range of synthetics to natural tissue and now antibiotic coated natural tissue. We are working with physicians to identify the right product for the right patient and provide a wide range of options for them. 
Our hernia fixation line declined 9% this quarter -- 7% this quarter, within the range of recent experience. As you'll hear from John DeFord, we have some new products in our pipeline that we believe will help us get back to growth in this category. 
We are well past the anniversaries of our acquisitions of BioSurgery, and that business grew double digits again this quarter. We remain bullish on the long-term opportunity here. 
This concludes our product line revenue discussion. I'll now turn you over to John DeFord."

I'll start with drug-coated balloons, where we're making good progress on additional sizes and indications worldwide. We filed the PMA supplement for additional balloon sizes for use in the SFA and popliteal and anticipate launch in the back half of this year. 
In our clinical activities, we've completed initial follow-up in our Levant 2 Japan study. We're in the data analysis phase, and we expect to submit in the back half of the year for approval. Enrollment continues in our Below the Knee and in-stent restenosis IDE studies. And we recently submitted the IDE for our AV access study with enrollment anticipated to start in Q3. We're also working toward the start of our Levant China study and expect to begin enrollment in the back half of the year. 
The Levant 2 study design was described in detail in a recent publication authored by Dr. Michael Jaff and several investigators in the American Heart Journal. We also expect the 24-months Levant 2 results to be presented at SVS [ph] in June. 
Also in Vascular, the LifeStream Balloon Expandable Covered Stent clinical study is recruiting quickly, and we anticipate completing enrollment later this year. This IDE evaluates the technology for the treatment of iliac artery disease. 
In other stent graft news, our next-generation device for use in AV access is nearing completion and development, and we anticipate launching in Europe in Q4. This product will require a clinical study for U.S. approval, and we anticipate filing the IDE and initiating a study in the first half of 2016. 
We have a new venous stent project that's on a similar development pathway with launch anticipated in Europe in Q4 and an IDE study expected to begin around the end of the year. 
Next, moving to Urology. We've launched our new skyline sub 2 French stone basket family and are working to expand the platform with 2.4 and 3 French versions expected later this year. 
Also in endourology, we anticipate launching our new access sheath system in the back half of the year. We believe these new products provide the urologist with needed improvements to some of the tools they're currently using in this important interventional space. 
In home care, we're nearing the launch of a new intermittent self-catheterization product, the Magic 3 Touchless, slated for release in Q3. Magic 3 Touchless combines the comfort and insertion benefits of the Magic 3 platform, combined with our touchless closed system designed to reduce the risk of contamination and infection due to catheter insertion. We've got a couple of other products in our intermittent catheter family that are slated to launch later this year. But I'll hold back the details until we get closer to product release. 
Moving to Oncology. We recently received U.S. regulatory clearance for our freehand stereotactic system for Vascular Access, named Pinpoint GT. The Pinpoint GT technology will be offered on the new Site-Rite 8 ultrasound system slated for launch later in the year. We believe the combination of Site-Rite ultrasound, Pinpoint GT yield guidance and 3CG Diamond catheter tip confirmation in an integrated system will provide a complete clinical solution for vascular catheter placement. 
In PICC, we're on track for a Q3 regulatory submission for our new thromboresistant coating. Upon regulatory clearance, we plan to launch a broad line of catheters marketed under the COVERT PICC trade name. We expect to follow the COVERT PICC with a combined antimicrobial and thromboresistant coating planned for launch in the back half of 2016. 
In midlines, we launched the 22-gauge PowerGlide catheter in Q1, completing our sizes in the PowerGlide product family. We're also making good progress on our next generation of midline catheters and anticipate our U.S. regulatory submission in Q4 with a first half 2016 launch. 
For the acute hemodialysis patient, we're expanding upon our market-leading Trialysis catheter family with the anticipated regulatory clearance and launch later this quarter of our new Trialysis slim. Trialysis slim incorporates superior flexibility, kink resistance and flow rates in excess of 400 milliliters per minute in a small 12-French triple lumen catheter configuration. 
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery. On our last call, we told you about our launch of the first antibiotic coated biologic mesh, XenMatrix AB. As John Weiland told you, the product is receiving excellent early feedback, and we're working hard to expand the size matrix available, with additional launches expected over the course of the next several quarters. 
We're also making good progress toward the launch of a new product family that incorporates our proven Sepra barrier technology with our Phasix bioresorbable mesh family to create the Phasix ST. Phasix ST is designed for intra-abdominal placement and is on track to launch in Q3. This new offering supplements XenMatrix AB, XenMatrix and Phasix to allow us to offer proprietary and differentiated products designed to address the entire spectrum of complex abdominal wall repairs. 
Moving onto our BioSurgery product family. In early Q3 of 2014, we filed our PMA supplement for our Progel sealant, seeking expanded use in video-assisted and robot-assisted thoracic surgery. We received approval from FDA earlier this quarter, and I'm pleased to announce the launch is underway ahead of schedule. 
Also in January of this year, we completed follow-up in our Tridyne vascular sealant pivotal IDE study. Analysis is complete and the team is working toward PMA submission this quarter. Following this time line, we anticipate approval and launch in mid-2016. 
And finally, in mesh fixation, we're gearing up for the launch in the next couple of weeks of our first spring-loaded resorbable tack device named OPTIFIX. OPTIFIX has been designed to employ stored energy for ease and efficiency of tack delivery while reducing tissue trauma that's been associated with some competitive devices. 
In past calls, I've told you that we have another fixation platform under development, but we've not disclosed the details. Now the time is right and I'm pleased to announce that we anticipate launching our new permanent fixation device named Capsure later this quarter. Capsure is the result of several years of analysis of the permanent fixation market and was designed to reduce the risk of tissue injury due to exposed sharps and concern over adhesions and reliability, while providing the functional requirements of a permanent tack, including the ability to penetrate hard tissues such as Cooper's ligament. With these 2 fixation launches, we're excited to move back to playing offense in this highly competitive space. 
Thanks for your attention today. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. Now I'll hand our discussion over to Chris."
254131,290174664,793855,"CR Bard Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","C. R. Bard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Let me start by covering certain items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. We got a credit and acquisition-related items of $9.2 million pretax, a $3.9 million pretax charge for restructuring and productivity ini",650,"Thank you, John. Let me start by covering certain items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. We got a credit and acquisition-related items of $9.2 million pretax, a $3.9 million pretax charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives, and we recorded expense of $10.3 million, primarily related to the judge's order in the women's health litigation that we work up 500 cases simultaneously. The P&L impact of these items is detailed in the notes to the financial statements and in the reconciliation accompanying our Q1 earnings press release. 
Now let's go to the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $508.5 million or 62% of sales for Q1. On an adjusted basis, GP was $498.6 million or 60.8% of sales, down 60 basis points from the prior year quarter, consistent with our guidance. FX costs us 30 basis points in GP this quarter and the new amortization from the Q4 2014 Lutonix approval was 40 basis points in Q1. 
Price pressure drove 130 basis points on the revenue line in Q1 and about 50 basis points of headwind on GPs, consistent with our expectations. Our cost improvements drove about 40 basis points of benefit to GPs this quarter, and mix was favorable by about 20 basis points. 
As we look to Q2, we expect gross margin to be similar to the Q2 2014 level, despite FX pressure and the incremental amortization. 
SG&A expenses were $235.7 million for the quarter or 28.8% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A as a percent of sales was 28.7%, a decrease of 90 basis points. We are on track with our annual guidance of delivering improved P&L leverage for the full year. 
R&D expenditures totaled $60.6 million for the first quarter or 7.4% of sales on both a reported and adjusted basis, consistent with our guidance. Interest expense was $11.3 million for the first quarter. 
Other income and expense was $16.3 million of expense for the first quarter as reported and $1.6 million of expense on an adjusted basis. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% on a reported basis and 24.9% on an adjusted basis, the same level as a year ago. And again, our full year guidance assumes the renewal of the R&D tax credit, but that will not be included in the reported numbers until it is renewed. 
Diluted shares for the period were 75.8 million, and we purchased 1.2 million shares during the first quarter. The net result is adjusted EPS of $2.10, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter. 
The balance sheet as of March 31 reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of approximately $1.03 billion versus $1.01 billion at December 31. For the quarter, accounts receivable days were up 0.7 days, and inventory days were up 0.3 days. Capital expenditures totaled $29 million for the quarter. 
On the liability side, total debt was $1.6 billion as of March 31 compared to $1.5 billion at the end of December. Debt-to-total cap at the end of the first quarter was about 48%, and total shareholder investment was $1.7 billion at March 31. 
In looking at Q2, we're expecting constant currency sales growth between 4.5% and 5.5% and would expect organic growth to be within the same range. We are now expecting currency headwinds based on exchange rates at their current levels to reduce reported sales by about 4% for Q2 and the full year, up from about 3% in original -- in our original guidance in January. 
From an adjusted EPS standpoint, excluding items affecting comparability and the amortization of intangibles, we see the second quarter in the $2.15 to $2.19 range. 
Despite the challenging and volatile FX environment, based on exchange rates at their current levels, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS between $8.95 and $9.05 for the full year of 2015. 
And with that, I'll hand the call back to Tim."

I'd like to welcome everybody to Bard's first quarter 2015 earnings call and thank all of you for taking the time to join us today. We'd expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 25 minutes. And we're going to try to keep the total call to about 1 hour or less. 
The discussion today will go as follows. I'll begin with an overview of the results for the first quarter. John Weiland, our President and COO will review first quarter product line revenue. John DeFord, our Senior VP of Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you an update on our productive development pipeline, after which, Chris Holland, our Senior VP and CFO, will cover the first quarter income statement and balance sheet as well as our expectations for Q2. And finally, we'll close with Q&A. 
First quarter 2015 net sales totaled $819.7 million. That's up 3% over Q1 last year on an as-reported basis and up 5% on a constant currency basis. The currency impact for the quarter versus last year was unfavorable by about 260 basis points. The quarterly royalty payment from Gore was $38.4 million, which represented slower growth than our product portfolio. So our organic revenue growth this quarter was about 5.3%, which was better than our guidance. 
Net income for the first quarter was $139.8 million, and diluted earnings per share were $1.82. That's down 6% and 2%, respectively, excluding certain items that affected the comparability of results between periods, which Chris will cover later. The first quarter 2015 net income was $142.4 million, up 6%. And diluted adjusted earnings per share, which exclude amortization, were $2.10. That's up 10%. This was also above our expectations despite the additional headwind from currency and represents a good start to what's an important year of execution for us. 
Looking at revenue growth geographically compared to the first quarter of last year. Q1 net sales in the U.S. grew 4% compared to a year ago. On a constant currency basis, in Europe, we were up 1%. Japan was up 5%. And our other international businesses were up 18%. 
We saw strong sales growth across all of our emerging market geographies in the first quarter as our investments over the last couple of years have strengthened our position in these faster growing markets. As a percentage of total sales in the first quarter, emerging markets represented between 8% and 9% of sales compared to just 7% a year ago. And while it's still a small percentage of portfolio, in some of our major product lines, the actual dollar growth we saw in emerging markets exceeded the dollar growth of the same products in the U.S. this quarter. 
As you know, emerging markets is just one of the opportunities we've highlighted as a key long-term revenue growth driver for us. In fact, you'll hear, as John Weiland takes you through the sales results, that each of the growth drivers we highlighted as part of our strategic investment plan performed well this quarter. 
We remain focused on the execution of that plan and providing the expected returns on those investments in 2015 and beyond. Chris will provide the detailed update to our guidance a bit later in the call, but I'm pleased to tell you that our strong start to the year and our confidence in our ability to execute on the things we can control, we believe we can manage the challenging foreign exchange environment so far and maintain our original financial guidance for 2015. 
So with that summary, let me now turn you over to John Weiland for a review of our product line revenue."

Before I start, let me point out that I'll be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $23",858,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, let me point out that I'll be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. 
So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $231.9 million, up 6% over last year on a reported basis and up 10% on a constant currency basis. U.S. Vascular sales were up 8% in Q1 and international sales were up 11%. 
Sales in our Surgical Graft category were down 4% this quarter within the range of recent experience. Our Endovascular business was up 10% in the first quarter, and it was up 12%, excluding the Gore royalty. 
Our biopsy products had a strong quarter, up 9%, and driven by good growth internationally, especially in emerging markets. 
Our peripheral PTA line increased 32% in the first quarter, with sales of our Lutonix DCB exceeding our expectations. We saw a good acceleration in the daily usage of the device after some large initial stocking orders in the fourth quarter. 
In Q1, we worked with Boston Scientific to train their reps on the product and, in Q2, received our first order from them. As you probably saw, hospital outpatient procedures are now eligible for reimbursement through CMS as of the beginning of the second quarter, an important milestone for the category. 
Our vena cava filter line grew 6% in Q1. Our Stent business declined 3% in Q1 compared to the prior year, and we continue to expect significant price pressure in this category. 
Now let's move to Urology. Total net sales were $205.6 million, up 2% versus the first quarter of last year on a reported basis and up 5% on a constant currency basis. The United States business was up 4%, and internationally, we grew 6%. We saw double-digit growth in our Targeted Temperature Management products again this quarter. And we remain encouraged by the long-term opportunity here. Our basic drainage business was up 4% in Q1 and up 2% in the United States. Within that category, our I.C. Foley business was up 1% globally and down 2% in the United States. 
Our continence business was up 7% in Q1, driven by double-digit growth in our DIGNICARE and male-external catheter sales. 
Our women's health product lines continue to decline but now make up less than 20% of the continence category and less than 1/2 of a percent of Bard's total sales. 
Sales in Urological Specialties were down 1% in the first quarter, with our brachytherapy down 4%. And finally, standalone sales of our StatLock catheter stabilization line increased 5% in Q1. 
Next is Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $224.6 million, an increase of 3% over Q1 last year on a reported basis and up 5% on a constant currency basis. Geographically, net sales in the United States were up 1%, and international sales were up 15%. 
Our port business was down 3% over Q1 of last year. We forecast that significant United States pricing pressure here related to GPO contracts signed in 2014, which drove the decline as units were essentially flat with prior year. 
Our PICC revenues were up 9% globally with good growth in the United States and even better growth internationally. And to close out the category, our vascular access ultrasound product line grew 12% this quarter, and our dialysis catheter product line was up 8%. 
So then let's finish with Surgical Specialties. Total net sales in this category were $135.9 million, up 1% on a reported basis, and up 3% on a constant currency basis. U.S. sales were up 5%, and international sales were down 4% in the quarter. Most of that international decline was driven by our performance irrigation business, which was down 34% globally due to the discontinuation of certain products in this category, which now represents less than 1% of total Bard sales. 
Our soft tissue business -- soft tissue repair business grew 5% this quarter. Within soft tissue, our synthetic hernia business grew 8% in Q1. 
In biologics, we were very pleased with the first full quarter of sales from our XenMatrix AB product, which is a porcine graft with an antibiotic coating. Thanks to the contribution from this new first-of-its-kind device, our total biologic category was flat in Q1, reversing a trend of double-digit declines. 
We have the broadest portfolio in hernia repair across all types of products, from a wide range of synthetics to natural tissue and now antibiotic coated natural tissue. We are working with physicians to identify the right product for the right patient and provide a wide range of options for them. 
Our hernia fixation line declined 9% this quarter -- 7% this quarter, within the range of recent experience. As you'll hear from John DeFord, we have some new products in our pipeline that we believe will help us get back to growth in this category. 
We are well past the anniversaries of our acquisitions of BioSurgery, and that business grew double digits again this quarter. We remain bullish on the long-term opportunity here. 
This concludes our product line revenue discussion. I'll now turn you over to John DeFord."

And as you'll hear in my update, our pipeline and plans show a very active 2015 and beyond. 
I'll start with drug-coated balloons, where we're making good progress on additional sizes and indications worldwide. We filed the PMA supplement for additional balloon sizes for use in the SFA and popliteal and anticipate launch in the back half of this year. 
In our clinical activities, we've completed initial follow-up in our Levant 2 Japan study. We're in the data analysis phase, and we expect to submit in the back half of the year for approval. Enrollment continues in our Below the Knee and in-stent restenosis IDE studies. And we recently submitted the IDE for our AV access study with enrollment anticipated to start in Q3. We're also working toward the start of our Levant China study and expect to begin enrollment in the back half of the year. 
The Levant 2 study design was described in detail in a recent publication authored by Dr. Michael Jaff and several investigators in the American Heart Journal. We also expect the 24-months Levant 2 results to be presented at SVS in June. 
Also in Vascular, the LifeStream Balloon Expandable Covered Stent clinical study is recruiting quickly, and we anticipate completing enrollment later this year. This IDE evaluates the technology for the treatment of iliac artery disease. 
In other stent graft news, our next-generation device for use in AV access is nearing completion and development, and we anticipate launching in Europe in Q4. This product will require a clinical study for U.S. approval, and we anticipate filing the IDE and initiating a study in the first half of 2016. 
We have a new venous stent project that's on a similar development pathway with launch anticipated in Europe in Q4 and an IDE study expected to begin around the end of the year. 
Next, moving to Urology. We've launched our new skyline sub 2 French stone basket family and are working to expand the platform with 2.4 and 3 French versions expected later this year. 
Also in endourology, we anticipate launching our new access sheath system in the back half of the year. We believe these new products provide the urologist with needed improvements to some of the tools they're currently using in this important interventional space. 
In home care, we're nearing the launch of a new intermittent self-catheterization product, the Magic 3 Touchless, slated for release in Q3. Magic 3 Touchless combines the comfort and insertion benefits of the Magic 3 platform, combined with our touchless closed system designed to reduce the risk of contamination and infection due to catheter insertion. We've got a couple of other products in our intermittent catheter family that are slated to launch later this year. But I'll hold back the details until we get closer to product release. 
Moving to Oncology. We recently received U.S. regulatory clearance for our freehand stereotactic system for Vascular Access, named Pinpoint GT. The Pinpoint GT technology will be offered on the new Site-Rite 8 ultrasound system slated for launch later in the year. We believe the combination of Site-Rite ultrasound, Pinpoint GT Needle Guidance and 3CG Diamond catheter tip confirmation in an integrated system will provide a complete clinical solution for vascular catheter placement. 
In PICC, we're on track for a Q3 regulatory submission for our new thromboresistant coating. Upon regulatory clearance, we plan to launch a broad line of catheters marketed under the COVERT PICC trade name. We expect to follow the COVERT PICC with a combined antimicrobial and thromboresistant coating planned for launch in the back half of 2016. 
In midlines, we launched the 22-gauge PowerGlide catheter in Q1, completing our sizes in the PowerGlide product family. We're also making good progress on our next generation of midline catheters and anticipate our U.S. regulatory submission in Q4 with a first half 2016 launch. 
For the acute hemodialysis patient, we're expanding upon our market-leading Trialysis catheter family with the anticipated regulatory clearance and launch later this quarter of our new Trialysis slim. Trialysis slim incorporates superior flexibility, kink resistance and flow rates in excess of 400 milliliters per minute in a small 12-French triple lumen catheter configuration. 
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery. On our last call, we told you about our launch of the first antibiotic coated biologic mesh, XenMatrix AB. As John Weiland told you, the product is receiving excellent early feedback, and we're working hard to expand the size matrix available, with additional launches expected over the course of the next several quarters. 
We're also making good progress toward the launch of a new product family that incorporates our proven Sepra barrier technology with our Phasix bioresorbable mesh family to create the Phasix ST. Phasix ST is designed for intra-abdominal placement and is on track to launch in Q3. This new offering supplements XenMatrix AB, XenMatrix and Phasix to allow us to offer proprietary and differentiated products designed to address the entire spectrum of complex abdominal wall repairs. 
Moving onto our BioSurgery product family. In early Q3 of 2014, we filed our PMA supplement for our Progel sealant, seeking expanded use in video-assisted and robot-assisted thoracic surgery. We received approval from FDA earlier this quarter, and I'm pleased to announce the launch is underway ahead of schedule. 
Also in January of this year, we completed follow-up in our Tridyne vascular sealant pivotal IDE study. Analysis is complete and the team is working toward PMA submission this quarter. Following this time line, we anticipate approval and launch in mid-2016. 
And finally, in mesh fixation, we're gearing up for the launch in the next couple of weeks of our first spring-loaded resorbable tack device named OPTIFIX. OPTIFIX has been designed to employ stored energy for ease and efficiency of tack delivery while reducing tissue trauma that's been associated with some competitive devices. 
In past calls, I've told you that we have another fixation platform under development, but we've not disclosed the details. Now the time is right and I'm pleased to announce that we anticipate launching our new permanent fixation device named Capsure later this quarter. Capsure is the result of several years of analysis of the permanent fixation market and was designed to reduce the risk of tissue injury due to exposed sharps and concern over adhesions and reliability, while providing the functional requirements of a permanent tack, including the ability to penetrate hard tissues such as Cooper's ligament. With these 2 fixation launches, we're excited to move back to playing offense in this highly competitive space. 
Thanks for your attention today. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. Now I'll hand our discussion over to Chris."

Let me start by covering certain items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. We got a credit and acquisition-related items of $9.2 million pretax, a $3.9 million pretax charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives, and we recorded expense of $10.3 million, primarily related to the judge's order in the women's health litigation that we work up 500 cases simultaneously. The P&L impact of these items is detailed in the notes to the financial statements and in the reconciliation accompanying our Q1 earnings press release. 
Now let's go to the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $508.5 million or 62% of sales for Q1. On an adjusted basis, GP was $498.6 million or 60.8% of sales, down 60 basis points from the prior year quarter, consistent with our guidance. FX costs us 30 basis points in GP this quarter and the new amortization from the Q4 2014 Lutonix approval was 40 basis points in Q1. 
Price pressure drove 130 basis points on the revenue line in Q1 and about 50 basis points of headwind on GPs, consistent with our expectations. Our cost improvements drove about 40 basis points of benefit to GPs this quarter, and mix was favorable by about 20 basis points. 
As we look to Q2, we expect gross margin to be similar to the Q2 2014 level, despite FX pressure and the incremental amortization. 
SG&A expenses were $235.7 million for the quarter or 28.8% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A as a percent of sales was 28.7%, a decrease of 90 basis points. We are on track with our annual guidance of delivering improved P&L leverage for the full year. 
R&D expenditures totaled $60.6 million for the first quarter or 7.4% of sales on both a reported and adjusted basis, consistent with our guidance. Interest expense was $11.3 million for the first quarter. 
Other income and expense was $16.3 million of expense for the first quarter as reported and $1.6 million of expense on an adjusted basis. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% on a reported basis and 24.9% on an adjusted basis, the same level as a year ago. And again, our full year guidance assumes the renewal of the R&D tax credit, but that will not be included in the reported numbers until it is renewed. 
Diluted shares for the period were 75.8 million, and we purchased 1.2 million shares during the first quarter. The net result is adjusted EPS of $2.10, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter. 
The balance sheet as of March 31 reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of approximately $1.03 billion versus $1.01 billion at December 31. For the quarter, accounts receivable days were up 0.7 days, and inventory days were up 0.3 days. Capital expenditures totaled $29 million for the quarter. 
On the liability side, total debt was $1.6 billion as of March 31 compared to $1.5 billion at the end of December. Debt-to-total cap at the end of the first quarter was about 48%, and total shareholder investment was $1.7 billion at March 31. 
In looking at Q2, we're expecting constant currency sales growth between 4.5% and 5.5% and would expect organic growth to be within the same range. We are now expecting currency headwinds based on exchange rates at their current levels to reduce reported sales by about 4% for Q2 and the full year, up from about 3% in original -- in our original guidance in January. 
From an adjusted EPS standpoint, excluding items affecting comparability and the amortization of intangibles, we see the second quarter in the $2.15 to $2.19 range. 
Despite the challenging and volatile FX environment, based on exchange rates at their current levels, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS between $8.95 and $9.05 for the full year of 2015. 
And with that, I'll hand the call back to Tim."

I'd like to welcome all of you to Bard's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call, and thank all of you for taking the time to join us today. We would expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 25 minutes and the total call to last about an hour. The agenda today will go as follows: I'll begin with an overview of the results for the second quarter; John Weiland, our President and Chief Operating Officer, will review our second quarter product line revenue; John DeFord, our Senior VP of Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you a brief update on our product pipeline; and then, Chris Holland, our Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer, will review the second quarter income statement, and the balance sheet, as well as our expectations for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. And then finally, we'll close with Q&A. 
Second quarter 2015 net sales totaled $859.8 million, that's up 4% over Q2 of last year and on an as-reported basis, and up 8% on a constant currency basis. Currency impact for the quarter was unfavorable by about 380 basis points. The royalty payment we received from Gore in the quarter was approximately $36.9 million, that's down 2% from a year ago. We believe the decline's due to the FX headwinds, but we don't receive that level of detail from them. Our organic revenue growth was approximately 8.2% this quarter, which exceeded our expectations, that does include a little more than 250 basis points of benefit from drug-coated balloon sales in the U.S. alone. 
Net loss for the second quarter of 2015 was $54.7 million and diluted loss per share was $0.74, which included the net charge for product liability. Excluding this and other items that affected the comparability of results between periods, which Chris will cover later, adjusted second quarter 2015 net income and diluted earnings per share were $154.3 million and $2.27, that's up 8% and 10%, respectively. These adjusted results exceeded the guidance we provided for the quarter and the first half of the year is coming little bit better than we projected. 
Looking at the revenue growth geographically compared to the second quarter of 2014. Net sales in the U.S. increased 7%. On a constant currency basis, Europe grew 5%, Japan was up 2% and our other international businesses grew 20%. We continue to be very pleased with the acceleration we're seeing in emerging markets, which represented 10% of our total sales in the second quarter, with all of our major geographic categories contributing strong double-digit growth. We are seeing good returns from our increased investments over the last couple of years. 
As we told you, a key objective of our investment plan was to accelerate the growth rates of the company. In Q2, every business performed either at the top or above our stated guidance range for each category. And each of the major growth drivers that we've been highlighting, mainly, emerging markets, drug-coated balloons, BioSurgery, homecare and Targeted Temperature Management, all grew in the healthy double-digit for the quarter. We continue to believe that executing our investment plan will allow us to provide a sustainable, above market revenue growth rate for the overall portfolio in the mid- to high single digits for the track of returns for shareholders. 
On the business development front, in early July, we acquired Vascular Pathways and this technology to enhance our wider assisted Vascular Access devices for approximately $90 million, plus milestones. While the existing revenue's very small, we believe this strengthens our future pipeline and revenue opportunity long term in a very large and important market for us. 
With that, let me turn you over to John Weiland for a review of our product line growth revenue."

Before I start, let me point out that I will be giving all percentage growth dated comparison to prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless noted otherwise. 
So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $248.6 million, up 7% over last year on an as-reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the royalty payment that a transition agreement related to the divestiture of electrophysiology products, total Vascular sales were up 15% in Q2, with the United States business up 18% and international up 11%. Sales in our Surgical Graft target category were down 5% in the second quarter, within the range of recent experience. Our Endovascular business grew 17% in the second quarter, excluding the Gore royalty. The key driver of this growth was strong Lutonix sales globally, which drove our peripheral PTA line to increase 45%. Our Stent business declined 3% in Q2, consistent with recent trends. Sales in our vena cava filter line were up 8% in Q2 and as disclosed previously, we recently had FDA inspections that resulted in a warning letter and we are working closely with the agency to resolve the issues identified. And to complete the Vascular category, our biopsy family of products grew 11% this quarter, driven by over 40% growth in emerging markets. Biopsy is one of our more global product lines in the portfolio, with approximately 60% of our sales coming from outside the United States. 
Let's go to Urology. Total net sales were $209.2 million, up 1% on an as-reported basis and up 4% on a constant currency basis compared to the second quarter of 2014. The United States business was up 4% while internationally, we grew 6%. Our basic drainage business was up 3%, both globally and in the United States, with our IC Foley business down 2% globally and 4% in the United States. Our Targeted Temperature Management products grew in the healthy double-digits again this quarter. Our continence business was up 4% in Q2 compared to a year ago. Sales in urological specialties were up 3% this quarter, including our therapy business, which grew at 1%. And finally, in this category, standalone sales of our StatLock catheter stabilization line increased 2% in the second quarter. 
So let's move on to Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $235.2 million, an increase of 5% on an as-reported basis and 8% on a constant currency basis over Q2 last year. Geographically, net sales in the United States were up 5% and international sales were up 17%. Our fourth business was up 1% versus Q2 of last year. Our PICC revenue was up 11% this quarter, with each of our major geographical regions performing well. As we've said before, we believe PICCs represent our largest single, outside of the United States revenue growth opportunity and we are focused on developing the international markets and advancing lives in the delivery of health care across the globe. Our Vascular Access Ultrasound product line grew 20% this quarter, with significant growth coming from both the United States and internationally. And to close out this category, our Dialysis Access product line was up 7% this quarter. 
Let's conclude with our Surgical Specialties business. Total net sales in this category were $143.8 million, up 3% as reported and up 6% on a constant currency basis. United States sales were up 6% and international sales were up 9% this quarter. We are pleased with the continued momentum from our BioSurgery business, which grew in the healthy double-digits, again, this quarter. Our soft tissue repair business grew 8% in the second quarter, which is the best result since the first quarter of 2011. Our synthetic hernia products grew 9% this quarter and our natural tissue products grew 8%, driven by our new XenMatrix, antibacterial NAB. And our hernia fixation business, which is included in the soft tissue repair subtotal, declined 5% this quarter. John DeFord will tell you about a couple of launches that we hope can change the trajectory here. 
Closing out the surgical category in Q2, our performance irrigation business was down 35%, similar to last quarter as we told you that we discontinued certain product lines in this category at the beginning of 2015. 
This concludes our product line revenue discussion. I'll now turn you over to John DeFord for our pipeline update."

Q2 is a pretty busy quarter for our R&D teams and for the second time, I'll just hit some of the highlights today. 
I'll start with drug-coated balloons, where we're excited to report publication of the Levant 2 study and the New England Journal of Medicine in July. We also released a first look at the 24-month results from the Levant 2 study and data from our global registry at the society of Vascular surgery meeting in mid-June. While those are important events, we're continuing to push forward with additional configuration, sizes and indications worldwide. Our PMA supplement for 120 and 150-millimeter balloon links was recently approved in the rollout of these sizes is underway for use in the SFA and popliteal arteries. Enrollment continues in our IDE and in-stent restenosis studies and we received IDE approval and enrolled the first few patients in our AV Access drug-coated balloons study. We're also on track to start our Levant China clinical trial and enroll our first patient before the end of the year. 
Also in Vascular, the live stream balloon expandable covered stent IDE continues to enroll very rapidly and I'm pleased to announce that we've completed enrollment of the initial cohort required for analysis of our primary endpoint. We're continuing to enroll a larger cohort and anticipate completing recruitment by the end of the year. This clinical study's evaluating the technology for the treatment of iliac artery disease with a 9-month follow-up. 
In other Stent graft news, our next-generation device for using AV Access is in final internal testing and we anticipate launching in Europe in Q4. This product will require a clinical study for U.S. approval and we anticipate filing the IDE and initiating the study in the first half of 2016. Our Stent project is on a similar development pathway and we anticipate launching in Europe in Q4 and initiating an IDE study around the end of the year. 
Next, moving to Urology and homecare. We're anticipating the launch of a new intermittent self catheterization product, the Magic 3 touch list, later this quarter. Magic 3 touch list combines the comfort and insertion benefits of the Magic 3 platform with our touch list closed system to reduce the risk of contamination and infection due to catheter insertion in more challenging environments outside of the hospital. In June, we launched our new Hydro 2 intermittent catheter designed specifically for the female patient. Hydro cirrhosis 2 incorporates a new handle design to further ease insertion with the technology of our Magic 3 silicone catheter and very low friction coating. The new handle's also designed to simplify the interface of the catheter with the drainage bag for enhanced patient control. 
Closing this category, I'm happy to tell you about our new self lubricating catheterization product, the Magic 3 Go. This new family of catheters anticipated to begin rollout around the end of the year, incorporates our new and proprietary coating technology that provides a hydrophilic low friction insertion without the mess and inconvenience of a water sachet. This new coating provides a sterile and wetted catheter service straight from the package without excess moisture and is designed specifically to address the needs of users outside the acute setting that may have limited dexterity. 
Moving to Oncology. Earlier this month, we launched the new Site-Rite 8 ultrasound system with integrated 3CG Diamond in Europe. This Site-Rite 8 with pinpoint GT technology and 3CG Diamond is slated for U.S. launch in Q4. We believe the combination of ultrasound, needle guidance and catheter tip confirmation in an integrated system will provide a full-featured, user-friendly and intuitive solution for Vascular catheter placement. 
In PICCs, we submitted for U.S. regulatory clearance a new catheter line that's highly resistant to the chemicals used in chemotherapy, as well as cleaning and disinfecting agents. This new and proprietary material is designed for extended exposure to these various solutions while maintaining the catheter characteristics that have made our PICCs the market leader. We anticipate product launch in Q4. 
As Tim announced, we've recently closed the acquisition of Vascular Pathways and have begun selling the acu-cath product. We believe the combination of our PICCs, power glide, midline family and acu-cath will help us bring the best guide wire system peripheral devices to a broad spectrum of patients with Vascular Access needs. 
We're also working toward the launch in the first half of 2016 of a next generation of both the POWERGLIDE and acu-cath products. 
For the acute hemodialysis patient, we've recently launched our new Trialysis Slim catheter. Trialysis Slim incorporates superior visibility and kink resistance, which flow rates in excess of 400 milliliters per minute in a small 12 French triple [indiscernible] catheter configuration. 
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery, and I'm pleased to present a series of launches ongoing or anticipated this quarter. First, in hernia repair, our new physics ST is expected to launch in just a couple of weeks. Physics ST incorporates our proven separate barrier technology with our bioresorbable physics mash to provide a fully resolvable hernia repair solution. This new offering supplements XenMatrix AB, XenMatrix and phasics and allows us to offer proprietary and differentiated products that address the spectrum of complex of domino wall repairs. 
Moving on to our BioSurgery product family. In Q2, we filed our PMA supplement, seeking approval for our new Vascular sealant and continue to anticipate approval in launch in mid-2016. 
And finally, in mesh fixation, we're in the early launch phase of our OPTIFIX spring-loaded resolvable tack device. OPTIFIX has been designed to employ stored energy for ease and efficiency of tack differently while reducing tissue trauma that's been associated with some other fixation devices. We're also in the early rollout of our new permanent fixation device named Capsure. Capsure's designed to reduce the risk of tissue injury due to exposed sharps seen on some other permanent fixation devices and incorporate to small cap on the tack to reduce the risk of adhesions, also seen with some other products. With these 2 fixation launches, we're excited to move back to playing offense in this highly competitive space. 
Thanks for your attention. Let me now hand it over to Chris."
254131,305681277,837662,"CR Bard Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","C. R. Bard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Let's first start with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. First quarter, we received $210.5 million related to the ruling in the Gore litigation. In product liability matters, based on recent develop",952,"Thank you, John. Let's first start with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. 
First quarter, we received $210.5 million related to the ruling in the Gore litigation. In product liability matters, based on recent developments, including progress on several large settlements, in Q2, we recorded a net charge of $343.7 million, primarily related to pelvic health product litigation. We also had acquisition-related items of $4.5 million in the quarter and charges of $8.5 million related to restructuring and productivity initiatives. The P&L impact for these items is detailed in the notes to the financial statements and the reconciliation accompanying our Q2 earnings press release. 
Now let's go to the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $526.1 million or 61.2% of sales for Q2. On an adjusted basis, GP was 61.4% of sales, up 10 basis points from the prior year quarter, a little better than we expected. New amortization of intangibles relating to activity in the last 12 months cost us about 30 basis points year-over-year this quarter. Price was unfavorable at 120 basis points on the revenue line and 40 basis points in gross profit, consistent with expectations. And foreign exchange was about a 50 basis point headwind to gross margin in the quarter. Mix was favorable by 40 basis points and our cost improvements and the timing of manufacturing variances drove approximately 90 basis points of favorability in GP in Q2. 
As we've described in the past, manufacturing variances can be somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter and in comparison to prior year, causing some ebbs and flows in GP. So in Q3, we expect the gross margin of about 61% even. Our cost savings and margin improvement programs are on track and we remain comfortable with our full year guidance of GPs of between 61.4% and 61.8%. 
SG&A expenses were $250 million for the quarter or 29.1% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 29% even or 60 basis points lower than Q2 of 2014, consistent with our full year guidance. R&D expenditures totaled $64 million for the second quarter or 7.4% of sales on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, R&D expense as a percentage of sales was 7.3%. Again, consistent with our full year guidance. I'll remind you that a couple of years ago, we significantly increased the level of R&D investment and we are now seeing leverage from that higher investment level as sales increase. We remain on offense from an investment standpoint and based on what we've seen in the results in the first half of the year, on sales and income, we intend to increase funding towards certain projects in both SG&A and R&D that we believe that drive long-term shareholder value. Interest expense was $11.2 million for the second quarter and other income and expense was $141.7 million of expense for the second quarter as reported or zero on an adjusted basis. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.9%, down 80 basis points from the prior year. We continue to expect the effective tax rate for the full year to improve between zero and 50 basis points when compared to the full year 2014. As a reminder, our full year EPS guidance continues to assume the renewal of the R&D tax credit in Q4. 
Diluted shares for the period were $75.5 million and we repurchased approximately 194,000 shares in the second quarter. The net result is adjusted EPS of $2.27, well above the range we provided for the quarter, driven primarily by the over achievement in sales. 
The balance sheet as of June 30 reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1.1 billion compared to $1.03 billion at March 31. For the quarter, accounts receivables days were down 0.4 days and inventory days were up 0.6 days. Capital expenditures totaled $28.4 million in the quarter. 
On the liability side. Total debt was $1.4 billion as of June 30 compared to $1.6 billion at March 31. Debt-to-total capital at the end of the second quarter was about 46% and total shareholder investment was $1.7 billion as of June 30. 
Now moving to financial guidance. For Q3, we are expecting constant currency sales growth between 6% and 7% and organic sales growth between 6.5% and 7.5%. We expect the Gore royalty to decline compared to the prior year due to foreign exchange. With regard to the full year, we now expect constant currency sales growth to be between 5% and 6% and organic sales growth to be between 5.5% and 6.5%, which is a full 150 basis point improvement from our original guidance in January. And we now expect foreign exchange to reduce sales for both Q3 and the full year by about 350 basis points. From an EPS standpoint, excluding items affecting comparability, we expect the third quarter in the range of $2.21 to $2.25 per share, reflecting a somewhat lower gross margin and the higher R&D spend compared to Q2 in the prior year. For the full year, we're increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a range of $9 to $9.10. This higher range reflects modest dilution from a recent acquisition and the increased investments we expect to make in SG&A and R&D during the second half of 2015. 
In summary, the first half of the year has gone quite well from both a sales and profitability perspective. As we now move to the second half, we remain focused on executing our investment plan and pursuing strategic opportunities, with the clear objective of driving attractive and sustainable revenue growth, profitability and shareholder returns over the long term. 
I'll now turn you back to Tim."

I would say, we're pleased with our emerging market growth and that's a lot of moving parts, but everything seems to be moving in the right direction and it works for us."

So I was hoping you could help me understand sort of the dilution around the Vascular Pathways. Is that going to be just a portion on your gross margins? Or SG&A going forward? Or how should we think about that as we model going forward? And then with Gore, I think the royalty comes off in 2019. And just trying to figure out, at this point, since it's a while away, what are you thinking about in terms of how do you replace it? Is it mostly new indications really sort of organic, organic  growth, other segments of the business step up, inorganic acquisitions? Or how should we think about what's going to replace that in the long run?"

We'll be looking to really relaunch it more broadly in '16. So I said it's $0.02 to $0.03 dilutive in '15, we're obviously covering that while still increasing our guidance for the year. It will be relatively limited sales and breakeven on a cash EPS standpoint in '16 and then, it'll become accretive in '17 beyond. As John DeFord said, it's really interesting technology addition to the Vascular Access product portfolio for us and we think it will be an excellent long-term value creating investment for us. But again, I mean, I think it's too small at this stage for you to worry too much about and from a near term standpoint, we've covered the dilution. I think the Gore royalty in 2019, we've talked about for a number of quarters now, the objective of everything we're doing is frankly, by 2019, to make that royalty a smaller and smaller and less significant portion of the P&L. Obviously, this quarter helps in that regard. We're looking, internally and externally, to find things that will provide good organic growth and then good through so as we get to 2019, again, our portfolio's performing in a way that helps to overcome some of that. And I think we've been pretty frank about continuing that a lot of balance sheet flexibility to help mitigate that impact as you jump from '19 to '20 through utilizing the balance sheet through increased share repurchase activity. So we spent a lot of time planning and thinking about it and obviously, as we get to 2019, there'll be an opportunity for us to give you more visibility. But we're certainly thinking about it in a way that it's -- it will be manageable and we'll make sure we do everything we can to mitigate the impact for investors."

I'd like to welcome all of you to Bard's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call and thank all of you for taking the time to join us today. We would expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 25 minutes and the total call to last about an hour. The agenda today will go as follows: I'll begin with an overview of the results for the second quarter; John Weiland, our President and Chief Operating Officer, will review our second quarter product line revenue; John DeFord, our Senior VP of Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you a brief update on our product pipeline; and then, Chris Holland, our Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer, will review the second quarter income statement and the balance sheet as well as our expectations for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. And then finally, we'll close with Q&A. 
Second quarter 2015 net sales totaled $859.8 million, that's up 4% over Q2 of last year and on an as-reported basis, and up 8% on a constant currency basis. Currency impact for the quarter was unfavorable by about 380 basis points. The royalty payment we received from Gore in the quarter was approximately $36.9 million, that's down 2% from a year ago. We believe the decline is due to FX headwinds, but we don't receive that level of detail from them. Our organic revenue growth was approximately 8.2% this quarter, which exceeded our expectations. That does include a little more than 250 basis points of benefit from drug-coated balloon sales in the U.S. alone. 
Net loss for the second quarter of 2015 was $54.7 million and diluted loss per share was $0.74, which included a net charge from product liability. Excluding this and other items that affected the comparability of results between periods, which Chris will cover later, adjusted second quarter 2015 net income and diluted earnings per share were $154.3 million and $2.27, that's up 8% and 10%, respectively. These adjusted results exceeded the guidance we provided for the quarter, and the first half of the year is coming little bit better than we projected. 
Looking at the revenue growth geographically compared to the second quarter of 2014. Net sales in the U.S. increased 7%. On a constant currency basis, Europe grew 5%, Japan was up 2% and our other international businesses grew 20%. We continue to be very pleased with the acceleration we're seeing in emerging markets, which represented 10% of our total sales in the second quarter, with all of our major geographic categories contributing strong double-digit growth. We're seeing good returns from our increased investments over the last couple of years.
As we told you, a key objective of our investment plan was to accelerate the growth rates of the company. In Q2, every business performed either at the top or above our stated guidance range for each category. And each of the major growth drivers that we've been highlighting, mainly emerging markets, drug-coated balloons, BioSurgery, homecare and Targeted Temperature Management, all grew in the healthy double digits this quarter. We continue to believe that executing our investment plan will allow us to provide a sustainable, above market revenue growth rate for the overall portfolio in the mid- to high single digits for the track of returns for shareholders. 
On the business development front, in early July, we acquired Vascular Pathways and this is a technology to enhance our wider assisted Vascular Access devices for approximately $90 million, plus milestones. While the existing revenue is very small, we believe this strengthens our future pipeline and revenue opportunity long term in a very large and important market for us. 
With that, let me turn you over to John Weiland for a review of our product line revenue."

Before I start, let me point out that I will be giving all percentage growth dated in comparison to prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless noted otherwise. So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $248",734,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, let me point out that I will be giving all percentage growth dated in comparison to prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless noted otherwise. 
So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $248.6 million, up 7% over last year on an as-reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the royalty payment and transition agreement related to the divestiture of electrophysiology products, total Vascular sales were up 15% in Q2, with the United States business up 18% and international up 11%. Sales in our Surgical Graft target category were down 5% in the second quarter, within the range of recent experience. Our Endovascular business grew 17% in the second quarter, excluding the Gore royalty. The key driver of this growth was strong Lutonix sales globally, which drove our peripheral PTA line to increase 45%. Our Stent business declined 3% in Q2, consistent with recent trends. Sales in our Vena Cava Filter line were up 8% in Q2. And as disclosed previously, we recently had FDA inspections that resulted in a warning letter, and we are working closely with the agency to resolve the issues identified. And to complete the Vascular category, our biopsy family of products grew 11% this quarter, driven by over 40% growth in emerging markets. Biopsy is one of our more global product lines in the portfolio, with approximately 60% of our sales coming from outside the United States. 
Let's go to Urology. Total net sales were $209.2 million, up 1% on an as-reported basis and up 4% on a constant currency basis compared to the second quarter of 2014. The United States business was up 4%, while internationally, we grew 6%. Our basic drainage business was up 3%, both globally and in the United States, with our I.C. Foley business down 2% globally and 4% in the United States. Our Targeted Temperature Management products grew in the healthy double-digits again this quarter. Our continence business was up 4% in Q2 compared to a year ago. Sales in Urological Specialties were up 3% this quarter, including our brachytherapy business, which grew at 1%. And finally, in this category, standalone sales of our StatLock catheter stabilization line increased 2% in the second quarter. 
So let's move on to Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $235.2 million, an increase of 5% on an as-reported basis and 8% on a constant currency basis over Q2 last year. Geographically, net sales in the United States were up 5% and international sales were up 17%. Our fourth business was up 1% versus Q2 of last year. Our PICC revenue was up 11% this quarter, with each of our major geographical regions performing well. As we've said before, we believe PICCs represent our largest single, outside of the United States revenue growth opportunity and we are focused on developing the international markets and advancing lives in the delivery of health care across the globe. Our Vascular Access Ultrasound product line grew 20% this quarter, with significant growth coming from both the United States and internationally. And to close out this category, our Dialysis Access product line was up 7% this quarter. 
Let's conclude with our Surgical Specialties business. Total net sales in this category were $143.8 million, up 3% as reported and up 6% on a constant currency basis. United States sales were up 6% and international sales were up 9% this quarter. We are pleased with the continued momentum from our BioSurgery business, which grew in the healthy double digits again this quarter. Our soft tissue repair business grew 8% in the second quarter, which is the best result since the first quarter of 2011. Our synthetic hernia products grew 9% this quarter and our natural tissue products grew 8%, driven by our new XenMatrix antibacterial porcine match or Xen AB. And our hernia fixation business, which is included in the soft tissue repair subtotal, declined 5% this quarter. John DeFord will tell you about a couple of launches that we hope can change the trajectory here. 
Closing out the surgical category in Q2, our Performance Irrigation business was down 35%, similar to last quarter, as we told you that we discontinued certain product lines in this category at the beginning of 2015. 
This concludes our product line revenue discussion. I'll now turn you over to John DeFord for our pipeline update."

Q2 is a pretty busy quarter for our R&D teams and for the sake of time, I'll just hit some of the highlights today. 
I'll start with drug-coated balloons, where we're excited to report publication of the Levant 2 study in the New England Journal of Medicine on July 9. We also released the a first look at the 24-month results from the Levant 2 study and data from our global registry at the Society of Vascular Surgery meeting in mid-June. While those are important events, we're continuing to push forward with additional configuration, sizes and indications worldwide. Our PMA supplement for 120- and 150-millimeter balloon links was recently approved, and the rollout of these sizes is underway for use in the SFA and popliteal arteries. Enrollment continues in our Bellow the Knee, IDE and in-stent restenosis studies and we received IDE approval and enrolled the first few patients in our AV Access drug-coated balloons study. We're also on track to start our Levant China clinical trial and enroll our first patient before the end of the year. 
Also in Vascular, the LifeStream Balloon Expandable Covered Stent IDE continues to enroll very rapidly and I'm pleased to announce that we've completed enrollment of the initial cohort required for analysis of our primary endpoint. We're continuing to enroll a larger cohort and anticipate completing recruitment by the end of the year. This clinical study is evaluating the technology for the treatment of iliac artery disease with a 9-month followup. 
In other Stent Graft news, our next-generation device for using AV Access is in final internal testing and we anticipate launching in Europe in Q4. This product will require a clinical study for U.S. approval and we anticipate filing the IDE and initiating a study in the first half of 2016. Our venous stent project is on a similar development pathway and we anticipate launching in Europe in Q4 and initiating an IDE study around the end of the year. 
Next, moving to Urology and home care. We're anticipating the launch of a new intermittent self catheterization product, the Magic 3 touchless, later this quarter. Magic 3 touchless combines the comfort and insertion benefits of the Magic 3 platform with our touchless closed system to reduce the risk of contamination and infection due to catheter insertion in more challenging environments outside of the hospital. In June, we launched our new Hydrosil Rose 2 intermittent catheter designed specifically for the female patient. Hydrosil Rose 2 incorporates a new handle design to further ease insertion with the technology of our Magic 3 silicone catheter and very low friction coating. The new handle is also designed to simplify the interface of the catheter with the drainage bag for enhanced patient control. 
Closing this category, I'm happy to tell you about our new self lubricating catheterization product, the Magic 3 Go. This new family of catheters anticipated to begin rollout around the end of the year, incorporates our new and proprietary coating technology that provides a hydrophilic low-friction insertion without the mess and inconvenience of a water sachet. This new coating provides a sterile and wetted catheter surface straight from the package without excess moisture and is designed specifically to address the needs of users outside the acute setting that may have limited dexterity. 
Moving to Oncology. Earlier this month, we launched the new Site-Rite 8 ultrasound system, with integrated 3CG Diamond in Europe. This Site-Rite 8 with Pinpoint GT technology and 3CG Diamond is slated for U.S. launch in Q4. We believe the combination of ultrasounds, needle guidance and catheter tip confirmation in an integrated system will provide a full-featured, user-friendly and intuitive solution for vascular catheter placement. 
In PICCs, we submitted for U.S. regulatory clearance a new catheter line that's highly resistant to the chemicals used in chemotherapy as well as cleaning and disinfecting agents. This new and proprietary material is designed for extended exposure to these various solutions while maintaining the catheter characteristics that have made our PICCs the market leader. We anticipate product launch in Q4. 
As Tim announced, we've recently closed the acquisition of Vascular Pathways and have begun selling the AccuCath product. We believe the combination of our PICCs, PowerGlide Midline family and AccuCath will help us bring the best guidewire assisted peripheral devices to a broad spectrum of patients with Vascular Access needs. 
We're also working toward the launch in the first half of 2016 of a next-generation of both the PowerGlide and AccuCath products. 
For the acute hemodialysis patient, we've recently launched our new Trialysis Slim catheter. Trialysis Slim incorporates superior flexibility and kink resistance, with flow rates in excess of 400 milliliters per minute in a small 12 French triple lumen catheter configuration. 
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery, and I'm pleased to present a series of launches ongoing or anticipated this quarter. First, in hernia repair, our new Phasix ST is expected to launch in just a couple of weeks. Phasix ST incorporates our proven separate barrier technology with our bioresorbable Phasix mesh to provide a fully resorbable ventral hernia repair solution. This new offering supplements XenMatrix AB, XenMatrix and Phasix and allows us to offer proprietary and differentiated products that address the spectrum of complex abdominal wall repairs. 
Moving on to our BioSurgery product family. In Q2, we filed our PMA supplement, seeking approval for our new Tridyne vascular sealant and continue to anticipate approval and launch in mid-2016. And finally, in fixation, we're in the early launch phase of our OPTIFIX spring-loaded resorbable tack device. OPTIFIX has been designed to employ stored energy for ease and efficiency of tack delivery while reducing tissue trauma that's been associated with some other fixation devices. We're also in the early rollout of our new permanent fixation device named Capsure. Capsure is designed to reduce the risk of tissue injury due to exposed sharps seen on some other permanent fixation devices and incorporate to small cap on the tack to reduce the risk of adhesions, also seen with some other products. With these 2 fixation launches, we're excited to move back to playing offense in this highly competitive space. 
Thanks for your attention. Let me now hand it over to Chris."
254131,305681277,837909,"CR Bard Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","C. R. Bard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Let's first start with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. First quarter, we received $210.5 million related to the willfulness ruling in the Gore litigation. In product liability matters, based on re",952,"Thank you, John. Let's first start with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. 
First quarter, we received $210.5 million related to the willfulness ruling in the Gore litigation. In product liability matters, based on recent developments, including progress on several large settlements, in Q2, we've recorded a net charge of $343.7 million, primarily related to pelvic health product litigation. We also had acquisition-related items of $4.5 million in the quarter and charges of $8.5 million related to restructuring and productivity initiatives. The P&L impact for these items is detailed in the notes for the financial statements and the reconciliation accompanying our Q2 earnings press release. 
Now let's go to the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $526.1 million or 61.2% of sales for Q2. On an adjusted basis, GP was 61.4% of sales, up 10 basis points from the prior year quarter, a little better than we expected. New amortization of intangibles relating to activity in the last 12 months cost us about 30 basis points year-over-year this quarter. Price was unfavorable at 120 basis points on the revenue line and 40 basis points in gross profit, consistent with expectations. And foreign exchange was about a 50 basis point headwind to gross margin in the quarter. Mix was favorable by 40 basis points and our cost improvements and the timing of manufacturing variances drove approximately 90 basis points of favorability in GP in Q2.
As we've described in the past, manufacturing variances can be somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter and in comparison to prior year, causing some ebbs and flows in GP. So in Q3, we expect the gross margin of about 61% even. Our cost savings and margin improvement programs are on track and we remain comfortable with our full year guidance of GPs of between 61.4% and 61.8%.
SG&A expenses were $250 million for the quarter or 29.1% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 29% even or 60 basis points lower than Q2 of 2014, consistent with our full year guidance. R&D expenditures totaled $64 million for the second quarter or 7.4% of sales on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, R&D expense as a percentage of sales was 7.3%, again, consistent with our full year guidance. I'll remind you that a couple of years ago, we significantly increased the level of R&D investment and we are now seeing leverage from that higher investment level as sales increased. We remain on offense from an investment standpoint, and based on what we've seen in the results in the first half of the year on sales and income, we intend to increase funding towards certain projects in both SG&A and R&D that we believe drive long-term shareholder value. Interest expense was $11.2 million for the second quarter and other income and expense was $141.7 million of expense for the second quarter as reported or zero on an adjusted basis. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.9%, down 80 basis points from the prior year. We continue to expect the effective tax rate for the full year to improve between zero and 50 basis points when compared to the full year 2014. As a reminder, our full year EPS guidance continues to assume the renewal of the R&D tax credit in Q4. 
Diluted shares for the period were $75.5 million and we repurchased approximately 194,000 shares in the second quarter. The net result is adjusted EPS of $2.27, well above the range we provided for the quarter, driven primarily by the over achievement in sales.
The balance sheet as of June 30 reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1.1 billion compared to $1.03 billion at March 31. For the quarter, accounts receivables days were down 0.4 days and inventory days were up 0.6 days. Capital expenditures totaled $28.4 million in the quarter.
On the liability side, total debt was $1.4 billion as of June 30 compared to $1.6 billion at March 31. Debt-to-total capital at the end of the second quarter was about 46% and total shareholder investment was $1.7 billion as of June 30.
Now moving to financial guidance. For Q3, we are expecting constant currency sales growth between 6% and 7% and organic sales growth between 6.5% and 7.5%. We expect the Gore royalty to decline compared to the prior year due to foreign exchange. With regard to the full year, we now expect constant currency sales growth to be between 5% and 6% and organic sales growth to be between 5.5% and 6.5%, which is a full 150 basis point improvement from our original guidance in January. And we now expect foreign exchange to reduce sales for both Q3 and the full year by about 350 basis points. From an EPS standpoint, excluding items affecting comparability, we expect the third quarter in the range of $2.21 to $2.25 per share, reflecting a somewhat lower gross margin and the higher R&D spend compared to Q2 in the prior year. For the full year, we're increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a range of $9 to $9.10. This higher range reflects modest dilution from a recent acquisition and the increased investments we expect to make in SG&A and R&D during the second half of 2015. 
In summary, the first half of the year has gone quite well from both a sales and profitability perspective. As we now move to the second half, we remain focused on executing our investment plan and pursuing strategic opportunities, with the clear objective of driving attractive and sustainable revenue growth, profitability and shareholder returns over the long term.

So a nice, strong improvement in organic. From an earnings standpoint, we've talked about some dilution from the acquisition of $0.02 to $0.03, and you'll see some stepped up investment in R&D and SG&A, relative to what we would've done frankly, otherwise, given the strength in the top line.

Obviously, this quarter helps in that regard. We're looking, internally and externally, to find things that will provide good organic growth and then good drop-throughs, so as we get to 2019, again, our portfolio is performing in a way that helps to overcome some of that. And I think we've been pretty frank about continuing to have a lot of balance sheet flexibility to help mitigate that impact as you jump from '19 to '20 through utilizing the balance sheet through increased share repurchase activity.

There's a lot of things that go when looking at deals and including our high filters. There've been some assets that have trended over the last couple of years and frankly, we've taken a look at it and passed on. Other companies have gotten forward and acquired those. They didn't meet our expectations on what our filters are, which are focused primarily on being a market leader, number one, and number two, product leadership, the sustainability of that and the revenue growth profile projected on a sustainable basis. So it just takes time and we're turning over a lot of rocks. And all I can tell you is we haven't changed our strategy or mindset relative to doing those things. We look at those as adding platforms to do more investment with going forward as just buying revenue. So I wouldn't read anything into one deal changing our outlook, one way or the other, from quarter-to-quarter."

And the data will tell us how that plays out.

I'd like to welcome all of you to Bard's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call and thank all of you for taking the time to join us today. We would expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 25 minutes and the total call to last about an hour. The agenda today will go as follows: I'll begin with an overview of the results for the second quarter; John Weiland, our President and Chief Operating Officer, will review our second quarter product line revenue; John DeFord, our Senior VP of Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you a brief update on our product pipeline; and then, Chris Holland, our Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer, will review the second quarter income statement and the balance sheet as well as our expectations for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. And then finally, we'll close with Q&A. 
Second quarter 2015 net sales totaled $859.8 million, that's up 4% over Q2 of last year on an as-reported basis, and up 8% on a constant currency basis. Currency impact for the quarter was unfavorable by about 380 basis points. The royalty payment we received from Gore in the quarter was approximately $36.9 million, that's down 2% from a year ago. We believe the decline is due to FX headwinds, but we don't receive that level of detail from them. Our organic revenue growth was approximately 8.2% this quarter, which exceeded our expectations. That does include a little more than 250 basis points of benefit from drug-coated balloon sales in the U.S. alone. 
Net loss for the second quarter of 2015 was $54.7 million and diluted loss per share was $0.74, which included a net charge from product liability. Excluding this and other items that affected the comparability of results between periods, which Chris will cover later, adjusted second quarter 2015 net income and diluted earnings per share were $154.3 million and $2.27, that's up 8% and 10%, respectively. These adjusted results exceeded the guidance we provided for the quarter, and the first half of the year is coming a little bit better than we projected. 
Looking at the revenue growth geographically compared to the second quarter of 2014. Net sales in the U.S. increased 7%. On a constant currency basis, Europe grew 5%, Japan was up 2% and our other international businesses grew 20%. We continue to be very pleased with the acceleration we're seeing in emerging markets, which represented 10% of our total sales in the second quarter, with all of our major geographic categories contributing strong double-digit growth. We're seeing good returns from our increased investments over the last couple of years.
As we told you, a key objective of our investment plan was to accelerate the growth rate of the company. In Q2, every business performed either at the top or above our stated guidance range for each category. And each of the major growth drivers that we've been highlighting, mainly emerging markets, drug-coated balloons, BioSurgery, homecare and Targeted Temperature Management, all grew in the healthy double digits this quarter. We continue to believe that executing our investment plan will allow us to provide a sustainable, above market revenue growth rate for the overall portfolio in the mid- to high single digits with attractive returns for shareholders. 
On the business development front, in early July, we acquired Vascular Pathways and its technology to enhance our wider assisted Vascular Access devices for approximately $90 million, plus milestones. While the existing revenue is very small, we believe this strengthens our future pipeline and revenue opportunity long term in a very large and important market for us. 
With that, let me turn you over to John Weiland for a review of our product line revenue."

So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $248.",734,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, let me point out that I will be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless noted otherwise. 
So let's begin with Vascular. Total net sales were $248.6 million, up 7% over last year on an as-reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the royalty payment and transition agreement related to the divestiture of electrophysiology products, total Vascular sales were up 15% in Q2, with the United States business up 18% and international up 11%. Sales in our Surgical Graft target category were down 5% in the second quarter, within the range of recent experience. Our Endovascular business grew 17% in the second quarter, excluding the Gore royalty. The key driver of this growth was strong Lutonix sales globally, which drove our peripheral PTA line to increase 45%. Our Stent business declined 3% in Q2, consistent with recent trends. Sales in our Vena Cava Filter line were up 8% in Q2. And as disclosed previously, we recently had FDA inspections that resulted in a warning letter, and we are working closely with the agency to resolve the issues identified. And to complete the Vascular category, our biopsy family of products grew 11% this quarter, driven by over 40% growth in emerging markets. Biopsy is one of our more global product lines in the portfolio, with approximately 60% of our sales coming from outside the United States. 
Let's go to Urology. Total net sales were $209.2 million, up 1% on an as-reported basis and up 4% on a constant currency basis compared to the second quarter of 2014. The United States business was up 4%, while internationally, we grew 6%. Our basic drainage business was up 3%, both globally and in the United States, with our I.C. Foley business down 2% globally and 4% in the United States. Our Targeted Temperature Management products grew in the healthy double-digits again this quarter. Our continence business was up 4% in Q2 compared to a year ago. Sales in Urological Specialties were up 3% this quarter, including our brachytherapy business, which grew at 1%. And finally, in this category, standalone sales of our StatLock catheter stabilization line increased 2% in the second quarter. 
So let's move on to Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $235.2 million, an increase of 5% on an as-reported basis and 8% on a constant currency basis over Q2 last year. Geographically, net sales in the United States were up 5% and international sales were up 17%. Our port business was up 1% versus Q2 of last year. Our PICC revenue was up 11% this quarter, with each of our major geographical regions performing well. As we've said before, we believe PICCs represent our largest single, outside of the United States revenue growth opportunity and we are focused on developing the international markets and advancing lives in the delivery of health care across the globe. Our Vascular Access Ultrasound product line grew 20% this quarter, with significant growth coming from both the United States and internationally. And to close out this category, our Dialysis Access product line was up 7% this quarter. 
Let's conclude with our Surgical Specialties business. Total net sales in this category were $143.8 million, up 3% as reported and up 6% on a constant currency basis. United States sales were up 6% and international sales were up 9% this quarter. We are pleased with the continued momentum from our BioSurgery business, which grew in the healthy double digits again this quarter. Our soft tissue repair business grew 8% in the second quarter, which is the best result since the first quarter of 2011. Our synthetic hernia products grew 9% this quarter and our natural tissue products grew 8%, driven by our new XenMatrix antibacterial porcine mesh or Xen AB. And our hernia fixation business, which is included in the soft tissue repair subtotal, declined 5% this quarter. John DeFord will tell you about a couple of launches that we hope can change the trajectory here. 
Closing out the surgical category in Q2, our Performance Irrigation business was down 35%, similar to last quarter, as we told you that we discontinued certain product lines in this category at the beginning of 2015. 
This concludes our product line revenue discussion. I'll now turn you over to John DeFord for our pipeline update."

Q2 is a pretty busy quarter for our R&D teams and for the sake of time, I'll just hit some of the highlights today. 
I'll start with drug-coated balloons, where we're excited to report publication of the Levant 2 study in the New England Journal of Medicine on July 9. We also released the a first look at the 24-month results from the Levant 2 study and data from our global registry at the Society of Vascular Surgery meeting in mid-June. While those are important events, we're continuing to push forward with additional configuration, sizes and indications worldwide. Our PMA supplement for 120- and 150-millimeter balloon links was recently approved, and the rollout of these sizes is underway for use in the SFA and popliteal arteries. Enrollment continues in our Bellow the Knee, IDE and in-stent restenosis studies and we received IDE approval and enrolled the first few patients in our AV Access drug-coated balloons study. We're also on track to start our Levant China clinical trial and enroll our first patient before the end of the year. 
Also in Vascular, the LifeStream Balloon Expandable Covered Stent IDE continues to enroll very rapidly and I'm pleased to announce that we've completed enrollment of the initial cohort required for analysis of our primary endpoint. We're continuing to enroll a larger cohort and anticipate completing recruitment by the end of the year. This clinical study is evaluating the technology for the treatment of iliac artery disease with a 9-month followup. 
In other Stent Graft news, our next-generation device for using AV Access is in final internal testing and we anticipate launching in Europe in Q4. This product will require a clinical study for U.S. approval and we anticipate filing the IDE and initiating a study in the first half of 2016. Our venous stent project is on a similar development pathway and we anticipate launching in Europe in Q4 and initiating an IDE study around the end of the year. 
Next, moving to Urology and home care. We're anticipating the launch of a new intermittent self catheterization product, the Magic 3 touchless, later this quarter. Magic 3 touchless combines the comfort and insertion benefits of the Magic 3 platform with our touchless closed system to reduce the risk of contamination and infection due to catheter insertion in more challenging environments outside of the hospital. In June, we launched our new Hydrosil Rose 2 intermittent catheter designed specifically for the female patient. Hydrosil Rose 2 incorporates a new handle design to further ease insertion with the technology of our Magic 3 silicone catheter and very low friction coating. The new handle is also designed to simplify the interface of the catheter with the drainage bag for enhanced patient control. 
Closing this category, I'm happy to tell you about our new self lubricating catheterization product, the Magic 3 Go. This new family of catheters anticipated to begin rollout around the end of the year, incorporates our new and proprietary coating technology that provides a hydrophilic low-friction insertion without the mess and inconvenience of a water sachet. This new coating provides a sterile and wetted catheter surface straight from the package without excess moisture and is designed specifically to address the needs of users outside the acute setting that may have limited dexterity. 
Moving to Oncology. Earlier this month, we launched the new Site-Rite 8 ultrasound system, with integrated 3CG Diamond in Europe. This Site-Rite 8 with Pinpoint GT technology and 3CG Diamond is slated for U.S. launch in Q4. We believe the combination of ultrasounds, needle guidance and catheter tip confirmation in an integrated system will provide a full-featured, user-friendly and intuitive solution for vascular catheter placement. 
In PICCs, we submitted for U.S. regulatory clearance a new catheter line that's highly resistant to the chemicals used in chemotherapy as well as cleaning and disinfecting agents. This new and proprietary material is designed for extended exposure to these various solutions while maintaining the catheter characteristics that have made our PICCs the market leader. We anticipate product launch in Q4. 
As Tim announced, we've recently closed the acquisition of Vascular Pathways and have begun selling the AccuCath product. We believe the combination of our PICCs, PowerGlide Midline family and AccuCath will help us bring the best guidewire assisted peripheral devices to a broad spectrum of patients with Vascular Access needs. 
We're also working toward the launch in the first half of 2016 of a next-generation of both the PowerGlide and AccuCath products. 
For the acute hemodialysis patient, we've recently launched our new Trialysis Slim catheter. Trialysis Slim incorporates superior flexibility and kink resistance, with flow rates in excess of 400 milliliters per minute in a small 12 French triple lumen catheter configuration. 
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery, and I'm pleased to present a series of launches ongoing or anticipated this quarter. First, in hernia repair, our new Phasix ST is expected to launch in just a couple of weeks. Phasix ST incorporates our proven separate barrier technology with our bioresorbable Phasix mesh to provide a fully resorbable ventral hernia repair solution. This new offering supplements XenMatrix AB, XenMatrix and Phasix and allows us to offer proprietary and differentiated products that address the spectrum of complex abdominal wall repairs. 
Moving on to our BioSurgery product family. In Q2, we filed our PMA supplement, seeking approval for our new Tridyne vascular sealant and continue to anticipate approval and launch in mid-2016. And finally, in mesh fixation, we're in the early launch phase of our OPTIFIX spring-loaded resorbable tack device. OPTIFIX has been designed to employ stored energy for ease and efficiency of tack delivery while reducing tissue trauma that's been associated with some other fixation devices. We're also in the early rollout of our new permanent fixation device named Capsure. Capsure is designed to reduce the risk of tissue injury due to exposed sharps seen on some other permanent fixation devices and incorporate to small cap on the tack to reduce the risk of adhesions, also seen with some other products. With these 2 fixation launches, we're excited to move back to playing offense in this highly competitive space. 
Thanks for your attention. Let me now hand it over to Chris."
254131,305681277,837975,"CR Bard Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","C. R. Bard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Let's first start with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. First quarter, we received $210.5 million related to the willfulness ruling in the Gore litigation. In product liability matters, based on re",952,"Thank you, John. Let's first start with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods. 
First quarter, we received $210.5 million related to the willfulness ruling in the Gore litigation. In product liability matters, based on recent developments, including progress on several large settlements, in Q2, we've recorded a net charge of $343.7 million, primarily related to pelvic health product litigation. We also had acquisition-related items of $4.5 million in the quarter and charges of $8.5 million related to restructuring and productivity initiatives. The P&L impact for these items is detailed in the notes for the financial statements and the reconciliation accompanying our Q2 earnings press release. 
Now let's go to the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $526.1 million or 61.2% of sales for Q2. On an adjusted basis, GP was 61.4% of sales, up 10 basis points from the prior year quarter, a little better than we expected. New amortization of intangibles relating to activity in the last 12 months cost us about 30 basis points year-over-year this quarter. Price was unfavorable at 120 basis points on the revenue line and 40 basis points in gross profit, consistent with expectations. And foreign exchange was about a 50 basis point headwind to gross margin in the quarter. Mix was favorable by 40 basis points and our cost improvements and the timing of manufacturing variances drove approximately 90 basis points of favorability in GP in Q2.
As we've described in the past, manufacturing variances can be somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter and in comparison to prior year, causing some ebbs and flows in GP. So in Q3, we expect the gross margin of about 61% even. Our cost savings and margin improvement programs are on track and we remain comfortable with our full year guidance of GPs of between 61.4% and 61.8%.
SG&A expenses were $250 million for the quarter or 29.1% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 29% even or 60 basis points lower than Q2 of 2014, consistent with our full year guidance. R&D expenditures totaled $64 million for the second quarter or 7.4% of sales on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, R&D expense as a percentage of sales was 7.3%, again, consistent with our full year guidance. I'll remind you that a couple of years ago, we significantly increased the level of R&D investment and we are now seeing leverage from that higher investment level as sales increased. We remain on offense from an investment standpoint, and based on what we've seen in the results in the first half of the year on sales and income, we intend to increase funding towards certain projects in both SG&A and R&D that we believe drive long-term shareholder value. Interest expense was $11.2 million for the second quarter and other income and expense was $141.7 million of expense for the second quarter as reported or zero on an adjusted basis. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.9%, down 80 basis points from the prior year. We continue to expect the effective tax rate for the full year to improve between 0 and 50 basis points when compared to the full year 2014. As a reminder, our full year EPS guidance continues to assume the renewal of the R&D tax credit in Q4. 
Diluted shares for the period were $75.5 million and we repurchased approximately 194,000 shares in the second quarter. The net result is adjusted EPS of $2.27, well above the range we provided for the quarter, driven primarily by the over achievement in sales.
The balance sheet as of June 30 reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1.1 billion compared to $1.03 billion at March 31. For the quarter, accounts receivables days were down 0.4 days and inventory days were up 0.6 days. Capital expenditures totaled $28.4 million in the quarter.
On the liability side, total debt was $1.4 billion as of June 30 compared to $1.6 billion at March 31. Debt-to-total capital at the end of the second quarter was about 46% and total shareholder investment was $1.7 billion as of June 30.
Now moving to financial guidance. For Q3, we are expecting constant currency sales growth between 6% and 7% and organic sales growth between 6.5% and 7.5%. We expect the Gore royalty to decline compared to the prior year due to foreign exchange. With regard to the full year, we now expect constant currency sales growth to be between 5% and 6% and organic sales growth to be between 5.5% and 6.5%, which is a full 150 basis point improvement from our original guidance in January. And we now expect foreign exchange to reduce sales for both Q3 and the full year by about 350 basis points. From an EPS standpoint, excluding items affecting comparability, we expect the third quarter in the range of $2.21 to $2.25 per share, reflecting a somewhat lower gross margin and the higher R&D spend compared to Q2 in the prior year. For the full year, we're increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a range of $9 to $9.10. This higher range reflects modest dilution from a recent acquisition and the increased investments we expect to make in SG&A and R&D during the second half of 2015. 
In summary, the first half of the year has gone quite well from both a sales and profitability perspective. As we now move to the second half, we remain focused on executing our investment plan and pursuing strategic opportunities, with the clear objective of driving attractive and sustainable revenue growth, profitability and shareholder returns over the long term. 
I'll now turn you back to Tim."

We're ramping up some of the clinical trial work in a number of places, and John DeFord mentioned the trial in China.

For the full year, the other impact, organic at 5.5% to 6.5%, there -- you'll also see in Q4 a decline in our sales to Boston Scientific related to the electrophysiology products, and that's actually material. So that's why we've got this difference in for the full year, from a constant currency basis, to the organic number. And again, currency impacting it negatively by about 3.5%. So a nice, strong improvement in organic. From an earnings standpoint, we've talked about some dilution from the acquisition of $0.02 to $0.03, and you'll see some stepped up investment in R&D and SG&A, relative to what we would've done frankly, otherwise, given the strength in the top line.

But again, I mean, I think it's too small at this stage for you to worry too much about, and from a near term standpoint, we've covered the dilution. I think the Gore royalty in 2019, we've talked about for a number of quarters now, the objective of everything we're doing is frankly, by 2019, to make that royalty a smaller and smaller and less significant portion of the P&L. Obviously, this quarter helps in that regard. We're looking, internally and externally, to find things that will provide good organic growth and then good drop-throughs, so as we get to 2019, again, our portfolio is performing in a way that helps to overcome some of that. And I think we've been pretty frank about continuing to have a lot of balance sheet flexibility to help mitigate that impact as you jump from '19 to '20 through utilizing the balance sheet through increased share repurchase activity. So we've spent a lot of time planning and thinking about it and obviously, as we get to 2019, there'll be an opportunity for us to give you more visibility.

Frankly, some of the investments we started to make a couple of years ago were focused on those geographies and we're seeing strong double-digit in the north of 20% growth in PICCs in developed markets as well. So this has a long, long way to play out and as we said in our prepared remarks, it continues to be the largest global opportunity for us."

And the data will tell us how that plays out. But suffice it to say that there's an awful lot of use and interest, various clinicians tend to focus in one of those areas more than another and we're seeing those physicians have an interest in trying drug-coated balloon technology together with their techniques or technologies, depending how they look at treating the disease. So I think it's going to take a number of years for that to play out to be able to cite any trends."

And I'd like to welcome everyone to Bard's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call, and thank all of you for taking the time to join with us today. We expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 30 minutes and the total call to last about an hour. The agenda today will be as follows: I'll begin with an overview of the results for the quarter; John Weiland, our President and COO, will review third quarter product line revenue; John DeFord, our Senior VP of Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you an update on our product development pipeline; and Chris Holland, our Senior VP and CFO, will review the third quarter income statement, balance sheet as well as our expectations for the fourth quarter, and then finally, we'll close with Q&A.
Third quarter 2015 net sales totaled $865.7 million, that's up 4% over Q3 of last year on as-reported basis and up 8% on a constant-currency basis. The currency impact for the quarter versus the same quarter last year was unfavorable, about 370 basis points. Excluding the Gore royalty of $38.4 million in sales related to recent acquisitions and divestitures, our organic growth rate was approximately 8.3% for the quarter. That's above our expectations. The U.S. sales of the Lutonix drug-coated balloon contributed a little less than 300 basis points of growth in Q3.
Net loss for the quarter of 2015 was $86 million and diluted loss per share was $1.16. Excluding these items that affected the comparability of results between periods, which Chris will cover later, third quarter 2015 net income was $154.5 million and diluted earnings per share, which excludes amortization of intangibles, were $2.28. That's up 4% and 6%, respectively.
Looking at revenue growth geographically compared to the same quarter last year. Third quarter net sales in the U.S. were up 7%. Internationally, we grew 10% on a constant-currency basis with Europe growing 7%, Japan declining 1% and our other international businesses growing 18% this quarter. Strong quarter in Europe was driven by Endovascular radiology infix, and the slight decline in Japan was due to inventory fluctuations at our joint venture.
You may have noticed a few weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership of our Japanese joint venture. We expect this transaction to be completed in the coming weeks. While it comes with some near-term dilution driven by exchange, we believe this is strategically important for us. Increased investment for market development and clinical trials in Japan was difficult with the structure of the joint venture when you combine that with foreign exchange pressure. So we decided this was a timely opportunity to take full ownership and advance our product leadership strategy in the world's third-largest health care market.
Our emerging markets business continues to grow into healthy double digits, following our significant investments there over the last couple of years. So as we look at our overall results for the quarter and the first 9 months of 2015, we said at the beginning of the year that it was an important year of execution for us. And so far, we're pleased with the results. As we projected at the announcement of our strategic investment plan nearly 3 years ago now, we are back at the top end of the sector from a revenue growth perspective, and we remain convinced that above-market revenue growth is a key to a premium multiple. We remain focused on making investments in areas of faster growth in a profitable manner to enhance shareholder value over the long term.
So with that, let me turn over to John Weiland for a review of our product line revenue."
254131,312630689,880436,"CR Bard Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,"Earnings Calls","C. R. Bard, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon, everyone.

Growth in this categor",871,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, let me point out that I will be getting all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant-currency basis, unless otherwise noted.
So let's begin with Vascular. Growth in this category was 13% for the quarter or 8% as reported, with total net sales of $250.5 million. Excluding the Gore royalty and the divested EP sales, total Vascular grew -- sales grew 16% globally, with the United States business up 18% and the international business growing 14% in the quarter.
Sales in our Surgical Graft category were up 4% in Q3. Excluding the Gore royalty, our Endovascular business increased 18% in the third quarter. Within Endovascular, our biopsy products had another strong quarter with 14% growth, with nice performance in the United States and even better performance outside of the United States.
Sales in our peripheral PTA line increased 48%, driven by global sales of our Lutonix drug-coated balloon. We are very pleased with the performance of this important product, which had anniversary-ed its FDA approval and the U.S. launch on October 10. It has been a good first 12 months in the United States, and we're pleased with the results from our real-world registry study. John DeFord will tell you more about this in a few minutes.
As we seek to expand the indications and reach of this compelling technology platform, we expect to see long-term global growth from Lutonix. Our Stent business declined 3% again this quarter, consistent with recent experience. And finally, net sales in our Vena Cava Filter line declined 3% in Q3.
So let's go to Urology. Total net sales were $212.3 million, up 5% versus Q3 of last year on a constant-currency basis and 1% on an as-reported basis. The United States business grew 5%, while internationally, we grew 4%. Our Targeted Temperature Management products grew into healthy double digits again this quarter. Our basic drainage business was up 6% globally in Q3, with the United States business up 7%. Our IC Foley business was up 3% globally and up 1% in the United States. We believe that Foley's this quarter benefited from subduer stocking, but we don't know the precise impact. So we've been cautioned against reading too much into these improved growth rates at a single quarter.
Our continence business decreased 3% in the third quarter. Sales in Urological Specialties grew 1% with our brachytherapy business down 1%. And finally, in this category, standalone sales of our StatLock catheter stabilization product line declined 4% in Q3.
Now let's go to Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $239.3 million, an increase of 8% on a constant-currency basis and 4% on an as-reported basis over the third quarter last year. Geographically, net sales in the United States were 5% and international sales were up 15%. Our port business decreased 1% this quarter due to the price reductions in the United States that we talked about at the beginning of the year. Our PICC revenue was up 13% in the third quarter, including strong results in the United States, Europe and emerging markets again this quarter. We're very pleased with the clinical adoption of our advanced technology, which helps patients and can save time and cost for the hospital.
Despite the competitive noise on single features here and there, we believe that the quality and performance of our broad product offering is why we continue to grow faster than the market. And as the competition tries to catch up to our older products, we continue to advance the technology and solve unmet needs for our customers and our patients. John DeFord will tell you more about this.
Our Vascular Access ultrasound product line was up 1% this quarter. The growth rates for this system can be a little lumpy around new product launches, and that's what we're seeing due to the vision to [ph] launch in the prior year and the pending Site-Rite 8 launch later this year. And to complete Oncology, our Dialysis Access product line was up 12% over Q3 of last year.
so let's conclude with our Surgical Specialties business. Total net sales in this category were $139.8 million, up 6% on a constant-currency basis and up 3% as reported. United States sales were up 6% and international sales grew 4% this quarter. 2 years after the acquisition of the Arista Hemostat and 3 years after the acquisition of the Progel sealant technology, our combined biosurgical product portfolio continues to grow double digits.
Our soft tissue repair business grew 7% in Q3, with our synthetic ventral hernia repair products growing 6%, while our natural tissue products grew 14%, driven by our new XenMatrix AB coated porcine mesh. Our hernia fixation business grew 2% this quarter, which was the first quarter in positive territory since the second quarter of 2011. We are hopeful that our new product launches here can reverse the trend of declines in recent years.
In closing out the surgical category, our performance irrigation business was down 20% in Q3. As we told you, we discontinued some products earlier in the year.
This concludes our product line revenue discussion, and now I'll turn you over to John DeFord."

For the sake of time, I'll jump right into some highlights, starting with drug-coated balloons. About 2 weeks ago with TCT, we released full 12-month results from our almost 700-patient global SFA and public registry. Lesion lengths were over 100 millimeters, about half the patients had significant calcification and over 30% of the lesions treated were chronic total occlusions. The study found over 94% of patients were free from TLR through the 12-month follow-up, with primary patency in almost 90% of patients. Interim 24-month results demonstrated 93% freedom from TLR and primary patency in excess of 80%. We believe the learnings from the Levant 2 study on keys to a successful procedure are working their way into real world practice, and we're very pleased with the results.
In our Below the Knee IDE enrollment continues, though, recruitment remains slower than planned due to the complex nature of these patients and their disease. We're working with FDA to find ways to speed up enrollment and analysis in this important study. At current recruitment weight rates, we like -- we'll likely to enroll patients through much of 2016, putting PMA submission in the second half of 2017.
On the other hand, our AB Access DCB IDE study that began enrollment last quarter is recruiting very quickly, and we anticipate enrollment could be complete as early as Q1 of 2016, which could put PMA submission ahead of schedule in the first half of 2017. The in-stent restenosis IDE study is ongoing, and we're currently planning a second half 2016 PMA submission, seeking this expanded indication. We have a host of other DCB studies ongoing or in start-up around the world, and we plan to begin enrollment in our Levant China study in Q1 of 2016.
Also in Vascular, the LifeStream balloon expandable covered stent IDE completed enrollment in Q3. This clinical study is evaluating the technology for the treatment of iliac artery disease with a 9-month follow-up. We anticipate PMA submission in the second half of 2016.
Our Covera next-generation stent graft designed for use in the AV Access circuit is planned for launch in Europe this quarter, and we're working with FDA to commence our U.S. IDE study in the first half of 2016. Our new de novo veno stent recently gained a CE Mark. As with Covera, we're working closely with FDA to initiate an IDE study seeking U.S. approval with enrollment planned to begin in the first half of next year.
Next, moving to Urology and home care, we're pleased to announce the release of the new Magic 3 Go self-lubricated catheter for female patients. This product's designed for enhanced comfort and ease of use for patients that often have limited dexterity. We plan to roll out this product selectively during Q4 as we ramp manufacturing. We also anticipate the launch of our Magic 3 touchless catheter in early 2016. Both of these products employ our latest silicone technology designed to enhance patient use and comfort.
We've got some other impactful products in this portfolio for launch later in 2016. But I'll hold off sharing the details until we get closer to those launches.
Now moving to Oncology. The new Site-Rite 8 ultrasound system with integrated 3 CG Diamond is rolling out in Europe. The Site-Rite 8 with Pinpoint GT and 3 CG Diamond is on track for U.S. launch in Q4, as John alluded to. We believe the combination of ultrasound, needle guidance and catheter tip confirmation in an integrated system will provide a full-featured user-friendly and intuitive solution for vascular catheter placement.
In PICCs, we've submitted the 510(k) and a way FDA clearance to launch a new and proprietary catheter family. These PICCs have been designed to resist common chemicals used in chemotherapy solutions as well as cleaning and disinfection agents. While these solutions are known to degrade standard PICC materials, this new catheter can maintain the same high-performance standards available in our current PICCs, even after long-term exposure. We're also expanding our development efforts toward technologies we believe can further reduce the risk of thrombosis.
While we prefer to keep our development plans confidential, I will say we have a new product family under development that's based on a new high-performance material. We expect to begin launching products using this new material in the back half of next year. Our current plans also anticipate commencement of studies to provide further clinical evidence to support the benefits of these new designs.
In concert with these efforts, we've also recently launched a training program and some associated products designed to reduce infections and promote the safe and effective use of our PICCs. With this change in near-term focus, we've reduced the priority we placed on our antimicrobial and thrombo-resistant coating technologies. The developments are ongoing, but we don't believe they'll have a major revenue contribution compared to these other opportunities.
For the difficult stick IB catheter patients, we announced on the last call the acquisition of the AccuCath guide wire-assisted PIV products. We've taken that technology into our development engine and anticipate the launch of an improved family of AccuCath products in the first half of 2016. These products are anticipated to launch alongside our new midline catheter, the Powered Like Pro, also planned for launch in that same time period. We believe the combination of our PICCs, the PowerGlide midline family and AccuCath IV product line will help us bring important guide wire-assisted devices to a broad spectrum of patients with Vascular Access needs.
Lastly, for the acute hemodialysis patient, we're expanding our family of catheters with the expected launch of a new dual lumen powers Genesys catheter in Q1 of next year. Genesys is designed for superior flexibility and kink resistance, along with flow rates in excess of 400 mils [ph] per minute in a small 11 per inch catheter configuration.
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery. Just a few weeks ago, we launched our new Phasix ST resorbable synthetic mesh. This launch as another differentiated product to our complex abdominal wall portfolio that includes XenMatrix, XenMatrix AB and the Phasix mesh technology. We're continuing our efforts to expand our product offerings based on the Phasix platform, and we expect to begin launching those new products over the next several quarters. We're also making good progress on our development of additional sizes of our one-of-a-kind antibiotic-coated XenMatrix AB family, with launches expected throughout 2016 and into 2017. In our BioSurgery product offering, on our last call, I told you we'd filed our PMA supplement, seeking approval of our new triadine Vascular sealant, and we continue to anticipate approval and launch in the back half of next year.
And finally, in mesh fixation, we recently launched both the OPTIFIX spring-loaded resorbable tack device and the capture permanent fixation product. We're working to build upon that momentum through the launch of 2 additional fixation devices, but due to the competitive nature of this market, I'll hold back the details for a later call.
Thanks for your time and attention tonight. Let me now hand you over to Chris."
254131,312630689,880436,"CR Bard Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,"Earnings Calls","C. R. Bard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Let's start with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods.In Q3, we had acquisition-related items of $2.5 million and a $14.6 million charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives. This quarter, we",1135,"Thank you, John. Let's start with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods.
In Q3, we had acquisition-related items of $2.5 million and a $14.6 million charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives. This quarter, we had made significant additional progress in settlement activity related to our women's health product liability. Driven by this settlement progress and additional information learned from it as well as recent activity in other product liability matters, we took an additional combined charge of $241.1 million this quarter. The final impact for these items is detailed in the notes to the financial statements and the reconciliation accompanying our Q3 earnings press release.
Now let's go through the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $529.4 million or 61.2% of sales for Q3. On an adjusted basis, gross profit was $530.3 million or 61.3% of sales, a little better than we projected and down 120 basis points from the prior year. New amortization of intangibles relating to transactions closed in the last 12 months was about 50 basis points this quarter, and foreign exchange drove approximately 30 basis points of headwind for us in Q3. Price was unfavorable by 90 basis points on the revenue line and approximately 30 basis points in gross profit, and our mix was favorable by about 40 basis points this quarter. As we forecasted last quarter, the manufacturing variances in our plans from year-to-year can be a little lumpy, and Q3 is an example of that. In Q2, cost savings drove 90 basis points of improvement but in Q3, it was 50 basis points negative. In Q4, we look for Q4 to look more like Q2 with strong favorability. So we expect gross profit in Q4 on an adjusted basis to be a meaningful improvement over Q3 and back to the Q4 2014 level or maybe even a little better, which would put us in the high end of the original guidance we gave you for gross margins for the full year. So it's been a year of solid organic improvement for us on the gross margin line.
SG&A expenses were $247.1 million for the quarter or 28.5% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was also 28.5% of sales, down 60 basis points from Q3 of last year. I'll remind you that we typically see an uptick in SG&A as a percent of sales in Q4 sequentially, but we expect to still see good leverage compared to the prior year and expect to be within our full year guidance for 2015.
R&D expenditures totaled $65.2 million or 7.5% of sales on a reported basis for the third quarter, which was the same on an adjusted basis, down 40 basis points from the prior year and right on our full year guidance. We feel good about the level of investment in innovation and continue to drive an active new product pipeline towards faster revenue growth opportunities as you could probably tell from John DeFord's update.
Interest expense was $11.2 million for the third quarter, no change from the prior year. Other income expense was $258.3 million of expense for the third quarter as reported and $1.8 million of expense on an adjusted basis. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.9%, which is the same for the 9 months year-to-date, where we were down 50 basis points compared to the prior year, consistent with our original guidance. We do expect the renewal of the R&D tax credit before the end of the year, which would lower the rate in Q4.
Diluted shares on adjusted earnings for the period were $75.4 million, and we repurchased 767,000 shares during the third quarter. The net result is adjusted cash APS for Q3 of $2.28, above the guidance range we provided for the quarter, driven by the higher sales.
The balance sheet as of September 30 reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1.1 billion, no change from June 30. For the quarter, accounts receivable to days were down 1.6 days and inventory days were down 3 days. Capital expenditures totaled $21.7 million for the quarter.
On the liability side, total debt was $1.4 billion as of September 30, no change from June 30. Debt to total cap at the end of the third quarter was about 49%, and total shareholder investment was $1.5 billion at September 30.
Now moving to financial guidance. At the beginning of this year, we guided organic revenue growth to be between 4% and 5% for the full year, and we're now expecting to be closer to 6.5%. That includes lapping the anniversary of the U.S. launch of Lutonix in Q4 of 2014, which included significant initial stocking orders. Excluding those initial stocking orders from last year, which we estimate represent about 1% of sales to the quarter, we project Q4 organic sales growth between 5% and 6%, with about 300 basis points of headwind from FX and an additional 200 basis points of headwind from other sales reductions on a reported basis. The biggest of these reductions relates to the pending acquisition of the Japanese joint venture, which would add about $40 million to operating revenue on an annual basis. However, the joint venture is holding inventory we have already recorded as sales to them. So we expect to have a negative impact to reported revenue in Q4 and Q1 until we work through that inventory.
We also, as we've discussed in prior calls, expect the sales of EP products to Boston Scientific to decline in Q4, as they have now started manufacturing some of those product lines themselves. So we are projecting reported revenue to be flat to down 1% in Q4, even though the organic momentum in the business is expected to remain quite strong.
Now to update our expectations for adjusted cash EPS. Following our announcement of the acquisition of our Japanese JV, our latest forecast was $8.95 to $9.05 for the full year. Today, we are raising that guidance to be between $9.03 and $9.07. At the midpoint, this also represents a $0.05 increase to our original full year guidance provided in January despite absorbing approximately $0.15 of expected combined dilution from acquisitions and worsening FX during the year. Specific to Q4, this means we expect adjusted cash EPS to be between $2.38 and $2.42, which includes about $0.06 for the renewal of the R&D tax credit. This performance speaks to the strength of our execution in 2015. We've been able to increase investments in the business with the objective of sustaining above-market revenue growth while absorbing dilution along the way, and yet we still expect to increase the EPS delivered on the bottom line in 2015 above our initial expectation.
Thank you for your attention. I'll now turn you back to Tim."

We think that clinicians are really interested in looking at both pivotal and randomized studies and registries. I think the Levant 2 study as published in New England Journal Medicine and also very unique study design. Also, we've also found in that study that procedure really matters. And that was something that came out. The panel came out and some of the post discussions that the way the device was used compared to PTA was different. And actually, in our study, the drug-coated balloon was used what you could call had a less effective treatment at the end of the procedure compared to PTA. Again, I think that attribute is attributed to some of the results that we see in our randomized study. Certainly, I understand our competitor wanting to try to shift the discussion back to theirs. It's kind of interesting they haven't updated their registry data yet. But our registry data real world is in much -- more difficult patients that we saw in Levant 2. We think it's really demonstrating the real-world usage of the technology. And of course, those clinicians were educated on the things that we've learned in the Levant 2 study on the importance of fully inflating the balloons, getting good expansion, appropriate access to the vessel and the lesion quickly and other things that were discussed by Dr. Schmidt at TCT. And so we think that these results are pretty indicative of real-world usage based on that new knowledge. Now what clinicians are going to do? So far, I think it's resonated pretty well that drug-coated balloons work. And at least the 2 technologies on the market today seem to work pretty similarly."

And I'd like to welcome everyone to Bard's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call, and thank all of you for taking the time to join with us today. We expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 30 minutes and the total call to last about an hour. The agenda today will be as follows: I'll begin with an overview of the results for the quarter; John Weiland, our President and COO, will review third quarter product line revenue; John DeFord, our Senior VP of Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you an update on our product development pipeline; and Chris Holland, our Senior VP and CFO, will review the third quarter income statement, balance sheet as well as our expectations for the fourth quarter, and then finally, we'll close with Q&A.
Third quarter 2015 net sales totaled $865.7 million. That's up 4% over Q3 of last year on as-reported basis and up 8% on a constant currency basis. The currency impact for the quarter versus the same quarter last year was unfavorable, about 370 basis points. Excluding the Gore royalty of $38.4 million in sales related to recent acquisitions and divestitures, our organic growth rate was approximately 8.3% for the quarter. That's above our expectations. The U.S. sales of the Lutonix drug-coated balloon contributed a little less than 300 basis points of growth in Q3.
Net loss for the quarter of 2015 was $86 million and diluted loss per share was $1.16. Excluding these items that affected the comparability of results between periods, which Chris will cover later, third quarter 2015 net income was $154.5 million and diluted earnings per share, which excludes amortization of intangibles, were $2.28. That's up 4% and 6%, respectively.
Looking at revenue growth geographically, compared to the same quarter last year, third quarter net sales in the U.S. were up 7%. Internationally, we grew 10% on a constant currency basis, with Europe growing 7%, Japan declining 1% and our other international businesses growing 18% this quarter. Strong quarter in Europe was driven by Endovascular radiology infix, and the slight decline in Japan was due to inventory fluctuations at our joint venture.
You may have noticed a few weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership of our Japanese joint venture. We expect this transaction to be completed in the coming weeks. While it comes with some near-term dilution driven by exchange, we believe this is strategically important for us. Increased investment for market development and clinical trials in Japan was difficult with the structure of the joint venture when you combine that with foreign exchange pressure. So we decided this was a timely opportunity to take full ownership and advance our product leadership strategy in the world's third-largest health care market.
Our emerging markets business continues to grow into healthy double digits, following our significant investments there over the last couple of years. So as we look at our overall results for the quarter and the first 9 months of 2015, we said at the beginning of the year that it was an important year of execution for us. And so far, we're pleased with the results. As we projected at the announcement of our strategic investment plan nearly 3 years ago now, we are back at the top end of the sector from a revenue growth perspective, and we remain convinced that above-market revenue growth is a key to a premium multiple. We remain focused on making investments in areas of faster growth in a profitable manner to enhance shareholder value over the long term.
So with that, let me turn you over to John Weiland for a review of our product line revenue."
254131,312630689,880610,"CR Bard Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,"Earnings Calls","C. R. Bard, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, let me point out that I will be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted.So let's begin with Vascular. Growth in this category",873,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, let me point out that I will be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted.
So let's begin with Vascular. Growth in this category was 13% for the quarter or 8% as-reported, with total net sales of $250.5 million. Excluding the Gore royalty and the divested EP sales, total Vascular grew -- sales grew 16% globally, with the United States business up 18% and the international business growing 14% in the quarter.
Sales in our Surgical Graft category were up 4% in Q3. Excluding the Gore royalty, our Endovascular business increased 18% in the third quarter. Within Endovascular, our biopsy products had another strong quarter with 14% growth, with nice performance in the United States and even better performance outside of the United States.
Sales in our peripheral PTA line increased 48%, driven by global sales of our Lutonix drug-coated balloon. We are very pleased with the performance of this important product, which anniversary-ed its FDA approval and the U.S. launch on October 10. It has been a good first 12 months in the United States and we're pleased with the results from our real-world registry study. John DeFord will tell you more about this in a few minutes.
As we seek to expand the indications and reach of this compelling technology platform, we expect to see long-term global growth from Lutonix. Our Stent business declined 3% again this quarter, consistent with recent experience. And finally, net sales in our Vena Cava Filter line declined 3% in Q3.
So let's go to Urology. Total net sales were $212.3 million, up 5% versus Q3 of last year on a constant currency basis and 1% on an as-reported basis. The United States business grew 5% while internationally, we grew 4%. Our Targeted Temperature Management products grew into healthy double digits again this quarter. Our basic drainage business was up 6% globally in Q3, with the United States business up 7%. Our I.C. Foley business was up 3% globally and up 1% in the United States. We believe that Foleys this quarter benefited from some dealer stocking, but we don't know the precise impact. So we've been cautioned against reading too much into these improved growth rates in a single quarter.
Our continence business decreased 3% in the third quarter. Sales in urological specialties grew 1% with our brachytherapy business down 1%. And finally, in this category, standalone sales of our StatLock catheter stabilization product line declined 4% in Q3.
Now let's go to Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $239.3 million, an increase of 8% on a constant currency basis and 4% on an as-reported basis over the third quarter last year. Geographically, net sales in the United States were up 5% and international sales were up 15%. Our port business decreased 1% this quarter due to the price reductions in the United States that we talked about at the beginning of the year. Our PICC revenue was up 13% in the third quarter, including strong results in the United States, Europe and emerging markets again this quarter. We're very pleased with the clinical adoption of our advanced technology, which helps patients and can save time and cost for the hospital.
Despite the competitive noise on single features here and there, we believe that the quality and performance of our broad product offering is why we continue to grow faster than the market. And as the competition tries to catch up to our older products, we continue to advance the technology and solve unmet needs for our customers and our patients. John DeFord will tell you more about this.
Our vascular access ultrasound product line was up 1% this quarter. The growth rates for this system can be a little lumpy around new product launches, and that's what we're seeing due to the Vision II launch in the prior year and the pending Site-Rite 8 launch later this year. And to complete Oncology, our Dialysis Access product line was up 12% over Q3 of last year.
So let's conclude with our Surgical Specialties business. Total net sales in this category were $139.8 million, up 6% on a constant currency basis and up 3% as-reported. United States sales were up 6% and international sales grew 4% this quarter. Two years after the acquisition of the Arista Hemostat and 3 years after the acquisition of the Progel sealant technology, our combined biosurgical product portfolio continues to grow double digits.
Our soft tissue repair business grew 7% in Q3, with our synthetic ventral hernia repair products growing 6%, while our natural tissue products grew 14%, driven by our new XenMatrix AB coated porcine mesh. Our hernia fixation business grew 2% this quarter, which was the first quarter in positive territory since the second quarter of 2011. We are hopeful that our new product launches here can reverse the trend of declines in recent years.
In closing out the surgical category, our performance irrigation business was down 20% in Q3. As we told you, we discontinued some products earlier in the year.
This concludes our product line revenue discussion, and now I'll turn you over to John DeFord."

For the sake of time, I'll jump right into some highlights, starting with drug-coated balloons. About 2 weeks ago with TCT, we released full 12-month results from our almost 700-patient global SFA and popliteal registry. Lesion lengths were over 100 millimeters. About half the patients had significant calcification and over 30% of the lesions treated were chronic total occlusions. The study found over 94% of patients were free from TLR through the 12-month follow-up, with primary patency in almost 90% of patients. Interim 24-month results demonstrated 93% freedom from TLR and primary patency in excess of 80%. We believe the learnings from the Levant 2 study on keys to a successful procedure are working their way into real world practice, and we're very pleased with the results.
In our Below the Knee IDE, enrollment continues, though, recruitment remained slower than planned due to the complex nature of these patients and their disease. We're working with FDA to find ways to speed up enrollment and analysis in this important study. At current recruitment weight -- rates, we like -- we'll likely to enroll patients through much of 2016, putting PMA submission in the second half of 2017.
On the other hand, our AV access DCB IDE study that began enrollment last quarter is recruiting very quickly, and we anticipate enrollment could be complete as early as Q1 of 2016, which could put PMA submission ahead of schedule in the first half of 2017. The in-stent restenosis IDE study is ongoing, and we're currently planning a second half 2016 PMA submission, seeking this expanded indication. We have a host of other DCB studies ongoing or in start-up around the world, and we plan to begin enrollment in our Levant China study in Q1 of 2016.
Also in Vascular, the LifeStream balloon expandable covered stent IDE completed enrollment in Q3. This clinical study is evaluating the technology for the treatment of iliac artery disease with a 9-month follow-up. We anticipate PMA submission in the second half of 2016.
Our Covera [ph] next-generation stent graft, designed for use in the AV access circuit, is planned for launch in Europe this quarter, and we're working with FDA to commence our U.S. IDE study in the first half of 2016. Our new de-novo veno stent recently gained the CE mark. As with Covera [ph], we're working closely with FDA to initiate an IDE study seeking U.S. approval with enrollment planned to begin in the first half of next year.
Next, moving to Urology and home care, we're pleased to announce the release of the new Magic3 Go self-lubricated catheter for female patients. This product's designed for enhanced comfort and ease-of-use for patients that often have limited dexterity. We plan to roll out this product selectively during Q4 as we ramp manufacturing. We also anticipate the launch of our Magic3 touchless catheter in early 2016. Both of these products employ our latest silicone technology designed to enhance patient use and comfort.
We've got some other impactful products in this portfolio for launch later in 2016. But I'll hold off sharing the details until we get closer to those launches.
Now moving to Oncology. The new Site-Rite 8 ultrasound system with integrated 3CG Diamond is rolling out in Europe. The Site-Rite 8 with Pinpoint GT and 3CG Diamond is on track for U.S. launch in Q4, as John alluded to. We believe the combination of ultrasound, needle guidance and catheter tip confirmation in an integrated system will provide a full-featured, user-friendly and intuitive solution for vascular catheter placement.
In PICCs, we've submitted the 510(k) and await FDA clearance to launch a new and proprietary catheter family. These PICCs have been designed to resist common chemicals used in chemotherapy solutions as well as cleaning and disinfection agents. While these solutions are known to degrade standard PICC materials, this new catheter can maintain the same high-performance standards available in our current PICCs, even after long-term exposure. We're also expanding our development efforts toward technologies we believe can further reduce the risk of thrombosis.
While we prefer to keep our development plans confidential, I will say we have a new product family under development that's based on a new high-performance material. We expect to begin launching products using this new material in the back half of next year. Our current plans also anticipate commencement of studies to provide further clinical evidence to support the benefits of these new designs.
In concert with these efforts, we've also recently launched a training program and some associated products designed to reduce infections and promote the safe and effective use of our PICCs. With this change in near-term focus, we've reduced the priority we placed on our antimicrobial and thrombo-resistant coating technologies. The developments are ongoing, but we don't believe they'll have a major revenue contribution compared to these other opportunities.
For the difficult stick IV catheter patients, we announced on the last call the acquisition of the AccuCath guide wire-assisted PIV products. We've taken that technology into our development engine and anticipate the launch of an improved family of AccuCath products in the first half of 2016. These products are anticipated to launch alongside our new midline catheter, the PowerGlide Pro, also planned for launch in that same time period. We believe the combination of our PICCs, the PowerGlide midline family and AccuCath IV product line will help us bring important guide wire-assisted devices to a broad spectrum of patients with Vascular Access needs.
Lastly, for the acute hemodialysis patient, we're expanding our family of catheters with the expected launch of a new dual lumen powers Xenesys [ph] catheter in Q1 of next year. Xenesys [ph] is designed for superior flexibility and kink resistance, along with flow rates in excess of 400 ml per minute in a small 11 per inch catheter configuration.
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery. Just a few weeks ago, we launched our new Phasix ST resorbable synthetic mesh. This launch adds another differentiated product to our complex abdominal wall portfolio that includes XenMatrix, XenMatrix AB and the Phasix mesh technology. We're continuing our efforts to expand our product offerings based on the Phasix platform, and we expect to begin launching those new products over the next several quarters. We're also making good progress on our development of additional sizes of our one-of-a-kind antibiotic-coated XenMatrix AB family, with launches expected throughout 2016 and into 2017. In our BioSurgery product offering, on our last call, I told you we'd filed our PMA supplement, seeking approval of our new TRIDYNE vascular sealant. And we continue to anticipate approval and launch in the back half of next year.
And finally, in mesh fixation, we recently launched both the OPTIFIX spring-loaded resorbable tack device and the Capsure permanent fixation product. We're working to build upon that momentum through the launch of 2 additional fixation devices. But due to the competitive nature of this market, I'll hold back the details for a later call.
Thanks for your time and attention tonight. Let me now hand you over to Chris."
254131,312630689,880610,"CR Bard Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,"Earnings Calls","C. R. Bard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Let's start with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods.In Q3, we had acquisition-related items of $2.5 million and a $14.6 million charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives. This quarter, we",1136,"Thank you, John. Let's start with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods.
In Q3, we had acquisition-related items of $2.5 million and a $14.6 million charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives. This quarter, we had made significant additional progress in settlement activity related to our women's health product liability. Driven by this settlement progress and additional information learned from it as well as recent activity in other product liability matters, we took an additional combined charge of $241.1 million this quarter. The P&L impact for these items is detailed in the notes to the financial statements and the reconciliation accompanying our Q3 earnings press release.
Now let's go through the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $529.4 million or 61.2% of sales for Q3. On an adjusted basis, gross profit was $530.3 million or 61.3% of sales, a little better than we projected and down 120 basis points from the prior year. New amortization of intangibles relating to transactions closed in the last 12 months was about 50 basis points this quarter, and foreign exchange drove approximately 30 basis points of headwind for us in Q3. 
Price was unfavorable by 90 basis points on the revenue line and approximately 30 basis points in gross profit, and our mix was favorable by about 40 basis points this quarter. As we forecasted last quarter, the manufacturing variances in our plants from year-to-year can be a little lumpy, and Q3 is an example of that. In Q2, cost savings drove 90 basis points of improvement but in Q3, it was 50 basis points negative. In Q4, we look for Q4 to look more like Q2 with strong favorability. So we expect gross profit in Q4 on an adjusted basis to be a meaningful improvement over Q3 and back to the Q4 2014 level or maybe even a little bit better, which would put us near the high end of the original guidance we gave you for gross margins for the full year. So it's been a year of solid organic improvement for us on the gross margin line.
SG&A expenses were $247.1 million for the quarter or 28.5% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was also 28.5% of sales, down 60 basis points from Q3 of last year. I'll remind you that we typically see an uptick in SG&A as a percent of sales in Q4 sequentially, but we expect to still see good leverage compared to the prior year and expect to be within our full year guidance for 2015.
R&D expenditures totaled $65.2 million or 7.5% of sales on a reported basis for the third quarter, which was the same on an adjusted basis, down 40 basis points from the prior year and right on our full year guidance. We feel good about the level of investment in innovation and continue to drive an active new product pipeline towards faster revenue growth opportunities as you could probably tell from John DeFord's update.
Interest expense was $11.2 million for the third quarter, no change from the prior year. Other income and expense was $258.3 million of expense for the third quarter as-reported and $1.8 million of expense on an adjusted basis. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.9%, which is the same for the 9 months year-to-date, where we are down 50 basis points compared to the prior year, consistent with our original guidance. We do expect the renewal of the R&D tax credit before the end of the year, which would lower the rate in Q4.
Diluted shares on adjusted earnings for the period were $75.4 million, and we repurchased 767,000 shares during the third quarter. The net result is adjusted cash EPS for Q3 of $2.28, above the guidance range we provided for the quarter, driven by the higher sales.
The balance sheet as of September 30 reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1.1 billion, no change from June 30. For the quarter, accounts receivable days were down 1.6 days and inventory days were down 3 days. Capital expenditures totaled $21.7 million for the quarter.
On the liability side, total debt was $1.4 billion as of September 30, no change from June 30. Debt to total cap at the end of the third quarter was about 49%, and total shareholder investment was $1.5 billion at September 30.
Now moving to financial guidance. At the beginning of this year, we guided organic revenue growth to be between 4% and 5% for the full year, and we're now expecting to be closer to 6.5%. That includes lapping the anniversary of the U.S. launch of Lutonix in Q4 of 2014, which included significant initial stocking orders. Excluding those initial stocking orders from last year, which we estimate represent about 1% of sales to the quarter, we project Q4 organic sales growth between 5% and 6%, with about 300 basis points of headwind from FX and an additional 200 basis points of headwind from other sales reductions on a reported basis. The biggest of these reductions relates to the pending acquisition of the Japanese joint venture, which would add about $40 million to operating revenue on an annual basis. However, the joint venture is holding inventory we have already recorded as sales to them. So we expect to have a negative impact to reported revenue in Q4 and Q1 until we work through that inventory.
We also, as we've discussed in prior calls, expect the sales of EP products to Boston Scientific to decline in Q4, as they have now started manufacturing some of those product lines themselves. So we are projecting the reported revenue to be flat to down 1% in Q4, even though the organic momentum in the business is expected to remain quite strong.
Now to update our expectations for adjusted cash EPS. Following our announcement of the acquisition of our Japanese JV, our latest forecast was $8.95 to $9.05 for the full year. Today, we are raising that guidance to be between $9.03 and $9.07. At the midpoint, this also represents a $0.05 increase to our original full year guidance provided in January despite absorbing approximately $0.15 of expected combined dilution from acquisitions and worsening FX during the year. Specific to Q4, this means we expect adjusted cash EPS to be between $2.38 and $2.42, which includes about $0.06 for the renewal of the R&D tax credit. This performance speaks to the strength of our execution in 2015. We've been able to increase investments in the business with the objective of sustaining above-market revenue growth while absorbing dilution along the way, and yet we still expect to increase the EPS delivered on the bottom line in 2015 above our initial expectation.
Thank you for your attention. I'll now turn you back to Tim."

It's very difficult for any company, I don't care how big you are, to know if you gain share or loss share on, the markets increase or stay flat or decline from quarter-to-quarter. I wouldn't say virtually impossible to know that over that short period of time. So we said in the past, it kind of felt like things were getting a little bit better. I think that some of the old metrics we used to use, like hospital admissions, especially when you're involved in procedures, maybe aren't the bellwether signs necessarily that they were a few years ago. So some of the dynamics, as you know, with health care, utilization, generally, are changing. So it's kind of difficult to say when you look at hospital admission metrics maybe going down, and yet our revenue continues to grow. What does all that mean? It's just very difficult to say. And we said earlier at the last call, it feels a little bit better. I would say that still holds true for this quarter. It's just hard to put any fine points on it."

We think that clinicians are really interested in looking at both pivotal and randomized studies and registries. I think the Levant 2 study, as published in New England Journal of Medicine, is a very unique study design. Also, we've also found in that study that procedure really matters. And that was something that came out at panel, came out in some of the post discussions, that the way the device was used compared to PTA was different. And actually, in our study, the drug-coated balloon was used what you could call had a less effective treatment at the end of the procedure compared to PTA. Again, I think that is attributed to some of the results that we see in our randomized study. Certainly, I understand our competitor wanting to try to shift the discussion back to theirs. It's kind of interesting they haven't updated their registry data yet. But our registry data real world is in much -- more difficult patients than we saw in Levant 2. We think it's really demonstrating the real world usage of the technology. And of course, those clinicians were educated on the things that we've learned in the Levant 2 study on the importance of fully inflating the balloons, getting good expansion, appropriate access to the vessel and the lesion quickly and other things that were discussed by Dr. Schmidt [ph] at TCT. And so we think that these results are pretty indicative of real world usage based on that new knowledge. Now what clinicians are going to do? So far, I think it's resonated pretty well that drug-coated balloons work. And at least the 2 technologies on the market today seem to work pretty similarly."

As I said, we launched a couple of additional sizes in Q3, which drove, we think, some additional stocking in Q3. And so certainly, we would expect a sequential decline in Q4 for Boston as they begin to work through that initial stocking inventory. So when you then adjust for [indiscernible] stocking order last year in Q4, we're seeing really terrific, both sequential and year-over-year, growth in our base organic Lutonix business. And feel really good about our competitive position. And John DeFord talked about the real world registry data, which is, frankly, outstanding. So we'll need to get through these couple of quarters here and get to a steady state next year, where Boston's been in the business now with us for a while and we've been moved beyond our initial launch in the U.S."

And I'd like to welcome everyone to Bard's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call, and thank all of you for taking the time to join with us today. We expect the presentation portion of the call to last about 30 minutes and the total call to last about an hour. The agenda today will be as follows: I'll begin with an overview of the results for the quarter; John Weiland, our President and COO, will review third quarter product line revenue; John DeFord, our Senior VP of Science, Technology and Clinical Affairs, will give you an update on our product development pipeline; and Chris Holland, our Senior VP and CFO, will review the third quarter income statement, balance sheet as well as our expectations for the fourth quarter. And then finally, we'll close with Q&A.
Third quarter 2015 net sales totaled $865.7 million. That's up 4% over Q3 of last year on an as-reported basis and up 8% on a constant currency basis. The currency impact for the quarter versus the same quarter last year was unfavorable, about 370 basis points. Excluding the Gore royalty of $38.4 million and sales related to recent acquisitions and divestitures, our organic growth rate was approximately 8.3% for the quarter. That's above our expectations. The U.S. sales of the Lutonix drug-coated balloon contributed a little less than 300 basis points of growth in Q3.
Net loss for the quarter of 2015 was $86 million and diluted loss per share was $1.16. Excluding these items that affected the comparability of results between periods, which Chris will cover later, third quarter 2015 net income was $154.5 million and diluted earnings per share, which excludes amortization of intangibles, were $2.28. That's up 4% and 6%, respectively.
Looking at revenue growth geographically, compared to the same quarter last year, third quarter net sales in the U.S. were up 7%. Internationally, we grew 10% on a constant currency basis, with Europe growing 7%, Japan declining 1% and our other international businesses growing 18% this quarter. Strong quarter in Europe was driven by Endovascular, radiology and PICCs, and the slight decline in Japan was due to inventory fluctuations at our joint venture.
You may have noticed a few weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership of our Japanese joint venture. We expect this transaction to be completed in the coming weeks. While it comes with some near-term dilution driven by exchange, we believe this is strategically important for us. Increased investment for market development and clinical trials in Japan was difficult with the structure of the joint venture when you combine that with foreign exchange pressure. So we decided this was a timely opportunity to take full ownership and advance our product leadership strategy in the world's third-largest health care market.
Our emerging markets business continues to grow in the healthy double digits, following our significant investments there over the last couple of years. So as we look at our overall results for the quarter and the first 9 months of 2015, we said at the beginning of the year that it was an important year of execution for us. And so far, we're pleased with the results. As we projected at the announcement of our strategic investment plan nearly 3 years ago now, we are back at the top end of the sector from a revenue growth perspective, and we remain convinced that above-market revenue growth is a key to a premium multiple. We remain focused on making investments in areas of faster growth in a profitable manner to enhance shareholder value over the long term.
So with that, let me turn you over to John Weiland for a review of our product line revenue."

Before I start, let me point out that I will be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted.So let's begin with Vascular. Growth in this category",874,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, let me point out that I will be giving all percentage growth data in comparison to the prior year period on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted.
So let's begin with Vascular. Growth in this category was 13% for the quarter, or 8% as-reported, with total net sales of $250.5 million. Excluding the Gore royalty and the divested EP sales, total Vascular grew -- sales grew 16% globally, with the United States business up 18% and the international business growing 14% in the quarter.
Sales in our Surgical Graft category were up 4% in Q3. Excluding the Gore royalty, our Endovascular business increased 18% in the third quarter. Within Endovascular, our biopsy products had another strong quarter with 14% growth, with nice performance in the United States and even better performance outside of the United States.
Sales in our peripheral PTA line increased 48%, driven by global sales of our Lutonix drug-coated balloon. We are very pleased with the performance of this important product, which anniversary-ed its FDA approval and the U.S. launch on October 10. It has been a good first 12 months in the United States, and we're pleased with the results from our real-world registry study. John DeFord will tell you more about this in a few minutes.
As we seek to expand the indications and reach of this compelling technology platform, we expect to see long-term global growth from Lutonix. Our Stent business declined 3% again this quarter, consistent with recent experience. And finally, net sales in our Vena Cava Filter line declined 3% in Q3.
So let's go to Urology. Total net sales were $212.3 million, up 5% versus Q3 of last year on a constant currency basis and 1% on an as-reported basis. The United States business grew 5% while internationally, we grew 4%. Our Targeted Temperature Management products grew in the healthy double digits again this quarter. Our basic drainage business was up 6% globally in Q3, with the United States business up 7%. Our I.C. Foley business was up 3% globally and up 1% in the United States. We believe that Foleys this quarter benefited from some dealer stocking, but we don't know the precise impact. So we've been cautioned against reading too much into these improved growth rates in a single quarter.
Our continence business decreased 3% in the third quarter. Sales in urological specialties grew 1% with our brachytherapy business down 1%. And finally, in this category, standalone sales of our StatLock catheter stabilization product line declined 4% in Q3.
Now let's go to Oncology. Total net sales in this category were $239.3 million, an increase of 8% on a constant currency basis and 4% on an as-reported basis over the third quarter last year. Geographically, net sales in the United States were up 5% and international sales were up 15%. Our port business decreased 1% this quarter due to the price reductions in the United States that we talked about at the beginning of the year. Our PICC revenue was up 13% in the third quarter, including strong results in the United States, Europe and emerging markets again this quarter. We're very pleased with the clinical adoption of our advanced technology, which helps patients and can save time and cost for the hospital.
Despite the competitive noise on single features here and there, we believe that the quality and performance of our broad product offering is why we continue to grow faster than the market. And as the competition tries to catch up to our older products, we continue to advance the technology and solve unmet needs for our customers and our patients. John DeFord will tell you more about this.
Our vascular access ultrasound product line was up 1% this quarter. The growth rates for this system can be a little lumpy around new product launches, and that's what we're seeing due to the Vision II launch in the prior year and the pending Site-Rite 8 launch later this year. And to complete Oncology, our Dialysis Access product line was up 12% over Q3 of last year.
So let's conclude with our Surgical Specialties business. Total net sales in this category were $139.8 million, up 6% on a constant currency basis and up 3% as-reported. United States sales were up 6% and international sales grew 4% this quarter. Two years after the acquisition of the Arista Hemostat and 3 years after the acquisition of the Progel sealant technology, our combined biosurgical product portfolio continues to grow double digits.
Our soft tissue repair business grew 7% in Q3, with our synthetic ventral hernia repair products growing 6%, while our natural tissue products grew 14%, driven by our new XenMatrix AB coated porcine mesh. Our hernia fixation business grew 2% this quarter, which was the first quarter in positive territory since the second quarter of 2011. We are hopeful that our new product launches here can reverse the trend of declines in recent years.
In closing out the surgical category, our performance irrigation business was down 20% in Q3. As we told you, we discontinued some products earlier in the year.
This concludes our product line revenue discussion, and now I'll turn you over to John DeFord."

Bard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John, and good afternoon -- or maybe it's evening for everyone. Thanks for taking time to join us today. For the sake of time, I'll jump right into some highlights, starting with drug-coated balloons. About 2 weeks ago at TCT, we released full 12-",1197,"Thanks, John, and good afternoon -- or maybe it's evening for everyone. Thanks for taking time to join us today. For the sake of time, I'll jump right into some highlights, starting with drug-coated balloons. About 2 weeks ago at TCT, we released full 12-month results from our almost 700-patient global SFA and popliteal registry. Lesion lengths were over 100 millimeters. About half the patients had significant calcification and over 30% of the lesions treated were chronic total occlusions. The study found over 94% of patients were free from TLR through the 12-month follow-up, with primary patency in almost 90% of patients. Interim 24-month results demonstrated 93% freedom from TLR and primary patency in excess of 80%. We believe the learnings from the Levant 2 study on keys to a successful procedure are working their way into real-world practice, and we're very pleased with the results.
In our Below the Knee IDE, enrollment continues, though recruitment remains slower than planned due to the complex nature of these patients and their disease. We're working with FDA to find ways to speed up enrollment and analysis in this important study. At current recruitment weight -- rates, we like -- we'll likely continue to enroll patients through much of 2016, putting PMA submission in the second half of 2017.
On the other hand, our AV access DCB IDE study that began enrollment last quarter is recruiting very quickly, and we anticipate enrollment could be complete as early as Q1 of 2016, which could put PMA submission ahead of schedule in the first half of 2017. The in-stent restenosis IDE study is ongoing, and we're currently planning a second half 2016 PMA submission, seeking this expanded indication. We have a host of other DCB studies ongoing or in start-up around the world, and we plan to begin enrollment in our Levant China study in Q1 of 2016.
Also in Vascular, the LifeStream Balloon Expandable Covered Stent IDE completed enrollment in Q3. This clinical study is evaluating the technology for the treatment of iliac artery disease with a 9-month follow-up. We anticipate PMA submission in the second half of 2016.
Our COVERA next-generation stent graft, designed for use in the AV access circuit, is planned for launch in Europe this quarter, and we're working with FDA to commence our U.S. IDE study in the first half of 2016. Our new de-novo [ph]  Venous stent recently gained a CE mark. As with COVERA, we're working closely with FDA to initiate an IDE study seeking U.S. approval, with enrollment planned to begin in the first half of next year.
Next, moving to Urology and home care, we're pleased to announce the release of the new Magic3 Go self-lubricated catheter for female patients. This product's designed for enhanced comfort and ease-of-use for patients that often have limited dexterity. We plan to roll out this product selectively during Q4 as we ramp manufacturing. We also anticipate the launch of our Magic3 touchless catheter in early 2016. Both of these products employ our latest silicone technology designed to enhance patient use and comfort.
We've got some other impactful products in this portfolio for launch later in 2016. But I'll hold off sharing the details until we get closer to those launches.
Now moving to Oncology. The new Site-Rite 8 ultrasound system with integrated 3CG Diamond is rolling out in Europe. The Site-Rite 8 with Pinpoint GT and 3CG Diamond is on track for U.S. launch in Q4, as John alluded to. We believe the combination of ultrasound, needle guidance and catheter tip confirmation in an integrated system will provide a full-featured, user-friendly and intuitive solution for vascular catheter placement.
In PICCs, we've submitted the 510(k) and await FDA clearance to launch a new and proprietary catheter family. These PICCs have been designed to resist common chemicals used in chemotherapy solutions as well as cleaning and disinfection agents. While these solutions are known to degrade standard PICC materials, this new catheter can maintain the same high-performance standards available in our current PICCs, even after long-term exposure. We're also expanding our development efforts toward technologies we believe can further reduce the risk of thrombosis.
While we prefer to keep our development plans confidential, I will say we have a new product family under development that's based on a new high-performance material. We expect to begin launching products using this new material in the back half of next year. Our current plans also anticipate commencement of studies to provide further clinical evidence to support the benefits of these new designs.
In concert with these efforts, we've also recently launched a training program and some associated products designed to reduce infections and promote the safe and effective use of our PICCs. With this change in near-term focus, we've reduced the priority we placed on our antimicrobial and thrombo-resistant coating technologies. The developments are ongoing, but we don't believe they'll have a major revenue contribution compared to these other opportunities.
For the difficult stick IV catheter patients, we announced on the last call the acquisition of the AccuCath guide wire-assisted PIV products. We've taken that technology into our development engine and anticipate the launch of an improved family of AccuCath products in the first half of 2016. These products are anticipated to launch alongside our new midline catheter, the PowerGlide Pro, also planned for launch in that same time period. We believe the combination of our PICCs, the PowerGlide midline family and AccuCath IV product line will help us bring important guide wire-assisted devices to a broad spectrum of patients with Vascular Access needs.
Lastly, for the acute hemodialysis patient, we're expanding our family of catheters with the expected launch of a new dual lumen power Xenesys [ph] catheter in Q1 of next year. Xenesys [ph] is designed for superior flexibility and kink resistance, along with flow rates in excess of 400 ml per minute in a small 11 per inch catheter configuration.
I'll close my portion of the discussion today with surgery. Just a few weeks ago, we launched our new Phasix ST resorbable synthetic mesh. This launch adds another differentiated product to our complex abdominal wall portfolio that includes XenMatrix, XenMatrix AB and the Phasix mesh technology. We're continuing our efforts to expand our product offerings based on the Phasix platform, and we expect to begin launching those new products over the next several quarters. We're also making good progress on our development of additional sizes of our one-of-a-kind antibiotic-coated XenMatrix AB family, with launches expected throughout 2016 and into 2017. In our BioSurgery product offering, on our last call, I told you we'd filed our PMA supplement, seeking approval of our new TRIDYNE vascular sealant. And we continue to anticipate approval and launch in the back half of next year.
And finally, in mesh fixation, we recently launched both the OPTIFIX spring-loaded resorbable tack device and the Capsure permanent fixation product. We're working to build upon that momentum through the launch of 2 additional fixation devices. But due to the competitive nature of this market, I'll hold back the details for a later call.
Thanks for your time and attention tonight. Let me now hand you over to Chris."
254131,312630689,880656,"CR Bard Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,"Earnings Calls","C. R. Bard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Let's start with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods.In Q3, we had acquisition-related items of $2.5 million and a $14.6 million charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives. This quarter, we",1136,"Thank you, John. Let's start with the items that affect the comparability of our results between periods.
In Q3, we had acquisition-related items of $2.5 million and a $14.6 million charge for restructuring and productivity initiatives. This quarter, we had made significant additional progress in settlement activity related to our women's health product liability. Driven by this settlement progress and additional information learned from it as well as recent activity in other product liability matters, we took an additional combined charge of $241.1 million this quarter. The P&L impact for these items is detailed in the notes to the financial statements and the reconciliation accompanying our Q3 earnings press release.
Now let's go through the statement of income for the quarter. Gross profit was $529.4 million or 61.2% of sales for Q3. On an adjusted basis, gross profit was $530.3 million or 61.3% of sales, a little better than we projected and down 120 basis points from the prior year. New amortization of intangibles relating to transactions closed in the last 12 months was about 50 basis points this quarter, and foreign exchange drove approximately 30 basis points of headwind for us in Q3. 
Price was unfavorable by 90 basis points on the revenue line and approximately 30 basis points in gross profit, and our mix was favorable by about 40 basis points this quarter. As we forecasted last quarter, the manufacturing variances in our plants from year-to-year can be a little lumpy, and Q3 is an example of that. In Q2, cost savings drove 90 basis points of improvement; but in Q3, it was 50 basis points negative. In Q4 -- we look for Q4 to look more like Q2 with strong favorability. So we expect gross profit in Q4 on an adjusted basis to be a meaningful improvement over Q3 and back to the Q4 2014 level or maybe even a little bit better, which would put us near the high end of the original guidance we gave you for gross margins for the full year. So it's been a year of solid organic improvement for us on the gross margin line.
SG&A expenses were $247.1 million for the quarter or 28.5% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was also 28.5% of sales, down 60 basis points from Q3 of last year. I'll remind you that we typically see an uptick in SG&A as a percent of sales in Q4 sequentially, but we expect to still see good leverage compared to the prior year and expect to be within our full year guidance for 2015.
R&D expenditures totaled $65.2 million or 7.5% of sales on a reported basis for the third quarter, which was the same on an adjusted basis, down 40 basis points from the prior year and right on our full year guidance. We feel good about the level of investment in innovation and continue to drive an active new product pipeline towards faster revenue growth opportunities as you could probably tell from John DeFord's update.
Interest expense was $11.2 million for the third quarter, no change from the prior year. Other income and expense was $258.3 million of expense for the third quarter as-reported and $1.8 million of expense on an adjusted basis. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.9%, which is the same for the 9 months year-to-date, where we are down 50 basis points compared to the prior year, consistent with our original guidance. We do expect the renewal of the R&D tax credit before the end of the year, which would lower the rate in Q4.
Diluted shares on adjusted earnings for the period were $75.4 million, and we repurchased 767,000 shares during the third quarter. The net result is adjusted cash EPS for Q3 of $2.28, above the guidance range we provided for the quarter, driven by the higher sales.
The balance sheet as of September 30 reflects cash, restricted cash and short-term investments of $1.1 billion, no change from June 30. For the quarter, accounts receivable days were down 1.6 days and inventory days were down 3 days. Capital expenditures totaled $21.7 million for the quarter.
On the liability side, total debt was $1.4 billion as of September 30, no change from June 30. Debt to total cap at the end of the third quarter was about 49%, and total shareholder investment was $1.5 billion at September 30.
Now moving to financial guidance. At the beginning of this year, we guided organic revenue growth to be between 4% and 5% for the full year, and we're now expecting to be closer to 6.5%. That includes lapping the anniversary of the U.S. launch of Lutonix in Q4 of 2014, which included significant initial stocking orders. Excluding those initial stocking orders from last year, which we estimate represent about 1% of sales to the quarter, we project Q4 organic sales growth between 5% and 6%, with about 300 basis points of headwind from FX and an additional 200 basis points of headwind from other sales reductions on a reported basis. The biggest of these reductions relates to the pending acquisition of the Japanese joint venture, which would add about $40 million to operating revenue on an annual basis. However, the joint venture is holding inventory we have already recorded as sales to them. So we expect to have a negative impact to reported revenue in Q4 and Q1 until we work through that inventory.
We also, as we've discussed in prior calls, expect the sales of EP products to Boston Scientific to decline in Q4, as they have now started manufacturing some of those product lines themselves. So we are projecting reported revenue to be flat to down 1% in Q4, even though the organic momentum in the business is expected to remain quite strong.
Now to update our expectations for adjusted cash EPS. Following our announcement of the acquisition of our Japanese JV, our latest forecast was $8.95 to $9.05 for the full year. Today, we are raising that guidance to be between $9.03 and $9.07. At the midpoint, this also represents a $0.05 increase to our original full year guidance provided in January despite absorbing approximately $0.15 of expected combined dilution from acquisitions and worsening FX during the year. Specific to Q4, this means we expect adjusted cash EPS to be between $2.38 and $2.42, which includes about $0.06 for the renewal of the R&D tax credit. This performance speaks to the strength of our execution in 2015. We've been able to increase investments in the business with the objective of sustaining above-market revenue growth while absorbing dilution along the way, and yet we still expect to increase the EPS delivered on the bottom line in 2015 above our initial expectation.
Thank you for your attention. I'll now turn you back to Tim."

There's been about 2% that relates specifically to the decline in Boston sales expected in the quarter and the impact of lower sales into Japan -- a result of us expecting to close the acquisition in a couple of weeks here. So the combination of those and a flat Gore royalty reduced sales by 2%. So you get the constant currency, if you will, Bob, of 2% to 3% for the quarter. And then the FX impact, as we said, is going to reduce sales by 3%. So that then gets us to the negative 1% to 0% on a reported basis."

So I think, certainly, as we look at Q4, as it relates to Boston's order pattern, we would certainly expect to see a sequential decline as they begin to now work through that initial inventory. So that's certainly impacting the overall growth rate for Lutonix as we look at Q4. We're seeing continued very strong organic growth in Lutonix. Relative to last Q4, though, we had a large stocking order in our own business, right? And so that's -- it's that lapping of that as well as the sequential sales into Boston that are just driving some of the sequential moves for Lutonix."

Let me talk a little bit about the utilization. I think what you heard at TCT is fairly consistent. We're beginning to see drug-coated balloons used as sort of an initial therapy, not necessarily the destination therapy, but an initial therapy. And then depending on the outcome of that initial therapy, making other decisions. Now obviously, atherectomy or things like that might come into play prior to using any kind of other technology. But by and large, we're seeing drug-coated balloons be used first. And then as you would expect, if there's provisional stenting required, then stents are used. If there are other technologies or other pieces needed, then they get included. So I don't think we ever expected DCB to replace some of these other technologies. But we are seeing it move exactly as we expected to be the first line of therapy. We think there's still a long way to go as far as growth and penetration. But this is -- it's still early days.

I would say it's virtually impossible to know that over that short period of time. So we said in the past, it kind of felt like things were getting a little bit better. I think that some of the old metrics we used to use, like hospital admissions, especially when you're involved in procedures, maybe aren't the bellwether signs necessarily that they were a few years ago. So some of the dynamics, as you know, in health care utilization generally are changing. So it's kind of difficult to say when you look at hospital admission metrics maybe going down, and yet our revenue continues to grow. What does all that mean? It's just very difficult to say.

We think that clinicians are really interested in looking at both pivotal and randomized studies and registries. I think the Levant 2 study, as published in New England Journal of Medicine, it was a very unique study design. Also, we've also found in that study that procedure really matters. And that was something that came out at panel, came out in some of the post discussions, that the way the device was used compared to PTA was different. And actually, in our study, the drug-coated balloon was used what you could call had a less-effective treatment at the end of the procedure compared to PTA. Again, I think that is attributed to some of the results that we see in our randomized study. 
Certainly, I understand our competitor wanting to try to shift the discussion back to theirs. It's kind of interesting they haven't updated their registry data yet. But our registry data real world is in much -- more difficult patients than we saw in Levant 2. We think it's really demonstrating the real-world usage of the technology. And of course, those clinicians were educated on the things that we've learned in the Levant 2 study on the importance of fully inflating the balloons, getting good expansion, appropriate access to the vessel and the lesion quickly and other things that were discussed by Dr. Schmidt at TCT. And so we think that these results are pretty indicative of real world usage based on that new knowledge. Now what clinicians are going to do? So far, I think it's resonated pretty well that drug-coated balloons work. And at least the 2 technologies on the market today seem to work pretty similarly."

We've been taking share annually in both of those major product lines that we acquired. We really built out a very successful independent sales force, pretty large by U.S. standards in that business. And I think they're executing extremely well. So we have been growing substantially in that space. We would expect we will continue to. And we're always looking for opportunities to be adjunctive to those product lines."

As I said, we launched a couple of additional sizes in Q3, which drove, we think, some additional stocking in Q3. And so certainly, we would expect a sequential decline in Q4 for Boston as they begin to work through that initial stocking inventory. So when you then adjust for our big stocking order last year in Q4, we're seeing really terrific, both sequential and year-over-year, growth in our base organic Lutonix business. And feel really good about our competitive position. And John DeFord talked about the real-world registry data, which is, frankly, outstanding. So we'll need to get through these couple of quarters here and get to a steady-state next year, where Boston's been in the business now with us for a while, and we've been moved beyond our initial launch in the U.S."

Your question was, will they -- what kind of a position will they have with Lutonix? I mean, as we set out on this, Boston had the rights to sell the product at a small subset of customers based on where they had good relationships or position in a certain therapy that we're not involved in. We have no plans to expand that to other product lines today or circumstances. I think this was a unique opportunity for us to be complementary with Boston in a small segment of customers, and I think that we like that positioning.
