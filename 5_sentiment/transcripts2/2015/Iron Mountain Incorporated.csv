After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A.
As we have done for the past couple of quarters, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on our Investor Relations page of the website at www.ironmountain.com under Investor Relations/Financial Information.
Referring now to Page 2 of that supplemental package, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2015 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings commentary, the safe harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations to these non-GAAP measures, as required by your Reg G are included in the supplemental reporting package.
With that, Bill, would you please begin?"

Before I begin, I think given the recent news stories following on from our December announcement with respect to a proposal to acquire Recall, I think I should just make a statement before we get into discussing our results for both the quarter and the year. We strongly believe that our acquisition of Recall would provide both company shareholders with a unique opportunity to participate in the growth of the combined businesses with attractive growth prospects. We believe that there's significant value creation potential from such a transaction for both companies' customers as well. We continued to try to figure out ways to narrow the valuation gap, but we'll only pursue a deal at the right price. We have nothing to report at this time. With that, let me turn to our results.
We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operating performance, wrapping up an eventful year of good progress on our 3-year strategic plan and our successful conversion to a REIT. During 2014, we continued to improve results in our developed markets, expanded our exposure to faster growing emerging markets and generated momentum in our emerging business segment. In addition, we expanded our REIT investor outreach, and we were added to the MSCI REIT in the FTSE NAREIT indices. Inclusion in these important benchmarks is important for generating a higher level of awareness of Iron Mountain as an attractive REIT investment.
Let me now turn to financial highlights. Rod will have more in a few minutes. On a constant dollar basis, our financial results for 2014 were right in line with our expectations. The significant strengthening of the dollar in the fourth quarter impacted our reported figures, as it did for most multinationals, resulting in growth in total revenue and adjusted OIBDA of over 3%, including restructuring charges. But on a constant dollar basis, we believe more -- which we believe more accurately reflects core operating performance, growth in these measures was just under 5% at the top end of our ranges. These results are supported by the durability of our storage rental business and are in line with our 3-year plan to achieve 4% compounded annual growth on a constant dollar basis in both total revenues and adjusted OIBDA.
Turning to operating highlights. Total storage revenue, a key economic driver of our business, was up 5.4% in constant dollars for the year, driven by strong growth of 13% in our international business and roughly 3% gains in both our North American Records and Information Management and Data Management segments. These results reflect our continued focus on driving net positive records management volume and storage rental revenue growth in developed markets and further penetration into higher-growth, emerging markets. In developed markets, we further sharpened our focus with the fourth quarter sale of our Shredder operations in the U.K., Ireland and Australia. We chose to divest these businesses because they were much smaller than our North American operations and we did not benefit from the same scale. At the same time, we acquired Secure Records Management in Canada, which brought us 9 facilities and 3 million cubic feet of records, including available space to support the on-boarding of a major new customer.
In Records Management, we added more than 18 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a base of 500 million cubic feet at the beginning of the year or 3.6% net growth. The growth was in part achieved as a result of the significant turnaround from negative to positive internal volume growth, in other words, before any impact of acquisitions, we achieved in North America. Importantly, North America represented 20% or more than 20% of our gains for the year, excluding volume from acquisitions. Globally, we maintained customer churn of under 2%. This is unchanged from Q3 levels but represents a 30% improvement over the level of customer losses experienced 2 years ago. This combination of improved customer retention, growth in new sales and consistent new volume from existing customers drove 3.5% internal storage rental growth in the fourth quarter, continuing the steady improvement we achieved throughout the year. Our strong fourth quarter growth rate did benefit from favorable comps relative to the 1.3% internal storage rental growth in the same period last year, but even when normalizing for that, we saw a nice pickup and are pleased with the momentum as we head into 2015. Our internal storage rental revenue growth expectations for this year are in the range of 2% to 2.5%.
Turning to emerging markets. We are making good progress towards our goal of 16% of total revenue from emerging markets by the end of next year. These high-growth countries represent 13.9% of our total revenues at the end of the year on a constant dollar basis using our 2014 FX budget rates and a 12.8% on reported basis. You'll hear from Rod that FX currency rates will be a drag on reported performance this year. Whilst our operating margin in virtually all our countries are naturally hedged and preserved, like most multinationals, we're not immune to the effects of currency translation in terms of absolute earnings impacting U.S. dollars. However, given our opportunity to expand internationally on what is today a relatively small international base, we like the fact that we have the benefit of investing in U.S. dollars overseas during this part of the currency cycle. We continue to see attractive growth potential in both storage and service in these markets as they are beginning to embrace outsourcing of enterprise storage, especially given the durability of our business. Both internal total revenue and internal storage rental growth in these markets was more than 15% in the fourth quarter. In addition, unlike more mature multinationals whose growth rates are fairly similar around the globe, we are in a unique position to invest our capital in markets where we're still early in the growth cycle, enabling us to capture higher growth rates off our lower basis, thereby enhancing our returns in the medium to long term. Given this as a backdrop, acquisitions continue to be an integral part of our strategy with the focus on higher-growth emerging markets. We completed $190 million of acquisitions in 2014, including the records inventory of smaller records management companies with more than $125 million of the total in emerging markets through Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific regions. We have a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities in emerging markets with more than 4x the coverage needed to achieve our goal of 16% on a constant dollar basis. And we'll continue to evaluate those opportunities in light of our targeted returns and favorable underlying growth dynamics that support the durability of our business.
Within our emerging business opportunity area, we continue to make progress in our data center operations. We have invested more than $70 million to date with $35 million of that in 2014, expanding our capacity in the underground facility in delivering our first phase in Boston. Whilst absorption in our Boston Data Center is just beginning to pick up on a blended basis, we have achieved a stabilized un-levered return on invested capital in this business of 9%, which we feel are -- which we feel is good given how recently we added our new capacity, and expect that this return will stabilize at 11% to 12% on a fully utilized basis. We continue to evaluate other emerging business opportunities that leverage our unique platform as a leader in enterprise storage. We see the potential to expand our brand strength and chain of custody and logistics to a broader range of offerings. Many of these opportunities are customer-driven, where they ask for our assistance in solving an enterprise storage need, whether it be upstream in their supply chain or downstream to support distribution. We expect to have more on this at our Investor Day in October. These facets of our strategic plan all support the durability of our business, the sustainability of our cash flow and our fit as a REIT. When you consider the nature of our business, our enterprise storage foundation compares very favorably with self-storage. We have superior customer credit quality given our service to more than 92% of the Fortune 1000. We serve more than 155,000 business customers, which leads to a diversified revenue stream and low customer churn of less than 2% per year. Unlike consumer self-storage where customers tend to be in transition and frequently have more temporary needs, the average life of a box in our facilities is 15 years. This means we have very low volatility. In fact, we've posted 26 years of consecutive growth in storage rental revenue, which persisted even throughout the Great Financial Crisis. And like self-storage, we have a service component to our business that is inextricably linked to our customers' underlying storage needs. We also compare very favorably with the industrial sector, if you think about the nature of our operating facilities. The major difference is there are real estate cost are incurred by the square foot, but we generate storage rental revenue by the cubic foot. We're essentially renting air. This multiplier effect generates a significant spread between our cost and our return on investment. It yields a very high net operating income per square foot and is core to how we create value for our stockholders. Similar to the industrial sector, we have a low maintenance CapEx requirement, but our turnover costs are even lower on a per-foot basis. And when we invest in incremental racking structures within an existing industrial shell, we can generate very strong return due to this volume dynamic. As we've talked on recent calls, we intend to buy $800 million to $1 billion of our lease facilities over the next 8 to 10 years, shifting our mix to a higher percentage of owned properties. This supports our REIT status, but it also means we have more optionality over the long term. If we consolidate in our market and exit buildings that we own, we can lease them to customers for other industrial or distribution uses, or we can create value by selling them or redeveloping the underlying real estate in infield markets for alternative use.
Importantly, the REIT structure is consistent with our capital allocation goals and does not limit our ability to fund our business plan. As we become more active in buying in our properties and execute our acquisition pipeline, we expect to fund that incremental investment with additional borrowing and/or equity issuance similar to the manner in which most REITs fund external growth. You may have seen that the board declared our first quarter dividend of $0.475 per share this week. At a $40 stock price, our implied cap rate is about 7.5%, well above where other property sectors are trading. At the same share price, our dividend represents a 4.8% yield, well in excess of most REITs. Combined with our goal to grow adjusted OIBDA by 4% on a compounded rate, our dividend level supports our goal to deliver total shareholder returns in line with the 8% to 9% TSR or total shareholder return of the S&P 500. And this goal is prior to any potential upside from additional emerging business opportunities.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rod."

We continue to execute well against our strategic plan, and we are pleased with our strong operating performance for the year. Our results underscore the durability of our storage rental business and demonstrate the benefit of acquisitions we have made in emerging and developed markets.
I'll begin today with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance, followed by an update on our outlook for 2015. I will then address our capital deployment activities and conclude with a discussion of various REIT metrics. Please note that throughout my prepared remarks, I will reference selected slides from our comprehensive supplemental reporting package, which can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website.
Turning to our financial results for the quarter and the year. Let me direct you to the financial highlights on Page 8. Supported by strong storage rental growth, total reported revenues of $778 million, up approximately 1% compared with Q4 of 2013 and up 5% on a constant dollar basis. For the year, total revenues grew by 3% to $3.1 billion or by 4% on a constant dollar basis and in constant dollars at the top end of our guidance range. Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $220 million compared with $195 million in 2013. For the full year, adjusted OIBDA grew by 4% to $926 million or by 5% to $934 million on a constant dollar basis. For comparison, adjusted OIBDA for 2014 included $3.5 million of costs associated with the company's restructuring initiative. In addition, adjusted OIBDA in 2013 included $19 million in the fourth quarter and $23 million in the full year of restructuring costs.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.25 per diluted share compared with $0.21 in 2013. For full year 2014, adjusted EPS of $1.36 was within our guidance range. As we highlighted on our Q3 earnings call, adjusted EPS for the full year was impacted by REIT compliance costs and an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses associated with our conversion to a REIT as well as acceleration of real estate consolidation on some of our acquisitions.
It's important to note that adjusted EPS for 2013 was restated to be on a comparable basis using our structural tax rate of roughly 15%. Our structural rate for the year came out to 14% as a result of lower pretax income in international jurisdictions, which was impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% over the long term.
The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by solid storage rental revenue growth. On Page 9, top line growth for the quarter on a constant dollar basis was up 5%, reflecting solid storage rental revenue gains of 5% and service revenue growth of 4%. The growth in service revenue was driven by increased project activity, improvement in paper revenue and recent acquisitions. On a constant dollar basis, full year total revenue growth was 4% driven by storage rental revenue gains of 5% and service revenue growth of 3%. Also on the same page, we showed total worldwide volume growth. We continue to demonstrate improvements in net volume growth in Records Management with total year-on-year volume growth of 3.6% including acquisitions or 1.9% excluding acquisitions. Growth excluding acquisitions maintained the steady improvement in performance that we have seen in the last 2 years. Within this, we continue to see strong volume from existing customers who added approximately 30 million cubic feet of storage worldwide in this category. This number of boxes is consistent with prior years, but the percentage growth dip to just below 6% in Q4, driven by the denominator effect of our growing base of records under management.
Let's turn to Page 12, where we present components of growth on a segment basis. Q4 and full year segment results were generally in line with our expectations, but our strong storage rental revenue continues to exhibit durability. North American Records and Information Management or RIM delivered positive storage rental internal growth and maintained strong adjusted OIBDA margins of 38.5% during the fourth quarter and the year. North American Data Management or DM delivered storage rental internal growth of 6% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the year. During the fourth quarter, the strong storage rental growth in DM more than offset the decline in service revenues resulting in adjusted OIBDA expansion of 130 basis points. Declines in service revenues in Data Management continue to reflect the trend towards reduced activity and related transportation revenues as our customers rotate their tapes less frequently and the business becomes more archival.
The international segment continued to generate attractive results, with 8% storage rental internal growth and 4% internal service revenue growth for the quarter. For the full year, storage internal -- storage rental internal growth was 6% and internal service revenue growth was 2%. The international business continued to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in line with our mid-20s targets for the year. Adjusted OIBDA margins for the fourth quarter were impacted by costs related to continuous improvement integration expenses and other IT project expenses.
Let me direct you now to Page 11, where we lay out our performance for the year and against our guidance. Bill covered this at a high level, noting that constant dollar revenue and adjusted OIBDA were at the high end of our growth expectations. Our full year FFO and AFFO were also in line with our expectations, excluding the impact of FX. Our total distributions for the year, including the EMP special distribution, were about $1.1 billion. Approximately $200 million was return of capital, representing less than 20% of the total. It is common for a REIT to have some portion of its distributions characterized as return of capital, particularly in its initial year. In order to qualify as a REIT, it was critical that we purge our entire legacy EMP, including the EMP from our foreign QRS entities before the end of 2014. We intentionally built a level of conservatism into our distribution estimates as we do not want to risk unjust distributing and failing to qualify.
Also highlighted on this page are investment capital expenditures we have made during the year. Real estate investment of $200 million for the year were -- is in line with the midpoint of our guidance. Our maintenance CapEx was $83 million, at the low end of the guidance range. Non-real estate investments, the $43 million, was slightly below the low end of our guidance range. This was driven by timing of certain IT investments which will now occur in 2015. Acquisitions for the year were $189 million at the low end of our guidance range. Although the acquisition pipeline is large, we are very selective in the acquisitions that we undertake, and we ensure that they meet our hurdle rates.
Turning now to outlook for 2015 on Page 10. Business trends and operating fundamentals remain consistent. Operationally, we remain on track to achieve our long-term financial objectives, given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. That said, we have updated our 2015 guidance to reflect FX headwinds and our new constant currency rates, which was based at rates at the beginning of this year. We are projecting constant dollar revenue growth of 1% to 5% and growth in adjusted OIBDA of 1% to 5%, in line with our strategic plan. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.30. To be clear, this guidance, similar to the preliminary guidance we provided at the last earnings call, reflects our anticipation of absolute increase in total earnings in constant dollars, offset on a per-share basis by the impact of share issues in connection with the special distribution, and in addition, the impact of FX. Driven by the consistent growth in our business and stable fundamentals, we expect normalized FFO to be between $425 million to $465 million, with AFFO between $480 million and $520 million. Please note that the 2015 guidance, we have deducted non-real estate investment from our AFFO calculation in response to constructive feedback. On not strictly maintenance-related capital expense, these expenditures are necessary for us to support our REIT IT and customer interface systems and are somewhat recurring in nature. Therefore, we believe this change to our definition of AFFO is a more conservative approach.
As you saw yesterday, we announced our first quarterly dividend for the year at $0.475 per share. We continue to believe that our cash flow supports our dividend at current levels, and we expect our dividends to grow in line with operating performance. From a capital spend standpoint, we expect investment in real estate to be $230 million to $270 million, including investment in racking. Maintenance CapEx, consistent with prior years, is expected to be in the $70 million to $90 million range. Non-real estate investment is also expected to be in the $70 million to $90 million range, which is higher than in recent years due to the inclusion of REIT compliance-related CapEx and the timing of certain IT investments. Acquisition investments are expected to be $150 million to $250 million. It's difficult to be precise here as acquisitions are opportunistic in nature. We will update our outlook again on our Q1 earnings call to reflect any changes, if any, including the impact of any further changes up or down in FX.
Shifting to the balance sheet. Pages 26 and 27 presents our debt maturity schedule and related metrics. At quarter end, we had liquidity over more than $700 million. As forecasted at our Investor Day last year, our lease adjusted leverage ratio would increase to support shareholder payouts, expenditures in connection with the proposed conversion to a REIT and recent acquisitions. In quarter end, it was 5.4x, as planned. At today's stock price, our debt to total market capitalization is roughly 36%.
Turning now to REIT-specific metrics on Page 20. We provide our global real estate portfolio, which highlights our leased and owned facilities worldwide. The number of lease facilities increase slightly compared to the third quarter of 2014 as a result of our international acquisitions, through which we assumed a few operating leases. As we begin to consolidate facilities and execute on our real estate purchase plan, we expect to increase the portion of owned facilities by square footage. On Page 21, we have provided storage net operating income or NOI per rack square foot, which highlights the attractive economics we derived from our real estate. We continue to achieve strong storage NOI from combined records management and data management of approximately $29 per rack square foot worldwide due to the multiplier effect of renting our space by the cubic foot. This level compares favorably to NOI per square foot for most property types within the REIT sector.
On Page 22, our racking and building utilization rates are high and improved slightly since the last quarter at 91% and 83%, respectively, for the records management portfolio. We believe that due to fictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90s. When we enter into a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about 3 years' time.
On Page 29, we have combined -- provided components of value, a summary of the various parts of our business to facilitate valuation. As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA, excluding rent expense, in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis whether leased or owned. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities area. We think about our valuation as a REIT by applying the self-storage or industrial cap rates to our annualized NOI from our storage rental business. On top of the market value of our storage business, we add the value of the services business by applying appropriate multiple. We also provide other tangible assets, our current investments in buildings and racking, as well as the book value of recent acquisitions. We also provide liabilities, including our annual rent expense, to which we apply cap rates and deduct as another form of debt. We hope you find this disclosure useful. And as we have said in prior communications, we will continue to enhance our supplemental reporting and welcome feedback.
With that, I will now turn the call back to Bill."

Our 2014 financial results were on track with our expectations prior to the impact of foreign currency. And in fact, revenue on a constant dollar basis was at the top end of our range. Moreover, we look for similar constant dollar growth in 2015, consistent with the 3-year plan we laid out at our Investor Day nearly a year ago. Our fourth quarter operating results demonstrated the success of our initiatives to drive volume and storage rental growth in both our developed and emerging markets, and we're maintaining momentum as we move into 2015. We have attractive, high-return investment opportunities in all of our segments, including potential acquisitions in developed and emerging markets and interesting initiatives to leverage our enterprise storage brand through emerging business opportunities. We're maintaining our dividend in line with the growth in operating profit, which represents an attractive yield, whilst providing cash flow to fund required CapEx and a portion of our growth investment. We'll continue to maintain our capital allocation discipline. And like most REITs, we will look for -- we will look to fund external growth with new capital after first demonstrating our ability to generate the appropriate returns. Our business is durable and predictable and is characterized by attractive fundamentals compared with self-storage and industrial property types. Whilst FX had been a drag in the recent quarter, we also see the current FX environment as an opportunity to take advantage of the strong U.S. dollar to increase our small but growing investment in the high-growth emerging markets at favorable rates.

But the way I think about service revenue, Andrew, and I think you do as well, is that the service activity -- service activity that we can directly influence and is also independent, if you like, from some of our core records management business. And then their service activity that is dependent on the activity of what's going on within the full storage side. I think what was positive for us in Q4, if we look at the first areas of the stuff that we can influence directly, we had a particularly good quarter in what we call projects. So that's why we did specific assignments for customers that sort of help them more with their records management issues. And that was a good strong performance. In addition, we also had a benefit of a good Shred performance during Q4, some of which was driven by an improved paper price that we've seen sort of tip up a bit into -- in Q4. In terms of the activity associated with our records business, within the RM side, although there was still a sort of modest decline, the decline is not as serious as we've seen. And so again, I think we are always nervous about calling the bottom of that, but at least it was a more favorable quarter than we see and actually follows on from Q3 in that regard. I think the contrast to that would be, as Bill said, within the DM side, we did see quite a significant drop in service activity associated with tape and sort of tape rotation. So now let's talk about 2015. As Bill said, we've actually done a bit of reorganization on the service side, particularly within North America, to give more focus on our scanning business and our shredding business, which I think will benefit us. And I would hope that within the RM side, although there'll probably still be continuing declines with activity associated with box, that should be a -- that will be at lower levels. But on the DM side, I do think we'll continue to see quite significant reduction. So in sort of summary, in terms of activity that we can control, I think we'll be -- I'm hoping for a good performance there. On the stuff that we -- is more difficult for us to control, RM, more positive things. DM, I think will continue to struggle. Bill, any..."

First of all, we do have a new offering in secure distraction which we're seeing, albeit off a small base, but very rapid growth off that base. So I think you'll start seeing that come through in some of the service numbers associated with the DM business. The other aspect is that we have taken a focus on maintaining, and in some cases, trying to add additional volume what the call our premium transport services around DM, which is dedicated transport. So there are a couple of puts and takes and initiatives that we just started in the last quarter of last year. And we expect those to continue to come through. But the overall trend in DM as it becomes more archival, like the box business, the DM business is a little bit behind in terms of the life cycle of that."

Before I begin, I think given recent news stories following on from our December announcement with respect to a proposal to acquire Recall, I think I should just make a statement before we get into our -- discussing our results for both the quarter and the year. 
We strongly believe that our acquisition of Recall would provide both company, shareholders with a unique opportunity to participate in the growth of the combined businesses with attractive growth prospects. We believe that there is significant value creation potential from such a transaction for both companies' customers as well. We continue to try to figure out ways to narrow the valuation gap, but we'll only pursue a deal at the right price. We have nothing to report at this time. With that, let me turn to our results.
We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operating performance, wrapping up an eventful year of good progress on our 3-year strategic plan and our successful conversion to a REIT. During 2014, we continued to improve results in our developed markets, expanded our exposure to faster-growing emerging markets and generated momentum in our emerging business segment. In addition, we expanded our REIT investor outreach, and we were added to the MSCI REIT in the FTSE NAREIT indices. Inclusion in these important benchmarks is important for generating a higher level of awareness of Iron Mountain as an attractive REIT investment.
Let me now turn to financial highlights. Rod will have more in a few minutes. 
On a constant dollar basis, our financial results for 2014 were right in line with our expectations. The significant strengthening of the dollar in the fourth quarter impacted our reported figures, as it did for most multinationals, resulting in growth in total revenue and adjusted OIBDA of over 3%, including restructuring charges. But on a constant dollar basis, we believe more -- which we believe more accurately reflects core operating performance, growth in these measures was just under 5%, at the top end of our ranges. These results are supported by the durability of our storage rental business and are in line with our 3-year plan to achieve 4% compounded annual growth on a constant dollar basis in both total revenues and adjusted OIBDA.
Turning to operating highlights. Total storage revenue, a key economic driver of our business, was up 5.4% in constant dollars for the year, driven by strong growth of 13% in our International business and roughly 3% gains in both our North American Records and Information Management and Data Management segments. These results reflect our continued focus on driving net positive records management volume and storage rental revenue growth in developed markets and further penetration into higher-growth Emerging Markets. In developed markets, we further sharpened our focus with the fourth quarter sale of our shred operations in the U.K., Ireland and Australia. We chose to divest these businesses because they were much smaller than our North American operations and we did not benefit from the same scale. At the same time, we acquired Securit Records Management in Canada, which brought us 9 facilities and 3 million cubic feet of records, including available space to support the onboarding of a major new customer.
In Records Management, we added more than 18 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a base of 500 million cubic feet at the beginning of the year or 3.6% net growth. The growth was in part achieved as a result of the significant turnaround from negative to positive internal volume growth, in other words before any impact of acquisitions, we achieved in North America. Importantly, North America represented 20% -- or more than 20% of our gains for the year, excluding volume from acquisitions. 
Globally, we maintained customer churn of under 2%. This is unchanged from Q3 levels but represents a 30% improvement over the level of customer losses experienced 2 years ago. This combination of improved customer retention, growth in new sales and consistent new volume from existing customers drove 3.5% internal storage rental growth in the fourth quarter, continuing the steady improvement we achieved throughout the year. 
Our strong fourth quarter growth rate did benefit from favorable comps relative to the 1.3% internal storage rental growth in the same period last year. But even when normalizing for that, we saw a nice pickup and are pleased with the momentum as we head into 2015. Our internal storage rental revenue growth expectations for this year are in the range of 2% to 2.5%.
Turning to Emerging Markets. We are making good progress towards our goal of 16% of total revenue from Emerging Markets by the end of next year. These high-growth countries represent 13.9% of our total revenues at the end of the year on a constant dollar basis using our 2014 FX budget rates and a 12.8% on reported basis. 
You'll hear from Rod that FX currency rates will be a drag on reported performance this year. Whilst our operating margin in virtually all our countries are naturally hedged and preserved, like most multinationals we're not immune to the effects of currency translation in terms of absolute earnings impacting U.S. dollars. However, given our opportunity to expand internationally on what is today a relatively small international base, we like the fact that we have the benefit of investing in U.S. dollars overseas during this part of the currency cycle. 
We continue to see attractive growth potential in both storage and service in these markets as they are beginning to embrace outsourcing of enterprise storage, especially given the durability of our business. Both internal total revenue and internal storage rental growth in these markets was more than 15% in the fourth quarter. In addition, unlike more mature multinationals whose growth rates are fairly similar around the globe, we are in a unique position to invest our capital in markets where we're still early in the growth cycle, enabling us to capture higher growth rates off our lower bases, thereby enhancing our returns in the medium to long term. 
Given this as a backdrop, acquisitions continue to be an integral part of our strategy with a focus on high-growth emerging markets. We completed $190 million of acquisitions in 2014, including the records inventory of smaller records management companies with more than $125 million of the total in emerging markets through Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific regions. 
We have a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities in emerging markets with more than 4x the coverage needed to achieve our goal of 16% on a constant dollar basis. And we'll continue to evaluate those opportunities in light of our targeted returns and favorable underlying growth dynamics that support the durability of our business.
Within our emerging business opportunity area, we continue to make progress in our data center operations. We have invested more than $70 million to date with $35 million of that in 2014, expanding our capacity in the underground facility and delivering our first phase in Boston. Whilst absorption in our Boston Data Center is just beginning to pick up on a blended basis, we have achieved a stabilized unlevered return on invested capital in this business of 9%, which we feel are -- which we feel is good given how recently we added our new capacity, and expect that this return will stabilize at 11% to 12% on a fully utilized basis. 
We continue to evaluate other emerging business opportunities that leverage our unique platform as a leader in enterprise storage. We see the potential to expand our brand strength and chain of custody and logistics to a broader range of offerings. Many of these opportunities are customer driven, where they asked for our assistance in solving an enterprise storage need whether it be upstream in their supply chain or downstream to support distribution. We expect to have more on this at our Investor Day in October. These facets of our strategic plan all support the durability of our business, the sustainability of our cash flow and our fit as a REIT. 
When you consider the nature of our business, our enterprise storage foundation compares very favorably with self-storage. We have superior customer credit quality given our service to more than 92% of the Fortune 1000. We serve more than 155,000 business customers, which leads to a diversified revenue stream and low customer churn of less than 2% per year. Unlike consumer self-storage where customers tend to be in transition and frequently have more temporary needs, the average life of a box in our facilities is 15 years. This means we have very low volatility. In fact, we've posted 26 years of consecutive growth in storage rental revenue, which persisted even throughout the great financial crisis. And like self-storage, we have a service component to our business that is inextricably linked to our customers' underlying storage needs. 
We also compare very favorably with the industrial sector if you think about the nature of our operating facilities. The major difference is their real estate costs are incurred by the square foot, but we generate storage rental revenue by the cubic foot. We're essentially renting air. This multiplier effect generates a significant spread between our costs and our return on investment. It yields a very high net operating income per square foot and is core to how we create value for our stockholders. 
Similar to the industrial sector, we have a low-maintenance CapEx requirement, but our turnover costs are even lower on a per-foot basis. And when we invest in incremental racking structures within an existing industrial shell, we can generate very strong returns due to this volume dynamic. 
As we've talked on recent calls, we intend to buy $800 million to $1 billion of our lease facilities over the next 8 to 10 years, shifting our mix to a higher percentage of owned properties. This supports our REIT status, but it also means we have more optionality over the long term. If we consolidate in our market and exit buildings that we own, we can lease them to customers for other industrial or distribution uses, or we can create value by selling them or redeveloping the underlying real estate in infill markets for alternative use.
Importantly, the REIT structure is consistent with our capital allocation goals and does not limit our ability to fund our business plan. As we become more active in buying in our properties and execute our acquisition pipeline, we expect to fund that incremental investment with additional borrowing and/or equity issuance, similar to the manner in which most REITs fund external growth. 
You may have seen that the board declared our first quarter dividend of $0.475 per share this week. At a $40 stock price, our implied cap rate is about 7.5%, well above where other property sectors are trading. At the same share price, our dividend represents a 4.8% yield, well in excess of most REITs. Combined with our goal to grow adjusted OIBDA by 4% on a compounded rate, our dividend level supports our goal to deliver total shareholder returns in line with the 8% to 9% TSR, or total shareholder return, of the S&P 500. And this goal is prior to any potential upside from additional emerging business opportunities.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rod."

We continue to execute well against our strategic plan, and we are pleased with our strong operating performance for the year. Our results underscore the durability of our storage rental business and demonstrate the benefit of acquisitions we have made in emerging and developed markets.
I'll begin today with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance, followed by an update on our outlook for 2015. I will then address our capital deployment activities and conclude with a discussion of various REIT metrics. Please note that throughout my prepared remarks, I will reference selected slides from our comprehensive supplemental reporting package, which can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website.
Turning to our financial results for the quarter and the year. Let me direct you to the financial highlights on Page 8. Supported by strong storage rental growth, total reported revenues were $778 million, up approximately 1% compared with Q4 of 2013 and up 5% on a constant dollar basis. For the year, total revenues grew by 3% to $3.1 billion or by 4% on a constant dollar basis and, in constant dollars, at the top end of our guidance range. 
Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $220 million compared with $195 million in 2013. For the full year, adjusted OIBDA grew by 4% to $926 million or by 5% to $934 million on a constant dollar basis. For comparison, adjusted OIBDA for 2014 included $3.5 million of costs associated with the company's restructuring initiative. In addition, adjusted OIBDA in 2013 included $19 million in the fourth quarter and $23 million in a full year of restructuring costs.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.25 per diluted share compared with $0.21 in 2013. For full year 2014, adjusted EPS of $1.36 was within our guidance range. As we highlighted on our Q3 earnings call, adjusted EPS for the full year was impacted by REIT compliance costs and an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses associated with our conversion to a REIT as well as acceleration of real estate consolidation in some of our acquisitions.
It's important to note that adjusted EPS for 2013 was restated to be on a comparable basis using our structural tax rate of roughly 15%. Our structural rate for the year came out to 14% as a result of lower pretax income in international jurisdictions, which was impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% over the long term.
The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by solid storage rental revenue growth. On Page 9, top line growth for the quarter on a constant dollar basis was up 5%, reflecting solid storage rental revenue gains of 5% and service revenue growth of 4%. The growth in service revenue was driven by increased project activity, improvement in paper revenue and recent acquisitions. On a constant dollar basis, full year total revenue growth was 4% driven by storage rental revenue gains of 5% and service revenue growth of 3%. 
Also on the same page, we show total worldwide volume growth. We continue to demonstrate improvements in net volume growth in Records Management with total year-on-year volume growth of 3.6% including acquisitions or 1.9% excluding acquisitions. Growth excluding acquisitions maintained the steady improvement in performance that we have seen in the last 2 years. Within this, we continue to see strong volume from existing customers, who added approximately 30 million cubic feet of storage worldwide in this category. This number of boxes is consistent with prior years, but the percentage growth dipped to just below 6% in Q4 driven by the denominator effects of our growing base of records under management.
Let's turn to Page 12, where we present components of growth on a segment basis. Q4 and full year segment results were generally in line with our expectations, but our strong storage rental revenue continues to exhibit durability. North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, delivered positive storage rental internal growth and maintained strong adjusted OIBDA margins of 38.5% during the fourth quarter and the year. North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of 6% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the year. During the fourth quarter, the strong storage rental growth in DM more than offset the decline in service revenues, resulting in adjusted OIBDA expansion of 130 basis points. Declines in service revenues in Data Management continued to reflect the trend towards reduced activity and related transportation revenues as our customers rotate their tapes less frequently and the business becomes more archival.
The International segment continued to generate attractive results with 8% storage rental internal growth and 4% internal service revenue growth for the quarter. For the full year, storage internal -- storage rental internal growth was 6% and internal service revenue growth was 2%. The International business continued to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in line with our mid-20s targets for the year. Adjusted OIBDA margins for the fourth quarter were impacted by costs related to continuous improvement integration expenses and other IT project expenses.
Let me direct you now to Page 11, where we lay out our performance for the year and against our guidance. Bill covered this at a high level, noting that constant dollar revenue and adjusted OIBDA were at the high end of our growth expectations. Our full year FFO and AFFO were also in line with our expectations, excluding the impact of FX. 
Our total distributions for the year, including the E&P purge or special distribution, were about $1.1 billion. Approximately $200 million was return of capital, representing less than 20% of the total. It is common for a REIT to have some portion of its distributions characterized as return of capital, particularly in its initial year. In order to qualify as a REIT, it was critical that we purge our entire legacy E&P, including E&P from our foreign QRS entities before the end of 2014. We intentionally built a level of conservatism into our distribution estimates as we did not want to risk underdistributing and failing to qualify.
Also highlighted on this page are investment and capital expenditures we have made during the year. Real estate investment of $200 million for the year were -- is in line with the midpoint of our guidance. Our maintenance CapEx was $83 million, at the low end of the guidance range. Non-real estate investments, the $43 million, were slightly below the low end of our guidance range. This was driven by timing of certain IT investments which will now occur in 2015. Acquisitions for the year were at $189 million, at the low end of our guidance range. Although the acquisition pipeline is large, we are very selective in the acquisitions that we undertake, and we ensure that they meet our hurdle rates.
Turning now to our outlook for 2015 on Page 10. Business trends and operating fundamentals remain consistent. Operationally, we remain on track to achieve our long-term financial objectives given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. That said, we have updated our 2015 guidance to reflect FX headwinds and our new constant currency rates, which was based at rates at the beginning of this year. 
We are projecting constant dollar revenue growth of 1% to 5% and growth in adjusted OIBDA of 1% to 5%, in line with our strategic plan. We expect adjusted EPS to be in a range of $1.15 to $1.30. To be clear, this guidance, similar to the preliminary guidance we provided at the last earnings call, reflects our anticipation of an absolute increase in total earnings in constant dollars, offset on a per-share basis by the impact of shares issues in connection with the special distribution and, in addition, the impact of FX. 
Driven by the consistent growth in our business and stable fundamentals, we expect normalized FFO to be between $425 million to $465 million, with AFFO between $480 million and $520 million. Please note that for 2015 guidance, we have deducted non-real estate investment from our AFFO calculation in response to constructive feedback. While not strictly maintenance-related capital expense, these expenditures are necessary for us to support our REIT IT and customer interface systems and are somewhat recurring in nature. Therefore, we believe this change to our definition of AFFO is a more conservative approach.
As you saw yesterday, we announced our first quarterly dividend for the year of $0.475 per share. We continue to believe that our cash flow supports our dividends at current levels, and we expect our dividends to grow in line with operating performance. 
From a capital spend standpoint, we expect investment in real estate to be $230 million to $270 million, including investment in racking. Maintenance CapEx, consistent with prior years, is expected to be in the $70 million to $90 million range. Non-real estate investment is also expected to be in the $70 million to $90 million range, which is higher than recent years' due to the inclusion of REIT compliance-related CapEx and the timing of certain IT investments. Acquisition investments are expected to be $150 million to $250 million. It's difficult to be precise here as acquisitions are opportunistic in nature. 
We will update our outlook again on our Q1 earnings call to reflect any changes, if any, including the impacts of any further changes, up or down, in FX.
Shifting to the balance sheet. Pages 26 and 27 present our debt maturity schedule and related metrics. At quarter end, we had liquidity of more than $700 million. As forecasted at our Investor Day last year, our lease-adjusted leverage ratio will increase to support shareholder payouts, expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT and recent acquisitions. In quarter end, it was 5.4x as planned. At today's stock price, our debt-to-total market capitalization is roughly 36%.
Turning now to REIT-specific metrics on Page 20. We provide our global real estate portfolio, which highlights our leased and owned facilities worldwide. The number of leased facilities increased slightly compared to the third quarter of 2014 as a result of our international acquisitions through which we assumed a few operating leases. As we begin to consolidate facilities and execute on our real estate purchase plan, we expect to increase the portion of owned facilities by square footage. 
On Page 21, we have provided storage net operating income, or NOI, per rack square foot, which highlights the attractive economics we derive from our real estate. We continue to achieve strong storage NOI from combined Records Management and Data Management of approximately $29 per rack square foot worldwide due to the multiplier effect of renting our space by the cubic foot. This level compares favorably to NOI per square foot for most property types within the REIT sector.
On Page 22, our racking and building utilization rates are high and have improved slightly since the last quarter at 91% and 83%, respectively, for the Records Management portfolio. We believe that due to fictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90s. When we enter into a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about 3 years' time.
On Page 29, we have provided components of value, a summary of the various parts of our business to facilitate valuation. As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA, excluding rent expense, in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis whether leased or owned. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities area. 
We think about our valuation as a REIT by applying the self-storage or industrial cap rates to our annualized NOI from our storage rental business. On top of the market value of our storage business, we add the value of the services business by applying appropriate multiple. We also provide other tangible assets, our current investments in buildings and racking, as well as the book value of recent acquisitions. We also provide liabilities, including our annual rent expense, to which we apply cap rates and deduct as another form of debt. We hope you find this disclosure useful. And as we have said in prior communications, we will continue to enhance our supplemental reporting and welcome feedback.
With that, I will now turn the call back to Bill."

Our 2014 financial results were on track with our expectations prior to the impact of foreign currency. And in fact, revenue on a constant dollar basis was at the top end of our range. Moreover, we look for similar constant dollar growth in 2015, consistent with the 3-year plan we laid out at our Investor Day nearly a year ago. 
Our fourth quarter operating results demonstrated the success of our initiatives to drive volume and storage rental growth in both our developed and emerging markets, and we're maintaining momentum as we move into 2015. 
We have attractive, high-return investment opportunities in all of our segments, including potential acquisitions in developed and emerging markets, and interesting initiatives to leverage our enterprise storage brand through emerging business opportunities. 
We're maintaining our dividend in line with the growth in operating profit, which represents an attractive yield, whilst providing cash flow to fund required CapEx and a portion of our growth investment. 
We'll continue to maintain our capital allocation discipline. And like most REITs, we'll look for -- we'll look to fund external growth with new capital after first demonstrating our ability to generate the appropriate returns. Our business is durable and predictable and is characterized by attractive fundamentals compared with self-storage and industrial property types. 
Whilst FX has been a drag in the recent quarter, we also see the current FX environment as an opportunity to take advantage of the strong U.S. dollar to increase our small but growing investment in the high-growth emerging markets at favorable rates.
With that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

And I think I would say, as an introductory remark before Rod takes you through the different components of that, because there -- as you know, there are multiple things in our service revenue, some of it is driven by paper prices, some of it is driven by the ins and outs associated with our Records Management business, there are different components that are more volatile and more in our indirect control of the operations. So I think we have seen an improvement around our imaging business and paper prices. And we have a new dedicated leader that's just looking at our digital or scanning operations, so we have seen an improvement in that area. But we still see some of the underlying trends, especially in our Data Management area in terms of some of the service associated with transport. But Rod, you may want to talk about it in more detail."

I think the way I think about service revenue, Andrew, and I think you do as well, is that there's service revenue that we can directly influence and is also independent, if you like, from some of our core Records Management business, and then there's service activity that is dependent on the activity of what's going on within the full storage side. I think what was positive for us in Q4, if we look at the first areas of the stuff that we can influence directly, we had a particularly good quarter of -- in what we call projects. So that's why we do specific assignments for customers, to sort of help them more with their records management issues. And that was a good, strong performance. In addition, we also had the benefit of a good shred performance during Q4, some of which was driven by an improved paper price that we've seen sort of tip up a bit into -- in Q4. In terms of the activity associated with our records business, within the RM side, although there was still a sort of modest decline, the decline is not as serious as we've seen. And so again, I think we're always nervous about calling the bottom of that, but at least it was a more favorable quarter than we've seen and actually follows on from Q3 in that regard. I think the contrast to that would be, as Bill said, within the DM side, we did see quite a significant drop in service activity associated with tape and sort of tape rotation. So now let's talk about 2015. As Bill said, we have actually done a bit of reorganization on the service side, particularly within North America, to get more focused to our scanning business and our shredding business, which I think will benefit us. And I would hope that within the RM side, although there'll probably still be continuing declines with activity associated with box, that should be it and that will be at lower levels. But on the DM side, I do think we'll continue to see quite significant reduction. So in sort of summary, in terms of the activity that we can control, I think we'll be -- I'm hoping for a good performance there. On the stuff that we -- is more difficult for us to control, RM, more positive things. Being -- DM, I think, will continue to struggle. Do you have any..."

First of all, we do have a new offering in secure destruction, which we're seeing, albeit off a small base but very rapid growth off that base. So I think you'll start seeing that come through in some of the service numbers associated with the DM business. The other aspect is, is that we have taken a focus on maintaining and, in some cases, trying to add additional volume in what the call our premium transport services around DM, which is dedicated transport. So there are a couple of puts and takes and initiatives that we just started in the last quarter of last year, and we expect those to continue to come through.

And just to pick up on one other thing, is that we have seen a nice progression in terms of the volume growth, the storage volume growth, over the last, say, 2 years where we've gone from Q1 in 2013 in terms of internal storage volume growth, i.e., before acquisitions of 1.1% net growth, and we progressed up to this last quarter of a 1.9% growth.

Before I begin, I think given recent news stories following on from our December announcement with respect to a proposal to acquire Recall, I think I should just make a statement before we get into our -- discussing our results for both the quarter and the year. 
We strongly believe that our acquisition of Recall would provide both company's shareholders with a unique opportunity to participate in the growth of the combined businesses with attractive growth prospects. We believe that there is significant value-creation potential from such a transaction for both companies' customers as well. We continue to try to figure out ways to narrow the valuation gap, but we'll only pursue a deal at the right price. We have nothing to report at this time. With that, let me turn to our results.
We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operating performance, wrapping up an eventful year of good progress on our 3-year strategic plan and our successful conversion to a REIT. During 2014, we continued to improve results in our developed markets, expanded our exposure to faster-growing emerging markets and generated momentum in our emerging business segment. In addition, we expanded our REIT investor outreach, and we were added to the MSCI REIT in the FTSE NAREIT indices. Inclusion in these important benchmarks is important for generating a higher level of awareness of Iron Mountain as an attractive REIT investment.
Let me now turn to financial highlights. Rod will have more in a few minutes. 
On a constant-dollar basis, our financial results for 2014 were right in line with our expectations. The significant strengthening of the dollar in the fourth quarter impacted our reported figures, as it did for most multinationals, resulting in growth in total revenue and adjusted OIBDA of over 3%, including restructuring charges. But on a constant-dollar basis, we believe more -- which we believe more accurately reflects core operating performance, growth in these measures was just under 5%, at the top end of our ranges. These results are supported by the durability of our storage rental business and are in line with our 3-year plan to achieve 4% compounded annual growth on a constant-dollar basis in both total revenues and adjusted OIBDA.
Turning to operating highlights. Total storage revenue, a key economic driver of our business, was up 5.4% in constant dollars for the year driven by strong growth of 13% in our International business and roughly 3% gains in both our North American Records and Information Management and Data Management segments. These results reflect our continued focus on driving net positive records management volume and storage rental revenue growth in developed markets and further penetration into higher-growth Emerging Markets. In developed markets, we further sharpened our focus with the fourth quarter sale of our Shred operations in the U.K., Ireland and Australia. We chose to divest these businesses because they were much smaller than our North American operations and we did not benefit from the same scale. At the same time, we acquired Securit Records Management in Canada, which brought us 9 facilities and 3 million cubic feet of records, including available space to support the onboarding of a major new customer.
In Records Management, we added more than 18 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a base of 500 million cubic feet at the beginning of the year or 3.6% net growth. The growth was in part achieved as a result of the significant turnaround from negative to positive internal volume growth, in other words before any impact of acquisitions, we achieved in North America. Importantly, North America represented 20% -- or more than 20% of our gains for the year, excluding volume from acquisitions. 
Globally, we maintained customer churn of under 2%. This is unchanged from Q3 levels but represents a 30% improvement over the level of customer losses experienced 2 years ago. This combination of improved customer retention, growth in new sales and consistent new volume from existing customers drove 3.5% internal storage rental growth in the fourth quarter, continuing the steady improvement we achieved throughout the year. 
Our strong fourth quarter growth rate did benefit from favorable comps relative to the 1.3% internal storage rental growth in the same period last year. But even when normalizing for that, we saw a nice pickup and are pleased with the momentum as we head into 2015. Our internal storage rental revenue growth expectations for this year are in the range of 2% to 2.5%.
Turning to Emerging Markets. We are making good progress towards our goal of 16% of total revenue from Emerging Markets by the end of next year. These high-growth countries represent 13.9% of our total revenues at the end of the year on a constant-dollar basis using our 2014 FX budget rates and a 12.8% on reported basis. 
You'll hear from Rod that FX currency rates will be a drag on reported performance this year. Whilst our operating margin in virtually all our countries are naturally hedged and preserved, like most multinationals, we're not immune to the effects of currency translation in terms of absolute earnings impacting U.S. dollars. However, given our opportunity to expand internationally on what is today a relatively small international base, we like the fact that we have the benefit of investing in U.S. dollars overseas during this part of the currency cycle. 
We continue to see attractive growth potential in both storage and service in these markets as they are beginning to embrace outsourcing of enterprise storage, especially given the durability of our business. Both internal total revenue and internal storage rental growth in these markets was more than 15% in the fourth quarter. In addition, unlike more mature multinationals whose growth rates are fairly similar around the globe, we are in a unique position to invest our capital in markets where we're still early in the growth cycle, enabling us to capture higher growth rates off our lower basis, thereby enhancing our returns in the medium to long term. 
Given this as a backdrop, acquisitions continue to be an integral part of our strategy with a focus on high-growth emerging markets. We completed $190 million of acquisitions in 2014, including the records inventory of smaller records management companies with more than $125 million of the total in emerging markets through Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific regions. 
We have a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities in emerging markets with more than 4x the coverage needed to achieve our goal of 16% on a constant-dollar basis. And we'll continue to evaluate those opportunities in light of our targeted returns and favorable underlying growth dynamics that support the durability of our business.
Within our emerging business opportunity area, we continue to make progress in our data center operations. We have invested more than $70 million to-date with $35 million of that in 2014, expanding our capacity in the underground facility and delivering our first phase in Boston. Whilst absorption in our Boston Data Center is just beginning to pick up on a blended basis, we have achieved a stabilized unlevered return on invested capital in this business of 9%, which we feel are -- which we feel is good given how recently we added our new capacity and expect that this return will stabilize at 11% to 12% on a fully utilized basis. 
We continue to evaluate other emerging business opportunities that leverage our unique platform as a leader in enterprise storage. We see the potential to extend our brand strength in chain of custody and logistics to a broader range of offerings. Many of these opportunities are customer driven, where they asked for our assistance in solving an enterprise storage need, whether it be upstream in their supply chain or downstream to support distribution. We expect to have more on this at our Investor Day in October. These facets of our strategic plan all support the durability of our business, the sustainability of our cash flow and our fit as a REIT. 
When you consider the nature of our business, our enterprise storage foundation compares very favorably with self-storage. We have superior customer credit quality given our service to more than 92% of the Fortune 1000. We serve more than 155,000 business customers, which leads to a diversified revenue stream and low customer churn of less than 2% per year. Unlike consumer self-storage where customers tend to be in transition and frequently have more temporary needs, the average life of a box in our facilities is 15 years. This means we have very low volatility. In fact, we've posted 26 years of consecutive growth in storage rental revenue, which persisted even throughout the great financial crisis. And like self-storage, we have a service component to our business that is inextricably linked to our customers' underlying storage needs. 
We also compare very favorably with the industrial sector if you think about the nature of our operating facilities. The major difference is that our real estate costs are incurred by the square foot, but we generate storage rental revenue by the cubic foot. We're essentially renting air. This multiplier effect generates a significant spread between our costs and our return on investment. It yields a very high net operating income per square foot and is core to how we create value for our stockholders. 
Similar to the industrial sector, we have a low-maintenance CapEx requirement, but our turnover costs are even lower on a per-foot basis. And when we invest in incremental racking structures within an existing industrial shell, we can generate very strong returns due to this volume dynamic. 
As we've talked on recent calls, we intend to buy $800 million to $1 billion of our lease facilities over the next 8 to 10 years, shifting our mix to a higher percentage of owned properties. This supports our REIT status, but it also means we have more optionality over the long term. If we consolidate in our market and exit buildings that we own, we can lease them to customers for other industrial or distribution uses, or we can create value by selling them or redeveloping the underlying real estate in infill markets for alternative use.
Importantly, the REIT structure is consistent with our capital allocation goals and does not limit our ability to fund our business plan. As we become more active in buying in our properties and execute our acquisition pipeline, we expect to fund that incremental investment with additional borrowing and/or equity issuance similar to the manner in which most REITs fund external growth. 
You may have seen that the board declared our first quarter dividend of 47 -- $0.00475 (sic) [ $0.475 ] per share this week. At a $40 stock price, our implied cap rate is about 7.5%, well above where other property sectors are trading. At the same share price, our dividend represents a 4.8% yield, well in excess of most REITs. Combined with our goal to grow adjusted OIBDA by 4% on a compounded rate, our dividend level supports our goal to deliver total shareholder returns in line with the 8% to 9% TSR, or total shareholder return, of the S&P 500. And this goal is prior to any potential upside from additional emerging business opportunities.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rod."

We continue to execute well against our strategic plan, and we are pleased with our strong operating performance for the year.

I'll begin today with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance followed by an update on our outlook for 2015. I will then address our capital deployment activities and conclude with a discussion of various REIT metrics. Please note that throughout my prepared remarks, I will reference selected slides from our comprehensive supplemental reporting package, which can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website.
Turning to our financial results for the quarter and the year. Let me direct you to the financial highlights on Page 8. Supported by strong storage rental growth, total reported revenues of $778 million, up approximately 1% compared with Q4 of 2013 and up 5% on a constant-dollar basis. For the year, total revenues grew by 3% to $3.1 billion or by 4% on a constant-dollar basis and, in constant dollars, at the top end of our guidance range. 
Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $220 million compared with $195 million in 2013. For the full year, adjusted OIBDA grew by 4% to $926 million or by 5% to $934 million on a constant-dollar basis. For comparison, adjusted OIBDA for 2014 included $3.5 million of costs associated with the company's restructuring initiative. In addition, adjusted OIBDA in 2013 included $19 million in the fourth quarter and $23 million in a full year of restructuring costs.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.25 per diluted share compared with $0.21 in 2013. For full year 2014, adjusted EPS of $1.36 was within our guidance range. As we highlighted on our Q3 earnings call, adjusted EPS for the full year was impacted by REIT compliance costs and an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses associated with our conversion to a REIT as well as acceleration of real estate consolidation with some of our acquisitions.
It's important to note that adjusted EPS for 2013 was restated to be on a comparable basis using our structural tax rate of roughly 15%. Our structural rate for the year came out to 14% as a result of lower pretax income in international jurisdictions, which was impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% over the long term.
The fundamentals of our business remain strong as evidenced by solid storage rental revenue growth. On Page 9, top line growth for the quarter on a constant-dollar basis was up 5%, reflecting solid storage rental revenue gains of 5% and service revenue growth of 4%. The growth in service revenue was driven by increased project activity, improvement in paper revenue and recent acquisitions. On a constant-dollar basis, full year total revenue growth was 4% driven by storage rental revenue gains of 5% and service revenue growth of 3%. 
Also on the same page, we show total worldwide volume growth. We continue to demonstrate improvements in net volume growth in Records Management with total year-on-year volume growth of 3.6% including acquisitions or 1.9% excluding acquisitions. Growth excluding acquisitions maintained the steady improvement in performance that we have seen in the last 2 years. Within this, we continue to see strong volume from existing customers, who added approximately 30 million cubic feet of storage worldwide in this category. This number of boxes is consistent with prior years, but the percentage growth dipped to just below 6% in Q4 driven by the denominator effects of our growing base of records under management.
Let's turn to Page 12, where we present components of growth on a segment basis. Q4 and full year segment results were generally in line with our expectations, but our strong storage rental revenue continues to exhibit durability. North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, delivered positive storage rental internal growth and maintained strong adjusted OIBDA margins of 38.5% during the fourth quarter and the year. North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of 6% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the year. During the fourth quarter, the strong storage rental growth in DM more than offset the decline in service revenues, resulting in adjusted OIBDA expansion of 130 basis points. Declines in service revenues in Data Management continue to reflect the trend towards reduced activity and related transportation revenues as our customers rotate their tapes less frequently and the business becomes more archival.
The International segment continued to generate attractive results with 8% storage rental internal growth and 4% internal service revenue growth for the quarter. For the full year, storage internal -- storage rental internal growth was 6% and internal service revenue growth was 2%. The International business continued to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in line with our mid-20s targets for the year. Adjusted OIBDA margins for the fourth quarter were impacted by costs related to continuous improvement integration expenses and other IT project expenses.
Let me direct you now to Page 11, where we lay out our performance for the year and against our guidance. Bill covered this at a high level, noting that constant-dollar revenue and adjusted OIBDA were at the high end of our growth expectations. Our full year FFO and AFFO were also in line with our expectations, excluding the impact of FX. 
Our total distributions for the year, including E&P purge or special distribution, were about $1.1 billion. Approximately $200 million was return of capital, representing less than 20% of the total. It is common for a REIT to have some portion of its distributions characterized as return of capital, particularly in its initial year. In order to qualify as a REIT, it was critical that we purge our entire legacy E&P, including E&P from our foreign QRS entities before the end of 2014. We intentionally built a level of conservatism into our distribution estimates as we did not want to risk underdistributing and failing to qualify.
Also highlighted on this page are investment and capital expenditures we have made during the year. Real estate investment of $200 million for the year were -- is in line with the midpoint of our guidance. Our maintenance CapEx was $83 million, at the low end of the guidance range. Non-real-estate investments of $43 million were slightly below the low end of our guidance range. This was driven by timing of certain IT investments, which will now occur in 2015. Acquisitions for the year were at $189 million, at the low end of our guidance range. Although the acquisition pipeline is large, we are very selective in the acquisitions that we undertake, and we ensure that they meet our hurdle rates.
Turning now to our outlook for 2015 on Page 10. Business trends and operating fundamentals remain consistent. Operationally, we remain on track to achieve our long-term financial objectives given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. That said, we have updated our 2015 guidance to reflect FX headwinds and our new constant-currency rate, which was based on rates at the beginning of this year. 
We are projecting constant-dollar revenue growth of 1% to 5% and growth in adjusted OIBDA of 1% to 5%, in line with our strategic plan. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.30. To be clear, this guidance, similar to the preliminary guidance we provided at the last earnings call, reflects our anticipation of an absolute increase in total earnings in constant dollars offset on a per-share basis by the impact of shares issues in connection with the special distribution and, in addition, the impact of FX. 
Driven by the consistent growth in our business and stable fundamentals, we expect normalized FFO to be between $425 million to $465 million with AFFO between $480 million and $520 million. Please note that for 2015 guidance, we have deducted non-real-estate investment from our AFFO calculation in response to constructive feedback. While not strictly maintenance-related capital expense, these expenditures are necessary for us to support our REIT IT and customer interface systems and are somewhat recurring in nature. Therefore, we believe this change to our definition of AFFO is a more conservative approach.
As you saw yesterday, we announced our first quarterly dividend for the year of $0.475 per share. We continue to believe that our cash flow supports our dividends at current levels, and we expect our dividends to grow in line with operating performance. 
From a capital spend standpoint, we expect investment in real estate to be $230 million to $270 million, including investment in racking. Maintenance CapEx, consistent with prior years, is expected to be in the $70 million to $90 million range. Non-real-estate investment is also expected to be in the $70 million to $90 million range, which is higher than recent years due to the inclusion of REIT compliance-related CapEx and the timing of certain IT investments. Acquisition investments are expected to be $150 million to $250 million. It's difficult to be precise here as acquisitions are opportunistic in nature. 
We will update our outlook again on our Q1 earnings call to reflect any changes, if any, including the impacts of any further changes, up or down, in FX.
Shifting to the balance sheet. Pages 26 and 27 present our debt maturity schedule and related metrics. At quarter end, we had liquidity of more than $700 million. As forecasted at our Investor Day last year, our lease-adjusted leverage ratio will increase to support shareholder payouts, expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT and recent acquisitions. In quarter end, it was 5.4x as planned. At today's stock price, our debt to total market capitalization is roughly 36%.
Turning now to REIT-specific metrics on Page 20. We provide our global real estate portfolio, which highlights our leased and owned facilities worldwide. The number of leased facilities increased slightly compared to the third quarter of 2014 as a result of our international acquisitions through which we assumed a few operating leases. As we begin to consolidate facilities and execute on our real estate purchase plan, we expect to increase the portion of owned facilities by square footage. 
On Page 21, we have provided storage net operating income, or NOI, per racked square foot, which highlights the attractive economics we derive from our real estate. We continue to achieve strong storage NOI from combined Records Management and Data Management of approximately $29 per racked square foot worldwide due to the multiplier effect of renting our space by the cubic foot. This level compares favorably to NOI per square foot for most property types within the REIT sector.
On Page 22, our racking and building utilization rates are high and have improved slightly since the last quarter at 91% and 83%, respectively, for the Records Management portfolio. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90s. When we enter into a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about 3 years' time.
On Page 29, we have provided components of value, a summary of the various parts of our business to facilitate valuation. As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA, excluding rent expense, in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis whether leased or owned. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities area. 
We think about our valuation as a REIT by applying the self-storage or industrial cap rates to our annualized NOI from our storage rental business. On top of the market value of our storage business, we add the value of the services business by applying appropriate multiple. We also provide other tangible assets, our current investments in buildings and racking, as well as the book value of recent acquisitions. We also provide liabilities, including our annual rent expense, to which we apply cap rates and deduct as another form of debt. We hope you find this disclosure useful. And as we have said in prior communications, we will continue to enhance our supplemental reporting and welcome feedback.
With that, I will now turn the call back to Bill."

Our 2014 financial results were on track with our expectations prior to the impact of foreign currency. And in fact, revenue on a constant-dollar basis was at the top end of our range. Moreover, we look for similar constant-dollar growth in 2015, consistent with the 3-year plan we laid out at our Investor Day nearly a year ago. 
Our fourth quarter operating results demonstrated the success of our initiatives to drive volume and storage rental growth in both our developed and emerging markets, and we're maintaining momentum as we move into 2015. 
We have attractive, high-return investment opportunities in all of our segments, including potential acquisitions in developed and emerging markets and interesting initiatives to leverage our enterprise storage brand through emerging business opportunities. 
We're maintaining our dividend in line with the growth in operating profit, which represents an attractive yield whilst providing cash flow to fund required CapEx and a portion of our growth investment. 
We'll continue to maintain our capital allocation discipline. And like most REITs, we'll look for -- we'll look to fund external growth with new capital after first demonstrating our ability to generate the appropriate returns. Our business is durable and predictable and is characterized by attractive fundamentals compared with self-storage and industrial property types. 
Whilst FX has been a drag in the recent quarter, we also see the current FX environment as an opportunity to take advantage of the strong U.S. dollar to increase our small but growing investment in the high-growth emerging markets at favorable rates.
With that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

So I think we have seen an improvement around our imaging business and paper prices. And we have a new dedicated leader that's just looking at our digital or scanning operations, so we have seen an improvement in that area. But we still see some of the underlying trends, especially in our Data Management area in terms of some of the service associated with transport.

I think the way I think about service revenue, Andrew, and I think you do as well, is that there's service revenue that we can directly influence and is also independent, if you like, from some of our core Records Management business, and then there's service activity that is dependent on the activity of what's going on within the full storage side. I think what was positive for us in Q4, if we look at the first areas of the stuff that we can influence directly, we had a particularly good quarter in what we call projects. So that's where we do specific assignments for customers to sort of help them more with their records management issues. And that was a good, strong performance. In addition, we also had the benefit of a good Shred performance during Q4, some of which was driven by an improved paper price that we'd seen sort of tip up a bit into -- in Q4. In terms of the activity associated with our records business, within the RM side, although there was still a sort of modest decline, the decline is not as serious as we've seen. And so again, I think we're always nervous about calling the bottom of that, but at least it was a more favorable quarter than we've seen and actually follows on from Q3 in that regard. I think the contrast to that would be, as Bill said, within the DM side, we did see quite a significant drop in service activity associated with tape and sort of tape rotation. So now let's talk about 2015. As Bill said, we have actually done a bit of reorganization on the service side, particularly within North America, to give more focus to our scanning business and our shredding business, which I think will benefit us. And I would hope that within the RM side, although there'll probably still be continuing declines with activity associated with box, that should be it and that will be at lower levels. But on the DM side, I do think we'll continue to see quite significant reduction. So in sort of summary, in terms of the activity that we can control, I think we'll be -- I'm hoping for a good performance there. On the stuff that we -- is more difficult for us to control, RM, more positive things. Being -- DM, I think, will continue to struggle. Bill, do you..."

First of all, we do have a new offering in secure destruction, which we're seeing, albeit off a small base but very rapid growth off that base. So I think you'll start seeing that come through in some of the service numbers associated with the DM business. The other aspect is, is that we have taken a focus on maintaining and, in some cases, trying to add additional volume in what we call our premium transport services around DM, which is dedicated transport. So there are a couple puts and takes and initiatives that we just started in the last quarter of last year, and we expect those to continue to come through.

But you're right, George, it doesn't explain the full difference by any means. Two things that are going on. One, we benefit from relatively weak comparators last year because as you may recall on our earnings call this time last year, we were talking about the numbers, so pricing adjustments downward that we had to make during that period. So in a sense, the sort of the year-on-year comparison is slightly false. But even if you strip that out, we have seen an improvement, a disproportionate improvement, relative to our volume.

I think we also guided at the beginning of the year that we were -- we did call out that we were underperforming, and we were very comfortable that we could get to the 2%, 2.5% range and we think we'll be able to continue that momentum this year. And just to pick you up on one other thing, is that we have seen a nice progression in terms of the volume growth, the storage volume growth, over the last, say, 2 years where we've gone from Q1 in 2013 in terms of internal storage volume growth, i.e., before acquisitions of 1.1% net growth, and we progressed up to this last quarter of 1.9% growth. So we've seen a very nice expansion, and that's really been driven by both better offense and defense in terms of retaining customers and also gaining new customers.

Referring now to Page 2 of the supplemental package, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2015 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and in the Recall presentation and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations to these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, are included in the supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin?"

Let me first extent our apology for such a short notice on the change of timing for the release of first quarter results. But given that it was driven by our in principle to acquire Recall, we felt it was important to combine the news. 
I would start by saying we're pleased to announce that our results from the first quarter meet or exceed our expectations. We continue to build operational momentum in the business, which is in turn, driving strong financial results in spite of the significant FX headwinds. However, given the breaking news associated with the agreement in principle to acquire Recall, I'd like to start with a discussion of this agreement. 
First, I should say we are very excited about our great proposal to acquire Recall. We think this proposed transaction represents an attractive value proposition supported by significant synergies and believe it will be highly accretive. Our revised offer reflects the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and other favorable changes since our proposal, particularly regarding transaction-related tax assumptions. Of course, we have yet to complete due diligence and reach a definitive agreement, and the successful completion of the transaction is subject to customary conditions noted in today's press release. We have a few slides related to the proposal, the proposed transaction, that we have posted to our Investor Relations website, which I'll touch on briefly. 
Turning first to Slide 3, the proposed acquisition is an all-stock deal at a fixed exchange rate of 0.1722 of an Iron Mountain share for each Recall share. Additionally, we have made a provision that each Recall shareholder can elect up to a maximum of 5,000 shares to be paid in cash at AUD 8.50 per share, subject to a cap on the total cash consideration of AUD 225 million.
On Slide 5, we estimate there is an opportunity to achieve synergies of between USD 125 million and USD 140 million, driven by economies of scale from the combination of infrastructure and overhead. We expect to realize 50% of these synergies in year 2, which will already yield by year 2 high-single digit accretion in EPS, FFO and AFFO. 
Another benefit of the proposed transaction in the medium term is that it supports our deleveraging strategy. Additionally, we have complementary market platforms, with Recall having a more developed presence with the small to medium businesses in the U.S., whilst we have more significant presence with larger enterprise customers in the U.S. 
Turning to Slide 6. We also have complementary geographic coverage, with Recall having more exposure to faster-growing international markets. 
Slide 7 provides a bit more detail on the benefits to Recall shareholders, including the ability, through stock ownership, to participate in future upside and be supported through a secondary listing in Australia. 
Slide 8 shows more detail on our estimated net synergies, as well as our expected integration and other costs that would be incurred in year 1 to achieve those synergies. Assuming the midpoint of this energy range, consensus estimates of Recall 2015 EBITDA and the fixed exchange ratio, we estimate our going-in EBITDA multiple is just over 12x and is reduced by 4 to 4.5 turns on a fully synergized basis, demonstrating the benefits of the proposed transaction. 
Lastly, on Slide 9, we provided a list of next steps in the process. With that overview of the proposed transaction, let me turn to our results. 
We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operating performance, extending recent progress with continued positive organic volume growth in solid storage rental internal growth. We continue to execute on our 3-year strategic plan, which rests on 3 pillars: Getting more from our developed markets, expanding our presence in faster growing, Emerging Markets; and continuing to explore adjacent opportunities in our Emerging business segment. 
Rod will have more details in a few minutes, but I'll start by highlighting that on a constant dollar basis, our financial results for the first quarter were in line or ahead of our expectations, with total revenue up 2% and adjusted OIBDA up 5.7% on a constant dollar basis, or 4.5% on a constant dollar basis if normalized for restructuring charges, as shown on Page 20 in our supplemental. 
We saw further strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the first quarter, which impacted our reported results, but the fundamental trends in the business remained solid and we are pleased with the momentum. Our results are supported by the durability of our storage rental business and are in line with our strategic plan. 
If you reviewed our supplemental disclosure before the call today, you probably noted that we added a further breakdown of our International business. Effective with this quarter's reporting, we've broken the former International segment into Western Europe and Other International. With this segment change, we've consolidated executive leadership of North America and Western European markets under Patrick Keddy to provide better focus and alignment within our developed markets. Patrick has run our U.K. and Western European markets for several years now, having originally joined us from Pitney Bowes, where he ran its entire business outside the U.S., including operations in 28 countries. 
JT Tomovcsik will continue to run our North American Records and Information Management business, and Eileen Sweeney will add Western Europe to her leadership responsibilities, and will have Data Management in all developed markets. She and JT will coordinate their offers through Patrick. This integration of executive leadership in North America and Western Europe will allow us to present a single face to our major customers in our largest markets and will be better positioned as a global service provider, not just a company with a global footprint. 
Marc Duale will continue to run Emerging markets through the Other International segment, which covers Latin America, Asia Pacific and Central and Eastern Europe. This segment also includes Australia, as it is easy to manage within this segment due to geographic proximity. We think this structure will better view of our continued momentum in developed markets and continue our expansion in emerging markets, thereby, more closely tying performance to our strategic plan. 
Turning to operating highlights. Total storage revenue, a key economic driver of our business, grew by 4.6% on a constant dollar basis during the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth from the Other International segment and consistent trends in Western Europe, as well as North America, RIM and DM, or Data Management. Worldwide internal growth in storage rental of 3% continue to show resilience. Whilst internal growth did benefit slightly from favorable comps relative to the 1.4% internal storage rental growth in the same period last year, we are seeing continued momentum and are maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth for 2015 of between 2% and 2.5%. 
In Records Management, we added roughly 18 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a trailing 12-month basis, representing 3.5% net growth. This growth was in part achieved as a result of the significant turnaround we are continuing to achieve in North America from negative to positive internal volume growth or, in other words, before benefit from acquisitions. Importantly, North America represents nearly 25% of our net volume gains for the trailing 12 months, excluding acquisitions. 
Globally, we maintained customer retention of 98%, in line with our fourth quarter 2014 levels, but a significant improvement over the level of customer turnover experienced just 2 years ago. 
In our Data Management business, we continue to see solid storage revenue growth, although as noted in recent quarters, we are still experiencing headwinds related to reduced frequency of customer tape rotation. Whilst we continue to evaluate ways to rightsize our cost structure to align with this trend, we are continuing to develop new product and services in the Data Management segment to leverage our strong customer relationships in the more than 200,000 stops we make each month. 
During the quarter, Google named us as the ingestion partner for its new near line cloud solution. This means we are the preferred provider to assist Google Cloud customers in uploading all the data saved in legacy data storage formats that predated cloud storage so they can better use big data. We plan to begin offering this service later this summer. 
We also are seeing good early reception to our restoration assurance program that helps customers retrieve data from legacy media and optimize their backup environment for future technologies. 
Moreover, just last week, we announced a strategic relationship with EMC to deliver cloud backup and replication services, which helps customers optimize their on-premise and off-premise Data Protection strategy. We are the only one of their providers to offer data domain application to the cloud with tape out capabilities. These new initiatives are in their early days and we are not guiding to a specific contribution from them, but they demonstrate our thought leadership, innovation capabilities and partnership with other world leaders in information management like Google and EMC. 
Turning to Emerging markets. We are making good progress towards our goal of 16% of total revenue from emerging markets by the end of next year. These high-growth markets represent 13.6% of our total revenue at the end of the quarter on a constant dollar basis. Like most multinationals, we do have exposure to the effects of currency translation in terms of absolute earnings and cash impact in U.S. dollars. Whilst FX variability does impact the absolute dollars we report, the impact on our growth and adjusted OIBDA margins is almost completely muted because most of our expenses are denominated in local currency, thereby, creating a natural hedge. 
On the other hand, the current FX environment gives us a positive window in terms of investment. Given our opportunity to expand internationally in what is today a relatively small international base, we believe we can create significant value over time by investing selectively in these higher growth markets using strong U.S. dollars during this part of the currency cycle. We continue to see attractive growth potential in both storage and service in emerging markets as they are still in the early part of the outsourcing of enterprise storage. 
Internal storage rental growth in our Other International segment was 11.1% in the first quarter. Rod will describe more fully the impact of foreign currency exchange rate impacts on our reported performance for the quarter. 
Furthermore, we intend to pursue attractive investment opportunities that extend the durability of the storage rental business. As we've discussed on recent calls, we plan to buy $700 million to $1 billion of our lease facilities over the next 8 to 10 years, shifting our mix to a higher percentage of owned properties. On average, we are achieving a spread of roughly 150 basis points between our going in cap rates and market cap rates whilst positioning ourselves to capture long-term residual value from ownership. 
Importantly, the REIT structure is consistent with our capital allocation goals and does not limit our ability to fund our business plan. As we become more active in buying in our properties and executing on our acquisition pipeline, we expect to fund that incremental investment with additional borrowing and/or equity issuance similar to the manner, in which most REITs fund external growth. 
As you think about opportunities to grow our storage rental business, it is important not to lose sight of the solid durability of the business, which is underpinned by roughly $1.5 billion of net operating income from our storage business alone. This amount of NOI is comparable to that generated by the leaders in the industrial and self storage sectors. And we have other attractive business characteristics that compare favorably with REITs. Our enterprise storage foundation is similar to self storage, but we serve more than 92% of the Fortune 1000 with superior customer credit quality. We have a diversified base of more than 155,000 business customers with 98% customer retention and a 15-year average life of box in our facilities. Our business has a very low volatility, as highlighted by our track record of 26 years of consecutive growth in storage rental revenue, even throughout the recent recession. In light self storage, we have a service component to our business that is inextricably linked to our customers underlying storage needs. We also compare very favorably with the industrial sector, with a major difference that our real estate costs are incurred by the square foot, but we generate storage rental revenue by the cubic foot, yielding a very high net operating income per square foot. 
Similar to the industrial sector, we have a low maintenance CapEx requirement, but our turnover costs are even lower on a per foot basis. And when we invest in incremental wrecking structures within an existing industrial shell, we generate very strong returns due to the leverage associated with this volume achieved with reduced growth CapEx. 
To wrap up, we're excited to be announcing the proposed transaction with Recall and reporting a quarter of strong operating performance. Our results were in line with or ahead of expectations, and we remain on track to achieve our long-term goals. Our business is durable and generate strong cash flow that more than covers our dividend and provides a portion of growth CapEx. And as we look at our longer-term growth potential, we have multiple capital allocation opportunities to invest in attractive returns that exceed our cost of capital and support long-term growth at our dividend. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rod."
30292,290824612,796523,"Iron Mountain Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2015",2015-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Iron Mountain Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Bill.

We're pleased with the momentum we continue to see no our business and the strong operating performance we saw in the first quarter of 2015. Our results continue to demonstrate the durability of our storage rental business and the benefits of acquisitions we made in developed and emerging market in prior periods. 
Before I begin, I'd like to note that our outlook for 2015 doesn't contemplate potential contribution or impact from the proposed transaction with Recall. As noted by Bill, we have yet to reach a definitive agreement. We are just embarking on the due diligence process. 
To frame my remarks, I'll begin today with an overview of our first quarter performance, including a review of our w segment disclosure. I'll briefly touch on our outlook for 2015, which remains unchanged since our update in February of this year. Finally, I will address other metrics through a REIT let's. Let's turn to our worldwide financial results for the quarter. 
Referring now to Pages 8 and 9 of our supplemental. Supported by strong storage rental growth, total reported revenues were $749 million, up approximately 2.2% compared with Q1 of 2015 on a constant dollar basis. Reported revenue for the quarter declined by 2.7% year-over-year as a result of the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which impacted total revenues by approximately 5% or $37 million. Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $231 million compared with $229 million in 2014, up 1.2% on a reported basis and 5.7% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted OIBDA increased year-over-year due to improved storage profits, somewhat offset by a reduction in service profits. In addition, overhead expenses declined partly, as we are seeing the benefits of our efficiency initiatives. 
To illustrate the 4.5% year-over-year improvement in normalized adjusted OIBDA, we've included a bridging schedule on Page 20 of our supplemental package. Normalized funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.50 for the quarter, while adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, was $128 million. The year-over-year decline in AFFO was driven by variances in deferred tax expenses. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.32 per diluted share compared with $0.35 in the first quarter of 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-over-year is driven by a 10% increase in share counts related to the special distribution we made in the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, adjusted EPS was impacted by an increase in interest expense related to high levels of debt an a slightly higher structural tax rate. The increase in borrowings was driven primarily by REIT conversion-related expenses, such as E&P purge and the DNA recapture payments. Our structural tax rate for Q1 '15 came out to 16.2% as a result of the slight mix change, driven by higher income from foreign jurisdictions. It's important to note that adjusted EPS for 2014 was restated to be on a comparable basis using our structural tax rate of roughly 15%. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% over the longer term. 
To illustrate the changes to adjusted EPS, we've included a bridging schedule on Page 21 of our supplemental. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by solid storage rental growth of 5%, offset by decline in service revenue of 1% on a constant dollar basis. 
As Bill mentioned, in an effort to more closely tie our leadership structure to the strategic plan, we have broken out the former International segment into 2 segments: Western Europe and Other International, to facilitate managing the business along the developed emerging lines we've talked about in the past. 
I will now discuss Records Management or RM volume trends across this new segmentation. As you can see on the supplemental on Pages 10 and 11, we've expanded our disclosure by illustrating Records Management volume trends by segments. As you can see, we've achieved positive volume growth of 1.2% in North America, 5.4% in Western Europe and 12.9% in the Other International segments, reporting global Records Management net volume growth of 3.5%. We continue to experience strong organic growth, with first quarter total year-on-year volume growth of 1.9%, excluding acquisitions. Underlying this growth is the stable incoming volume from existing customers, who added approximately 30 million gross cubic feet of storage in the last 12 months, which is consistent with prior periods. 
Let's now turn to our financial performance by segments. North America Records and Information Management, or RIM, delivered positive storage rental internal growth and expanded OIBDA margins by more than 300 basis points during the first quarter. This expansion in adjusted OIBDA margins was driven by decline in overhead costs, as we continue to execute on our speed and agility efforts. 
North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of 5.2% in the first quarter. However, service declined by 5.9% as DM take management becomes more callable. During the first quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA declined to 52.7%, partly as a result of the new product launches related to our restoration/assurance program and other initiatives that Bill covered in his remarks. We believe this will prove very positive investments for the longer term. 
The Western Europe segment generated solid results, with 3.7% storage rental internal growth, which is partially offset by a decline of 2.6% in internal service revenue. The Western Europe business is similar to North America in this level of market maturity. However, there are certain countries within this segments where we don't have a strong leadership position, which in turn, results in profit margins that are lower than North American margins, although returns are still well above total hurdle rates. 
In addition, it's important to note that the Western Europe segment includes head office costs, which reduces our adjusted OIBDA margins. Excluding the head office costs, the margin in this segment would be in the mid- to high 30% range. Adjusted OIBDA margin percentages remained stable in the first quarter, despite the decline in service revenues, although absolute dollar-adjusted OIBDA fell primarily as the result of FX headwinds. 
The Other International segments, which is made up of emerging markets and Australia, had strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 11.1% and service intern  growth was 6.8%. We expected adjusted OIBDA for this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the high teens to low-20s range as we continue to expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets. Adjusted OIBDA for the first quarter was impacted by FX headwinds and integration costs. 
Historical data to Other International, on a full year basis, would be available in our amended 10-K, which will be filed in the short term. 
As I mentioned at the outset, our outlook for 2015 remains consistent with the guidance we provided in February during our fourth quarter earnings call. In addition, at this time, our guidance doesn't reflect the benefit or impact of the potential Recall transaction. Business trends and operating fundamentals remain consistent. Operationally, we remain on track to deliver our long-term financial objectives, given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. That said, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to impact our reported results. However, we believe that we will remain within the ranges of our guidance. 
As a reminder, our guidance includes an expectation of roughly 12% decline in reported non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue for 2015 relative to FX rates in place in 2014. Revenues outside the U.S. make up 40% of total worldwide revenue. As a result, we expect the FX impact on total revenue for 2015 to be 4% to 5%. 
Lastly, although there is no seasonality to our quarters, there is typically a moderate ramp in revenue performance as the year progresses. Our strong cash flow continues to support our dividend at current levels, and we expect our dividends to grow in line with operating performance. Our estimate for cash available for distribution and discretionary investment for 2015 remains $470 million, which gives us ample dividend coverage and the ability to fund a portion of our core growth investments. 
As we've previously said, we expect to fund discretionary investments, including real estate and acquisitions through external funding, whether through equity or borrowings. 
Shifting to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had liquidity of more than $780 million. Quarter end, our lease adjusted ratio was 5.5x, as planned. At Monday stock price, our debt to total market capitalization is roughly 38%, in line with major REIT averages. 
Turning now to REIT-specific metrics. As we begin to accelerate consolidation of facilities and execute on our real estate purchase plan, we expect to increase the portion of owned facilities by square footage. We continue to achieve strong storage NOI for approximately $27 per rack square foot worldwide, which compares favorably to NOI per square foot for most property types within the REIT sector. 
Our racking and building utilization rates are high at 91% and 83%, respectively, for the Records Management portfolio. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90s. When we enter into a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about 3 year's time. We added a new page to the supplemental, Page 32, which highlights our investments from racking projects in process, building developments and building acquisitions on major geographic region, their total expected return and anticipated returns. We will continue to enhance our disclosures as we move forward through the year. 
Lastly, similar to prior quarters, we are providing components of value, a summary of the various parts of our business to facilitate valuation. As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA, excluding rent expense. In order to present storage economics on a consistent basis least our own. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities areas. In an effort to ensure transparency to our shareholders, we will continue to enhance our supplemental disclosure and provide more detail to help you better understand our business and its underlying fundamentals. As always, we welcome your feedback. Operator, with that, we will now take questions."

As I'm sure everyone joining us this morning knows, we also announced an agreement in principle to acquire Recall. This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, our CEO, who will discuss highlights for the quarter, some key points related to the proposed transaction as well as progress toward our strategic initiative; followed by Rod Day, our CFO, who will cover financial results.
After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. 
As we have done for the last few quarters, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at ironmountain.com under Investor Relations/Financial Information. We've also posted there a brief presentation related to the proposed Recall transaction at the same location. Referring now to Page 2 of the supplemental, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2015 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and in the Recall presentation and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations to these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, are included in the supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin?"

Let me first extend our apologies for such a short notice on the change in timing for the release of first quarter results. But given that it was driven by our agreement in principle to acquire Recall, we felt it was important to combine the news. 
I would start by saying we are pleased to announce that our results from the first quarter meet or exceed our expectations. We continue to build operational momentum in the business which is in turn, driving strong financial results in spite of the significant FX headwinds. However, given the breaking news associated with the agreement in principle to acquire Recall, I'd like to start with a discussion of this agreement. 
First, I should say we are very excited about our agreed proposal to acquire Recall. We think this proposed transaction represents an attractive value proposition supported by significant synergies and believe it will be highly accretive. Our revised offer reflects the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and other favorable changes since our proposal, particularly regarding transaction-related tax assumptions. Of course, we have yet to complete due diligence and reach a definitive agreement, and the successful completion of the transaction is subject to customary conditions noted in today's press release. We have a few slides related to the proposal, the proposed transaction, that we have posted to our Investor Relations website which I'll touch on briefly. 
Turning first to Slide. 3, the proposed acquisition is an all-stock deal at a fixed exchange rate of 0.1722 of an Iron Mountain share for each Recall share. Additionally, we have made a provision that each Recall shareholder can elect up to a maximum of 5,000 shares to be paid in cash at AUD 8.50 per share, subject to a cap on the total cash consideration of AUD 225 million.
On Slide 5, we estimate there is an opportunity to achieve synergies of between USD 125 million and USD 140 million, driven by economies of scale from the combination of infrastructure and overhead. We expect to realize 50% of these synergies in year 2 which will already yield by year 2, high-single digit accretion in EPS, FFO and AFFO. 
Another benefit of the proposed transaction in the medium term is that it supports our deleveraging strategy. Additionally, we have complementary market platforms, with Recall having a more developed presence with the small to medium businesses in the U.S. whilst we have more significant presence with larger enterprise customers in the U.S. 
Turning to Slide 6. We also have complementary geographic coverage, with Recall having more exposure to faster-growing international markets. 
Slide 7 provides a bit more detail on the benefits to Recall shareholders, including the ability, through stock ownership, to participate in future upside and be supported through a secondary listing in Australia. 
Slide 8 shows more detail on our estimated net synergies, as well as our expected integration and other costs that would be incurred in year 1 to achieve those synergies. Assuming the midpoint of this synergy range, consensus estimates of Recall's 2015 EBITDA and the fixed exchange ratio, we estimate our going-in EBITDA multiple is just over 12x and is reduced by 4 to 4.5 turns on a fully synergized basis, demonstrating the benefits of the proposed transaction. 
Lastly, on Slide 9, we provided a list of next steps in the process. With that overview of the proposed transaction, let me turn to our results. 
We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operating performance, extending recent progress with continued positive organic volume growth in solid storage rental internal growth. We continue to execute on our 3-year strategic plan which rests on 3 pillars: getting more from our developed markets; expanding our presence in faster growing, emerging markets; and continuing to explore adjacent opportunities in our Emerging business segment. 
Rod will have more details in a few minutes, but I'll start by highlighting that on a constant dollar basis, our financial results for the first quarter were in line or ahead of our expectations, with total revenue up 2% and adjusted OIBDA up 5.7% on a constant dollar basis, or 4.5% on a constant dollar basis if normalized for restructuring charges, as shown on Page 20 in our supplemental. 
We saw further strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the first quarter which impacted our reported results, but the fundamental trends in the business remained solid and we are pleased with the momentum. Our results are supported by the durability of our storage rental business and are in line with our strategic plan. 
If you reviewed our supplemental disclosure before the call today, you probably noted that we added a further breakdown of our International business. Effective with this quarter's reporting, we've broken the former International segment into Western Europe and Other International. With this segment change, we've consolidated executive leadership of North America and Western European markets under Patrick Keddy to provide better focus and alignment within our developed markets. Patrick has run our U.K. and Western European markets for several years now, having originally joined us from Pitney Bowes, where he ran its entire business outside the U.S., including operations in 28 countries. 
JT Tomovcsik will continue to run our North American Records and Information Management business, and Eileen Sweeney will add Western Europe to her leadership responsibilities and will have Data Management in all developed markets. She and JT will coordinate their offers through Patrick. This integration of executive leadership in North America and Western Europe will allow us to present a single face to our major customers in our largest markets and will be better positioned as a global service provider, not just a company with a global footprint. 
Marc Duale will continue to run Emerging Markets through the Other International segment which covers Latin America, Asia Pacific and Central and Eastern Europe. This segment also includes Australia, as it is easy to manage within this segment due to geographic proximity. We think this structure will better fuel of our continued momentum in developed markets and continue our expansion in emerging markets, thereby, more closely tying performance to our strategic plan. 
Turning to operating highlights. Total storage revenue, a key economic driver of our business, grew by 4.6% on a constant dollar basis during the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth from the Other International segment and consistent trends in Western Europe, as well as North America RIM and DM, or Data Management. Worldwide internal growth in storage rental of 3% continue to show resilience. Whilst internal growth did benefit slightly from favorable comps relative to the 1.4% internal storage rental growth in the same period last year, we are seeing continued momentum and are maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth for 2015 of between 2% and 2.5%. 
In Records Management, we added roughly 18 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a trailing 12-month basis, representing 3.5% net growth. This growth was in part achieved as a result of the significant turnaround we are continuing to achieve in North America from negative to positive internal volume growth or, in other words, before benefit from acquisitions. Importantly, North America represents nearly 25% of our net volume gains for the trailing 12 months, excluding acquisitions. 
Globally, we maintained customer retention of 98%, in line with our fourth quarter 2014 levels, but a significant improvement over the level of customer turnover experienced just 2 years ago. 
In our Data Management business, we continue to see solid storage revenue growth, although as noted in recent quarters, we are still experiencing headwinds related to reduced frequency of customer tape rotation. Whilst we continue to evaluate ways to rightsize our cost structure to align with this trend, we are continuing to develop new product and services in the Data Management segment to leverage our strong customer relationships in the more than 200,000 stops we make each month. 
During the quarter, Google named us as the ingestion partner for its new near line cloud solution. This means we are the preferred provider to assist Google Cloud customers in uploading all the data saved in legacy data storage formats that predated cloud storage so they can better use big data. We plan to begin offering this service later this summer. 
We also are seeing good early reception to our restoration assurance program that helps customers retrieve data from legacy media and optimize their backup environment for future technologies. 
Moreover, just last week, we announced a strategic relationship with EMC to deliver cloud backup and replication services which helps customers optimize their on-premise and off-premise data protection strategy. We are the only one of their providers to offer data domain replication to the cloud with tape out capabilities. These new initiatives are in their early days and we are not guiding to a specific contribution from them, but they demonstrate our thought leadership, innovation capabilities and partnership with other world leaders in information management like Google and EMC. 
Turning to Emerging markets. We are making good progress towards our goal of 16% of total revenue from emerging markets by the end of next year. These high-growth markets represent 13.6% of our total revenue at the end of the quarter on a constant dollar basis. Like most multinationals, we do have exposure to the effects of currency translation in terms of absolute earnings and cash impact in U.S. dollars. Whilst FX variability does impact the absolute dollars we report, the impact on our growth and adjusted OIBDA margins is almost completely muted because most of our expenses are denominated in local currency, thereby, creating a natural hedge. 
On the other hand, the current FX environment gives us a positive window in terms of investment. Given our opportunity to expand internationally in what is today a relatively small international base, we believe we can create significant value over time by investing selectively in these higher growth markets using strong U.S. dollars during this part of the currency cycle. We continue to see attractive growth potential in both storage and service in emerging markets as they are still in the early part of the outsourcing of enterprise storage. 
Internal storage rental growth in our Other International segment was 11.1% in the first quarter. Rod will describe more fully the impact of foreign currency exchange rate impacts on our reported performance for the quarter. 
Furthermore, we intend to pursue attractive investment opportunities that extend the durability of the storage rental business. As we've discussed on recent calls, we plan to buy $700 million to $1 billion of our lease facilities over the next 8 to 10 years, shifting our mix to a higher percentage of owned properties. On average, we are achieving a spread of roughly 150 basis points between our going in cap rates and market cap rates whilst positioning ourselves to capture long-term residual value from ownership. 
Importantly, the REIT structure is consistent with our capital allocation goals and does not limit our ability to fund our business plan. As we become more active in buying in our properties and executing on our acquisition pipeline, we expect to fund that incremental investment with additional borrowing and/or equity issuance similar to the manner in which most REITs fund external growth. 
As you think about opportunities to grow our storage rental business, it is important not to lose sight of the solid durability of the business which is underpinned by roughly $1.5 billion of net operating income from our storage business alone. This amount of NOI is comparable to that generated by the leaders in the industrial and self storage sectors. And we have other attractive business characteristics that compare favorably with REITs. Our enterprise storage foundation is similar to self storage, but we serve more than 92% of the Fortune 1000 with superior customer credit quality. We have a diversified base of more than 155,000 business customers with 98% customer retention and a 15-year average life of box in our facilities. Our business has a very low volatility, as highlighted by our track record of 26 years of consecutive growth in storage rental revenue, even throughout the recent recession. In light self storage, we have a service component to our business that is inextricably linked to our customers' underlying storage needs. We also compare very favorably with the industrial sector, with a major difference that our real estate costs are incurred by the square foot, but we generate storage rental revenue by the cubic foot, yielding a very high net operating income per square foot. 
Similar to the industrial sector, we have a low maintenance CapEx requirement, but our turnover costs are even lower on a per foot basis. And when we invest in incremental racking structures within an existing industrial shelf, we generate very strong returns due to the leverage associated with this volume achieved with reduced growth CapEx. 
To wrap up, we're excited to be announcing the proposed transaction with Recall and reporting a quarter of strong operating performance. Our results were in line with or ahead of expectations, and we remain on track to achieve our long-term goals. Our business is durable and generates strong cash flow that more than covers our dividend and provides a portion of growth CapEx. And as we look at our longer-term growth potential, we have multiple capital allocation opportunities to invest in attractive returns that exceed our cost of capital and support long-term growth and our dividend. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rod."
30292,290824612,796649,"Iron Mountain Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2015",2015-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Iron Mountain Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Bill.

We're pleased with the momentum we continue to see in our business and the strong operating performance we saw in the first quarter of 2015. Our results continue to demonstrate the durability of our storage rental business and the benefits of acquisitions we made in developed and emerging markets in prior periods. 
Before I begin, I'd like to note that our outlook for 2015 doesn't contemplate potential contribution or impact from the proposed transaction with Recall. As noted by Bill, we have yet to reach a definitive agreement, we are just embarking on the due diligence process. 
To frame my remarks, I'll begin today with an overview of our first quarter performance, including a review of our new segment disclosure. I'll briefly touch on our outlook for 2015 which remains unchanged since our update in February of this year. Finally, I will address other metrics through a REIT lens. Let's turn to our worldwide financial results for the quarter. 
Referring now to Pages 8 and 9 of our supplemental. Supported by strong storage rental growth, total reported revenues were $749 million, up approximately 2.2% compared with Q1 of 2015 on a constant dollar basis. Reported revenue for the quarter declined by 2.7% year-over-year as a result of the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar which impacted total revenues by approximately 5% or $37 million. Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $231 million compared with $229 million in 2014, up 1.2% on a reported basis and 5.7% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted OIBDA increased year-over-year due to improved storage profits, somewhat offset by a reduction in service profits. In addition, overhead expenses declined partly, as we are seeing the benefits of our efficiency initiatives. 
To illustrate the 4.5% year-over-year improvement in normalized adjusted OIBDA, we've included a bridging schedule on Page 20 of our supplemental package. Normalized funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.50 for the quarter, while adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, was $128 million. The year-over-year decline in AFFO was driven by variances in deferred tax expenses. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.32 per diluted share compared with $0.35 in the first quarter of 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-over-year is driven by a 10% increase in share counts related to the special distribution we made in the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, adjusted EPS was impacted by an increase in interest expense related to high levels of debt and a slightly higher structural tax rate. The increase in borrowings was driven primarily by REIT conversion-related expenses such as E&P purge and the DNA recapture payments. Our structural tax rate for Q1 '15 came out to 16.2% as a result of the slight mix change, driven by higher income from foreign jurisdictions. It's important to note that adjusted EPS for 2015 was restated to be on a comparable basis, using our structural tax rate of roughly 15%. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% over the longer term. 
To illustrate the changes to adjusted EPS, we've included a bridging schedule on Page 21 of our supplemental. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by solid storage rental growth of 5%, offset by a decline in service revenue of 1% on a constant dollar basis. 
As Bill mentioned, in an effort to more closely tie our leadership structure to the strategic plan, we have broken out the former International segment into 2 segments: Western Europe and Other International, to facilitate managing the business along the developed emerging lines we've talked about in the past. 
I will now discuss Records Management or RM volume trends across this new segmentation. As you can see in the supplemental on Pages 10 and 11, we've expanded our disclosure by illustrating Records Management volume trends by segments. As you can see, we've achieved positive volume growth of 1.2% in North America, 5.4% in Western Europe and 12.9% in the Other International segments, reporting global Records Management net volume growth of 3.5%. We continue to experience strong organic growth, with first quarter total year-on-year volume growth of 1.9% excluding acquisitions. Underlying this growth is the stable incoming volume from existing customers, who added approximately 30 million gross cubic feet of storage in the last 12 months which is consistent with prior periods. 
Let's now turn to our financial performance by segments. North America Records and Information Management, or RIM, delivered positive storage rental internal growth and expanded OIBDA margins by more than 300 basis points during the first quarter. This expansion in adjusted OIBDA margins was driven by a decline in overhead costs, as we continue to execute on our speed and agility efforts. 
North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of 5.2% in the first quarter. However, service declined by 5.9% as DM tape management becomes more archival. During the first quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA declined to 52.7%, partly as a result of the new product launches related to our restoration assurance program and other initiatives that Bill covered in his remarks. We believe these will prove very positive investments for the longer term. 
The Western Europe segment generated solid results, with 3.7% storage rental internal growth which is partially offset by a decline of 2.6% in internal service revenue. The Western Europe business is similar to North America in its level of market maturity. However, there are certain countries within this segment where we don't have a strong leadership position which in turn, results in profit margins that are lower than North American margins, although returns are still well above required hurdle rates. 
In addition, it's important to note that the Western Europe segment includes head office costs which reduces our adjusted OIBDA margins. Excluding the head office costs, the margin in this segment would be in the mid to high 30% range. Adjusted OIBDA margin percentages remained stable in the first quarter despite the decline in service revenues, although absolute dollar-adjusted OIBDA fell primarily as the result of FX headwinds. 
The Other International segments which is made up of emerging markets and Australia, had strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 11.1% and service internal growth was 6.8%. We expect adjusted OIBDA for this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the high teens to low-20s range as we continue to expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets. Adjusted OIBDA for the first quarter was impacted by FX headwinds and integration costs. 
Historical data to Other International on a full year basis will be available on our amended 10-K which will be filed in the short term. 
As I mentioned at the outset, our outlook for 2015 remains consistent with the guidance we provided in February during our fourth quarter earnings call. In addition, at this time, our guidance doesn't reflect the benefit or impact of the potential Recall transaction. Business trends and operating fundamentals remain consistent. Operationally, we remain on track to deliver our long-term financial objectives, given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. That said, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to impact our reported results. However, we believe that we will remain within the ranges of our guidance. 
As a reminder, our guidance includes an expectation of roughly 12% decline in reported non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue for 2015 relative to FX rates in place in 2014. Revenues outside the U.S. make up 40% of total worldwide revenue. As a result, we expect the FX impact on total revenue for 2015 to be 4% to 5%. 
Lastly, although there is no seasonality to our quarters, there is typically a moderate ramp in revenue performance as the year progresses. Our strong cash flow continues to support our dividend at current levels, and we expect our dividends to grow in line with operating performance. Our estimate for cash available for distribution and discretionary investment for 2015 remains $470 million which gives us ample dividend coverage and the ability to fund a portion of our core growth investments. 
As we've previously said, we expect to fund discretionary investments, including real estate and acquisitions through external funding, whether through equity or borrowings. 
Shifting to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had liquidity of more than $780 million. Quarter end, our lease adjusted ratio was 5.5x as planned. At Monday's stock price, our debt to total market capitalization is roughly 38%, in line with major REIT averages. 
Turning now to REIT-specific metrics. As we begin to accelerate consolidation of facilities and execute on our real estate purchase plan, we expect to increase a portion of owned facilities by square footage. We continue to achieve strong storage NOI or approximately $27 per rack square foot worldwide which compares favorably to NOI per square foot for most property types within the REIT sector. 
Our racking and building utilization rates are high at 91% and 83%, respectively for the Records Management portfolio. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90s. When we enter into a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about 3 years' time. We added a new page to the supplemental, Page 32 which highlights our investments for racking projects in process, building developments and building acquisitions on major geographic region, their total expected return and anticipated returns. We will continue to enhance our disclosure as we move forward through the year. 
Lastly, similar to prior quarters, we are providing components of value, a summary of the various parts of our business to facilitate valuation. As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA excluding rent expense in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis for the leased or owned. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities area. In an effort to ensure transparency to our shareholders, we will continue to enhance our supplemental disclosure and provide more details to help you better understand our business and its underlying fundamentals. As always, we welcome your feedback. Operator, with that, we will now take questions."

After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. 
As we have done for the last few quarters, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at ironmountain.com under Investor Relations/Financial Information. We've also posted there a brief presentation related to the proposed Recall transaction at the same location. Referring now to Page 2 of the supplemental, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2015 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and in the Recall presentation and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations to these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, are included in the supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin?"

Let me first extend our apologies for such a short notice on the change in timing for the release of first quarter results. But given that it was driven by our agreement in principle to acquire Recall, we felt it was important to combine the news. 
I would start by saying we are pleased to announce that our results from the first quarter meet or exceed our expectations. We continue to build operational momentum in the business which is in turn, driving strong financial results in spite of the significant FX headwinds. However, given the breaking news associated with the agreement in principle to acquire Recall, I'd like to start with a discussion of this agreement. 
First, I should say we are very excited about our agreed proposal to acquire Recall. We think this proposed transaction represents an attractive value proposition supported by significant synergies and believe it will be highly accretive. Our revised offer reflects the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and other favorable changes since our proposal, particularly regarding transaction-related tax assumptions. Of course, we have yet to complete due diligence and reach a definitive agreement, and the successful completion of the transaction is subject to customary conditions noted in today's press release. We have a few slides related to the proposal, the proposed transaction, that we have posted to our Investor Relations website which I'll touch on briefly. 
Turning first to Slide 3, the proposed acquisition is an all-stock deal at a fixed exchange rate of 0.1722 of an Iron Mountain share for each Recall share. Additionally, we have made a provision that each Recall shareholder can elect up to a maximum of 5,000 shares to be paid in cash at AUD 8.50 per share, subject to a cap on the total cash consideration of AUD 225 million.
On Slide 5, we estimate there is an opportunity to achieve synergies of between USD 125 million and USD 140 million, driven by economies of scale from the combination of infrastructure and overhead. We expect to realize 50% of these synergies in year 2 which will already yield by year 2, high-single digit accretion in EPS, FFO and AFFO. 
Another benefit of the proposed transaction in the medium term is that it supports our deleveraging strategy. Additionally, we have complementary market platforms, with Recall having a more developed presence with the small to medium businesses in the U.S. whilst we have more significant presence with larger enterprise customers in the U.S. 
Turning to Slide 6. We also have complementary geographic coverage, with Recall having more exposure to faster-growing international markets. 
Slide 7 provides a bit more detail on the benefits to Recall shareholders, including the ability, through stock ownership, to participate in future upside and be supported through a secondary listing in Australia. 
Slide 8 shows more detail on our estimated net synergies, as well as our expected integration and other costs that would be incurred in year 1 to achieve those synergies. Assuming the midpoint of this synergy range, consensus estimates of Recall's 2015 EBITDA and the fixed exchange ratio, we estimate our going-in EBITDA multiple is just over 12x and is reduced by 4 to 4.5 turns on a fully synergized basis, demonstrating the benefits of the proposed transaction. 
Lastly, on Slide 9, we provided a list of next steps in the process. With that overview of the proposed transaction, let me turn to our results. 
We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operating performance, extending recent progress with continued positive organic volume growth in solid storage rental internal growth. We continue to execute on our 3-year strategic plan which rests on 3 pillars: getting more from our developed markets; expanding our presence in faster growing, emerging markets; and continuing to explore adjacent opportunities in our Emerging business segment. 
Rod will have more details in a few minutes, but I'll start by highlighting that on a constant dollar basis, our financial results for the first quarter were in line or ahead of our expectations, with total revenue up 2% and adjusted OIBDA up 5.7% on a constant dollar basis, or 4.5% on a constant dollar basis if normalized for restructuring charges, as shown on Page 20 in our supplemental. 
We saw further strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the first quarter which impacted our reported results, but the fundamental trends in the business remained solid and we are pleased with the momentum. Our results are supported by the durability of our storage rental business and are in line with our strategic plan. 
If you reviewed our supplemental disclosure before the call today, you probably noted that we added a further breakdown of our International business. Effective with this quarter's reporting, we've broken the former International segment into Western Europe and Other International. With this segment change, we've consolidated executive leadership of North America and Western European markets under Patrick Keddy to provide better focus and alignment within our developed markets. Patrick has run our U.K. and Western European markets for several years now, having originally joined us from Pitney Bowes, where he ran its entire business outside the U.S., including operations in 28 countries. 
JT Tomovcsik will continue to run our North American Records and Information Management business, and Eileen Sweeney will add Western Europe to her leadership responsibilities and will head Data Management in all developed markets. She and JT will coordinate their offers through Patrick. This integration of executive leadership in North America and Western Europe will allow us to present a single face to our major customers in our largest markets and we'll be better positioned as a global service provider, not just a company with a global footprint. 
Marc Duale will continue to run Emerging Markets through the Other International segment which covers Latin America, Asia Pacific and Central and Eastern Europe. This segment also includes Australia, as it is easy to manage within this segment due to geographic proximity. We think this structure will better fuel of our continued momentum in developed markets and continue our expansion in emerging markets, thereby, more closely tying performance to our strategic plan. 
Turning to operating highlights. Total storage revenue, a key economic driver of our business, grew by 4.6% on a constant dollar basis during the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth from the Other International segment and consistent trends in Western Europe, as well as North America RIM and DM, or Data Management. Worldwide internal growth in storage rental of 3% continue to show resilience. Whilst internal growth did benefit slightly from favorable comps relative to the 1.4% internal storage rental growth in the same period last year, we are seeing continued momentum and are maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth for 2015 of between 2% and 2.5%. 
In Records Management, we added roughly 18 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a trailing 12-month basis, representing 3.5% net growth. This growth was in part achieved as a result of the significant turnaround we are continuing to achieve in North America from negative to positive internal volume growth or, in other words, before benefit from acquisitions. Importantly, North America represents nearly 25% of our net volume gains for the trailing 12 months, excluding acquisitions. 
Globally, we maintained customer retention of 98%, in line with our fourth quarter 2014 levels, but a significant improvement over the level of customer turnover experienced just 2 years ago. 
In our Data Management business, we continue to see solid storage revenue growth, although as noted in recent quarters, we are still experiencing headwinds related to reduced frequency of customer tape rotation. Whilst we continue to evaluate ways to rightsize our cost structure to align with this trend, we are continuing to develop new product and services in the Data Management segment to leverage our strong customer relationships in the more than 200,000 stops we make each month. 
During the quarter, Google named us as the ingestion partner for its new near line cloud solution. This means we are the preferred provider to assist Google Cloud customers in uploading all the data saved in legacy data storage formats that predated cloud storage so they can better use big data. We plan to begin offering this service later this summer. 
We also are seeing good early reception to our restoration assurance program that helps customers retrieve data from legacy media and optimize their backup environment for future technologies. 
Moreover, just last week, we announced a strategic relationship with EMC to deliver cloud backup and replication services which helps customers optimize their on-premise and off-premise data protection strategy. We are the only one of their providers to offer data domain replication to the cloud with tape out capabilities. These new initiatives are in their early days and we are not guiding to a specific contribution from them, but they demonstrate our thought leadership, innovation capabilities and partnership with other world leaders in information management like Google and EMC. 
Turning to Emerging markets. We are making good progress towards our goal of 16% of total revenue from emerging markets by the end of next year. These high-growth markets represent 13.6% of our total revenue at the end of the quarter on a constant dollar basis. Like most multinationals, we do have exposure to the effects of currency translation in terms of absolute earnings and cash impact in U.S. dollars. Whilst FX variability does impact the absolute dollars we report, the impact on our growth and adjusted OIBDA margins is almost completely muted because most of our expenses are denominated in local currency, thereby, creating a natural hedge. 
On the other hand, the current FX environment gives us a positive window in terms of investment. Given our opportunity to expand internationally in what is today a relatively small international base, we believe we can create significant value over time by investing selectively in these higher growth markets using strong U.S. dollars during this part of the currency cycle. We continue to see attractive growth potential in both storage and service in emerging markets as they are still in the early part of the outsourcing of enterprise storage. 
Internal storage rental growth in our Other International segment was 11.1% in the first quarter. Rod will describe more fully the impact of foreign currency exchange rate impacts on our reported performance for the quarter. 
Furthermore, we intend to pursue attractive investment opportunities that extend the durability of the storage rental business. As we've discussed on recent calls, we plan to buy $700 million to $1 billion of our lease facilities over the next 8 to 10 years, shifting our mix to a higher percentage of owned properties. On average, we are achieving a spread of roughly 150 basis points between our going in cap rates and market cap rates whilst positioning ourselves to capture long-term residual value from ownership. 
Importantly, the REIT structure is consistent with our capital allocation goals and does not limit our ability to fund our business plan. As we become more active in buying in our properties and executing on our acquisition pipeline, we expect to fund that incremental investment with additional borrowing and/or equity issuance similar to the manner in which most REITs fund external growth. 
As you think about opportunities to grow our storage rental business, it is important not to lose sight of the solid durability of the business which is underpinned by roughly $1.5 billion of net operating income from our storage business alone. This amount of NOI is comparable to that generated by the leaders in the industrial and self storage sectors. And we have other attractive business characteristics that compare favorably with REITs. Our enterprise storage foundation is similar to self storage, but we serve more than 92% of the Fortune 1000 with superior customer credit quality. We have a diversified base of more than 155,000 business customers with 98% customer retention and a 15-year average life of box in our facilities. Our business has a very low volatility, as highlighted by our track record of 26 years of consecutive growth in storage rental revenue, even throughout the recent recession. In light self storage, we have a service component to our business that is inextricably linked to our customers' underlying storage needs. We also compare very favorably with the industrial sector, with a major difference that our real estate costs are incurred by the square foot, but we generate storage rental revenue by the cubic foot, yielding a very high net operating income per square foot. 
Similar to the industrial sector, we have a low maintenance CapEx requirement, but our turnover costs are even lower on a per foot basis. And when we invest in incremental racking structures within an existing industrial shelf, we generate very strong returns due to the leverage associated with this volume achieved with reduced growth CapEx. 
To wrap up, we're excited to be announcing the proposed transaction with Recall and reporting a quarter of strong operating performance. Our results were in line with or ahead of expectations, and we remain on track to achieve our long-term goals. Our business is durable and generates strong cash flow that more than covers our dividend and provides a portion of growth CapEx. And as we look at our longer-term growth potential, we have multiple capital allocation opportunities to invest in attractive returns that exceed our cost of capital and support long-term growth and our dividend. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rod."

We're pleased with the momentum we continue to see in our business and the strong operating performance we saw in the first quarter of 2015. Our results continue to demonstrate the durability of our storage rental business and the benefits of acquisitions we made in developed and emerging markets in prior periods. 
Before I begin, I'd like to note that our outlook for 2015 doesn't contemplate potential contribution or impact from the proposed transaction with Recall. As noted by Bill, we have yet to reach a definitive agreement, we are just embarking on the due diligence process. 
To frame my remarks, I'll begin today with an overview of our first quarter performance, including a review of our new segment disclosure. I'll briefly touch on our outlook for 2015 which remains unchanged since our update in February of this year. Finally, I will address other metrics through a REIT lens. Let's turn to our worldwide financial results for the quarter. 
Referring now to Pages 8 and 9 of our supplemental. Supported by strong storage rental growth, total reported revenues were $749 million, up approximately 2.2% compared with Q1 of 2015 on a constant dollar basis. Reported revenue for the quarter declined by 2.7% year-over-year as a result of the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar which impacted total revenues by approximately 5% or $37 million. Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $231 million compared with $229 million in 2014, up 1.2% on a reported basis and 5.7% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted OIBDA increased year-over-year due to improved storage profits, somewhat offset by a reduction in service profits. In addition, overhead expenses declined partly, as we are seeing the benefits of our efficiency initiatives. 
To illustrate the 4.5% year-over-year improvement in normalized adjusted OIBDA, we've included a bridging schedule on Page 20 of our supplemental package. Normalized funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.50 for the quarter, while adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, was $128 million. The year-over-year decline in AFFO was driven by variances in deferred tax expenses. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.32 per diluted share compared with $0.35 in the first quarter of 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-over-year is driven by a 10% increase in share counts related to the special distribution we made in the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, adjusted EPS was impacted by an increase in interest expense related to high levels of debt and a slightly higher structural tax rate. The increase in borrowings was driven primarily by REIT conversion-related expenses such as E&P purge and the DNA recapture payments. Our structural tax rate for Q1 '15 came out to 16.2% as a result of the slight mix change, driven by higher income from foreign jurisdictions. It's important to note that adjusted EPS for 2015 was restated to be on a comparable basis, using our structural tax rate of roughly 15%. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% over the longer term. 
To illustrate the changes to adjusted EPS, we've included a bridging schedule on Page 21 of our supplemental. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by solid storage rental growth of 5%, offset by a decline in service revenue of 1% on a constant dollar basis. 
As Bill mentioned, in an effort to more closely tie our leadership structure to the strategic plan, we have broken out the former International segment into 2 segments: Western Europe and Other International, to facilitate managing the business along the developed emerging lines we've talked about in the past. 
I will now discuss Records Management or RM volume trends across this new segmentation. As you can see in the supplemental on Pages 10 and 11, we've expanded our disclosure by illustrating Records Management volume trends by segments. As you can see, we've achieved positive volume growth of 1.2% in North America, 5.4% in Western Europe and 12.9% in the Other International segments, reporting global Records Management net volume growth of 3.5%. We continue to experience strong organic growth, with first quarter total year-on-year volume growth of 1.9% excluding acquisitions. Underlying this growth is the stable incoming volume from existing customers, who added approximately 30 million gross cubic feet of storage in the last 12 months which is consistent with prior periods. 
Let's now turn to our financial performance by segments. North America Records and Information Management, or RIM, delivered positive storage rental internal growth and expanded OIBDA margins by more than 300 basis points during the first quarter. This expansion in adjusted OIBDA margins was driven by a decline in overhead costs, as we continue to execute on our speed and agility efforts. 
North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of 5.2% in the first quarter. However, service declined by 5.9% as DM tape management becomes more archival. During the first quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA declined to 52.7%, partly as a result of the new product launches related to our restoration assurance program and other initiatives that Bill covered in his remarks. We believe these will prove very positive investments for the longer term. 
The Western Europe segment generated solid results, with 3.7% storage rental internal growth which is partially offset by a decline of 2.6% in internal service revenue. The Western Europe business is similar to North America in its level of market maturity. However, there are certain countries within this segment where we don't have a strong leadership position which in turn, results in profit margins that are lower than North American margins, although returns are still well above required hurdle rates. 
In addition, it's important to note that the Western Europe segment includes head office costs which reduces our adjusted OIBDA margins. Excluding the head office costs, the margin in this segment would be in the mid to high 30% range. Adjusted OIBDA margin percentages remained stable in the first quarter despite the decline in service revenues, although absolute dollar-adjusted OIBDA fell primarily as the result of FX headwinds. 
The Other International segments which is made up of emerging markets and Australia, had strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 11.1% and service internal growth was 6.8%. We expect adjusted OIBDA for this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the high teens to low-20s range as we continue to expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets. Adjusted OIBDA for the first quarter was impacted by FX headwinds and integration costs. 
Historical data to Other International on a full year basis will be available on our amended 10-K which will be filed in the short term. 
As I mentioned at the outset, our outlook for 2015 remains consistent with the guidance we provided in February during our fourth quarter earnings call. In addition, at this time, our guidance doesn't reflect the benefit or impact of the potential Recall transaction. Business trends and operating fundamentals remain consistent. Operationally, we remain on track to deliver our long-term financial objectives, given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. That said, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to impact our reported results. However, we believe that we will remain within the ranges of our guidance. 
As a reminder, our guidance includes an expectation of roughly 12% decline in reported non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue for 2015 relative to FX rates in place in 2014. Revenues outside the U.S. make up 40% of total worldwide revenue. As a result, we expect the FX impact on total revenue for 2015 to be 4% to 5%. 
Lastly, although there is no seasonality to our quarters, there is typically a moderate ramp in revenue performance as the year progresses. Our strong cash flow continues to support our dividend at current levels, and we expect our dividends to grow in line with operating performance. Our estimate for cash available for distribution and discretionary investment for 2015 remains $470 million which gives us ample dividend coverage and the ability to fund a portion of our core growth investments. 
As we've previously said, we expect to fund discretionary investments, including real estate and acquisitions through external funding, whether through equity or borrowings. 
Shifting to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had liquidity of more than $780 million. Quarter end, our lease adjusted ratio was 5.5x as planned. At Monday's stock price, our debt to total market capitalization is roughly 38%, in line with major REIT averages. 
Turning now to REIT-specific metrics. As we begin to accelerate consolidation of facilities and execute on our real estate purchase plan, we expect to increase a portion of owned facilities by square footage. We continue to achieve strong storage NOI or approximately $27 per rack square foot worldwide which compares favorably to NOI per square foot for most property types within the REIT sector. 
Our racking and building utilization rates are high at 91% and 83%, respectively for the Records Management portfolio. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90s. When we enter into a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about 3 years' time. We added a new page to the supplemental, Page 32 which highlights our investments for racking projects in process, building developments and building acquisitions on major geographic region, their total expected return and anticipated returns. We will continue to enhance our disclosure as we move forward through the year. 
Lastly, similar to prior quarters, we are providing components of value, a summary of the various parts of our business to facilitate valuation. As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA excluding rent expense in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis whether leased or owned. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities area. In an effort to ensure transparency to our shareholders, we will continue to enhance our supplemental disclosure and provide more details to help you better understand our business and its underlying fundamentals. As always, we welcome your feedback. Operator, with that, we will now take questions."

After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. 
As we have done for the last few quarters, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at ironmountain.com under Investor Relations/Financial Information. We've also posted there a brief presentation related to the proposed Recall transaction at the same location. Referring now to Page 2 of the supplemental, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2015 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and in the Recall presentation and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations to these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, are included in the supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin?"

Let me first extend our apologies for such a short notice on the change in timing for the release of first quarter results. But given that it was driven by our agreement in principle to acquire Recall, we felt it was important to combine the news. 
I would start by saying we are pleased to announce that our results from the first quarter meet or exceed our expectations. We continue to build operational momentum in the business which is in turn, driving strong financial results in spite of the significant FX headwinds. However, given the breaking news associated with the agreement in principle to acquire Recall, I'd like to start with a discussion of this agreement. 
First, I should say we are very excited about our agreed proposal to acquire Recall. We think this proposed transaction represents an attractive value proposition supported by significant synergies and believe it will be highly accretive. Our revised offer reflects the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and other favorable changes since our proposal, particularly regarding transaction-related tax assumptions. Of course, we have yet to complete due diligence and reach a definitive agreement, and the successful completion of the transaction is subject to customary conditions noted in today's press release. We have a few slides related to the proposal, the proposed transaction, that we have posted to our Investor Relations website which I'll touch on briefly. 
Turning first to Slide 3, the proposed acquisition is an all-stock deal at a fixed exchange rate of 0.1722 of an Iron Mountain share for each Recall share. Additionally, we have made a provision that each Recall shareholder can elect up to a maximum of 5,000 shares to be paid in cash at AUD 8.50 per share, subject to a cap on the total cash consideration of AUD 225 million.
On Slide 5, we estimate there is an opportunity to achieve synergies of between USD 125 million and USD 140 million, driven by economies of scale from the combination of infrastructure and overhead. We expect to realize 50% of these synergies in year 2 which will already yield by year 2, high-single digit accretion in EPS, FFO and AFFO. 
Another benefit of the proposed transaction in the medium term is that it supports our deleveraging strategy. Additionally, we have complementary market platforms, with Recall having a more developed presence with the small to medium businesses in the U.S. whilst we have more significant presence with larger enterprise customers in the U.S. 
Turning to Slide 6. We also have complementary geographic coverage, with Recall having more exposure to faster-growing international markets. 
Slide 7 provides a bit more detail on the benefits to Recall shareholders, including the ability, through stock ownership, to participate in future upside and be supported through a secondary listing in Australia. 
Slide 8 shows more detail on our estimated net synergies, as well as our expected integration and other costs that would be incurred in year 1 to achieve those synergies. Assuming the midpoint of this synergy range, consensus estimates of Recall's 2015 EBITDA and the fixed exchange ratio, we estimate our going-in EBITDA multiple is just over 12x and is reduced by 4 to 4.5 turns on a fully synergized basis, demonstrating the benefits of the proposed transaction. 
Lastly, on Slide 9, we provided a list of next steps in the process. With that overview of the proposed transaction, let me turn to our results. 
We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operating performance, extending recent progress with continued positive organic volume growth in solid storage rental internal growth. We continue to execute on our 3-year strategic plan which rests on 3 pillars: getting more from our developed markets; expanding our presence in faster growing, emerging markets; and continuing to explore adjacent opportunities in our Emerging business segment. 
Rod will have more details in a few minutes, but I'll start by highlighting that on a constant dollar basis, our financial results for the first quarter were in line or ahead of our expectations, with total revenue up 2% and adjusted OIBDA up 5.7% on a constant dollar basis, or 4.5% on a constant dollar basis if normalized for restructuring charges, as shown on Page 20 in our supplemental. 
We saw further strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the first quarter which impacted our reported results, but the fundamental trends in the business remained solid and we are pleased with the momentum. Our results are supported by the durability of our storage rental business and are in line with our strategic plan. 
If you reviewed our supplemental disclosure before the call today, you probably noted that we added a further breakdown of our International business. Effective with this quarter's reporting, we've broken the former International segment into Western Europe and Other International. With this segment change, we've consolidated executive leadership of North America and Western European markets under Patrick Keddy to provide better focus and alignment within our developed markets. Patrick has run our U.K. and Western European markets for several years now, having originally joined us from Pitney Bowes, where he ran its entire business outside the U.S., including operations in 28 countries. 
JT Tomovcsik will continue to run our North American Records and Information Management business, and Eileen Sweeney will add Western Europe to her leadership responsibilities and will head Data Management in all developed markets. She and JT will coordinate their offers through Patrick. This integration of executive leadership in North America and Western Europe will allow us to present a single face to our major customers in our largest markets and we'll be better positioned as a global service provider, not just a company with a global footprint. 
Marc Duale will continue to run Emerging Markets through the Other International segment which covers Latin America, Asia Pacific and Central and Eastern Europe. This segment also includes Australia, as it is easy to manage within this segment due to geographic proximity. We think this structure will better fuel of our continued momentum in developed markets and continue our expansion in emerging markets, thereby, more closely tying performance to our strategic plan. 
Turning to operating highlights. Total storage revenue, a key economic driver of our business, grew by 4.6% on a constant dollar basis during the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth from the Other International segment and consistent trends in Western Europe, as well as North America RIM and DM, or Data Management. Worldwide internal growth in storage rental of 3% continue to show resilience. Whilst internal growth did benefit slightly from favorable comps relative to the 1.4% internal storage rental growth in the same period last year, we are seeing continued momentum and are maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth for 2015 of between 2% and 2.5%. 
In Records Management, we added roughly 18 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a trailing 12-month basis, representing 3.5% net growth. This growth was in part achieved as a result of the significant turnaround we are continuing to achieve in North America from negative to positive internal volume growth or, in other words, before benefit from acquisitions. Importantly, North America represents nearly 25% of our net volume gains for the trailing 12 months, excluding acquisitions. 
Globally, we maintained customer retention of 98%, in line with our fourth quarter 2014 levels, but a significant improvement over the level of customer turnover experienced just 2 years ago. 
In our Data Management business, we continue to see solid storage revenue growth, although as noted in recent quarters, we are still experiencing headwinds related to reduced frequency of customer tape rotation. Whilst we continue to evaluate ways to rightsize our cost structure to align with this trend, we are continuing to develop new product and services in the Data Management segment to leverage our strong customer relationships in the more than 200,000 stops we make each month. 
During the quarter, Google named us as the ingestion partner for its new near line cloud solution. This means we are the preferred provider to assist Google Cloud customers in uploading all the data saved in legacy data storage formats that predated cloud storage so they can better use big data. We plan to begin offering this service later this summer. 
We also are seeing good early reception to our restoration assurance program that helps customers retrieve data from legacy media and optimize their backup environment for future technologies. 
Moreover, just last week, we announced a strategic relationship with EMC to deliver cloud backup and replication services which helps customers optimize their on-premise and off-premise data protection strategy. We are the only one of their providers to offer data domain replication to the cloud with tape out capabilities. These new initiatives are in their early days and we are not guiding to a specific contribution from them, but they demonstrate our thought leadership, innovation capabilities and partnership with other world leaders in information management like Google and EMC. 
Turning to Emerging markets. We are making good progress towards our goal of 16% of total revenue from emerging markets by the end of next year. These high-growth markets represent 13.6% of our total revenue at the end of the quarter on a constant dollar basis. Like most multinationals, we do have exposure to the effects of currency translation in terms of absolute earnings and cash impact in U.S. dollars. Whilst FX variability does impact the absolute dollars we report, the impact on our growth and adjusted OIBDA margins is almost completely muted because most of our expenses are denominated in local currency, thereby, creating a natural hedge. 
On the other hand, the current FX environment gives us a positive window in terms of investment. Given our opportunity to expand internationally in what is today a relatively small international base, we believe we can create significant value over time by investing selectively in these higher growth markets using strong U.S. dollars during this part of the currency cycle. We continue to see attractive growth potential in both storage and service in emerging markets as they are still in the early part of the outsourcing of enterprise storage. 
Internal storage rental growth in our Other International segment was 11.1% in the first quarter. Rod will describe more fully the impact of foreign currency exchange rate impacts on our reported performance for the quarter. 
Furthermore, we intend to pursue attractive investment opportunities that extend the durability of the storage rental business. As we've discussed on recent calls, we plan to buy $700 million to $1 billion of our lease facilities over the next 8 to 10 years, shifting our mix to a higher percentage of owned properties. On average, we are achieving a spread of roughly 150 basis points between our going in cap rates and market cap rates whilst positioning ourselves to capture long-term residual value from ownership. 
Importantly, the REIT structure is consistent with our capital allocation goals and does not limit our ability to fund our business plan. As we become more active in buying in our properties and executing on our acquisition pipeline, we expect to fund that incremental investment with additional borrowing and/or equity issuance similar to the manner in which most REITs fund external growth. 
As you think about opportunities to grow our storage rental business, it is important not to lose sight of the solid durability of the business which is underpinned by roughly $1.5 billion of net operating income from our storage business alone. This amount of NOI is comparable to that generated by the leaders in the industrial and self storage sectors. And we have other attractive business characteristics that compare favorably with REITs. Our enterprise storage foundation is similar to self storage, but we serve more than 92% of the Fortune 1000 with superior customer credit quality. We have a diversified base of more than 155,000 business customers with 98% customer retention and a 15-year average life of box in our facilities. Our business has a very low volatility, as highlighted by our track record of 26 years of consecutive growth in storage rental revenue, even throughout the recent recession. In light self storage, we have a service component to our business that is inextricably linked to our customers' underlying storage needs. We also compare very favorably with the industrial sector, with a major difference that our real estate costs are incurred by the square foot, but we generate storage rental revenue by the cubic foot, yielding a very high net operating income per square foot. 
Similar to the industrial sector, we have a low maintenance CapEx requirement, but our turnover costs are even lower on a per foot basis. And when we invest in incremental racking structures within an existing industrial shelf, we generate very strong returns due to the leverage associated with this volume achieved with reduced growth CapEx. 
To wrap up, we're excited to be announcing the proposed transaction with Recall and reporting a quarter of strong operating performance. Our results were in line with or ahead of expectations, and we remain on track to achieve our long-term goals. Our business is durable and generates strong cash flow that more than covers our dividend and provides a portion of growth CapEx. And as we look at our longer-term growth potential, we have multiple capital allocation opportunities to invest in attractive returns that exceed our cost of capital and support long-term growth and our dividend. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rod."

We're pleased with the momentum we continue to see in our business and the strong operating performance we saw in the first quarter of 2015. Our results continue to demonstrate the durability of our storage rental business and the benefits of acquisitions we made in developed and emerging markets in prior periods. 
Before I begin, I'd like to note that our outlook for 2015 doesn't contemplate potential contribution or impact from the proposed transaction with Recall. As noted by Bill, we have yet to reach a definitive agreement, we are just embarking on the due diligence process. 
To frame my remarks, I'll begin today with an overview of our first quarter performance, including a review of our new segment disclosure. I'll briefly touch on our outlook for 2015 which remains unchanged since our update in February of this year. Finally, I will address other metrics through a REIT lens. Let's turn to our worldwide financial results for the quarter. 
Referring now to Pages 8 and 9 of our supplemental. Supported by strong storage rental growth, total reported revenues were $749 million, up approximately 2.2% compared with Q1 of 2015 on a constant dollar basis. Reported revenue for the quarter declined by 2.7% year-over-year as a result of the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar which impacted total revenues by approximately 5% or $37 million. Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $231 million compared with $229 million in 2014, up 1.2% on a reported basis and 5.7% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted OIBDA increased year-over-year due to improved storage profits, somewhat offset by a reduction in service profits. In addition, overhead expenses declined partly, as we are seeing the benefits of our efficiency initiatives. 
To illustrate the 4.5% year-over-year improvement in normalized adjusted OIBDA, we've included a bridging schedule on Page 20 of our supplemental package. Normalized funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.50 for the quarter, while adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, was $128 million. The year-over-year decline in AFFO was driven by variances in deferred tax expenses. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.32 per diluted share compared with $0.35 in the first quarter of 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-over-year is driven by a 10% increase in share counts related to the special distribution we made in the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, adjusted EPS was impacted by an increase in interest expense related to high levels of debt and a slightly higher structural tax rate. The increase in borrowings was driven primarily by REIT conversion-related expenses such as E&P purge and the DNA recapture payments. Our structural tax rate for Q1 '15 came out to 16.2% as a result of the slight mix change, driven by higher income from foreign jurisdictions. It's important to note that adjusted EPS for 2015 was restated to be on a comparable basis, using our structural tax rate of roughly 15%. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% over the longer term. 
To illustrate the changes to adjusted EPS, we've included a bridging schedule on Page 21 of our supplemental. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by solid storage rental growth of 5%, offset by a decline in service revenue of 1% on a constant dollar basis. 
As Bill mentioned, in an effort to more closely tie our leadership structure to the strategic plan, we have broken out the former International segment into 2 segments: Western Europe and Other International, to facilitate managing the business along the developed emerging lines we've talked about in the past. 
I will now discuss Records Management or RM volume trends across this new segmentation. As you can see in the supplemental on Pages 10 and 11, we've expanded our disclosure by illustrating Records Management volume trends by segments. As you can see, we've achieved positive volume growth of 1.2% in North America, 5.4% in Western Europe and 12.9% in the Other International segments, reporting global Records Management net volume growth of 3.5%. We continue to experience strong organic growth, with first quarter total year-on-year volume growth of 1.9% excluding acquisitions. Underlying this growth is the stable incoming volume from existing customers, who added approximately 30 million gross cubic feet of storage in the last 12 months which is consistent with prior periods. 
Let's now turn to our financial performance by segments. North America Records and Information Management, or RIM, delivered positive storage rental internal growth and expanded OIBDA margins by more than 300 basis points during the first quarter. This expansion in adjusted OIBDA margins was driven by a decline in overhead costs, as we continue to execute on our speed and agility efforts. 
North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of 5.2% in the first quarter. However, service declined by 5.9% as DM tape management becomes more archival. During the first quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA declined to 52.7%, partly as a result of the new product launches related to our restoration assurance program and other initiatives that Bill covered in his remarks. We believe these will prove very positive investments for the longer term. 
The Western Europe segment generated solid results, with 3.7% storage rental internal growth which is partially offset by a decline of 2.6% in internal service revenue. The Western Europe business is similar to North America in its level of market maturity. However, there are certain countries within this segment where we don't have a strong leadership position which in turn, results in profit margins that are lower than North American margins, although returns are still well above required hurdle rates. 
In addition, it's important to note that the Western Europe segment includes head office costs which reduces our adjusted OIBDA margins. Excluding the head office costs, the margin in this segment would be in the mid to high 30% range. Adjusted OIBDA margin percentages remained stable in the first quarter despite the decline in service revenues, although absolute dollar-adjusted OIBDA fell primarily as the result of FX headwinds. 
The Other International segments which is made up of emerging markets and Australia, had strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 11.1% and service internal growth was 6.8%. We expect adjusted OIBDA for this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the high teens to low-20s range as we continue to expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets. Adjusted OIBDA for the first quarter was impacted by FX headwinds and integration costs. 
Historical data to Other International on a full year basis will be available on our amended 10-K which will be filed in the short term. 
As I mentioned at the outset, our outlook for 2015 remains consistent with the guidance we provided in February during our fourth quarter earnings call. In addition, at this time, our guidance doesn't reflect the benefit or impact of the potential Recall transaction. Business trends and operating fundamentals remain consistent. Operationally, we remain on track to deliver our long-term financial objectives, given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. That said, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to impact our reported results. However, we believe that we will remain within the ranges of our guidance. 
As a reminder, our guidance includes an expectation of roughly 12% decline in reported non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue for 2015 relative to FX rates in place in 2014. Revenues outside the U.S. make up 40% of total worldwide revenue. As a result, we expect the FX impact on total revenue for 2015 to be 4% to 5%. 
Lastly, although there is no seasonality to our quarters, there is typically a moderate ramp in revenue performance as the year progresses. Our strong cash flow continues to support our dividend at current levels, and we expect our dividends to grow in line with operating performance. Our estimate for cash available for distribution and discretionary investment for 2015 remains $470 million which gives us ample dividend coverage and the ability to fund a portion of our core growth investments. 
As we've previously said, we expect to fund discretionary investments, including real estate and acquisitions through external funding, whether through equity or borrowings. 
Shifting to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had liquidity of more than $780 million. Quarter end, our lease adjusted ratio was 5.5x as planned. At Monday's stock price, our debt to total market capitalization is roughly 38%, in line with major REIT averages. 
Turning now to REIT-specific metrics. As we begin to accelerate consolidation of facilities and execute on our real estate purchase plan, we expect to increase a portion of owned facilities by square footage. We continue to achieve strong storage NOI or approximately $27 per rack square foot worldwide which compares favorably to NOI per square foot for most property types within the REIT sector. 
Our racking and building utilization rates are high at 91% and 83%, respectively for the Records Management portfolio. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90s. When we enter into a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about 3 years' time. We added a new page to the supplemental, Page 32 which highlights our investments for racking projects in process, building developments and building acquisitions on major geographic region, their total expected return and anticipated returns. We will continue to enhance our disclosure as we move forward through the year. 
Lastly, similar to prior quarters, we are providing components of value, a summary of the various parts of our business to facilitate valuation. As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA excluding rent expense in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis whether leased or owned. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities area. In an effort to ensure transparency to our shareholders, we will continue to enhance our supplemental disclosure and provide more details to help you better understand our business and its underlying fundamentals. As always, we welcome your feedback. Operator, with that, we will now take questions."

We are pleased to be recording solid second quarter results that were in line with our expectations on a constant-currency basis and underscore the durability of our core business. Despite the FX headwinds,",2089,"Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be recording solid second quarter results that were in line with our expectations on a constant-currency basis and underscore the durability of our core business. Despite the FX headwinds, we are comfortable maintaining our guidance for 2015 as we typically see a bit of a ramp in the second half of the year. 
It was a very eventful quarter, with the announcement of our agreement to acquire Recall Holdings and the initiation to our transformation plans, which will drive up to improve significant improvement in our overhead cost structure and support strong cash flow generation in years to come even prior to the substantial and additional synergies we anticipate from our acquisition of Recall.
I'll get to the last 2 items shortly, but first, I'd like to briefly cover certain financial and operating highlights.  Our momentum in the storage rental business continues to build and drive durable results in line with our strategic plan. On a constant dollar basis, total revenue growth for the quarter was 2.2%, reflecting continued solid storage rental gains of 4.1% and service revenue declines of just 0.6%. Foreign currency impact year-over-year in total revenue by roughly 6%, reflecting the strong appreciation of the dollar experienced at this time in 2014.
We also continued to see good internal growth with storage rental up 2.7% for the quarter and 2.9% for the year-to-date, reflecting continued strong growth from Data Management, or DM, and the other International segment, and stable performance in Western Europe and North America RIM. As we look at the remainder of the year, we are seeing consistent trends and are maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth for 2015 in the mid-2% range. The realignment of our Data Management business we initiated last year is yielding good results. DM storage continue to show very strong internal growth with a 5.3% increase over last year.
Total service revenue internal growth was flat for the quarter and down just 0.5 year-to-date in line with our expectations for continued yet moderating topline headwinds. 
Looking at volume in Records Management, we added roughly 14 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a trailing 12-month basis, representing 2.8% net growth. This growth was obtained in part as a result of a significant turnaround we are continuing to achieve in North America from negative to positive internal volume growth, or in other words, before benefit from acquisitions.
Net volume growth in North America was 1.2% or 0.4% on an internal basis, excluding acquisitions in line with Q1 levels.
Globally, we maintained customer retention of 98%, in line with the first quarter and a 20% improvement over the level of customer turnover experienced just 2 years ago.
Now turning to our transformation overhead optimization program we announced in June prior to the Recall acquisition news. We spoke with many of you about this over the past several weeks and highlighted how our reorganization in April in which we put a single leader over our developed markets has facilitated this important program.
This initiative calls for taking $100 million out of overhead costs or SG&A between now and 2018 and is independent of and additive to the Recall acquisition. This will bring us from our current overhead of a more than 28% of total revenue, down to the mid-20% range and more in keeping with best practices for companies of similar size and global reach.
Importantly, we have already implemented a portion of this program and achieved $50 million of cost reduction or half of these savings with a charge to be taken in Q3 and the full benefit of a $50 million to be realized in 2016. With the partial year contribution from this program, we expect the net impact for 2015 to be neutral.
Also in recent send communications, we've illustrated how the decline in our service margins over the past few years, and more recently, FX headwinds have offset the attractive returns we achieved from investment in real estate and acquisitions.
In fact, during this period, we have been achieving unlevered returns on invested growth capital in the low-teens and have seen significant contribution flow through in the past couple of years. We initiated some programs last year and are continuing to implement changes that we believe will allows us to stabilize the service margin trend line and get back to around 27% by the end of the year. 
It is important to keep this in perspective. While service represents 40% of our total revenue, today, it represents just 17% of our total gross profit. Again, to be clear, we are talking about a slowdown in the activity of feasible records and tapes being retrieved, not a slowdown in incoming volume of records and tapes to be stored.
Whilst the demand for typical office cut sheet paper has declined between 2% and 4% in mature markets in the past few years, we continue to see the same number of offices being inbounded from our existing customers year-after-year, demonstrating the durability of the storage rental business. We do continue to expect service revenue headwinds of negative 1% to negative 2% annually over the next few years, and in fact, we did see flat service revenue this quarter compared to a year-ago period. And whilst we can't completely offset the impact of the lower service revenues due to a decline in retrieval and refile and transportation activity, we can do more to align our service cost structure with this decrease in activity levels.
So what are we doing to address this service margin decline? First, we are looking at ways to verbalize more of our cost. Second, we are exploring efforts to make more efficient use of third-party logistics suppliers or 3PLs, where we can be assured they will maintain our quality and focus on secure chain of custody. We have used this in Europe on the smallest scale, and we believe we can extend the use of 3PLs elsewhere. And thirdly, we are using technology more proactively such as using sensors to detect when shred bins are ready to be emptied to make routes more efficient.
Additionally, in this quarter, we have seen an uptick in our bad debt. This has come out of our North American business, and is primarily the result of refining our billing process over the past 18 to 24 months. During this transition, we didn't adequately refine the process before moving responsibility for the North American billing offshore. There is now a robust plan in place addressing this. 
Now let's turn to the Recall transaction. This deal is extremely compelling in terms of industrial logic and strategic fit, and is supported by meaningful synergies that drives significant accretion. I assume by now you are familiar with the basic terms of the deal, so I won't review all the information, but rather just touch upon the highlights.
In the announcement presentation, we illustrate estimated total net synergies of $155 million with a $110 million of that to be achieved by 2017. These synergies are driven by economies of scale from the combination of infrastructure and overhead, and when fully realized, will lead to double-digit accretion in adjusted EPS, FFO per share and AFFO. At 25% of our size, Recall is managing a similar global platform in terms of country coverage as they are in 24 countries compared to our 36, which drives much of the overhead synergies.
Another benefit of the proposed transaction in the medium term is that it supports our deleveraging strategy. With the additional cash available to us from our transformation plan as well as Recall synergy, we cannot only fund a stable and growing dividend per share, but we also generate the capital we need for growth.
Additionally, we have complementary market platforms with Recall having a more developed presence in the small to medium business, whilst we have more significant presence with the larger enterprise customers. We've been on the road over the past several weeks, and have met with a number of our shareholders as well as Recall's major holders in Australia. And what we are hearing is a universal agreement that our 2 companies are worth more together than they are separately. 
You can see that several Recall shareholders have increased their holdings and appreciate the attractiveness of owning the combined company. Even our most seasoned advisors that noted that they cannot remember a deal that delivered 26% EPS accretion in 3 years time. 
In the next several weeks, we expect to file the shareholder meeting document, seeking approval of the acquisition, which will have additional detail including pro forma results.
Turning back to Iron Mountain, on past calls, we discussed progress in our 3-year strategic plan, which rests on 3 pillars: Getting more from our developed markets, expanding our presence in faster growing emerging markets and continue to explore adjacent opportunities in our emerging business segment. 
Whilst the Recall acquisition and transformation plan have garnered a bit more internal and external attention of late, we continue to make good progress on our base plan, achieving consistent positive storage volume growth in developed markets and completing an organization realignment to put developed markets under common leadership, which enables our ability to implement our latest transformation program, it is well [indiscernible] to accelerate our service margin initiatives. 
Additionally, in Emerging Markets, we continue to progress towards our goal of 16% to total revenue from these markets by the end of next year. We pressed the pause button on acquisitions for a moment to assess some of the transactions in the pipeline might be affected by the Recall acquisition, but we are resuming activity and continued to be pleased with the quality, size and scope of our pipeline.
We've also discussed on recent calls how we have been impacted by the effects of currency translation in terms of absolute earnings and cash impact in U.S. dollars. Whilst FX durability does impact the absolute dollars we report, the impact on our growth and adjusted OIBDA margins is muted because most of our expenses are denominated in local currency, thereby creating a natural hedge. 
On the other hand, we continue to believe that the current strong dollars are positive in terms of investment opportunity. Given our intent to expand what it is today a relatively small international base, we believe we can create significant value over time by investing selectively in these higher growth markets using strong U.S. dollars during this part of the currency cycle.
This may take the form of M&A or in the purchase or development of real estate. In both cases, we can benefit from investing at a low basis. 
In addition, we have deepened our focus in the real estate investment area, adding an experienced REIT asset manager to accelerate our plan to buy $700 million to $1 billion of our leased facilities over the next 8 to 10 years.
As we seek to shift our mix to a higher percentage of owned property, on average, we are achieving a spread of roughly 150 basis points between our going in cap rates and our market cap rates, whilst positioning ourselves to capture long term residual value from ownership. We think this is important and appropriate as a REIT as has been viewed more in line with traditional REIT by our rating agencies and investors. Importantly, our debt to total market cap and our debt-to-EBITDA measures are in line with major REIT sector leaders, and our internal storage rental revenue fared better than these sectors during the recent recession when we did not have a down year. 
Our low volatility business is distinguished by a track record of 26 years of consecutive growth in storage rental revenue. 
As we think about the opportunities to grow our storage rental business, it is important not to lose sight of the durability of the business, which is underpinned by roughly $1.5 billion of net operating income from our storage business alone. This amount of NOI is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self storage sectors. As we've noticed in recent calls, the restructure is consistent with our capital allocation goals. It does not limit our ability to fund our business plan as we become more active in buying in our properties and executing on our acquisition pipeline, we expect to fund that incremental investment with excess cash flow or additional borrowing. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rod."

Our results continue to demonstrate the durability of our storage rental revenue stream and the underlying strength of our business fundamentals. Our performance is tracking in line with our full year expectations.
To frame my remarks, I'll begin today with an overview of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, including a review of results by segment. Then I will address plans and expectations related to our transformation program and our initiative to improve service gross margins. I will briefly touch on the Recall acquisition costs and also our outlook for 2015, which remains unchanged since June on a constant dollar basis. Finally, I will address other metrics through a REIT lens. 
Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. Referring now to Pages 8 and 9 of our supplemental. Total reported revenues were $760 million compared to $787 million in Q2 of 2014, down by 3.5% year-over-year. This reflects the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which impacted total revenues by approximately 5.7% or $44 million. Excluding FX and so on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 2.2%. 
Year-to-date reported revenues were $1.51 billion compared with $1.56 billion in 2014, again on a constant dollar basis, [indiscernible] our total total revenue growth was also 2.2%.
Worldwide revenues were driven by solid constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of 4.1% for the quarter and 4.3% year-to-date. This was offset by service revenue declines of roughly 1% for the quarter and year-to-date.
As we did for the prior quarter, we are providing bridging schedules for revenue, OIBIDA and earnings which explains key variances on a year-on-year performance. These are on Pages 20 to 22 of the supplemental.
Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $223 million compared with $242 million in 2014, down 7.7% on a reported basis and 3.3% on a constant dollar basis. The constant dollar adjusted OIBDA decline was driven by investments in new product introductions, for example, in Data Management. In addition, we had a $4 million increase in debt expense. As Bill mentioned, during the offshore in our billing activities, our collection efforts fell behind. However, we now have a strong remediation in place. 
Service margin declines were further driving the business, although these were offset by improvements in storage contributions. Adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.28 per diluted share compared with $0.41 in the second quarter 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-over-year is driven by a 10% increase in share count related to the special distribution which we made in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
In addition to the earlier OIBDA breakdown, adjusted EPS was also impacted by an increase in interest expense related to high levels of debt. As stated in our earlier calls, this year-over-year increase in borrowings was driven primarily by REIT-converting related expenses such as A&P and the depreciation and amortization recapture payments. 
On the subject to of debt, please note that it is our intent to refinance our high coupon debt when conditions allow. Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out to 13.9% compared with 15% in the prior quarter, primarily as a result of a mix change in income from foreign jurisdictions. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% over the long term. 
Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share is $0.48 for the quarter and $0.98 year-to-date. While adjusted funds from operations or AFFO was $130 million for the quarter and $255 million year-to-date.
Let me now turn to Records Management volume trends on Pages 10 and 11. As you can see, we achieved positive volume growth of 1.2% in North America, 3% in Western Europe and 9.7% in the other International segment, delivering global Records Management net volume growth of 2.8%.
We continue to experience strong organic growth with second quarter total year-on-year volume growth of 1.8% excluding acquisitions. Underlying this growth is the stable incoming volume from existing customers. We continue to add approximately $30 million gross cubic feet of storage in the last 12 months, consistent with prior periods. 
Let's now turn to our financial performance by segment. In North American Management and Information or RIM, internal storage rental revenue was flat for the second quarter. Year-to-date North American RIM internal storage rental revenue grew by 0.2%. Internal service revenue growth showed a small improvement in Q2 with a decline of 1.3% compared to a decline of 1.8% in Q1. Adjusted OIBIDA margins in RIM remained solid at 39.4% for the quarter and 40.2% year-to-date. 
North American Data Management delivered storage rental internal growth of 5.3% in both the second quarter and year-to-date. Our service declined by 1.7% for the quarter and 3.8% year-to-date as we continue to see declines in refile and transportation activity. 
During the second quarter, DM adjusted OIBIDA declined to 50.8% from 52.7% to Q1 as we continue to invest in new products.
The Western Europe segment generated solid results with 3.5% storage rental internal growth for the quarter and 3.6% year-to-date. This growth was partially offset by declines in internal service revenue, 4.8% for the quarter and 3.7% year-to-date. The decline in service revenue was driven mostly by the sale of our shred business in the U.K. and Ireland towards the end of last year. Adjusted OIBDA margins were declined in Western Europe this quarter due to legal costs related to the customer disputes word.
The Other international segment, which is made up of Emerging Markets and Australia, showed strong growth in both the storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 11.5% for the quarter and 11.3% year-to-date. The service internal growth is 13.5% for the quarter and 10.2% year-to-date. 
This quarter, Emerging Markets revenues represented approximately 14% of our total revenues on a constant dollar basis. We expect adjusted OIBIDA for the segment to deliver profitability on portfolio basis in the high-teens, the low '20s range, as we continue to expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets. 
As Bill mentioned, we're leveraging our new leadership structure to focus on integrating cost across developed markets. Through our transformation program, which was announced last month, we expect to achieve approximately $100 million in production and overhead expense by 2018. Actions we have taken this month were expected to yield a full-year $50 million benefit in 2016. We will see partial benefits this year at the end of the year. However, these will be offset by severance related charges. We are anticipating approximately $10 million of severance-related expenses in the third quarter as a result of this program. 
Let's now discuss our initiatives to maintain and enhance service gross margins. As Bill outlined, the decline in service gross margin has act as a drag to our performance in the last 4 years, partially masking the strong returns that we're seeing from investments in real estate and M&A. That said, it should also be remembered that on a constant dollar basis, we have seen good improvements in overall contribution year-on-year in 2014, and we expect the same in 2015. 
As discussed earlier and as you can see in the supplemental on Page 26, in the second quarter, service gross margins have declined year-over-year. The actions we are now taking are not yet reflected in our results. During the second half of the year, we expect to see an improvement in service margins and continues to target the year end run rate of about 27%.
Let's touch on the Recall acquisition briefly. As Bill mentioned, we're making good progress with the regulatory refilings. To prepare for closing, we incurred approximately $6 million professional and advisory fees this quarter. We expect about $10 million to $15 million of additional spend in each of the third and fourth quarters of this year. 
In addition to these advisory fees, we are expecting approximately $20 million to $25 million charge in the second half of the year to prepare for integration, including Recall's REIT conversion.
Please note that these costs will be excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation because they are onetime in nature. These costs were also included in our guidance related to the Recall acquisition when we announced the deal.
As I mentioned at the onset, our outlook for 2015 remains consistent with the guidance we provided in June when we announced the definitive agreements to acquire Recall. Please note that at this time, our guidance doesn't reflect the benefit or impact of the potential Recall transaction. We will provide detailed guidance for 2016 and beyond at our upcoming Investor Day in October. 
For 2015, although we expect revenue to be as anticipated on a constant dollar basis for the full year, given FX movements, we expect reported dollar revenues to be towards the lower end of our range. As regards to other metrics for both constant and reported dollars, we expect them to be well within our ranges. 
Our strong cash flow continues to support our dividend at current levels in 2015, and we intend to maintain our dividend per share rates for the remainder of the year, subject to Board approval. Our estimate for cash available for distribution and discretionary investment for 2015 remains $470 million, giving us ample dividend coverage and the ability to fund our core real estate investments or growth racking with support approximately 2% organic growth in our adjusted OIBDA.
For 2016 and beyond, assuming the Recall acquisition closes and with the transformation benefits, we have excess cash that can support potential growth in the dividend and/or fun discretionary investments in real estate, M&A and emerging business opportunities. These investments achieved returns above and [indiscernible] and are accretive to shareholders. 
To sum up, we have adequate dividend coverage, excess capacity and attractive investment options.
Shifting to the balance sheet, at quarter end, we have liquidity of approximately $750 million. At quarter end, our lease adjusted debt ratio was 5.7x at as expected.
Turning now to REIT-specific metrics. We continue to achieve strong storage NOI of approximately $28 per rack square-foot worldwide, which compares favorably to NOI per square-foot for most property types within the REIT sector.
Our racking and billing utilization rates are high at 91% and 84% respectively, for the records management portfolio. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90s. When we enter a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about 3 years time. 
Investment page, Page 32 of the supplemental, highlights our investments for racking projects, process building developments and building acquisitions by major geographic region, their total expected investments and anticipated NOI and returns. Please note that these investments represent growth-related investments and exclude consolidation-related spend. As you can see on this page, we achieved high returns in our growth racking and building development projects. 
Lastly, similar to prior quarters, we are providing [indiscernible] value. A summary of metrics of our business to facilitate valuation.
As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA excluding rent expense in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis whether the facilities are leased or owned. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities area. 
Overall, we believe this was a solid quarter, and we're pleased with the momentum we continue to see in the business. We remain on track to deliver our guidance for 2015. 
Looking ahead, we continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by extending the durability of our storage rental business, improving service margins, achieving overhead cost reductions through our transformation program and realizing the synergy benefits of the Recall acquisition. 
And that concludes my summary for the Q2 financials."

So I think, first of all, you need to start to talk that we are starting from a base where our SG&A is 28% of sales, which is clearly on the upper end of what the company with our scale and scope should be able to achieve. It should -- a company our scale and scope should be in the, let' say, the mid-20s, I think probably the lower side of the mid-20s. In other words, it's probably kind of more the 23% to 25% range is where a company of our size and complexity should be. So that is the first thing to give you kind of a sense of what's possible. And then the thing that triggers is it there's really, if you think about it, there are, I would say, 3 buckets. 1 is just getting efficiency through the reorganization. So when we put all the developed markets under 1 person, then it allows you to rationalize, you have 2 finance groups, you have 2 HR groups, you have 2 commercial leadership groups, you have 2 engineering groups, et cetera. So you are able to actually shrink that's 1 to get some of the efficiencies and economies of scale that you would expect. I think, the second aspect of it is looking at what we call just general spans and layers. Probably it's triggered by that move, but just saying what is the right breadth of responsibility in the organization? Do we have too many layers? And I think that's just good housekeeping that all companies our size need to go through every [indiscernible]  And to make sure we don't have what I would call organizational creep or layers building into the organization. And to me, that's important, not just from a cost standpoint, but it's also important from a dynamic standpoint. And I mean by dynamic is to be quicker, nimble, more nimble, less bureaucratic. So I think that's a  -- it shows up in the cost line, but we also expect that to show up in the revenue line. And then the third aspect is it's related a little bit to the aging of some of our receivable slip, which led to a bad debt charge. Is that we need to look at our processes, first and foremost, in terms of how can we make those more efficient. And then where should those be done? Should they be done internally? Should they be done internally offshore? Or should they be done by an outside party? And that's the third bucket that we're going through is that both optimize those processes and then figure out where the they should be done either by Iron Mountain or by an outside vendor. And that's kind of the 3 buckets that we're going through. And then lastly, you can imagine we're actually using also some outside help that have done this a number of times. So we feel very confident in terms of the targets. We feel very confident that we are doing this in areas that doesn't impact the customer experience and service level. And in fact, I think, our expectation is that it should improve as we look to make the organization quicker, more nimble and less bureaucratic."

But I think if you look at the results that we're getting, as you can see -- I mean, I think, the way we look at it in a couple of ways is we're getting, I would say, purely regular yet modest price increase that offsets the inflation that the low inflation levels. But I think as I said I think a number of times on calls is that in the low inflation environment, price increases are more challenging. I think, the other thing to look at it is if you look at what's been happening to our gross margins associated with storage, you can see that actually -- there's a slight uptick. So that gives you a view that low inflation, obviously, we have wage inflation that is still a real in terms of what we pay our folks. But we're able to get both productivity increases and pricing increases that allows us to even maintain or slightly enhance our gross margins. So we feel pretty good in terms of what we are getting in terms of pricing. It is something that we continue to work on. I think, I told you we brought somebody in about a year ago just our new leader for the pricing group, that seems to be getting some good contraction. But I also think it's important to understand that in a low inflation environment, these are small numbers that you're dealing, but you're not dealing with large order of magnitude.

So one of the areas we publicized is that we have a partnership with EMC that offers both their customers and our customers a joint -- it's kind of a combination of our data center, our tape business and EMCs data domain business, which is a data center replication hardware offering they have. And there is an investment associated with standing up to those new products. Our expectation, the reason why we didn't bridge that, is you could say that that was a one-off for this quarter.

But if you actually -- when we look at the performance as part of the improvement program, if we talk about the May month, May was the specifically week month for us in terms of service margin and profitability. We took the month of May out. We would have a 26.1% service margin in this quarter, which is still 100 basis points, but we know how to bridge that gap. And even if we looked at May, some of the things that we are introducing, it gets better to manage it. So the month of May was particularly soft, really 2 things. One is realizing some of our costs quick enough associated with a normal downtick in revenue because there is some seasonality and revenue on plus it was a short month. But in terms of the way the holiday fell. So those 2 things, which is part of our program. If you remember our three-prong approach to this is realizing our cost space more, which is the month of May is a great example in terms of what the program is designed to offset.

We are pleased to be reporting solid second quarter results that were in line with our expectations on a constant-currency basis and underscore the durability of our core business. Despite the FX headwinds,",2093,"Thank you, Melissa. And good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be reporting solid second quarter results that were in line with our expectations on a constant-currency basis and underscore the durability of our core business. Despite the FX headwinds, we are comfortable maintaining our guidance for 2015 as we typically see a bit of a ramp in the second half of the year.
It was a very eventful quarter, with the announcement of our agreement to acquire Recall Holdings and the initiation of our Transformation plan, which will drive significant improvement in our overhead cost structure and support strong cash flow generation in years to come, even prior to the substantial and additional synergies we anticipate from our acquisition of Recall.
I'll get to the last 2 items shortly. But first, I'd like to briefly cover certain financial and operating highlights. Our momentum in the storage rental business continues to build and drive durable results in line with our strategic plan. On a constant dollar basis, total revenue growth for the quarter was 2.2%, reflecting continued solid storage rental gains of 4.1% and service revenue declines of just 0.6%. Foreign currency impact year-over-year in total revenue by roughly 6%, reflecting the strong appreciation of the dollar experienced since this time in 2014.
We also continued to see good internal growth, with storage rental up 2.7% for the quarter and 2.9% for the year-to-date, reflecting continued strong growth from Data Management or DM and the Other International segment and stable performance in Western Europe and North America RIM. 
As we look at the remainder of the year, we are seeing consistent trends and are maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth for 2015 in the mid-2% range. The realignment of our Data Management business we initiated last year is yielding good results. DM storage continue to show very strong internal growth, with a 5.3% increase over last year.
Total service revenue internal growth was flat for the quarter and down just 0.5 year-to-date in line with our expectations for continued yet moderating top line headwinds.
Looking at volume in Records Management, we added roughly 14 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a trailing 12-month basis, representing 2.8% net growth. This growth was obtained in part as a result of the significant turnaround we are continuing to achieve in North America from negative to positive internal volume growth or, in other words, before benefit from acquisitions.
Net volume growth in North America was 1.2% or 0.4% on an internal basis, excluding acquisitions, in line with Q1 levels.
Globally, we maintained customer retention of 98%, in line with the first quarter and a 20% improvement over the level of customer turnover experienced just 2 years ago.
Now turning to our Transformation overhead optimization program we announced in June prior to the Recall acquisition news. We've spoken with many of you about this over the past several weeks and highlighted how our organ -- reorganization in April, in which we put a single leader over our developed markets, has facilitated this important program. This initiative calls for taking $100 million out of overhead costs or SG&A between now and 2018 and is independent of and additive to the Recall acquisition. This will bring us from our current overhead of a more than 28% of total revenue down to the mid-20% range and more in keeping with best practices for companies of similar size and global reach.
Importantly, we have already implemented a portion of this program and achieved $50 million of cost reduction or half of these savings, with a charge to be taken in Q3 and the full benefit of the $50 million to be realized in 2016. With the partial year contribution from this program, we expect the net impact for 2015 to be neutral.
Also in recent communications, we've illustrated how the decline in our service margins over the past few years and, more recently, FX headwinds have offset the attractive returns we achieved from investment in real estate and acquisitions.
In fact, during this period, we have been achieving unlevered returns on invested growth capital in the low-teens and have seen significant contribution flow-through in the past couple of years. We initiated some programs last year and are continuing to implement changes that we believe will allows us to stabilize the service margin trend line and get back to around 27% by the end of the year.
It is important to keep this in perspective. While service represents 40% of our total revenue, today, it represents just 17% of our total gross profit. Again, to be clear, we are talking about a slowdown in the activity of physical records and tapes being retrieved, not a slowdown in incoming volume of records and tapes to be stored.
Whilst the demand for typical office cut sheet paper has declined between 2% and 4% in mature markets in the past few years, we continue to see the same number of boxes being inbounded from our existing customers year-after-year, demonstrating the durability of the storage rental business. 
We do continue to expect service revenue headwinds of negative 1% to negative 2% annually over the next few years. And in fact, we did see flat service revenue this quarter compared to a year-ago period. And whilst we can't completely offset the impact of lower service revenues due to a decline in retrieval and refile in transportation activity, we can do more to align our service cost structure with this decrease in activity levels.
So what are we doing to address this service margin decline? First, we are looking at ways to variable-ize more of our costs. Second, we are exploring efforts to make more efficient use of third party logistics suppliers or 3PLs, where we can be assured they will maintain our quality and focus on secure chain of custody. We have used this in Europe on a smaller scale and believe we can expand the use of 3PLs elsewhere. And third, we are using technology more proactively such as using sensors to detect when shred bins are already -- are ready to be emptied to make routes more efficient.
Additionally, in this quarter, we have seen an uptick in our bad debt. This has come out of our North American business and is primarily the result of refining our billing process over the past 18 to 24 months. During this transition, we didn't adequately refine the process before moving responsibility for the North American billing offshore. There is now a robust plan in place addressing this.
Now let's turn to the Recall transaction. This deal is extremely compelling in terms of industrial logic and strategic fit and is supported by meaningful synergies that drive significant accretion. I assume by now you are familiar with the basic terms of the deal, so I won't review all the information and rather just touch upon the highlights.
In the announcement presentation, we illustrate estimated total net synergies of $155 million, with $110 million of that to be achieved by 2017. These synergies are driven by economies of scale from the combination of infrastructure and overhead and, when fully realized, will lead to double-digit accretion in adjusted EPS, FFO per share and AFFO. At 25% of our size, Recall is managing a similar global platform in terms of country coverage as they are in 24 countries compared to our 36, which drives much of the overhead synergies.
Another benefit of the proposed transaction in the medium term is that it supports our deleveraging strategy. With the additional cash available to us from our Transformation plan as well as Recall synergies, we cannot only fund a stable and growing dividend per share, but we also generate the capital we need for growth.
Additionally, we have complementary market platforms, with Recall having a more developed presence in the small to medium business, whilst we have more significant presence with the larger enterprise customers. 
We've been on the road over the past several weeks and have met with a number of our shareholders as well as Recall's major holders in Australia. And what we're hearing is a universal agreement that our 2 companies are worth more together than they are separately. You can see that several Recall shareholders have increased their holdings and appreciate the attractiveness of owning the combined company. Even our most seasoned advisers have noted that they cannot remember a deal that delivered 26% EPS accretion in 3 years time.
In the next several weeks, we expect to file the shareholder meeting document seeking approval of the acquisition, which will have additional detail including pro forma results.
Turning back to Iron Mountain. On past calls, we've discussed progress on our 3-year strategic plan which rests on 3 pillars: Getting more from our developed markets, expanding our presence in faster growing emerging markets and continuing to explore adjacent opportunities in our Emerging business segment.
Whilst Recall -- whilst the Recall acquisition and Transformation plan have garnered a bit more internal and external attention of late, we continue to make good progress on our base plan, achieving consistent positive storage volume growth in developed markets and completing an organizational realignment to put developed markets under common leadership, which enables our ability to implement our latest Transformation program as well as to accelerate our service margin initiatives.
Additionally, in Emerging Markets, we continue to progress towards our goal of 16% of total revenue from these markets by the end of next year. We pressed the pause button on acquisitions for a moment to assess how some of the transactions in the pipeline might be affected by the Recall acquisition, but we are resuming activity and continue to be pleased with the quality, size and scope of our pipeline.
We've also discussed on recent calls how we have been impacted by the effects of currency translation in terms of absolute earnings and cash impact in U.S. dollars. Whilst FX durability does impact the absolute dollars we report, the impact on our growth and adjusted OIBDA margins is muted because most of our expenses are denominated in local currency, thereby creating a natural hedge. 
On the other hand, we continue to believe that the current strong dollar is positive in terms of investment opportunity. Given our intent to expand what it is today a relatively small international base, we believe we can create significant value over time by investing selectively in these higher growth markets using strong U.S. dollars during this part of the currency cycle. This may take the form of M&A or in the purchase or development of real estate. In both cases, we can benefit from investing at a low basis.
In addition, we have deepened our focus in the real estate investment area, adding an experienced REIT asset manager to accelerate our plan to buy $700 million to $1 billion of our leased facilities over the next 8 to 10 years. 
As we seek to shift our mix to a higher percentage of owned properties, on average, we are achieving a spread of roughly 150 basis points between our going in cap rates and our market cap rates, whilst positioning ourselves to capture long-term residual value from ownership. We think this is important and appropriate as a REIT, as it supports us being viewed more in line with traditional REITs by the rating agencies and investors. Importantly, our debt to total market cap and our debt-to-EBITDA measures are in line with major REIT sector leaders, and our internal storage rental revenue fared better than these sectors during the recent recession when we did not have a down year. Our low volatility business is distinguished by a track record of 26 years of consecutive growth in storage rental revenue.
As we think about the opportunities to grow our storage rental business, it is important not to lose sight of the durability of the business, which is underpinned by roughly $1.5 billion of net operating income from our storage business alone. This amount of NOI is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self storage sectors. As we've noticed in recent calls, the restructure is consistent with our capital allocation goals. It does not limit our ability to fund our business plan as we become more active in buying in our properties and executing on our execution -- acquisition pipeline. We expect to fund that incremental investment with excess cash flow or additional borrowing.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rod."

Our results continue to demonstrate the durability of our storage rental revenue stream and the underlying strength of our business fundamentals. Our performance is tracking in line with our full year expectations.
To frame my remarks, I'll begin today with an overview of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, including a review of results by segment. Then, I will address plans and expectations related to our Transformation program and our initiative to improve service gross margins. I will briefly touch on the Recall acquisition costs and also our outlook for 2015, which remains unchanged since June on a constant dollar basis. Finally, I will address other metrics through a REIT lens.
Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. Referring now to Pages 8 and 9 of our supplemental. Total reported revenues were $760 million compared with $787 million in Q2 of 2014, down by 3.5% year-over-year. This reflects the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which impacted total revenues by approximately 5.7% or $44 million. Excluding FX, and so on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 2.2%.
Year-to-date reported revenues were $1.51 billion compared with $1.56 billion in 2014. Again, on a constant dollar basis, first half total revenue growth was also 2.2%.
Worldwide revenues were driven by solid constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of 4.1% for the quarter and 4.3% year-to-date. This was offset by service revenue declines of roughly 1% for the quarter and year-to-date.
As we did for the prior quarter, we are providing bridging schedules for revenue, OIBDA and earnings which explain key variances on year-on-year performance. These are on Pages 20 to 22 of the supplemental.
Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $223 million compared with $242 million in 2014, down 7.7% on a reported basis and 3.3% on a constant dollar basis. The constant dollar adjusted OIBDA decline was driven by investments in new product introductions, for example, in Data Management. 
In addition, we had a $4 million increase in bad debt expense. As Bill mentioned, during the offshoring of our billing activities, our collection efforts fell behind. However, we now have a strong remediation in place.
Service margin declines were a further drag on the business, although these were offset by improvements in storage contribution. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.28 per diluted share compared with $0.41 in the second quarter of 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-over-year is driven by a 10% increase in share count related to the special distribution which we made in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
In addition to the earlier OIBDA breakdown, adjusted EPS was also impacted by an increase in interest expense related to high levels of debt. As stated in our earlier calls, this year-over-year increase in borrowings was driven primarily by REIT conversion-related expenses such as EMP purge and the depreciation amortization recapture payments.
On the subject of debt, please note that it is our intent to refinance our high coupon debt when conditions allow. 
Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out to 13.9% compared with 15% in the prior quarter, primarily as a result of mix change in income from foreign jurisdictions. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% over the long-term.
Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share is $0.48 for the quarter and $0.98 year-to-date, while adjusted funds from operations or AFFO was $130 million for the quarter and $255 million year-to-date.
Let me now turn to Records Management volume trends on Pages 10 and 11. As you can see, we achieved positive volume growth of 1.2% in North America, 3% in Western Europe and 9.7% in the Other International segment, delivering global Records Management net volume growth of 2.8%.
We continue to experience strong organic growth, with second quarter total year-on-year volume growth of 1.8%, excluding acquisitions. Underlying this growth is the stable incoming volume from existing customers. We continue to add approximately $30 million gross cubic feet of storage in the last 12 months, consistent with prior periods.
Let's now turn to our financial performance by segment. In North American Records Management and Information or RIM, internal storage rental revenue was flat for the second quarter. Year-to-date North American RIM internal storage rental revenue grew by 0.2%. Internal service revenue growth showed a small improvement in Q2 with a decline of 1.3% compared to a decline of 1.8% in Q1. Adjusted OIBDA margins in RIM remained solid at 39.4% for the quarter and 42 -- 40.2% year-to-date.
North American Data Management delivered storage rental internal growth of 5.3% in both the second quarter and year-to-date, although service declined by 1.7% for the quarter and 3.8% year-to-date as we continue to see declines in refile and transportation activity.
During the second quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA declined to 50.8% from 52.7% in Q1 as we continue to invest in new products.
The Western Europe segment generated solid results, with 3.5% storage rental internal growth for the quarter and 3.6% year-to-date. This growth was partially offset by declines in internal service revenue, 4.8% for the quarter and 3.7% year-to-date. The decline in service revenue was driven mostly by the sale of our shred business in the U.K. and Ireland towards the end of last year. Adjusted OIBDA margins declined in Western Europe this quarter due to legal costs related to customer disputes.
The Other International segment, which is made up of Emerging Markets and Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 11.5% for the quarter and 11.3% year-to-date and service internal growth was 13.5% for the quarter and 10.2% year-to-date.
This quarter, Emerging Market revenues represented approximately 14% of our total revenues on a constant dollar basis. We expect adjusted OIBDA for this segment to deliver profitability, on a portfolio basis, in the high-teens to low-20s range as we continue to expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets.
As Bill mentioned, we're leveraging our new leadership structure to focus on integrating cross -- costs across developed markets. Through our Transformation program, which was announced last month, we expect to achieve approximately $100 million of reduction in overhead expense by 2018. Actions we have taken this month were expected to yield a full year $50 million benefit in 2016. 
We will see partial benefits this year at the end of the year. However, these will be offset by severance-related charges. We are anticipating approximately $10 million of severance-related expenses in the third quarter as a result of this program.
Let's now discuss our initiatives to maintain and enhance service gross margins. As Bill outlined, the decline in service gross margin has acted as a drag on our performance in the last 4 years, partially masking the strong returns that we're seeing from investments in real estate and M&A. That said, it should also be remembered that on a constant dollar basis, we have seen good improvements in overall contribution year-on-year in 2014, and we expect the same in 2015.
As discussed earlier, and as you can see in the supplemental on Page 26, in the second quarter, service gross margins have declined year-over-year. The actions we are now taking are not yet reflected in our results. But in the second half of the year, we expect to see an improvement in service margins and continues to target a year-end run rate of about 27%.
Let's touch on the Recall acquisition briefly. As Bill mentioned, we're making good progress with regulatory filings. To prepare for closing, we incurred approximately $6 million professional and advisory fees this quarter. We expect about $10 million to $15 million of additional spend in each of the third and fourth quarters of this year.
In addition to these advisory fees, we are expecting approximately $20 million to $25 million charged in the second half of the year to prepare for integration, including Recall's REIT conversion. Please note that these costs will be excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation because they are onetime in nature. These costs were also included in our guidance related to the Recall acquisition when we announced the deal.
As I mentioned at the outset, our outlook for 2015 remains consistent with the guidance we provided in June when we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Recall. Please note that, at this time, our guidance doesn't reflect the benefit or impact of the potential Recall transaction. We will provide detailed guidance for 2016 and beyond at our upcoming Investor Day in October.
For 2015, although we expect revenue to be an -- as anticipated on a constant dollar basis for the full year, given FX movements, we expect reported dollar revenues to be towards the lower end of our range. As regard to other metrics for both constant and reported dollars, we expect them to be well within our ranges.
Our strong cash flow continues to support our dividend at current levels in 2015, and we intend to maintain our dividend per share rates for the remainder of the year, subject to Board approval. Our estimate for cash available for distribution and discretionary investment for 2015 remains $470 million, giving us ample dividend coverage and the ability to fund our core real estate investments or growth racking which support approximately 2% organic growth in our adjusted OIBDA.
For 2016 and beyond, assuming the Recall acquisition closes and with the Transformation benefits, we have excess cash that can support potential growth in the dividend and/or discretion -- and/or fund discretionary investments in real estate, M&A or emerging business opportunities. These investments achieved returns above our whack and are accretive to shareholders. To sum up, we have adequate dividend coverage, excess capacity and attractive investment options.
Shifting to the balance sheet, at quarter-end, we had liquidity of approximately $750 million. At quarter-end, our lease adjusted debt ratio was 5.7x as expected.
Turning now to REIT-specific metrics. We continue to achieve strong storage NOI, approximately $28 per rack square foot worldwide, which compares favorably to NOI per square foot for most property types within the REIT sector.
Our racking and building utilization rates are high at 91% and 84%, respectively, for the Records Management portfolio. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90s. When we enter a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about 3 years time.
Investment page, Page 32 of the supplemental, highlights our investments for racking projects and process building development and building acquisitions by major geographic region, their total expected investment and anticipated NOI and returns. Please note that these investments represent growth-related investments and exclude consolidation-related spend. As you can see on this page, we achieved high returns in our growth racking and building development projects.
Lastly, similar to prior quarters, we are providing components to value, a summary of various metrics of our business to facilitate valuation. As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA excluding rent expense in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis, whether facilities are leased or owned. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities area.
Overall, we believe this was a solid quarter and we're pleased with the momentum we continue to see in the business. We remain on track to deliver our guidance for 2015.
Looking ahead, we continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by extending the durability of our storage rental business, improving service margins, achieving overhead cost reductions through our Transformation program and realizing the synergy benefits of the Recall acquisition.
And that, Bill, concludes my summary for the Q2 financials."

We have actions under way that we expect will stabilize the margins in our service business. 
We are teeing up to close the Recall deal early next year and are organized internally to support the smooth integration of Recall, and our attractive emerging business pipeline is delivering interesting adjacencies that can further extend the durability of our enterprise storage business. 
Finally and most importantly, the strength of our business plus the Transformation program support approximately 11% to 14% growth in the cash we have available already next year to grow our dividend per share over time and fund our growth investment. This is even prior to the Recall acquisition.
With that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

We feel good in terms of what we've done over the last, say, 12 months in terms of, first of all, divesting those shredding operations, the one in Australia, the one in the U.K. where we didn't think we have the scale to get the kind of returns that we expect in demand, whilst separating the U.S. operation to be more of a standalone unit so that it has the right focus and cadence associated with it to achieve the results that we think are possible.

So I think, first of all, you -- we need to start to talk that we are starting from a base where our SG&A is 28% of sales, which is clearly on the upper end of what a company with our scale and scope should be able to achieve.",557,"It's an excellent question. So I think, first of all, you -- we need to start to talk that we are starting from a base where our SG&A is 28% of sales, which is clearly on the upper end of what a company with our scale and scope should be able to achieve. It should -- a company of our scale and scope should be in the, let's say, the mid-20s, and it's probably the lower side of the mid-20s. In other words, you're not -- it's probably kind of more the 23% to 25% range is where a company of our size and complexity should be. So that's the first thing to give you kind of a sense of what's possible. 
Then, the thing that triggers it is there's really, if you think about it, there are, I would say, 3 buckets. One is just getting efficiency through the reorganization. So when we put all the developed markets under one person, then it allows you to rationalize, you have 2 finance groups, you have 2 HR groups, you 2 -- have 2 commercial leadership groups, you have 2 engineering groups, et cetera. So you are able to actually shrink that to one to get some of the efficiencies and economies of scale that you would expect. 
I think the second aspect of it is looking at what we call just general spans and layers. Probably it's triggered by that move, but just saying what is the right breadth of responsibility in the organization? Do we have too many layers? And I think that's just good housekeeping that all companies our size need to go through every so often to make sure that we don't have what I would call organizational creep or layers building into the organization. And to me, that's important not just from a cost standpoint, but it's also important from a dynamic standpoint. I mean, by dynamic is to be quicker, nimble, more nimble, less bureaucratic. So I think that's a  -- it shows up in the cost line, but we also expect that to show up in the revenue line. 
And then, the third aspect is it's related a little bit to the aging of some of our -- aging of our receivable split, which led to a bad debt charge, is that we need to look at our processes, first and foremost, in terms of how can we make those more efficient. And then, where should those be done? Should they be done internally? Should they be done internally offshore? Or should they be done by an outside party? And that's the third bucket that we're going through is to both optimize those processes, and then figure out where they should be done either within Iron Mountain or by an outside vendor. And that's kind of the 3 buckets that we're going through. On that last one, you can imagine we're actually using also some outside help that have done this a number of times. 
So we feel very confident in terms of the targets. We feel very confident that we are doing this in areas that doesn't impact the customer experience and service level. And in fact, I think, our expectation is it should improve it as we look to make the organization quicker, more nimble and less bureaucratic."

We have to go through the regulatory aspect. So I can't comment on how we compare to Recall. 
But I think if you look at the results that we're getting, as you can see -- I mean, I think the way to look at it is a couple of ways, is we're getting, I would say, fairly regular yet modest price increase that offsets the inflation that -- the low inflation levels. But I think, as I've said, I think, a number of times on calls is that in a low inflation environment, price increases are more challenging. 
I think the other thing to look at is if you look with the -- if you look at what's been happening to our gross margins associated with storage, you can see they actually -- there's a slight uptick. So that gives you a view that in a low inflation environment, obviously, we have wage inflation that is still real in terms of what we pay our folks, but we're able to get both productivity increases and pricing increases that allows us to either maintain or slightly enhance our gross margins. 
So we feel pretty good in terms of what we're getting in terms of pricing. It's something that we continue to work on. I think I told you we brought somebody in about a year ago just to -- our new leader for the pricing group, that seems to be getting some good traction. But I also think it's important to understand that in a low inflation environment, it's -- these are small numbers that you're dealing with. You're not dealing with large order of magnitude. But the results are good. I mean, our gross margins are stable and I'd say they're slightly higher than they were a year ago."

And we didn't bridge to that for the reason that you're highlighting right now is we are -- we have made a conscious decision to incur some additional OpEx, which is associated with launching new products in that area. So one of the areas I think we've publicized is that we have a partnership with EMC that offers both their customers and our customers a joint -- it's kind of a combination of our data center, our tape business and EMC's data domain business, which is a data center replication hardware offering they have. And that -- there is an investment associated with standing up those new products. Our expectation -- the reason why we didn't bridge that is you could say that, that was a one-off for this quarter, but our expectation is we will continue to make those kind of investments as we see a pipeline of further products like this one that we've announced publicly with EMC. So I think that's the way I would think about it. So what we have in the bridge was very specific to a product launch that we did this quarter that we really anticipate as a one-off, but we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur some OpEx investment in terms of new product launches."

If we took the month of May out, we would have a 26.1% service margin in the -- in this quarter, which is still 100 basis points, but we know how to bridge that gap. And even when we looked at May, some of the things that we're introducing, we -- gets us better to manage it. So the month of May was particularly soft for really 2 things, was one is variable-izing some of our costs quick enough associated with a normal downtick in revenue because there is some seasonality in revenue, and plus it was a short month, but -- in terms of the way the holidays fell. So those 2 things that -- which is part of our program. If you remember our 3-pronged approach to this is variable-izing our cost base more, which -- the month of May is a great example in terms of what that program is designed to offset.

As we have done for the last few quarters, we've posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at ironmountain.com under Investor Relations/Financial Information.
Referring now to Page 2 of the supplemental. Today's earnings call and supplemental package do contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2015 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's supplemental, the safe harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.
In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results, and the reconciliations to those measures, as required by Reg G, are included in the supplemental reporting package.
With that, Bill, would you please begin?"

And good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be reporting solid second quarter results that were in line with our expectations on a constant-currency basis and underscore the durability of our core business. Despite the FX headwinds,",2094,"Thank you, Melissa. And good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be reporting solid second quarter results that were in line with our expectations on a constant-currency basis and underscore the durability of our core business. Despite the FX headwinds, we are comfortable maintaining our guidance for 2015 as we typically see a bit of a ramp in the second half of the year.
It was a very eventful quarter, with the announcement of our agreement to acquire Recall Holdings and the initiation of our Transformation plan, which will drive significant improvement in our overhead cost structure and support strong cash flow generation in years to come, even prior to the substantial and additional synergies we anticipate from our acquisition of Recall.
I'll get to the last 2 items shortly. But first, I'd like to briefly cover certain financial and operating highlights. Our momentum in the storage rental business continues to build and drive durable results in line with our strategic plan. On a constant dollar basis, total revenue growth for the quarter was 2.2%, reflecting continued solid storage rental gains of 4.1% and service revenue declines of just 0.6%. Foreign currency impact year-over-year in total revenue by roughly 6%, reflecting the strong appreciation of the dollar experienced since this time in 2014.
We also continued to see good internal growth, with storage rental up 2.7% for the quarter and 2.9% for the year-to-date, reflecting continued strong growth from Data Management or DM and the Other International segment and stable performance in Western Europe and North America RIM. 
As we look at the remainder of the year, we are seeing consistent trends and are maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth for 2015 in the mid-2% range. The realignment of our Data Management business we initiated last year is yielding good results. DM storage continued to show very strong internal growth, with a 5.3% increase over last year.
Total service revenue internal growth was flat for the quarter and down just 0.5 point year-to-date in line with our expectations for continued yet moderating top line headwinds.
Looking at volume in Records Management, we added roughly 14 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a trailing 12-month basis, representing 2.8% net growth. This growth was obtained in part as a result of the significant turnaround we are continuing to achieve in North America from negative to positive internal volume growth or, in other words, before benefit from acquisitions.
Net volume growth in North America was 1.2% or 0.4% on an internal basis, excluding acquisitions, in line with Q1 levels.
Globally, we maintained customer retention of 98%, in line with the first quarter and a 20% improvement over the level of customer turnover experienced just 2 years ago.
Now turning to our Transformation overhead optimization program we announced in June prior to the Recall acquisition news. We've spoken with many of you about this over the past several weeks and highlighted how our organ -- reorganization in April, in which we put a single leader over our developed markets, has facilitated this important program. This initiative calls for taking $100 million out of overhead costs or SG&A between now and 2018 and is independent of and additive to the Recall acquisition. This will bring us from our current overhead of more than 28% of total revenue down to the mid-20% range and more in keeping with best practices for companies of similar size and global reach.
Importantly, we have already implemented a portion of this program and achieved $50 million of cost reduction or half of these savings, with a charge to be taken in Q3 and the full benefit of the $50 million to be realized in 2016. With a partial year contribution from this program, we expect the net impact for 2015 to be neutral.
Also in recent communications, we've illustrated how the decline in our service margins over the past few years and, more recently, FX headwinds have offset the attractive returns we achieved from investment in real estate and acquisitions.
In fact, during this period, we have been achieving unlevered returns on invested growth capital in the low-teens and have seen significant contribution flow-through in the past couple of years. We initiated some programs last year and are continuing to implement changes that we believe will allow us to stabilize the service margin trend line and get back to around 27% by the end of the year.
It is important to keep this in perspective. While service represents 40% of our total revenue, today, it represents just 17% of our total gross profit. Again, to be clear, we are talking about a slowdown in the activity of physical records and tapes being retrieved, not a slowdown in incoming volume of records and tapes to be stored.
Whilst the demand for typical office cut sheet paper has declined between 2% and 4% in mature markets in the past few years, we continue to see the same number of boxes being inbounded from our existing customers year-after-year, demonstrating the durability of the storage rental business. 
We do continue to expect service revenue headwinds of negative 1% to negative 2% annually over the next few years. And in fact, we did see flat service revenue this quarter compared to a year-ago period. And whilst we can't completely offset the impact of lower service revenues due to a decline in retrieval and refile in transportation activity, we can do more to align our service cost structure with this decrease in activity levels.
So what are we doing to address this service margin decline? First, we are looking at ways to variable-ize more of our costs. Second, we are exploring efforts to make more efficient use of third party logistics suppliers or 3PLs, where we can be assured they will maintain our quality and focus on secure chain of custody. We have used this in Europe on a smaller scale and believe we can expand the use of 3PLs elsewhere. And third, we are using technology more proactively, such as using sensors to detect when shred bins are already -- are ready to be emptied to make routes more efficient.
Additionally, in this quarter, we have seen an uptick in our bad debt. This has come out of our North American business and is primarily the result of refining our billing process over the past 18 to 24 months. During this transition, we didn't adequately refine the process before moving responsibility for the North American billing offshore. There is now a robust plan in place addressing this.
Now let's turn to the Recall transaction. This deal is extremely compelling in terms of industrial logic and strategic fit and is supported by meaningful synergies that drive significant accretion. I assume by now you are familiar with the basic terms of the deal, so I won't review all the information and rather just touch upon the highlights.
In the announcement presentation, we illustrate estimated total net synergies of $155 million, with $110 million of that to be achieved by 2017. These synergies are driven by economies of scale from the combination of infrastructure and overhead and, when fully realized, will lead to double-digit accretion in adjusted EPS, FFO per share and AFFO. At 25% of our size, Recall is managing a similar global platform in terms of country coverage as they are in 24 countries compared to our 36, which drives much of the overhead synergies.
Another benefit of the proposed transaction in the medium term is that it supports our deleveraging strategy. With the additional cash available to us from our Transformation plan as well as Recall synergies, we cannot only fund a stable and growing dividend per share, but we also generate the capital we need for growth.
Additionally, we have complementary market platforms, with Recall having a more developed presence in the small to medium business, whilst we have more significant presence with the larger enterprise customers. 
We've been on the road over the past several weeks and have met with a number of our shareholders as well as Recall's major holders in Australia. And what we're hearing is a universal agreement that our 2 companies are worth more together than they are separately. You can see that several Recall shareholders have increased their holdings and appreciate the attractiveness of owning the combined company. Even our most seasoned advisers have noted that they cannot remember a deal that delivered 26% EPS accretion in 3 years' time.
In the next several weeks, we expect to file the shareholder meeting document seeking approval of the acquisition, which will have additional detail including pro forma results.
Turning back to Iron Mountain. On past calls, we've discussed progress on our 3-year strategic plan which rests on 3 pillars: getting more from our developed markets, expanding our presence in faster growing emerging markets and continuing to explore adjacent opportunities in our Emerging business segment.
Whilst Recall -- whilst the Recall acquisition and Transformation plan have garnered a bit more internal and external attention of late, we continue to make good progress on our base plan, achieving consistent positive storage volume growth in developed markets and completing an organizational realignment to put developed markets under common leadership, which enables our ability to implement our latest Transformation program as well as to accelerate our service margin initiatives.
Additionally, in Emerging Markets, we continue to progress towards our goal of 16% of total revenue from these markets by the end of next year. We pressed the pause button on acquisitions for a moment to assess how some of the transactions in the pipeline might be affected by the Recall acquisition, but we are resuming activity and continue to be pleased with the quality, size and scope of our pipeline.
We've also discussed on recent calls how we have been impacted by the effects of currency translation in terms of absolute earnings and cash impact in U.S. dollars. Whilst FX durability does impact the absolute dollars we report, the impact on our growth and adjusted OIBDA margins is muted because most of our expenses are denominated in local currency, thereby creating a natural hedge. 
On the other hand, we continue to believe that the current strong dollar is a positive in terms of investment opportunity. Given our intent to expand what it is today a relatively small international base, we believe we can create significant value over time by investing selectively in these higher growth markets using strong U.S. dollars during this part of the currency cycle. This may take the form of M&A or in the purchase or development of real estate. In both cases, we can benefit from investing at a low basis.
In addition, we have deepened our focus in the real estate investment area, adding an experienced REIT asset manager to accelerate our plan to buy $700 million to $1 billion of our leased facilities over the next 8 to 10 years. 
As we seek to shift our mix to a higher percentage of owned properties, on average, we are achieving a spread of roughly 150 basis points between our going in cap rates and our market cap rates, whilst positioning ourselves to capture long-term residual value from ownership. We think this is important and appropriate as a REIT, as it supports us being viewed more in line with traditional REITs by the rating agencies and investors. Importantly, our debt to total market cap and our debt-to-EBITDA measures are in line with major REIT sector leaders, and our internal storage rental revenue fared better than these sectors during the recent recession, when we did not have a down year. Our low volatility business is distinguished by a track record of 26 years of consecutive growth in storage rental revenue.
As we think about the opportunities to grow our storage rental business, it is important not to lose sight of the durability of the business, which is underpinned by roughly $1.5 billion of net operating income from our storage business alone. This amount of NOI is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self storage sectors. As we've noticed in recent calls, the restructure is consistent with our capital allocation goals. It does not limit our ability to fund our business plan as we become more active in buying in our properties and executing on our execution -- acquisition pipeline. We expect to fund that incremental investment with excess cash flow or additional borrowing.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rod."

Our results continue to demonstrate the durability of our storage rental revenue stream and the underlying strength of our business fundamentals. Our performance is tracking in line with our full year expectations.To frame my remarks, I'll",1945,"Thanks, Bill. Our results continue to demonstrate the durability of our storage rental revenue stream and the underlying strength of our business fundamentals. Our performance is tracking in line with our full year expectations.
To frame my remarks, I'll begin today with an overview of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, including a review of results by segment. Then, I will address plans and expectations related to our Transformation program and our initiative to improve service gross margins. I will briefly touch on the Recall acquisition costs and also our outlook for 2015, which remains unchanged since June on a constant dollar basis. Finally, I will address other metrics through a REIT lens.
Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. Referring now to Pages 8 and 9 of our supplemental. Total reported revenues were $760 million compared with $787 million in Q2 of 2014, down by 3.5% year-over-year. This reflects the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which impacted total revenues by approximately 5.7% or $44 million. Excluding FX, and so on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 2.2%.
Year-to-date reported revenues were $1.51 billion compared with $1.56 billion in 2014. Again, on a constant dollar basis, first half total revenue growth was also 2.2%.
Worldwide revenues were driven by solid constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of 4.1% for the quarter and 4.3% year-to-date. This was offset by service revenue declines of roughly 1% for the quarter and year-to-date.
As we did for the prior quarter, we are providing bridging schedules for revenue, OIBDA and earnings which explain key variances on year-on-year performance. These are on Pages 20 to 22 of the supplemental.
Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $223 million compared with $242 million in 2014, down 7.7% on a reported basis and 3.3% on a constant dollar basis. The constant dollar adjusted OIBDA decline was driven by investments in new product introductions, for example, in Data Management. 
In addition, we had a $4 million increase in bad debt expense. As Bill mentioned, during the offshoring of our billing activities, our collection efforts fell behind. However, we now have a strong remediation in place.
Service margin declines were a further drag on the business, although these were offset by improvements in storage contribution. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.28 per diluted share compared with $0.41 in the second quarter of 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-over-year is driven by a 10% increase in share count related to the special distribution which we made in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
In addition to the earlier OIBDA breakdown, adjusted EPS was also impacted by an increase in interest expense related to high levels of debt. As stated in our earlier calls, this year-over-year increase in borrowings was driven primarily by REIT conversion related expenses such as the EMP purge and the depreciation amortization recapture payments.
On the subject of debt, please note that it is our intent to refinance our high coupon debt when conditions allow. 
Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out to 13.9% compared with 15% in the prior quarter, primarily as a result of mix change in income from foreign jurisdictions. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% over the long-term.
Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share is $0.48 for the quarter and $0.98 year-to-date, while adjusted funds from operations or AFFO was $130 million for the quarter and $255 million year-to-date.
Let me now turn to Records Management volume trends on Pages 10 and 11. As you can see, we achieved positive volume growth of 1.2% in North America, 3% in Western Europe and 9.7% in the Other International segment, delivering global Records Management net volume growth of 2.8%.
We continue to experience strong organic growth, with second quarter total year-on-year volume growth of 1.8%, excluding acquisitions. Underlying this growth is the stable incoming volume from existing customers. We continue to add approximately $30 million gross cubic feet of storage in the last 12 months, consistent with prior periods.
Let's now turn to our financial performance by segment. In North American Records Management and Information or RIM, internal storage rental revenue was flat for the second quarter. Year-to-date North American RIM internal storage rental revenue grew by 0.2%. Internal service revenue growth showed a small improvement in Q2 with a decline of 1.3% compared to a decline of 1.8% in Q1. Adjusted OIBDA margins in RIM remained solid at 39.4% for the quarter and 42 -- 40.2% year-to-date.
North American Data Management delivered storage rental internal growth of 5.3% in both the second quarter and year-to-date, although service declined by 1.7% for the quarter and 3.8% year-to-date as we continue to see declines in refile and transportation activity.
During the second quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA declined to 50.8% from 52.7% in Q1 as we continue to invest in new products.
The Western Europe segment generated solid results, with 3.5% storage rental internal growth for the quarter and 3.6% year-to-date. This growth was partially offset by declines in internal service revenue, 4.8% for the quarter and 3.7% year-to-date. The decline in service revenue was driven mostly by the sale of our shred business in the U.K. and Ireland towards the end of last year. Adjusted OIBDA margins declined in Western Europe this quarter due to legal costs related to a customer dispute.
The Other International segment, which is made up of Emerging Markets and Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 11.5% for the quarter and 11.3% year-to-date and service internal growth was 13.5% for the quarter and 10.2% year-to-date.
This quarter, Emerging Market revenues represented approximately 14% of our total revenues on a constant dollar basis. We expect adjusted OIBDA for this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the high-teens to low-20s range as we continue to expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets.
As Bill mentioned, we're leveraging our new leadership structure to focus on integrating cross -- costs across developed markets. Through our Transformation program, which was announced last month, we expect to achieve approximately $100 million of reduction in overhead expense by 2018. Actions we have taken this month were expected to yield a full year $50 million benefit in 2016. 
We will see partial benefits this year at the end of the year. However, these will be offset by severance-related charges. We are anticipating approximately $10 million of severance-related expenses in the third quarter as a result of this program.
Let's now discuss our initiative to maintain and enhance service gross margins. As Bill outlined, the decline in service gross margin has acted as a drag on our performance in the last 4 years, partially masking the strong returns that we're seeing from investments in real estate and M&A. That said, it should also be remembered that on a constant dollar basis, we have seen good improvements in overall contribution year-on-year in 2014, and we expect the same in 2015.
As discussed earlier, and as you can see in the supplemental on Page 26, in the second quarter, service gross margins have declined year-over-year. The actions we are now taking are not yet reflected in our results. But in the second half of the year, we expect to see an improvement in service margins and continue to target a year-end run rate of about 27%.
Let's touch on the Recall acquisition briefly. As Bill mentioned, we're making good progress with regulatory filings. To prepare for closing, we incurred approximately $6 million professional and advisory fees this quarter. We expect about $10 million to $15 million of additional spend in each of the third and fourth quarters of this year.
In addition to these advisory fees, we are expecting approximately $20 million to $25 million charge in the second half of the year to prepare for integration, including Recall's REIT conversion. Please note that these costs will be excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation as they are onetime in nature. These costs were also included in our guidance related to the Recall acquisition when we announced the deal.
As I mentioned at the outset, our outlook for 2015 remains consistent with the guidance we provided in June when we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Recall. Please note that at this time, our guidance doesn't reflect the benefit or impact of the potential Recall transaction. We will provide detailed guidance for 2016 and beyond at our upcoming Investor Day in October.
For 2015, although we expect revenue to be an -- as anticipated on a constant dollar basis for the full year, given FX movements, we expect reported dollar revenues to be towards the lower end of our range. As regard to other metrics for both constant and reported dollars, we expect them to be well within our ranges.
Our strong cash flow continues to support our dividend at current levels in 2015, and we intend to maintain our dividend per share rate for the remainder of the year, subject to board approval. Our estimate for cash available for distribution and discretionary investment for 2015 remains $470 million, giving us ample dividend coverage and the ability to fund our core real estate investments or growth racking which support approximately 2% organic growth in our adjusted OIBDA.
2016 and beyond, assuming the Recall acquisition closes and with the Transformation benefits, we have excess cash that can support potential growth in the dividend and/or discretion -- and/or fund discretionary investments in real estate, M&A or emerging business opportunities. These investments achieve returns above our WACC and are accretive to shareholders. To sum up, we have adequate dividend coverage, excess capacity and attractive investment options.
Shifting to the balance sheet, at the quarter-end, we had liquidity of approximately $750 million. At the quarter-end, our lease adjusted debt ratio was 5.7x as expected.
Turning now to REIT-specific metrics. We continue to achieve strong storage NOI, approximately $28 per rack square foot worldwide, which compares favorably to NOI per square foot for most property types within the REIT sector.
Our racking and building utilization rates are high at 91% and 84%, respectively, for the Records Management portfolio. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90s. When we enter a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about 3 years' time.
Investment page, Page 32 of the supplemental, highlights our investments for racking projects and process building development and building acquisitions by major geographic region, their total expected investment and anticipated NOI and returns. Please note that these investments represent growth-related investments and exclude consolidation-related spend. As you can see on this page, we achieved high returns in our growth racking and building development projects.
Lastly, similar to prior quarters, we are providing components of value, a summary of various metrics of our business to facilitate valuation. As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA excluding rent expense in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis, whether facilities are leased or owned. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities area.
Overall, we believe this was a solid quarter and we're pleased with the momentum we continue to see in the business. We remain on track to deliver our guidance for 2015.
Looking ahead, we continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by extending the durability of our storage rental business, improving service margins, achieving overhead cost reductions through our Transformation program and realizing the synergy benefits of the Recall acquisition.
And that, Bill, concludes my summary for the Q2 financials."

We are teeing up to close the Recall deal early next year and are organized internally to support the smooth integration of Recall, and our attractive emerging business pipeline is delivering interesting adjacencies that can further extend the durability of our enterprise storage business. 
Finally and most importantly, the strength of our business plus the Transformation program support approximately 11% to 14% growth in the cash we have available already next year to grow our dividend per share over time and fund our growth investment. This is even prior to the Recall acquisition.

So I think, first of all, you -- we need to start at the top, that we are starting from a base where our SG&A is 28% of sales, which is clearly on the upper end of what a company with our scale and scope should be able to achieve. It should -- a company of our scale and scope should be in the, let's say, the mid-20s, and probably the lower side of the mid-20s. In other words, you're not -- it's probably kind of more the 23% to 25% range is where a company of our size and complexity should be. So that's the first thing to give you kind of a sense of what's possible. 
Then, the thing that triggers it is there's really, if you think about it, there are, I would say, 3 buckets. One is just getting efficiency through the reorganization. So when we put all the developed markets under one person, then it allows you to rationalize -- you have 2 finance groups, you have 2 HR groups, you 2 -- have 2 commercial leadership groups, you have 2 engineering groups, et cetera. So you are able to actually shrink that to one to get some of the efficiencies and economies of scale that you would expect. 
I think the second aspect of it is looking at what we call just general spans and layers. Partly it's triggered by that move, but just saying what is the right breadth of responsibility in the organization? Do we have too many layers? And I think that's just good housekeeping that all companies our size need to go through every so often to make sure that we don't have what I would call organizational creep or layers building into the organization. And to me, that's important not just from a cost standpoint, but it's also important from a dynamic standpoint. I mean by dynamic is to be quicker, nimble, more nimble, less bureaucratic. So I think that's a  -- it shows up in the cost line, but we also expect that to show up in the revenue line. 
And then, the third aspect is -- it's related a little bit to the aging of some of our -- aging of our receivable split, which led to a bad debt charge, is that we need to look at our processes, first and foremost, in terms of how can we make those more efficient. And then, where should those be done? Should they be done internally? Should they be done internally offshore? Or should they be done by an outside party? And that's the third bucket that we're going through, is to both optimize those processes, and then figure out where they should be done, either within Iron Mountain or by an outside vendor. And that's kind of the 3 buckets that we're going through. On that last one, you can imagine we're actually using also some outside help that have done this a number of times. 
So we feel very confident in terms of the targets. We feel very confident that we are doing this in areas that doesn't impact the customer experience and service levels. And in fact, I think, our expectation is it should improve it as we look to make the organization quicker, more nimble and less bureaucratic."

And that is to be expected as key volume continues to build at a decent price that flows toward a decent margin. So quarter after quarter after quarter, we should continue to build. 
Around that, obviously, then you have some of these one-offs in the quarter. We called out a couple of them. One was this bad debt expense issue that Bill referenced in terms of the off -- related to the offshoring of our billing activities. We also had a -- an investment in the Data Management space around new product introduction, which, obviously, the expectation of that is there will be returns coming from that in the future.

But I think if you look at the results that we're getting, is you can see -- I mean, I think the way to look at it is a couple of ways, is we're getting, I would say, fairly regular yet modest price increase that offsets the inflation that -- the low inflation levels. But I think, as I've said, I think, a number of times on calls is that in a low inflation environment, price increases are more challenging.
I think the other thing to look at is if you look with the -- if you look at what's been happening to our gross margins associated with storage, you can see they actually -- there's a slight uptick. So that gives you a view that in a low inflation environment, obviously, we have wage inflation that is still real in terms of what we pay our folks, but we're able to get both productivity increases and pricing increases that allows us to either maintain or slightly enhance our gross margins. 
So we feel pretty good in terms of what we're getting in terms of pricing. It's something that we continue to work on. I think I told you we brought somebody in about a year ago just to -- our new leader for the pricing group, that seems to be getting some good traction. But I also think it's important to understand that in a low inflation environment, it's -- these are small numbers that you're dealing with. You're not dealing with large order of magnitude.

So one of the areas I think we've publicized is that we have a partnership with EMC that offers both their customers and our customers a joint -- it's kind of a combination of our data center, our tape business and EMC's data domain business, which is a data center replication hardware offering they have. And that -- there is an investment associated with standing up those new products.

If we took the month of May out, we would have a 26.1% service margin in the -- in this quarter, which is still 100 basis points, but we know how to bridge that gap. And even when we looked at May, some of the things that we're introducing, we -- gets us better to manage it. So the month of May was particularly soft for really 2 things, was one is variable-izing some of our costs quick enough associated with a normal downtick in revenue because there is some seasonality in revenue, and plus it was a short month, but -- in terms of the way the holidays fell. So those 2 things that -- which is part of our program.

We are pleased to report a solid third quarter results that were at the upper end of our profit expectations and underscores the durability of our core business. That is based on this continued demonstration of the growth and durability of our business that our Board of Directors has resumed our growth in dividends and has pulled forward the dividend increase by declaring a quarterly cash dividend of $0.485 per share. 
I suspect most of you on the call today either attended in person or listened to the webcast of our Investor Day about 2 weeks ago. Therefore, I won't go into a long discussion of our strategy, goals or longer-term expectations, as I believe time would be better spent on Q&A.
That said, I would like to briefly reiterate a few main points from our event and relate how our Q3 results fit within that framework. For those who haven't heard the live event or listened to the replay, we laid out our vision for the year 2020, given that we are rapidly approaching the end of the 3-year strategic plan that we introduced at our Investor Day in the beginning of 2014.
More specifically, we described our past performance and go-forward vision for our 3 strategic pillars: developed markets, emerging Markets and adjacent businesses. 
In developed markets, our strategic plan over the last 2 years has turned around these relatively flat internal growth markets and driven more than 7 million cubic feet of net new records all prior to acquisition. 
In emerging markets, our sales expanded from representing 10% of total revenue in 2013 to 14.3% of total revenue by the end of Q3 on a constant dollar basis. These markets are growing 10% to 15% per year before acquisitions, and our goal to reach 20% of total volume from these markets by 2020 is within our grasp. Roughly 18% of the 20% goal will be reached by internal growth alone. 
In adjacent businesses, we expect revenue to represent 5% of our total worldwide revenue in 2020, up from just 2% today. Currently, our adjacent businesses are comprised of our Data Center business are our recently announced acquisition of Crozier Fine Arts storage, the leading art storage business in the U.S. This is a natural extension of our film and found business. Crozier comes with about 0.5 million square feet of owned real estate and achieves about 10% sales growth per year before acquisitions. We anticipate closing this deal in December.
This all adds up to a shift in mix with 25% of our revenue coming from faster growth markets and businesses by 2020. That's up from 15% today, with the majority of the increase coming from internal growth. The expected impact from this shift is that by 2020, annual internal profit will grow by roughly 5% or 7% with acquisitions versus 2% and 4%, respectively, today. 
We also enhanced our Transformation program to deliver a total of $125 million of overhead saving, up from the $100 million we announced this summer. You can see from the bridging schedules in the supplemental that we recorded $9 million of charges in Q3 related to this program.
We expect to realize partial year benefit of the first $50 million in savings in the fourth quarter offsetting this charge. The full $50 million annualized benefit will flow through in 2016 and beyond. And our next set of actions to be taken in early 2016 will represent another $50 million of annualized savings in 2017. So we are getting more from our efforts in this program and we're getting it faster than originally anticipated.
We outlined our plans to continue to increase the percentage of owned real estate over time through our programs which deliver improved operating economics with the consolidation of facilities. 
Lastly, we demonstrated future cash generation on a run-rate basis to support growth in dividends and investments, both on a standalone basis and including recall. 
On a standalone basis, the continued strong and durable cash-based business, coupled with the Transformation program, will, at a minimum, allow us to increase the dividend per share by 15% between 2015 and 2018, whilst reducing leverage by 0.4 of a turn. 
Including Recall, our minimum dividend per share delivers 24% growth between 2015 and 2018 and reduces leverage by 0.7 turns. This is all without issuing equity beyond the shares issued to purchase Recall.
Now turning to Q3 financial and operating highlights. 
Total revenue for the quarter grew by 2% on a constant dollar basis, reflecting continued solid storage rental gains of 4.2%. The impact from foreign currency on total revenues was roughly 7%, reflecting the continued strong appreciation of the dollar against several of our major functional currencies. Moreover, we should note that we did not have any meaningful acquisition activity this quarter, as we deferred transactions to assess how they may be affected by the Recall acquisition. Having now fully assessed the benefit of the Recall acquisition, we have resumed M&A activity with appropriately adjusted focus to account for Recall's footprint.
This quarter, we continued to see good internal growth with storage rental up 2.8% for both the quarter and year-to-date, reflecting continued strong growth from Data Management, Other International and Western Europe. As we look at the remainder of the year, we are seeing consistent trends and are maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth in the mid-2% range. 
Looking at volume and records management, we added roughly 14 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a trailing 12-month basis, representing 2.7% net growth. Globally, we retained 98% of all customers, this is in line with our second quarter, and a 20% improvement from the customer turnover that we experienced just 2 years ago. 
We continued to see the same number of boxes being inbounded, some 30 million cubic feet from our existing customers year-after-year, demonstrating the durability of the storage rental business. The durability of our business is demonstrated by a solid growth in bookings we are seeing across major verticals. In addition, we are encouraged by year-to-date low double-digit increase in the midmarket customer bookings, as we continue to increase our focus on these small to midsized enterprises where our market share of the total market is roughly 10%.
We are pleased to report solid improvement in our service gross margins as a result of numerous initiatives. Q3 total service gross margin was 28.5%. However, when normalizing for the reclassification between storage and service, Q3 total service gross margins were approximately 26.8%, and we are well on track to achieve our expected end-of-year run rate of between 27% and 27.5%.
Now let's turn to the Recall transaction. 
This deal is extremely compelling in terms of strategic fit and is supported by meaningful synergies that drive significant accretion. With the benefit from a number of months of detailed and joint integration planning with our Recall counterparts, we remain comfortable with the estimated total net synergies of $155 million, with $110 million of that to be achieved in 2017. As we've noted in the past, this is -- there is potential upside to these figures as we work through real estate consolidation opportunities. We remain on track from a regulatory standpoint, and we continued to target a close in early 2016.
As I've said previously, our business is underpinned by roughly $1.5 billion of net operating income, which is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self storage sectors. What distinguishes our business is that inherent durability, and it is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance even in the most volatile times. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over now to Rod."

We are pleased with this quarter's strong operating performance and the momentum we continued to see in our business. Our results continued to underscore the strength and durability of our storage rental business and the incremental returns we are generating from our investments. 
Similar to Bill, my remarks this morning will be brief. I'll begin with an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date performance, including a review of results by segments, and an update on costs related to the potential Recall transaction. Finally, I will touch briefly on our outlook for 2015 and 2016.
Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. 
Referring to pages 8 to 9 of our supplemental. Total reported revenues for the quarter were $747 million compared with $783 million in the prior year. This decline reflects the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which impacted total revenues by approximately 6.6% or $50 million year-over-year. Excluding FX, on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 2%. Year-to-date reported revenues were $2.26 billion compared with $2.34 billion in 2014, and again, excluding FX, also grew by 2% on a constant dollar basis.
Total revenues were driven by a solid constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of more than 4% for the quarter and year-to-date. This was offset by a modest service revenue declines of roughly 1.3% for the quarter and 1.1% year-to-date. The decline in our constant dollar service revenue was partially driven by the disposition of our shredding businesses in the U.K. and Australia. 
Consistent with prior quarters, we are providing bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted earnings per share, which explain key variances in year-on-year performance. These schedules are on pages 20 through 22 of the supplemental. In addition, this quarter, we are providing a bridging schedule on Page 23 to explain the change in our total service gross margin. In this schedule, we have normalized for the accounting adjustment that Bill referenced, and our projected year-end run rate of 27% to 27.5% is consistent with that normalized basis.
Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $228 million compared to $235 million in 2014. Excluding FX, adjusted OIBDA was up 2.3%. Our adjusted OIBDA for Q3 '15 included $9 million of charges related to our Transformation program. Excluding these costs, adjusted OIBDA would have been $237 million or grown 6.5% on a normalized constant dollar basis. Year-to-date, adjusted OIBDA grew by 1.5% on a constant dollar basis. For the fourth quarter, we expect to incur a very little in charges related to the Transformation initiative. Please note that our savings outlook for Transformation remain consistent with what we laid out at our Investor Day.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.31 per diluted share compared with $0.35 in the third quarter of '14. The decline in adjusted EPS year-on-year is driven by a 9% increase in share count related to the special distribution we made in Q4 of '14, as well as the restructuring charges related to Transformation. Excluding the increase in share count and the Transformation costs, normalized adjusted EPS grew by 8.7% for the quarter. 
Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out at 16.5% compared to 16.3% for the prior year and 13.9% in Q2. The sequential increase in our structural tax rate was driven by the expenses related to the Recall acquisition and the debt refinancing costs, which lowered our QRS pretax income. We continued to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% in the short term. Our blended rates following the close of the potential Recall acquisition will be closer to 20%, as we noted when we announced the deal. 
Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.55 for the quarter and $1.53 year-to-date, while adjusted funds from operation or AFFO was $137 million for the quarter and $395 million year-to-date.
Let's turn to our financial performance by segments. 
In North American Records and Information Management or RIM, internal storage rental revenue showed a decline of 0.3% for the third quarter and is flat year-to-date. North American RIM internal storage rental growth can vary on a quarterly basis and is often impacted by the timing of large contract renegotiations. For the last 8 quarters, it has varied from 0.9% to minus 0.4%. 
North American RIM internal service revenue declined this quarter due to continued decrease in retrieved refile activity levels and the timing of nonrecurring imaging projects that were in the year-ago period. 
Adjusted OIBDA margins in RIM remain solid at 40% for the quarter and year-to-date.
North American Data Management or DM delivered storage rental internal growth of more than 5% in both the third quarter and year-to-date. However, internal service revenue declined by 4.9% for the quarter and 4.1% year-to-date, as we continued to see declines in tape rotation from related transportation activity in the business. 
During the third quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA margins remained strong at 51.6% compared with 50.8% in Q2. 
The Western Europe segment generated solid results, with 1.4% storage rental internal growth for the quarter and 2.8% year-to-date. 
Looking at internal service revenue, declines in activity were partially offset by increases in nonrecurring imaging and other projects. Adjusted OIBDA margins remained strong in Western Europe at 31.2%. 
The other International segments, which is made up primarily of Emerging Markets and Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 11.5% for the quarter and 11.4% year-to-date. Service internal growth was 12.3% for the quarter and 10.9% year-to-date. We continue to expect adjusted OIBDA for this segments to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the high teens and low 20s range in the short term as we expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets.
Let's touch on the Recall acquisition briefly. 
As we mentioned at our Investor Day, we are making good progress with the regulatory process and we anticipate closing the deal early in 2016. To prepare for closing, this quarter, we incurred approximately $15 million of professional and advisory fees, including costs to prepare for Recall's reconversion. We expect about $25 million to $30 million of additional Recall costs in the fourth quarter. 
Please note that these expenses are included -- excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculations as they are one-time in nature. Importantly, these costs were included in our guidance related to the Recall acquisition when we announced the deal.
As I mentioned at the outset, our outlook for 2015 and '16 remains consistent with the guidance we provided earlier this month at our Investor Day. The one exception to that is that we tightened our expected real estate investment range and lowered it by roughly $30 million at the midpoint relative to the projections provided on our Investor Day due to the focus on and timing of our real estate consolidation program.
Given FX fluctuations and to provide better visibility of the underlying performance of our business, we are providing constant dollar guidance figures for 2016 and our plan is to continue that practice. Please note that our current 2016 guidance is based on 2015 constant dollar budget rates which was set in January 2015. When we report full year '15 results in February, we will provide an updated 2016 guidance based on 2016 constant dollar budget rates, which will be set in early January 2016. 
We've got the question from some of you on our dollar guidance for 2016. Assuming constant September 30 FX rates, our exit FX impacts for the quarter on total revenue were, approximately 40% of it is denominated in non-U.S. dollars, is roughly 3.5%. Again, holding that constant for 2016, it implies a 3.5% FX impact on revenues, which translates into roughly $120 million impact for the full year.
Beyond the dividend increase that Bill mentioned for the upcoming quarter, we laid out at our Investor Day a minimum projected dividend per share guidance through 2018 on a standalone basis and the combined basis with Recall. Please refer to the presentation and webcast for more details.
Late in September, we raised $1 billion of debt at 6%, enabling us to pay off some of our very high interest legacy debt and lowering our average interest costs. At the quarter-end, we had liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion. Note that this figure is prior to the October 2015 redemption of our outstanding 6.75% euro notes, 7.75% U.S. notes and 8.38% U.S. notes. Following the redemption, liquidity will be approximately $900 million. Lastly, our lease adjusted debt ratio was 1.7x as expected.
Turning now to Page 34 for supplemental where we highlight our investments for racking projects in process building development and building acquisitions by major geographic region, their total expected investment and anticipated NOI and returns. Please note that these investments represent growth-related investments and exclude consolidated related spend. 
As you can see on this page, we achieved higher returns on our growth racking and building development projects. So far this year, our investment in M&A and real estate investment activity has been lower than typical as we prepare for the potential Recall acquisition. We are focusing future plans on the synergy potential fueled by real estate consolidation between the companies.
Overall, we believe this was a solid quarter, and we are pleased the progress we have made so far in advancing our Transformation program and stabilizing service gross margins. We remain on track to deliver our guidance for 2015, as well as our long-term objectives. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives our cash available to fund dividends and core growth investments. 
And with that, operator, we will now take questions."

But if you kind of look at North America, North America is achieving similar types net volume growth organically or before acquisitions as we were last year, so it's actually up in terms of volume. We've had some pricing adjustments this year -- this quarter due to some renewals, which I think we talked about a little bit on Investor Day. It's not unusual during certain times of the year. And if you go back over, say, the last 2 to 3 years, you'll see that we have maybe 2, 3, 4 quarters of positive internal storage revenue growth in North America and then it's punctuated by 1 or 2 quarters generally of negative, which is usually associated when we're doing renewals. But you can't -- because one set of data in terms of if we look at the revenue side is quarter by quarter, you can't link that to volume, which is just on a trailing 12 months.

In other words, if they get something, if they get some growth out of an existing customer, but we deemed it as a new area or a new location or a new department, that we call that a new sale. So I think there is some ebb and flow between the 2 and as you know, if we look heavily regulated industries which we have which is a big part of our business, I guess a lot of that's affected by different litigation that's going on around the world.

So for instance, I just came back from Eastern Europe and took a couple of members of the board along with me so they could be up close what we're doing out there and also see some of the talent we've got, so Eastern Europe is growing, it continues to grow extremely well, but so does in Latin America. I mean the challenge in Latin America, and Brazil, which is our largest operation, for instance, is in terms of growth. And if you measure it Brazilian real, it is strongly double-digit and it continues to do well. I mean the issue, of course, in places like Brazil is the translation of that because the real has been under pressure. And then Asia, which is a smaller portion of our portfolio, but again, has very strong growth rates, whether you look at India, you look at places like Hong Kong, Singapore and China. The one thing I would point out though is that in markets, even markets like Brazil where we've been under pressure from a real standpoints when you translate that in Us dollars, the growth may be muted slightly is we've also been able to some of these cases like Brazil been able to borrow locally in real has helped hedge some of the translation.

So if you say 40% of our sales are in foreign currency, but the currencies that are impacted typically are in that a little less than 15% emerging market area. And those areas where our OIBDA margins at this point are lower because we are building scale in those markets. So we are taking strong U.S. to build out these markets right now. And their impact, even with the negative FX impact, the impact on OIBDA in earning is muted. It's obviously fully affected at the revenue line, but when you see what happens to earnings, it's muted. So I agree, you need to model it out, but the earnings is not as sensitive as you might think to the FX, whereas you do see the full sensitivity on the revenue line and that's why we feel comfortable about already starting to increase our dividend because we feel that we've got enough momentum in the business that we can continue and start back on our growth trend in terms of dividend."

And so the revenue side if you can appreciate when we renegotiate large enterprise deals, that you do get, in any given quarter, you can get a significant impact in terms of the revenue associated per cube. So there's a disconnect between that volume growth. Over a long period of time though, if you look at the trend over a long period of time, we still see, if you take the revenue growth and if you look on an annualized basis, we're getting between 0.5% and 1% in terms of price per cube. Then you get those 2 bits combined, and that will give you a good guide in terms of what the internal storage revenue growth is for a particular market. So the -- you're right to point out that we continued to drive significant, I'd say, on a percentage basis relatively small percentage growth in North America but in terms of volume because of the size of the North American business a lot of large numbers, we continue to deliver significant amount of organic quarter volume growth in North America. And over a 12-month period, you should think about 0.5% to 1% price growth on top of that cube growth, but any given quarter depending on where we are renewals cycles especially for the large contracts, if you go back over the last, I don't know, 8, 9, 10 quarters, you'll see that bit around where we'll have 1 or 2 quarters where we'll be negative, 2 to 3 quarters will be positive, and it just kind of moves around."

I think the one of the things that we do -- where you'll see us try to even tap into another market which we think is quite large is what we're doing in the midmarket. So I think I -- if you look at where we are on the midmarket side, I think actually I misquoted, we're kind of low double-digit growth if we look at year-on-year booking for new sale across the board, but in the mid- markets here today, we are up over 60% in terms of bookings in the midmarket where we only have 10% market share. So I think there are some things where we can tap into quote another large market but it think is fair to say that if you look at our core, our normal hunting ground, if you will, it's a lot of large numbers and there's a limited terms of how much more we can get to those customers."

We're pleased to report a solid third quarter results that were at the upper end of our profit expectations and underscores the durability of our core business. It is based upon this continued demonstration of the growth and durability of our business that our Board of Directors has resumed our growth in dividends and has pulled forward the dividend increase by declaring a quarterly cash dividend of $0.485 per share. 
I suspect most of you on the call today either attended in person or listened to the webcast of our Investor Day about 2 weeks ago. Therefore, I won't go into a long discussion of our strategy, goals or longer-term expectations as, I believe, time would be better spent on Q&A.
That said, I would like to briefly reiterate a few main points from our event and relate how our Q3 results fit within that framework. For those who haven't heard the live event or listened to the replay, we laid out our vision for the year 2020, given that we are rapidly approaching the end of the 3-year strategic plan that we introduced at our Investor Day in the beginning of 2014.
More specifically, we described our past performance and go-forward vision for our 3 strategic pillars: developed markets, Emerging Markets and adjacent businesses. 
In developed markets, our strategic plan over the last 2 years has turned around these relatively flat internal growth markets and driven more than 7 million cubic feet of net new records, all prior to acquisition. 
In Emerging Markets, our sales expanded from representing 10% of total revenue in 2013 to 14.3% of total revenue by the end of Q3 on a constant dollar basis. These markets are growing 10% to 15% per year before acquisitions, and our goal to reach 20% of total volume from these markets by 2020 is within our grasp. Roughly 18% of the 20% goal will be reached by internal growth alone. 
In adjacent businesses, we expect revenue to represent 5% of our total worldwide revenue in 2020, up from just 2% today. Currently, our adjacent businesses are comprised of our data center business and our recently announced acquisition of Crozier Fine Arts storage, the leading art storage business in the U.S. This is a natural extension of our film and sound business. Crozier comes with about 0.5 million square feet of owned real estate and achieves about 10% sales growth per year before acquisitions. We anticipate closing this deal in December.
This all adds up to a shift in mix, with 25% of our revenue coming from faster growth markets and businesses by 2020. That's up from 15% today, with the majority of the increase coming from internal growth. The expected impact from this shift is that by 2020, annual internal profit will grow by roughly 5% or 7% with acquisitions versus 2% and 4%, respectively, today. 
We also enhanced our Transformation program to deliver a total of $125 million of overhead savings, up from the $100 million we announced this summer. You can see from the bridging schedules in the supplemental that we recorded $9 million of charges in Q3 related to this program. We expect to realize partial-year benefit of the first $50 million in savings in the fourth quarter, offsetting this charge. The full $50 million annualized benefit will flow through in 2016 and beyond, and our next set of actions to be taken in early 2016 will represent another $50 million of annualized savings in 2017. So we're getting more from our efforts in this program, and we're getting it faster than originally anticipated.
We outlined our plans to continue to increase the percentage of owned real estate over time through our programs which deliver improved operating economics with the consolidation of facilities. 
Lastly, we demonstrated future cash generation on a run rate basis to support growth in dividends and investments, both on a stand-alone basis and including Recall. 
On a stand-alone basis, the continued strong and durable cash-based business, coupled with the Transformation program, will, at a minimum, allow us to increase the dividend per share by 15% between 2015 and 2018 whilst reducing leverage by 0.4 of a turn. Including Recall, our minimum dividend per share delivers 24% growth between 2015 and 2018 and reduces leverage by 0.7 turns. This is all without issuing equity beyond the shares issued to purchase Recall.
Now turning to Q3 financial and operating highlights. Total revenue for the quarter grew by 2% on a constant dollar basis, reflecting continued solid storage rental gains of 4.2%. The impact from foreign currency on total revenues was roughly 7%, reflecting the continued strong appreciation of the dollar against several of our major functional currencies. Moreover, we should note that we did not have any meaningful acquisition activity this quarter as we deferred transactions to assess how they may be affected by the Recall acquisition. Having now fully assessed the benefit of the Recall acquisition, we have resumed M&A activity with an appropriately adjusted focus to account for Recall's footprint.
This quarter, we continue to see good internal growth, with storage rental up 2.8% for both the quarter and year-to-date, reflecting continued strong growth from Data Management, Other International and Western Europe. As we look at the remainder of the year, we are seeing consistent trends and are maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth in the mid-2% range. 
Looking at volume and records management, we added roughly 14 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a trailing 12-month basis, representing 2.7% net growth. Globally, we retained 98% of all customers. This is in line with our second quarter and the 20% improvement from the customer turnover we experienced just 2 years ago. 
We continue to see the same number of boxes being inbounded, some 30 million cubic feet, from our existing customers year-after-year, demonstrating the durability of the storage rental business. The durability of our business is demonstrated by solid growth in bookings we are seeing across major verticals. In addition, we are encouraged by year-to-date low double-digit increase in the mid-market customer bookings as we continue to increase our focus on these small to midsized enterprises where our market share of the total market is roughly 10%.
We are pleased to report solid improvement in our service gross margins as a result of numerous initiatives. Q3 total service gross margin was 28.5%. However, when normalizing for the reclassification between storage and service, Q3 total service gross margins were approximately 26.8%, and we are well on track to achieve our expected end-of-year run rate of between 27% and 27.5%.
Now let's turn to the Recall transaction. This deal is extremely compelling in terms of strategic fit and is supported by meaningful synergies that drive significant accretion. With the benefit from a number of months of detailed and joint integration planning with our Recall counterparts, we remain comfortable with the estimated total net synergies of $155 million, with $110 million of that to be achieved in 2017. As we've noted in the past, this is -- there is potential upside to these figures as we work through real estate consolidation opportunities. We remain on track from a regulatory standpoint, and we continue to target a close in early 2016.
As I've said previously, our business is underpinned by roughly $1.5 billion of net operating income, which is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability, and it is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance even in the most volatile times. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over now to Rod."

We're pleased with this quarter's strong operating performance and the momentum we continue to see in our business. Our results continue to underscore the strength and durability of our storage rental business and the incremental returns we're generating from our investments. 
Similar to Bill, my remarks this morning will be brief. I'll begin with an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date performance, including a review of results by segments, and an update on costs related to the potential Recall transaction. Finally, I will touch briefly on our outlook for 2015 and 2016.
Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. Referring to pages 8 and 9 of our supplemental, total reported revenues for the quarter were $747 million compared with $783 million in the prior year. This decline reflects the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which impacted total revenues by approximately 6.6% or $50 million year-over-year. Excluding FX, on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 2%. Year-to-date reported revenues were $2.26 billion compared with $2.34 billion in 2014 and again, excluding FX, also grew by 2% on a constant dollar basis.
Total revenues were driven by solid constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of more than 4% for the quarter and year-to-date. This was offset by modest service revenue declines of roughly 1.3% for the quarter and 1.1% year-to-date. The decline in our constant dollar service revenue was partially driven by the disposition of our shredding businesses in the U.K. and Australia. 
Consistent with prior quarters, we are providing bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted earnings per share, which explain key variances in year-on-year performance. These schedules are on pages 20 through 22 of the supplemental. In addition, this quarter, we are providing a bridging schedule on Page 23 to explain the change in our total service gross margin. In this schedule, we have normalized for the accounting adjustment that Bill referenced, and our projected year-end run rate of 27% to 27.5% is consistent with that normalized basis.
Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $228 million compared with $235 million in 2014. Excluding FX, adjusted OIBDA was up 2.3%. Our adjusted OIBDA for Q3 '15 included $9 million of charges related to our Transformation program. Excluding these costs, adjusted OIBDA would have been $237 million or grown 6.5% on a normalized constant dollar basis. Year-to-date, adjusted OIBDA grew by 1.5% on a constant dollar basis. For the fourth quarter, we expect to incur a very little in charges related to the Transformation initiative. Please note that our savings outlook for Transformation remain consistent with what we laid out on our Investor Day.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.31 per diluted share compared with $0.35 in the third quarter of '14. The decline in adjusted EPS year-on-year is driven by a 9% increase in share count related to the special distribution we made in Q4 of '14 as well as the restructuring charges related to Transformation. Excluding the increase in share count and the Transformation cost, normalized adjusted EPS grew by 8.7% for the quarter. 
Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out at 16.5% compared with 16.3% for the prior year and 13.9% in Q2. The sequential increase in our structural tax rate was driven by the expenses related to the Recall acquisition and debt refinancing costs, which lowered our QRS pretax income. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% in the short term. Our blended rates, following the close of the potential Recall acquisition, will be closer to 20%, as we noted when we announced the deal. 
Normalized funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.55 for the quarter and $1.53 year-to-date, while adjusted funds from operation, or AFFO, was $137 million for the quarter and $395 million year-to-date.
Let's turn to our financial performance by segment. In North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage rental revenue showed a decline of 0.3% for the third quarter and is flat year-to-date. North American RIM internal storage rental growth can vary on a quarterly basis and is often impacted by the timing of large contract renegotiations. For the last 8 quarters, it has varied from 0.9% to minus 0.4%. North American RIM internal service revenue declined this quarter due to continued decrease in retrieve, refile activity levels and the timing of nonrecurring imaging projects that were in the year-ago period. Adjusted OIBDA margins in RIM remained solid at 40% for the quarter and year-to-date.
North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of more than 5% in both the third quarter and year-to-date. However, internal service revenue declined by 4.9% for the quarter and 4.1% year-to-date as we continue to see declines in tape rotation and related transportation activity in the business. During the third quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA margins remained strong at 51.6% compared with 50.8% in Q2. 
The Western Europe segment generated solid results, with 1.4% storage rental internal growth for the quarter and 2.8% year-to-date. Looking at internal service revenue, declines in activity were partially offset by increases in nonrecurring imaging and other projects. Adjusted OIBDA margins remained strong in Western Europe at 31.2%. 
The Other International segment, which is made up primarily of Emerging Markets and Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 11.5% for the quarter and 11.4% year-to-date. Service internal growth was 12.3% for the quarter and 10.9% year-to-date. We continue to expect adjusted OIBDA for this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the high teens and low-20s range in the short term as we expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets.
Let's touch on the Recall acquisition briefly. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, we're making good progress with the regulatory process, and we anticipate closing the deal early in 2016. To prepare for closing, this quarter, we incurred approximately $15 million of professional and advisory fees, including cost to prepare for Recall's REIT conversion. We expect about $25 million to $30 million of additional Recall costs in the fourth quarter. Please note that these expenses are included -- excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculations as they are onetime in nature. Importantly, these costs were included in our guidance related to the Recall acquisition when we announced the deal.
As I mentioned at the outset, our outlook for 2015 and '16 remains consistent with the guidance we provided earlier this month at our Investor Day. The one exception to that is that we tightened our expected real estate investment range and lowered it by roughly $30 million at the midpoint relative to the projections provided at our Investor Day due to the focus on and timing of our real estate consolidation program.
Given FX fluctuations and to provide better visibility of the underlying performance of our business, we're providing constant dollar guidance figures for 2016, and our plan is to continue that practice. Please note that our current 2016 guidance is based on 2015 constant dollar budget rates, which were set in January 2015. When we report full year '15 results in February, we will provide an updated 2016 guidance based on 2016 constant dollar budget rates, which will be set in early January 2016. 
We got a question from some of you on our dollar guidance for 2016. Assuming constant September 30 FX rates, our exit FX impacts for the quarter on total revenue, where approximately 40% of it is denominated in non-U.S. dollars, is roughly 3.5%. Again, holding that constant for 2016, it implies a 3.5% FX impact on revenues, which translates into roughly $120 million impact for the full year.
Beyond the dividend increase that Bill mentioned for the upcoming quarter, we laid out at our Investor Day a minimum projected dividend per share guidance through 2018 on a stand-alone basis and the combined basis with Recall. Please refer to the presentation and webcast for more details.
Late in September, we raised $1 billion of debt at 6%, enabling us to pay off some of our very high-interest legacy debt and lowering our average interest cost. At the quarter end, we had liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion. Note that this figure is prior to the October 2015 redemption of our outstanding 6 3/4% euro notes, 7 3/4% U.S. notes and 8 3/8% U.S. notes. Following the redemption, liquidity will be approximately $900 million. Lastly, our lease adjusted debt ratio was 5.7x, as expected.
Turning now to Page 34 of the supplemental, where we highlight our investments for racking projects in process, building development and building acquisitions by major geographic region, their total expected investment and anticipated NOI and returns. Please note that these investments represent growth-related investments and exclude consolidated related spend. As you can see on this page, we achieved high returns on our growth racking and building development projects. So far this year, our investment in M&A and real estate investment activity has been lower than typical as we prepare for the potential Recall acquisition. We are focusing future plans on the synergy potential fueled by real estate consolidation between the companies.
Overall, we believe this was a solid quarter, and we're pleased with the progress we have made so far in advancing our Transformation program and stabilizing service gross margins. We remain on track to deliver our guidance for 2015 as well as our long-term objectives. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives our cash available to fund dividends and core growth investments. 
And with that, operator, we will now take questions."

One is the one set of data, the -- if we look at the price changes or the -- measured in revenue in terms of constant dollar storage, it's quarter-on-quarter. And when we look at volume, it's trailing 12 months. So you can't quite put the 2 of them together. But if you kind of look at North America, North America is achieving similar types net volume growth organically or before acquisitions as we were last year, so it's actually up in terms of volume. We've had some pricing adjustments this year -- this quarter due to some renewals, which, I think, we talked about a little bit on Investor Day. It's not unusual during certain times of the year. And if you go back over, let's say, the last 2 to 3 years, you'll see that we have maybe 2, 3, 4 quarters of positive internal storage revenue growth in North America. And then, it's punctuated by 1 or 2 quarters generally of negative, which is usually associated when we're doing renewals. But you can't -- because one set of data, in terms of we look at the revenue side, is quarter by quarter, you can't link that to volume, which is just on trailing 12 months. I don't know, Rod, if you want to add anything to that."

And what comes from the ""existing customers"" is as much to do in terms of the way we compensate our sales force. In other words, if they get something -- if they get some growth out of an existing customer, but we deemed it as a new area or new location or new department, then we call that a new sale. So I think there is some ebb and flow between the 2. And as you know, if we look at the heavily regulated industries, which we have, which is a big part of our business, I guess, a lot of that's affected by different litigation that's going on around the world.

So for instance, I just came back from Eastern Europe and took a couple of members of the board along with me so they could see up close what we're doing out there and also see some of the talent we've got. So Eastern Europe is growing. It continues to grow extremely well, but so does Latin America. I mean, the challenge in Latin America and Brazil, which is our largest operation, for instance, is in terms of growth. And if you measure it in Brazilian real, it is strongly double digit and continues to do well. I mean, the issue, of course, in places like Brazil is the translation of that because the real has been under pressure. And then, Asia, which is a smaller portion of our portfolio, but again, has very strong growth rates, whether you look at India, you look at places like Hong Kong, Singapore and China. The one thing I would point out, though, is that in markets -- even markets like Brazil, where we've been under pressure from a real standpoint and when you translate that in U.S. dollars, the growth may be muted slightly, is we've also been able, in some of these cases like Brazil, been able to borrow locally in real, which has helped hedge some of the translation. But I would say pretty much across-the-board. We haven't seen any slowdown in the Emerging Markets, and all the countries typically run in that low double digit of internal growth before acquisitions."

And the -- where we are at the stage is sometimes, the timing is not bad for us because we're using strong U.S. dollars to invest and build out this portfolio, which is still a relatively small portion in terms of the countries where the currency is mostly impacted, which is in the emerging markets. I'm not saying that the other markets aren't a factor. So if you say 40% of our sales are in foreign currency -- but the currencies that are impacted typically are in that a little less than 15% emerging market area. And those are areas where our OIBDA margins at this point are lower because we're building scale in those markets. So we're taking strong U.S. dollars to build out these markets right now. And their impact, even with the negative FX impact, the impact on OIBDA and earnings is muted. It's, obviously, fully affected at the revenue line. But when you see what happens to earnings, it's muted. So I agree. You need to model it out. But the earnings is not as sensitive as you might think to the FX, whereas you do see the full sensitivity at the -- on the revenue line.

So if you go back, say, to Q4 '13, right, you just look at the number of quarters, you'll see that North American storage rental revenue growth has gone negative 0.4%, negative 0.3%, plus 0.3%, plus 0.4%, plus 0.9%, plus 0.5%. And then in the last 2 quarters, a negative 0.1% and negative 0.3%. So you'll see, first of all, which I was referring to earlier, you'll see that moving around. You can kind of get that. You can back into that through the supplemental. And so on the revenue side, because if you can appreciate, when we renegotiate large enterprise deals that you do get -- in any given quarter, you can get a significant impact in terms of the revenue associated per cube. So there's a disconnect between that volume growth. Over a long period of time, though, if you look at the trend over a long period of time, we still see, if you take the revenue growth and our -- if you look on an annualized basis, we're getting between 0.5% and 1% in terms of price per cube growth. Then you get those 2 bits combined, and that will give you a good guide in terms of what the internal storage revenue growth is for a particular market. So the -- you're right to point out that we continue to drive significant, I'd say, on a percentage basis relatively small percentage growth in North America. But in terms of volume because of the size of the North American business, the law of large numbers, we continue to deliver significant amount of organic cube volume growth in North America. And over a 12-month period, you should think about 0.5% to 1% price growth on top of that cube growth. But any given quarter, depending on where we are in renewals cycles, especially for the large contracts, if you go back over the last, I don't know, 8, 9, 10 quarters, you'll see that movement around where we'll have 1 or 2 quarters where we'll be negative, 2 or 3 quarters will be positive, and it just kind of moves around."

We're pleased to report a solid third quarter results that were at the upper end of our profit expectations and underscore the durability of our core business. It is based upon this continued demonstration of the growth and durability of our business that our Board of Directors has resumed our growth in dividends and has pulled forward the dividend increase by declaring a quarterly cash dividend of $0.485 per share. 
I suspect most of you on the call today either attended in person or listened to the webcast of our Investor Day about 2 weeks ago. Therefore, I won't go into a long discussion of our strategy, goals or longer-term expectations, as I believe time would be better spent on Q&A.
That said, I would like to briefly reiterate a few main points from our event and relate how our Q3 results fit within that framework. For those who haven't heard the live event or listened to the replay, we laid out our vision for the year 2020, given that we are rapidly approaching the end of the 3-year strategic plan that we introduced at our Investor Day in the beginning of 2014.
More specifically, we described our past performance and go-forward vision for our 3 strategic pillars: Developed Markets, Emerging Markets and Adjacent Businesses. 
In Developed Markets, our strategic plan over the last 2 years has turned around these relatively flat internal growth markets and driven more than 7 million cubic feet of net new records, all prior to acquisition. 
In Emerging Markets, our sales expanded from representing 10% of total revenue in 2013 to 14.3% of total revenue by the end of Q3 on a constant dollar basis. These markets are growing 10% to 15% per year before acquisitions, and our goal to reach 20% of total volume from these markets by 2020 is within our grasp. Roughly 18% of the 20% goal will be reached by internal growth alone. 
In adjacent businesses, we expect revenue to represent 5% of our total worldwide revenue in 2020, up from just 2% today. Currently, our adjacent businesses are comprised of our data center business and our recently announced acquisition of Crozier Fine Arts storage, the leading art storage business in the U.S. This is a natural extension of our film and sound business. Crozier comes with about 0.5 million square feet of owned real estate and achieves about 10% sales growth per year before acquisitions. We anticipate closing this deal in December.
This all adds up to a shift in mix, with 25% of our revenue coming from faster growth markets and businesses by 2020. That's up from 15% today, with the majority of the increase coming from internal growth. The expected impact from this shift is that by 2020, annual internal profit will grow by roughly 5%, or 7% with acquisitions, versus 2% and 4% respectively today. 
We also enhanced our Transformation program to deliver a total of $125 million of overhead savings, up from the $100 million we announced this summer. You can see from the bridging schedules in the supplemental that we recorded $9 million of charges in Q3 related to this program. We expect to realize partial-year benefit of the first $50 million in savings in the fourth quarter, offsetting this charge. The full $50 million annualized benefit will flow through in 2016 and beyond, and our next set of actions to be taken in early 2016 will represent another $50 million of annualized savings in 2017. So we're getting more from our efforts in this program, and we're getting it faster than originally anticipated.
We outlined our plans to continue to increase the percentage of owned real estate over time through our programs which deliver improved operating economics with the consolidation of facilities. 
Lastly, we demonstrated future cash generation on a run rate basis to support growth in dividends and investment, both on a stand-alone basis and including Recall. 
On a stand-alone basis, the continued strong and durable cash-based business, coupled with the Transformation program, will, at a minimum, allow us to increase the dividend per share by 15% between 2015 and 2018 whilst reducing leverage by 0.4 of a turn. Including Recall, our minimum dividend per share delivers 24% growth between 2015 and 2018 and reduces leverage by 0.7 turns. This is all without issuing equity beyond the shares issued to purchase Recall.
Now turning to Q3 financial and operating highlights. Total revenue for the quarter grew by 2% on a constant dollar basis, reflecting continued solid storage rental gains of 4.2%. The impact from foreign currency on total revenues was roughly 7%, reflecting the continued strong appreciation of the dollar against several of our major functional currencies. Moreover, we should note that we did not have any meaningful acquisition activity this quarter as we deferred transactions to assess how they may be affected by the Recall acquisition. Having now fully assessed the benefit of the Recall acquisition, we have resumed M&A activity with an appropriately adjusted focus to account for Recall's footprint.
This quarter, we continued to see good internal growth, with storage rental up 2.8% for both the quarter and year-to-date, reflecting continued strong growth from Data Management, Other International and Western Europe. As we look at the remainder of the year, we are seeing consistent trends and are maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth in the mid-2% range. 
Looking at volume and records management, we added roughly 14 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a trailing 12-month basis, representing 2.7% net growth. Globally, we retained 98% of all customers. This is in line with our second quarter and a 20% improvement from the customer turnover we experienced just 2 years ago. 
We continue to see the same number of boxes being inbounded, some 30 million cubic feet, from our existing customers year-after-year, demonstrating the durability of the storage rental business. The durability of our business is demonstrated by solid growth in bookings we are seeing across major verticals. In addition, we are encouraged by year-to-date low double-digit increase in the mid-market customer bookings as we continue to increase our focus on these small to midsized enterprises where our market share of the total market is roughly 10%.
We are pleased to report solid improvement in our service gross margins as a result of numerous initiatives. Q3 total service gross margin was 28.5%. However, when normalizing for the reclassification between storage and service, Q3 total service gross margins were approximately 26.8%, and we are well on track to achieve our expected end-of-year run rate of between 27% and 27.5%.
Now let's turn to the Recall transaction. This deal is extremely compelling in terms of strategic fit and is supported by meaningful synergies that drive significant accretion. With the benefit from a number of months of detailed and joint integration planning with our Recall counterparts, we remain comfortable with the estimated total net synergies of $155 million, with $110 million of that to be achieved in 2017. As we've noted in the past, this is -- there is potential upside to these figures as we work through real estate consolidation opportunities. We remain on track from a regulatory standpoint, and we continue to target a close in early 2016.
As I've said previously, our business is underpinned by roughly $1.5 billion of net operating income, which is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability, and it is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance even in the most volatile times. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over now to Rod."

We're pleased with this quarter's strong operating performance and the momentum we continue to see in our business. Our results continue to underscore the strength and durability of our storage rental business and the incremental returns we're generating from our investments. 
Similar to Bill, my remarks this morning will be brief. I'll begin with an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date performance, including a review of results by segments, and an update on costs related to the potential Recall transaction. Finally, I will touch briefly on our outlook for 2015 and 2016.
Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. Referring to pages 8 and 9 of our supplemental, total reported revenues for the quarter were $747 million compared with $783 million in the prior year. This decline reflects the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which impacted total revenues by approximately 6.6% or $50 million year-over-year. Excluding FX, on a constant dollar basis revenues grew by 2%. Year-to-date reported revenues were $2.26 billion compared with $2.34 billion in 2014 and again, excluding FX, also grew by 2% on a constant dollar basis.
Total revenues were driven by solid constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of more than 4% for the quarter and year-to-date. This was offset by modest service revenue declines of roughly 1.3% for the quarter and 1.1% year-to-date. The decline in our constant dollar service revenue was partially driven by the disposition of our shredding businesses in the U.K. and Australia. 
Consistent with prior quarters, we are providing bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted earnings per share, which explain key variances in year-on-year performance. These schedules are on pages 20 through 22 of the supplemental. In addition, this quarter we are providing a bridging schedule on Page 23 to explain the change in our total service gross margin. In this schedule we have normalized for the accounting adjustment that Bill referenced, and our projected year-end run rate of 27% to 27.5% is consistent with that normalized basis.
Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $228 million compared with $235 million in 2014. Excluding FX, adjusted OIBDA was up 2.3%. Our adjusted OIBDA for Q3 '15 included $9 million of charges related to our Transformation program. Excluding these costs, adjusted OIBDA would have been $237 million or grown 6.5% on a normalized constant dollar basis. Year-to-date, adjusted OIBDA grew by 1.5% on a constant dollar basis. For the fourth quarter, we expect to incur very little in charges related to the Transformation initiative. Please note that our savings outlook for Transformation remain consistent with what we laid out on our Investor Day.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.31 per diluted share compared with $0.35 in the third quarter of '14. The decline in adjusted EPS year-on-year is driven by a 9% increase in share count related to the special distribution we made in Q4 of '14 as well as the restructuring charges related to Transformation. Excluding the increase in share count and the Transformation cost, normalized adjusted EPS grew by 8.7% for the quarter. 
Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out at 16.5% compared with 16.3% for the prior year and 13.9% in Q2. The sequential increase in our structural tax rate was driven by the expenses related to the Recall acquisition and debt refinancing costs, which lowered our QRS pretax income. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% in the short term. Our blended rates, following the close of the potential Recall acquisition, will be closer to 20%, as we noted when we announced the deal. 
Normalized funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.55 for the quarter and $1.53 year-to-date, while adjusted funds from operation, or AFFO, was $137 million for the quarter and $395 million year-to-date.
Let's turn to our financial performance by segment. In North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage rental revenue showed a decline of 0.3% for the third quarter and is flat year-to-date. North American RIM internal storage rental growth can vary on a quarterly basis and is often impacted by the timing of large contract renegotiations. For the last 8 quarters it has varied from 0.9% to minus 0.4%. North American RIM internal service revenue declined this quarter due to continued decrease in retrieve/refile activity levels and the timing of nonrecurring imaging projects that were in the year-ago period. Adjusted OIBDA margins in RIM remained solid at 40% for the quarter and year-to-date.
North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of more than 5% in both the third quarter and year-to-date. However, internal service revenue declined by 4.9% for the quarter and 4.1% year-to-date as we continue to see declines in tape rotation and related transportation activity in the business. During the third quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA margins remained strong at 51.6% compared with 50.8% in Q2. 
The Western Europe segment generated solid results, with 1.4% storage rental internal growth for the quarter and 2.8% year-to-date. Looking at internal service revenue, declines in activity were partially offset by increases in nonrecurring imaging and other projects. Adjusted OIBDA margins remained strong in Western Europe at 31.2%. 
The Other International segment, which is made up primarily of Emerging Markets and Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 11.5% for the quarter and 11.4% year-to-date. Service internal growth was 12.3% for the quarter and 10.9% year-to-date. We continue to expect adjusted OIBDA for this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the high teens and low-20s range in the short term as we expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets.
Let's touch on the Recall acquisition briefly. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, we're making good progress with the regulatory process, and we anticipate closing the deal early in 2016. To prepare for closing, this quarter we incurred approximately $15 million of professional and advisory fees, including cost to prepare for Recall's REIT conversion. We expect about $25 million to $30 million of additional Recall costs in the fourth quarter. Please note that these expenses are included -- excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculations as they are one-time in nature. Importantly, these costs were included in our guidance related to the Recall acquisition when we announced the deal.
As I mentioned at the outset, our outlook for 2015 and '16 remains consistent with the guidance we provided earlier this month at our Investor Day. The one exception to that is that we've tightened our expected real estate investment range and lowered it by roughly $30 million at the midpoint relative to the projections provided at our Investor Day due to the focus on and timing of our real estate consolidation program.
Given FX fluctuations and to provide better visibility of the underlying performance of our business, we're providing constant dollar guidance figures for 2016, and our plan is to continue that practice. Please note that our current 2016 guidance is based on 2015 constant dollar budget rates, which were set in January 2015. When we report full year '15 results in February, we will provide an updated 2016 guidance based on 2016 constant dollar budget rates, which will be set in early January 2016. 
We've got the question from some of you on our dollar guidance for 2016. Assuming constant September 30 FX rates, our exit FX impact for the quarter on total revenue, where approximately 40% of it is denominated in non-U.S. dollars, is roughly 3.5%. Again, holding that constant for 2016, it implies a 3.5% FX impact on revenues, which translates into roughly $120 million impact for the full year.
Beyond the dividend increase that Bill mentioned for the upcoming quarter, we laid out at our Investor Day a minimum projected dividend per share guidance through 2018 on a stand-alone basis and a combined basis with Recall. Please refer to the presentation and webcast for more details.
Late in September we raised $1 billion of debt at 6%, enabling us to pay off some of our very high-interest legacy debt and lowering our average interest cost. At the quarter end, we had liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion. Note that this figure is prior to the October 2015 redemption of our outstanding 6 3/4% euro notes, 7 3/4% U.S. notes and 8 3/8% U.S. notes. Following the redemption, liquidity will be approximately $900 million. Lastly, our lease adjusted debt ratio was 5.7x, as expected.
Turning now to Page 34 of the supplemental, where we highlight our investments for racking projects in process, building development and building acquisitions by major geographic region, their total expected investment and anticipated NOI and returns. Please note that these investments represent growth-related investments and exclude consolidated related spend. As you can see on this page, we achieved high returns on our growth racking and building development projects. So far this year our investment in M&A and real estate investment activity has been lower than typical as we prepare for the potential Recall acquisition. We are focusing future plans on the synergy potential fueled by real estate consolidation between the companies.
Overall, we believe this was a solid quarter, and we're pleased with the progress we have made so far in advancing our Transformation program and stabilizing service gross margins. We remain on track to deliver our guidance for 2015 as well as our long-term objectives. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives our cash available to fund dividends and core growth investments. 
And with that, operator, we will now take questions."

But if you kind of look at North America, North America is achieving similar types net volume growth organically or before acquisitions as we were last year, so it's actually up in terms of volume. 
We've had some pricing adjustments this year -- this quarter due to some renewals, which I think we talked about a little bit on Investor Day. It's not unusual during certain times of the year. And if you go back over, say, the last 2 to 3 years, you'll see that we have maybe 2, 3, 4 quarters of positive internal storage revenue growth in North America. And then it's punctuated by 1 or 2 quarters generally of negative, which is usually associated when we're doing renewals. But you can't -- because one set of data, in terms of we look at the revenue side, is quarter by quarter, you can't link that to volume, which is just on trailing 12 months.

And it's in that split between new sales growth and what comes from the ""existing customers"" is as much to do in terms of the way we compensate our sales force. In other words, if they get something -- if they get some growth out of an existing customer but we deemed it as a new area or new location or new department, then we call that a new sale. 
So I think there is some ebb and flow between the 2. And as you know, if we look at the heavily regulated industries, which we have, which is a big part of our business, a lot of that is affected by different litigation that's going on around the world.

Really what's behind that is the work that we've been doing on efficiencies around service margin and also around the Transformation efforts that we've referenced.

So for instance I just came back from Eastern Europe and took a couple members of the board along with me so they could see up close what we're doing out there and also see some of the talent we've got. 
So Eastern Europe is growing, continues to grow extremely well. But so does Latin America. I mean, the challenge in Latin America and Brazil, which is our largest operation, for instance, is in terms of growth. And if you measure it in Brazilian real, it is strongly double digit and continues to do well. I mean, the issue, of course, in places like Brazil is the translation of that because the real has been under pressure. 
And then Asia, which is a smaller portion of our portfolio, but again has very strong growth rates, whether you look at India or you look at places like Hong Kong, Singapore and China. 
The one thing I would point out, though, is that in markets -- even markets like Brazil where we've been under pressure from a real standpoint, so when you translate that in U.S. dollars the growth may be muted slightly, is we've also been able in some of these cases like Brazil been able to borrow locally in real, which has helped hedge some of that translation. 
But I would say pretty much across the board we haven't seen any slowdown in the Emerging Markets. And all the countries typically run in that low double digit of internal growth before acquisitions."

And  the -- where we are in the stage is, in some sense the timing is not bad for us because we're using strong U.S. dollars to invest and build out this portfolio, which is still a relatively small portion in terms of the countries where the currency is mostly impacted, which is in the emerging markets. I'm not saying that the other markets aren't a factor. 
So if you say 40% of our sales are in foreign currency -- but the currencies that are impacted typically are in that little less than 15% emerging market area. And those are areas where our OIBDA margins at this point are lower because we're building scale in those markets. So we're taking strong U.S. dollars to build out these markets right now. And their impact, even with the negative FX impact, the impact on OIBDA and earnings is muted. It's obviously fully affected at the revenue line, but when you see what happens to earnings it's muted. 
So I agree; you need to model it out. But the earnings is not as sensitive as you might think to the FX, whereas you do see the full sensitivity at the -- on the revenue line. That's why we feel comfortable about already starting to increase our dividend, because we feel that we've got enough momentum in the business that we can continue and start our -- start back on our growth trend in terms of dividends."

So if you go back, say, to Q4 '13, right, and you just look at the number of quarters, you'll see that North American storage rental revenue growth has gone negative 0.4%, negative 0.3%, plus 0.3%, plus 0.4%, plus 0.9%, plus 0.5%. And then in the last 2 quarters a negative 0.1% and negative 0.3%. So you'll see, first of all, which I was referring to earlier, you'll see that moving around. You can kind of get that. You can back into that out through the supplemental. 
And so on the revenue side, because if you can appreciate, when we renegotiate large enterprise deals, that you do get -- in any given quarter you can get a significant impact in terms of the revenue associated per cube. So there's a disconnect between that volume growth. 
Over a long period of time, though, if you look at the trend over a long period of time, we still see, if you take the revenue growth and our -- if you look on an annualized basis, we're getting between 0.5% and 1% in terms of price per cube growth. Then you get those 2 bits combined, and that will give you a good guide in terms of what the internal storage revenue growth is for a particular market. 
So the -- you're right to point out that we continue to drive significant -- I'd say on a percentage basis relatively small percentage growth in North America. But in terms of volume, because of the size of the North American business, the law of large numbers, we continue to deliver significant amount of organic cube volume growth in North America. And over a 12-month period you should think about 0.5% to 1% price growth on top of that cube growth. 
But any given quarter, depending on where we are in renewals cycles, especially for the large contracts, if you go back over the last, I don't know, 8, 9, 10 quarters, you'll see that movement around where we'll have 1 or 2 quarters where it will be negative, 2 or 3 quarters it will be positive, and it just kind of moves around."

Is there -- we had seen kind of a run-up. That whole organic number had been going trending up from the middle of 2013 through basically 3Q '14, and then we're starting to see that coming down. Is there any color you can give to that, those numbers moving in that direction?"
