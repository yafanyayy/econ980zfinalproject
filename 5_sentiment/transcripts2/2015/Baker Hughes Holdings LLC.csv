We delivered strong results to end a record year for Baker Hughes. I expect 2015 to be pivotal in many ways for our company and our industry, and I will provide you with our views on the marketplace later in the call. But first, let me provide perspective on the prior year and the fourth quarter. We entered 2014 with a number of strategic initiatives, which we communicated at our analyst conference in May. We plan to leverage our strength in well construction to grow share in deepwater and unconventional markets, and we wanted to establish differentiating positions in our well production and midstream product lines with technology development. 
We also outlined 3 financial targets: First, to raise margins in the Western Hemisphere, targeting the mid-teens in North America by year's end; second, was to achieve double-digit revenue growth in the Eastern Hemisphere; and third, was to maintain capital discipline and deliver strong free cash flow. Achieving these performance objectives would require managing our business more efficiently and delivering on our strategy to convert innovations into earnings. That means leveraging our strength in technology development and our global supply chain to deliver differentiating new products and services, which are designed to solve our customers 3 biggest challenges: Efficient well construction, optimized well production and increased ultimate recovery. 
Cornerstone of this strategy is to accelerate new product development and to maximize returns early in the product life cycle. One of the targets that we shared at our conference was to increase the revenue generated from products within the first 12 months after they have been commercialized. We set an ambitious target of $1 billion in revenue for the year, a 20% increase over the prior year. 
During the year, our Global Products and Services group introduced more than 160 new products and services to the market. That means, on average, we brought a new solution to the marketplace every 55 hours. 
Now let me share a few examples of technologies, which are reshaping our industry and our financial performance. Among the most impactful innovations we have brought to market has been our ProductionWave solution, which integrates cutting-edge artificial lift technologies with production chemicals and remote monitoring services to optimize production in the unconventionals. ProductionWave has come to market at the right time and at the right price point to become a true differentiator. And today, we already have approximately 5,000 ProductionWave solutions installed in North America and a growing number of international markets. Not surprisingly, artificial lift was our fastest-growing product line in 2014. FASTrak is also gaining momentum. This technology remains the world's only commercially available service designed to reduce reservoir uncertainty and maximize ultimate recovery by analyzing and extracting samples while drilling. This service has seen strong demand in exploration markets with deployments in 13 different countries across each of our operating segments, and is part of the reason why we've increased our share of drilling services in virtually every deepwater market around the world. SHADOW Plug is another example of a recent technology breakthrough. By leverage our strength in Completion Systems and material sciences, we created the world's first large bore plug, which incorporates a disintegrating metallic ball. This innovation eliminates the need to mill out plugs following well completion, removing a critical barrier to achieving unlimited lateral length and expanding the possibilities of well construction altogether. Sales for Shadow Plug grew exponentially over the year with fourth quarter sales exceeding the first 3 quarters combined. 
These are just a few of the innovations we placed on big bets on, and these are better paying off creating value for our customers, differentiation for Baker Hughes and more than $1 billion in revenue for new products. 
We also highlighted that our focus is squarely on execution and outcomes. In North America, we set out to completely transform our largest product line, our Pressure Pumping business. This is part of a multi-year initiative we put in place shortly after I became CEO. The plan include the key investments, modernize our supply chain, deployment of new technologies to drive efficiencies at the well site and relentless pursuit of the larger, more efficient customers. In North America, results are a reflection of this plan in action. For the fourth quarter, I'm pleased to report that our U.S. Pressure Pumping margins were the highest they've been in 3 years. Taking a look at our international operations, we are also seeing the benefit of investments made over the last few years leading to significant contract wins in Brazil, Norway Angola and the Middle East. At the same time, we made a tough decision to exit some projects that weren't generating satisfactory returns. In Iraq,  we demobilized on a major contract this summer freeing up resources to be redeployed to more profitable projects in the region, contributing to better margins in our Middle East/Asia Pacific segment and profitability in Iraq. In Libya, we shut down our onshore operations there and reorganized our North African geomarket allowing us to service the offshore from neighboring countries. During the fourth quarter, North Africa margins were at their highest level since the geomarket was formed more than 5 years ago. In Venezuela, we altered our business model by partnering with local providers, allowing us to maintain support for this vital oil-producing country, while at the same time, significantly reducing our working capital exposure. Today, our net receivables in Venezuela are less than 1% of our total receivables balance, a fraction of what is used to be a couple of years ago. Across all of our international operations, we're seeing increased earnings from investments made to modernize our infrastructure and enhance our global supply chain. 
During the fourth quarter, we delivered the highest volume of year end product sales in the history of Baker Hughes. Our manufacturing, operations and supply chain teams all worked in concert to fabricate, sell and deliver an unprecedented volume of Completion Systems, drilling assemblies, artificial lift products and wireline technologies to customers across Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. Compared to the previous year, fourth quarter product sales increased nearly 20%, a remarkable example of execution and a solid way to punctuate the end of a very positive year. We also grew our Industrial segment and increased our capabilities to the acquisition of a complementary pipeline services business. In alignment with our strategy to help customers optimize production, Baker Hughes has established a differentiating and very unique position in the midstream space with unmatched capabilities in Process and Pipeline Services and downstream chemicals. By executing our strategy and managing our business more efficiently, we delivered on each of the performance objectives we set out to achieve for the year. We increased share in deepwater with major wins in Brazil, Angola and Norway. We'd strengthened our position in the unconventionals with technologies like Shadow Plug, by transforming our Pressure Pumping business. We established a differentiating position in well production with ProductionWave, and through acquisition, we have established a very unique position in the midstream market. We ended the year with 15% margins in North America and 20% margins in Latin America. And in the east, we achieved 12% growth over the prior year. 
We achieved these performance objectives while maintaining capital discipline and reducing our cash conversion cycle and delivered the highest free cash flow in the history of Baker Hughes. And we converted these results into greater shareholder returns, we repurchased more shares and increased our dividends all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. But without a doubt, the most notable highlight of the year was secured late in the fourth quarter with the successful negotiation and signing of the merger agreement with Halliburton. We fully expect the closing of this transaction to deliver a premium to our shareholders in the near term and provide a long-term opportunity to benefit from the future upside of the combined companies. We fully believe in the potential of the combined companies to better serve customers with a broad suite of products and technology and to create more opportunities for employees over the long term.  Under the leadership of Mark and Belgacem, our integration teams are developing plans for an efficient and thoughtful integration, and I am very pleased with the progress to date. 
Until the transaction closes, our focus remains on execution and navigating the current market downturn. Late in the fourth quarter, we began to see the first evidence that customers are pulling back activity as reflected in the North American rig count. This is the beginning of a trend which will continue to unfold in the weeks and months ahead. Later in today's call, I'll share my thoughts on what the near-term outlook is for our industry, what we are doing to adjust our business accordingly, and why I'm confident that Baker Hughes has the right people, the right technology and the right strategy to remain strong in the months ahead. But first, let me turn it over to Kimberly Ross who I am pleased to welcome to her first earnings call for Baker Hughes, to provide additional details on the quarter. Kimberly?"
19007,279886095,747031,"Baker Hughes Incorporated, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2015",2015-01-20,"Earnings Calls","Baker Hughes Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported revenues for the fourth quarter of $6.6 billion, a record for Baker Hughes, and an increase of $385 million or 6% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was also a record at $1,4",1530,"Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported revenues for the fourth quarter of $6.6 billion, a record for Baker Hughes, and an increase of $385 million or 6% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was also a record at $1,450,000,000, up 22% sequentially. On a GAAP basis, net income attributable to Baker Hughes for the fourth quarter was $663 million or $1.52 per sheet. Adjusted net income excludes a $34 million before and after-tax gain or $0.08 per share resulting from the deconsolidation of a joint venture in North Africa. The effective tax rate on adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was 31.5%, a reduction from the previous quarter due to the recent extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit and a more favorable geographic mix of sales. As a result, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $629 million or $1.44 per share. Compared to the previous quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased $0.42 or 41%. 
Taking a closer look at our results from operations. We posted record revenue in North America of $3.3 billion, up 5% sequentially. North America operating profit was $488 million, and operating profit margin was 14.8%, an increase of 270 basis points versus the prior quarter and in line with the goal we communicated a year ago. The increased profitability is attributed primarily to improved pricing and utilization in our U.S. Pressure Pumping business, along with increased contribution from our Gulf of Mexico and Canadian geomarkets. In North America onshore, we maintain high activity throughout most of the quarter and saw increased demand for new introduced well construction and well production technologies. As a result, the segment delivered record revenues across most product lines, including Pressure Pumping, artificial lift, Upstream Chemicals, Completion Systems and drill bits. Offshore, delays caused by movements in the previous quarter began to dissipate in November. When coupled with the large backlog of deepwater simulation activity, we saw a solid rebound in our Gulf of Mexico business for the quarter. 
Moving to international results. We posted revenue of $2,950,000,000, which is a 7% increase versus the prior quarter. Operating profit was $545 million, and operating profit margin was 18.4%. This represents an increase of 490 basis points compared to adjusted results in the prior quarter. Each of our international operating segments posted increased revenue in margins with the strongest incremental operating profit coming from Middle East/Asia Pacific. This segment remains our fastest-growing business and delivered an impressive 13% top line growth sequentially, along with a 430 basis point increase in operating profit margins. Profitable growth was achieved through an exceptionally rich mix of year end product sales across the region, along with record revenue in drilling services, artificial lift and Pressure Pumping. Completion Systems also delivered record revenue and delivered a major well construction project on our integrated operation in Malaysia. We also saw a positive contribution from Iraq, which was profitable in the fourth quarter. We similarly posted record revenue in our Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian segment, along with an increase in operating profit margins of 410 basis points compared to adjusted results in the third quarter. This segment benefited from solid activity in our Angola, Continental Europe and Nigeria geomarket, along with strong year end product sales across Africa and the Russian Caspian region. The region also profited from cost-reduction measures taken in the previous quarter in response to activity disruptions in North Africa leading to higher margins. Strong margin improvement was also delivered in Latin America where we posted a 4% increase in revenue, along with a 750 basis point increase in operating profit margins. This segment benefited from record revenue in artificial lift as a result of exceptionally high year end product sales, particularly in the Andean region. Additionally, our drilling service product line delivered strong performance and secured additional share in Brazil, resulting in improved profitability for that geomarket. Our Latin America segment ended the year as our highest margin operation worldwide. This is a remarkable turnaround for a business that was unprofitable only 6 quarters ago. 
For our Industrial Services segment, revenue for the fourth quarter was $377 million, which is a 13% increase sequentially. This increase includes a full quarter's revenue contribution from the newly added pipeline services group which we acquired late in the third quarter. Industrial Services operating profit margins were 6.1% reflecting seasonal reductions in activity, along with costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the new business. 
Looking at cash flow and the balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, we generated $838 million in free cash flow, a record for Baker Hughes. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.7 billion, which is an increase of $531 million or 44% over the prior quarter. Total debt for the quarter declined by $280 million or 6% sequentially to $4.1 billion, and we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 18%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $503 million. 
As we look ahead, we see that market dynamics are evolving rapidly. Customer budgets are being reset, activity levels are declining and currencies continue to fluctuate. The further we look beyond the quarter, the greater the lack of clarity. As a result, we're approaching this year one quarter at a time. 
With that said, in North America, for the first quarter, we expect the U.S. onshore rig count will continue to drop as customers reduce capital spending. The average U.S. rig count in the first quarter is projected to be approximately 15% lower than the fourth quarter average. Additionally, we are seeing a growing inventory of wells drilled but not completed, as some customers are reluctant to delay completions and defer productions. In Canada, we would normally expect to see peak activity levels in the first quarter. However, this year, rig counts are expected to remain relatively flat until spring when activity normally drops sharply. As a result of the reduction in overall activity in North America, we project decreased demand for our well construction product lines. In general, well production product lines such as our artificial lift and production chemicals should be more insulated in the short term. 
Turning to international markets. We expect to see rig counts begin to slowly decline in some offshore and shallow water market such as Continental Europe, Mexico, Australia, Iraq and the North Sea. International markets, which should remain more resilient in the short term, include emerging unconventional place like Argentina and deepwater markets such as Brazil and Angola. Nigeria is the exception where activity levels are likely to decline and remain suppressed until the upcoming election is concluded. 
In contrast to the declining activity predicted in many parts of the world, several Middle Eastern countries are expected to see a modest increase in activity in the near term. Also as a reminder, seasonal product sales, which were exceptionally high in the fourth quarter, are not expected to repeat in the first quarter of this year. 
In summary, in addition to a sharp drop in product sales, we expect to see reduced well construction activity in most of our geographical operating segments in the first quarter. With the highest declines in North America, followed by our Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian segment. These segments will see reduced volumes of work almost immediately, and all markets may see pricing pressures as the worldwide demand for well construction services continues to compress. 
For Latin America, we expect to offset some of the activity declines with an increased share of drilling services in Brazil. Similarly, activity declines in Asia Pacific will be partially offset by increased activity in parts of the Middle East. For Industrial Services segment, we expect seasonal reductions in our Process and Pipeline Services business resulting in a drop in revenue. Margins, however, should improve modestly as acquisition and integration costs incurred in the fourth quarter are reduced. 
With respect to nonoperational items. Interest expense for the year is expected to be approximately $240 million, and the effective tax rate should remain in the low- to mid-30s, excluding any discrete items. For 2015, our goal is to remain nimble and maintain a strong focus on asset utilization, working capital and returns. We plan to proactively adapt to changing market conditions by rightsizing our cost structure to reflect near-term activity levels. While this work is still in progress, based on current estimates, we expect to undertake a workforce reduction of 7,000, most of which to take place in the first quarter. As a result, we expect to book a one-time charge in the range of $160 million to $185 million for severance. Additionally, we are reviewing our operations for potential asset impairment such as facility closures. At the same time, we plan to increase the rigor around the process of capital deployment. To that end, we expect to reduce capital expenditures by 20% compared to last year. We enter the cycle well positioned financially and strategically. At the same time, we will continue to monitor market conditions closely, adapt with agility and remain focused on returns, all while maintaining a strong culture of safety, compliance and controls. 
At this point, I would like to turn the call back over to Martin. Martin?"

As Kimberly just mentioned, our industry is clearly in the early stages of a down cycle. The same sort of cycle we enter once or twice a decade. As with past cycles, the early days are always marked with a high degree of uncertainty, which customers will cut spending and by how much, how fast will rig counts drop and where, and when are we going to reach the bottom. And we don't have precise answers to all these questions and no one, frankly, does. But we've through this before and many times, in fact. But we've learned in the past that as when the market turns down, it turns swiftly. In each of the last 3 downturns dating back to the '90s, we've seen North America rig counts fall between 40% and 60% in the space of only 12 months. International rigs don't tend to fall as sharply but begin to drop steadily a couple months after the first signs of weakness appear in North America. And we see no reason to believe that this cycle is going to be an any different for we've navigated changing market conditions many times, both the downcycle and the eventual up cycle. 
The coming months are going to be challenging but Baker Hughes is very well positioned financially and strategically to navigate the near term efficiently. We know that the key to success is to move quickly, act decisively and to never lose focus on your customers or your core competency, and for Baker Hughes, our core is innovation. This industry can't simply hope and wait for oil to climb back over $100 a barrel, instead, we must adapt to a new reality of sustained lower commodity prices. A major element in this new reality will be technology. And to that end, we are continuing our investment in fundamental research and product development because our customers need for innovative new products is more critical than ever before. 
Today, our scientists and research engineers are focused on redefining what is possible and reshaping the limits of the industries 3 fundamental challenges: Lowering the cost of well construction; optimizing well production; and increasing ultimate recoveries. We are exploring new uses for recent discoveries and nanotechnology to reduce the cost of an unconventional well. We are researching new sensors and new metallurgy capable of increasing production from ultra-deepwater reservoirs. We launched the breakthrough new chemical product called JETTISON, which removes oil from solids in production stream reducing our customers' refining costs. And given the outstanding success of for ProductionWave that I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have greatly accelerated the research and engineering of a new product called Leap, the same artificial lift concept we unveiled at our analyst conference. This technology has the potential to completely redefine production management and low rate wells, and is the latest demonstration of our leadership and production enhancement solutions. 
These are just a few of the opportunities we've been working on, and it demonstrates that our strategy transcends market conditions and supports our purpose to enable safe, affordable energy, improving peoples lives. Longer term, the outlook for our industry remains strong. The world's demand for energy will continue to climb and the supply of energy will continue to increase in complexity requiring greater service intensity and more advanced technologies. In the meantime, we remain committed to our strategy focused on execution, dedicated to safe, reliable service and relentless in our pursuit of positive outcomes for the coming year. So with that, Trey, let's go ahead and take some questions."

So in the Pressure Pumping world, we're starting to certainly have some serious discussions with the customers around bringing down the prices and helping them adjust the costs. Look at around 4 to 5 rig per frac in terms of utilization. So as those rigs start coming out, there's going to be some capacity brought in the market. And there's no doubt that product lines are first to witness it. And it will cascade to the others, and again, I think, from your perspective, the more capital intensive, generally, the more pressure it's going to come under first. But in terms of some of the other ones, such as artificial lift and chemicals, make up a significant part of our North American portfolio, I fully expect those to be, not fully insulated, but more insulated, if you will.  And on a geographic basis, Gulf of Mexico will be the least to be -- or last to be affected.

You obviously have a nice risk profile, both -- I think subsurface as well as above the surface, if you will. I think our customers are increasingly appreciating that. As well, I think the customer mix in the Gulf of Mexico has a little bit more of steady tendency to it. So now again my comments are more related to the more deeper water. The shelf in the Gulf of Mexico is already starting to come under some pressure, and I think part of that has associated with the customer mix. The other item I'd highlight as it relates to us, Byron, is our position with the floating capacity, the vessels. And you're aware of those, and we have a very large contract that we secured for super major in the Gulf, multi-year with some pretty much nice terms and conditions and I take my hat off to the folks who run the business there. But secondly, the foresight to put a vessel like that, it is so unique in its capabilities, I think sets us up pretty well going forward. Whatever turmoil the Gulf should see, but of those 3 deepwater markets you highlighted, I'd tell you, in my opinion, the Gulf of Mexico will be the most steady."

Jim, I think I'd comment it this way. Let me start with this. We have to accept the fact that when your customer community is struggling to produce a healthy return on its capital, particularly the IOCs, on the international front, it's going to post a challenge for the service community. And our customers have not been doing very well on that front. Secondly, on the other hand, the geological success, as some of our key customers have reported over the last couple of quarters, over the last couple of years, internationally, has not been great either. So that doesn't bode well for increasing us from the supply side. So you should see eventually some kind of balancing out of oil prices, which will settle the market down, but when it happens and at what price, it's still very much up in the air and that kind of dictates what it's going to mean for us. Again I go back to the earlier comments I made. As we sit around the world, this company has never been stronger, whether it's the talent in place, whether it's the portfolio, whether it's the adherence to processes and controls and supply chain infrastructure, proof line, whatever it is. So whatever the market will throw to us over the next couple of years, and you're right on, it's a very difficult thing to predict, this company is very well positioned to perform better than I think that's any time in its history."

I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you're navigating through your customer base in North America? You've been doing a great job of building up utilization throughout the year. I'm going to assume that fourth quarter, you were largely at capacity. How do you expect that to play out? I know it's a tough question over the next couple of quarters. But are you trying to keep the utilization as high as possible? Or I'm just kind of curious because you're thinking as we head into this one?"

Let me just also remind you though that the whole business doesn't revolve around -- I know certainly, it's been impactful to everybody's number, the Pressure Pumping business.

Let me just also remind you though that the whole business doesn't revolve around -- I know certainly, it's been impactful to everybody's number, the Pressure Pumping business. But it's a multi-faceted discussion. To your point on utilization, obviously, again that's around, again, capital intensive the business like Pressure Pumping, pumping, but that's kind of where it stops. And so yes, utilization is extremely important. Next to price, and that's kind of business, that's your biggest profit driver and the discussions with customers, they're still looking for every bit of efficiency that they can achieve. And to the degree that we can bring a broader solution to the problems, where the drilling and drilling completion set and formation evaluation, all the way through the production cycle, we're going to continue to do that for the purpose of keeping everything active. But as I said earlier, 4 to 5 rigs per frac fleet is generally dependent on the basic what we see and there's no doubt that as the quarters unfold here, you're going to see capacity getting stuck because it just doesn't make any sense to keep it running. So I don't know if that answers your question, but that's the best I can do."

Let me start by saying that I am very pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter. We delivered strong results to end a record year for Baker Hughes.

We delivered strong results to end a record year for Baker Hughes. I expect 2015 to be pivotal in many ways for our company and our industry, and I will provide you with our views on the marketplace later in the call. 
But first, let me provide perspective on the prior year and the fourth quarter. We entered 2014 with a number of strategic initiatives, which we communicated at our analyst conference in May. We planned to leverage our strength in well construction, to grow share in deepwater and unconventional markets, and we wanted to establish differentiating positions in our well production and midstream product lines with technology development.  
We also outlined 3 financial targets: first, to raise margins in the Western Hemisphere, targeting the mid-teens in North America by year's end; second was to achieve double-digit revenue growth in the Eastern Hemisphere; and third was to maintain capital discipline and deliver strong free cash flow. Achieving these performance objectives would require managing our business more efficiently and delivering on our strategy to convert innovations into earnings. That means leveraging our strength in technology development and our global supply chain to deliver differentiating new products and services, which are designed to solve our customers' 3 biggest challenges: efficient well construction, optimized well production and increased ultimate recovery.  
Cornerstone of this strategy is to accelerate new product development and to maximize returns early in the product life cycle. One of the targets that we shared at our conference was to increase the revenue generated from products within the first 12 months after they have been commercialized. We set an ambitious target of $1 billion in revenue for the year, a 20% increase over the prior year. During the year, our Global Products and Services group introduced more than 160 new products and services to the market. That means, on average, we brought a new solution to the marketplace every 55 hours. 
Now let me share a few examples of technologies, which are reshaping our industry and our financial performance. Among the most impactful innovations we have brought to market has been our ProductionWave solution, which integrates cutting-edge artificial lift technologies with production chemicals and remote monitoring services to optimize production in the unconventionals. ProductionWave has come to market at the right time and at the right price point to become a true differentiator. And today, we already have approximately 5,000 ProductionWave solutions installed in North America and a growing number of international markets. Not surprisingly, artificial lift was our fastest-growing product line in 2014. 
FASTrak is also gaining momentum. This technology remains the world's only commercially available service designed to reduce reservoir uncertainty and maximize ultimate recovery by analyzing and extracting samples while drilling. This service has seen strong demand in exploration markets with deployments in 13 different countries across each of our operating segments and is part of the reason why we've increased our share of drilling services in virtually every deepwater market around the world. 
SHADOW plug is another example of a recent technology breakthrough. By leveraging our strength in completion systems and material sciences, we created the world's first large bore plug, which incorporates a disintegrating metallic ball. This innovation eliminates the need to mill out plugs following well completion, removing a critical barrier to achieving unlimited lateral length and expanding the possibilities of well construction altogether. Sales for SHADOW plug grew exponentially over the year with fourth quarter sales exceeding the first 3 quarters combined. 
These are just a few of the innovations we placed some big bets on and these bets are paying off, creating value for our customers, differentiation for Baker Hughes and more than $1 billion in revenue for new products.  
We also highlighted that our focus is squarely on execution and outcomes. In North America, we set out to completely transform our largest product line, our Pressure Pumping business. This is part of a multiyear initiative we put in place shortly after I became CEO. The plan included key investments, modernize our supply chain, deployment of new technologies to drive efficiencies at the well site and the relentless pursuit of contracts with larger, more efficient customers. In North America, results are a reflection of this plan in action. For the fourth quarter, I'm pleased to report that our U.S. Pressure Pumping margins were the highest they've been in 3 years. 
Taking a look at our international operations, we are also seeing the benefit of investments made over the last few years, leading to significant contract wins in Brazil, Norway, Angola and the Middle East. At the same time, we made the tough decision to exit some projects that weren't generating satisfactory returns. In Iraq, we demobilized on a major contract this summer, freeing up resources to be redeployed to more profitable projects in the region, contributing to better margins in our Middle East/Asia Pacific segment and profitability in Iraq. In Libya, we shut down our onshore operations there and reorganized our North African geomarket, allowing us to service the offshore safely and efficiently from neighboring countries. During the fourth quarter, North Africa margins were at their highest level since the geomarket was formed more than 5 years ago. In Venezuela, we altered our business model by partnering with local providers, allowing us to maintain support for this vital oil-producing country while, at the same time, significantly reducing our working capital exposure. Today, our net receivables in Venezuela are less than 1% of our total receivables balance, a fraction of what it used to be only a couple of years ago. Across all of our international operations, we are seeing increased earnings from investments made to modernize our infrastructure and enhance our global supply chain.  
During the fourth quarter, we delivered the highest volume of year-end product sales in the history of Baker Hughes. Our manufacturing, operations and supply chain teams all worked in concert to fabricate, sell and deliver an unprecedented volume of completion systems, drilling assemblies, artificial lift products and wireline technologies to customers across Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. Compared to the previous year, fourth quarter product sales increased nearly 20%, a remarkable example of execution and a solid way to punctuate the end of a very positive year. 
We also grew our Industrial segment and increased our capabilities through the acquisition of a complementary pipeline services business. In alignment with our strategy to help customers optimize production, Baker Hughes has established a differentiating and very unique position in the midstream space with unmatched capabilities in process and pipeline services and downstream chemicals. 
By executing our strategy and managing our business more efficiently, we delivered on each of the performance objectives we set out to achieve for the year. We increased share in deepwater with major wins in Brazil, Angola and Norway. We'd strengthened our position in the unconventionals with technologies like SHADOW plug and by transforming our pressure pumping business. We established a differentiating position in well production with ProductionWave, and through acquisition, we have established a very unique position in the midstream market. 
We ended the year with 15% margins in North America and 20% margins in Latin America. And in the east, we achieved 12% growth over the prior year. We achieved these performance objectives while maintaining capital discipline and reducing our cash conversion cycle and delivered the highest free cash flow in the history of Baker Hughes, and we converted these results into greater shareholder returns. We repurchased more shares and increased our dividend, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
But without a doubt, the most notable highlight of the year was secured late in the fourth quarter with the successful negotiation and signing of the merger agreement with Halliburton. We fully expect the closing of this transaction to deliver a premium to our shareholders in the near term and provide a long-term opportunity to benefit from the future upside of the combined companies. We fully believe in the potential of the combined companies to better serve customers with a broad suite of products and technology and to create more opportunities for employees over the long term. Under the leadership of Mark and Belgacem, our integration teams are developing plans for an efficient and thoughtful integration, and I am very pleased with the progress to date.  
Until the transaction closes, our focus remains on execution and navigating the current market downturn. Late in the fourth quarter, we began to see the first evidence that customers are pulling back activity as reflected in the North American rig count. This is the beginning of a trend which will continue to unfold in the weeks and months ahead. Later in today's call, I'll share my thoughts on what the near-term outlook is for our industry, what we are doing to adjust our business accordingly and why I am confident that Baker Hughes has the right people, the right technology and the right strategy to remain strong in the months ahead. 
But first, let me turn it over to Kimberly Ross, who I am pleased to welcome to her first earnings call for Baker Hughes, to provide additional details on the quarter. Kimberly?"

Today, we reported revenue for the fourth quarter of $6.6 billion, a record for Baker Hughes and an increase of $385 million or 6% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was also a record at $1,450",1528,"Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported revenue for the fourth quarter of $6.6 billion, a record for Baker Hughes and an increase of $385 million or 6% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was also a record at $1,450,000,000, up 22% sequentially. On a GAAP basis, net income attributable to Baker Hughes for the fourth quarter was $663 million or $1.52 per sheet. Adjusted net income excludes a $34 million before and after tax gain or $0.08 per share, resulting from the deconsolidation of a joint venture in North Africa. The effective tax rate on adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was 31.5%, a reduction from the previous quarter due to the recent extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit and a more favorable geographic mix of sales. As a result, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $629 million or $1.44 per share. Compared to the previous quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased $0.42 or 41%.  
Taking a closer look at our results from operations. We posted record revenue in North America of $3.3 billion, up 5% sequentially. North America operating profit was $488 million and operating profit margin was 14.8%, an increase of 270 basis points versus the prior quarter and in line with the goal we communicated a year ago. The increased profitability is attributed primarily to improved pricing and utilization in our U.S. Pressure Pumping business, along with increased contribution from our Gulf of Mexico and Canadian geomarkets. 
In North America onshore, we maintained high activity levels throughout most of the quarter and saw increased demand for newly introduced well construction and well production technologies. As a result, the segment delivered record revenue across most product lines, including pressure pumping, artificial lift, upstream chemicals, completion systems and drill bits. Offshore, delays caused by movements in the previous quarter began to dissipate in November. When coupled with a large backlog of deepwater simulation activity, we saw a solid rebound in our Gulf of Mexico business for the quarter.  
Moving to international results. We posted revenue of $2,950,000,000, which is a 7% increase versus the prior quarter. Operating profit was $545 million, and operating profit margin was 18.4%. This represents an increase of 490 basis points compared to adjusted results in the prior quarter. Each of our international operating segments posted increased revenue in margins with the strongest incremental operating profit coming from Middle East/Asia Pacific. This segment remains our fastest-growing business and delivered an impressive 13% top line growth sequentially, along with a 430 basis point increase in operating profit margins. Profitable growth was achieved through an exceptionally rich mix of year-end product sales across the region, along with record revenue in drilling services, artificial lift and pressure pumping. Completion systems also delivered record revenue and delivered a major well construction project on our integrated operation in Malaysia. We also saw a positive contribution from Iraq, which was profitable in the fourth quarter. 
We similarly posted record revenue in our Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian segment, along with an increase in operating profit margins of 410 basis points compared to adjusted results in the third quarter. This segment benefited from solid activity in our Angola, Continental Europe and Nigeria geomarkets, along with strong year-end product sales across Africa and the Russian Caspian region. The region also profited from cost-reduction measures taken in the previous quarter in response to activity disruptions in North Africa leading to higher margins. Strong margin improvement was also delivered in Latin America, where we posted a 4% increase in revenue, along with a 750 basis point increase in operating profit margins. This segment benefited from record revenue in artificial lift as a result of exceptionally high year-end product sales, particularly in the Andean region. Additionally, our drilling service product line delivered strong performance and secured additional share in Brazil, resulting in improved profitability for that geomarket. Our Latin America segment ended the year as our highest margin operation worldwide. This is a remarkable turnaround for a business that was unprofitable only 6 quarters ago.  
For our Industrial Services segment, revenue for the fourth quarter was $377 million, which is a 13% increase sequentially. This increase includes a full quarter's revenue contribution from the newly added pipeline services group, which we acquired late in the third quarter. Industrial Services operating profit margins were 6.1% reflecting seasonal reductions in activity, along with costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the new business. 
Looking at cash flow and the balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, we generated $838 million in free cash flow, a record for Baker Hughes. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.7 billion, which is an increase of $531 million or 44% over the prior quarter. Total debt for the quarter declined by $280 million or 6% sequentially to $4.1 billion, and we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 18%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $503 million.  
As we look ahead, we see that market dynamics are evolving rapidly. Customer budgets are being reset, activity levels are declining and currencies continue to fluctuate. The further we look beyond the quarter, the greater the lack of clarity. As a result, we're approaching this year one quarter at a time.  
With that said, in North America, for the first quarter, we expect the U.S. onshore rig count will continue to drop as customers reduce capital spending. The average U.S. rig count in the first quarter is projected to be approximately 15% lower than the fourth quarter average. Additionally, we're seeing a growing inventory of wells drilled but not completed as some customers are reluctant to delay completions and defer production. In Canada, we would normally expect to see peak activity level in the first quarter. However, this year, rig counts are expected to remain relatively flat until spring when activity normally drops sharply. As a result of the reduction in overall activity in North America, we project decreased demand for our well construction product lines. In general, well production product lines, such as our artificial lift and production chemicals, should be more insulated in the short term.  
Turning to international markets. We expect to see rig counts begin to slowly decline in some offshore and shallow water market, such as Continental Europe, Mexico, Australia, Iraq and the North Sea. International markets which should remain more resilient in the short term include emerging unconventional place like Argentina and deepwater markets, such as Brazil and Angola. Nigeria is the exception where activity levels are likely to decline and remain suppressed until the upcoming election is concluded. In contrast to the declining activity predicted in many parts of the world, several Middle Eastern countries are expected to see a modest increase in activity in the near term. Also, as a reminder, seasonal product sales, which were exceptionally high in the fourth quarter, are not expected to repeat in the first quarter of this year.  
In summary, in addition to a sharp drop in product sales, we expect to see reduced well construction activity in most of our geographical operating segments in the first quarter with the highest declines in North America, followed by our Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian segment. These segments will see reduced volumes of work almost immediately, and all markets may see pricing pressures as worldwide demand for well construction services continues to compress. For Latin America, we expect to offset some of the activity declines with an increased share of drilling services in Brazil. Similarly, activity declines in Asia Pacific will be partially offset by increased activity in parts of the Middle East. For our Industrial Services segment, we expect seasonal reductions in our Process and Pipeline Services business resulting in a drop in revenue. Margins, however, should improve modestly as acquisition and integration cost incurred in the fourth quarter are reduced.  
With respect to nonoperational items. Interest expense for the year is expected to be approximately $240 million and the effective tax rate should remain in the low- to mid-30s, excluding any discrete items. For 2015, our goal is to remain nimble and maintain a strong focus on asset utilization, working capital and returns. We plan to proactively adapt to changing market conditions by rightsizing our cost structure to reflect near-term activity levels. While this work is still in progress, based on current estimates, we expect to undertake a workforce reduction of 7,000, most of which to take place in the first quarter. As a result, we expect to book a onetime charge in the range of $160 million to $185 million for severance. Additionally, we are reviewing our operations for potential asset impairments, such as facility closures. At the same time, we plan to increase the rigor around the process of capital deployment. To that end, we expect to reduce capital expenditures by 20% compared to last year. 
We enter the cycle well positioned financially and strategically. At the same time, we will continue to monitor market conditions closely, adapt with agility and remain focused on returns, all while maintaining a strong culture of safety, compliance and controls.  
At this point, I would like to turn the call back over to Martin. Martin?"

And as Kimberly just mentioned, our industry is clearly in the early stages of a down cycle, the same sort of cycle we enter once or twice a decade. As with past cycles, the early days are always marked with a high degree of uncertainty,",596,"Thanks, Kimberly. And as Kimberly just mentioned, our industry is clearly in the early stages of a down cycle, the same sort of cycle we enter once or twice a decade. As with past cycles, the early days are always marked with a high degree of uncertainty, which customers will cut spending and by how much, how fast will rig counts drop and where and when are we going to reach the bottom. And we don't have precise answers to all these questions and no one, frankly, does. But we've been through this before and many times, in fact. 
What we've learned in the past is that when the market turns down, it turns swiftly. In each of the last 3 downturns dating back to the '90s, we've seen North America rig counts fall between 40% and 60% in the space of only 12 months. International rigs don't tend to fall as sharply but begin to drop steadily a couple months after the first signs of weakness appear in North America. And we see no reason to believe that this cycle is going to be an any different, but we've navigated changing market conditions many times, both the down cycle and the eventual up cycle. The coming months are going to be challenging, but Baker Hughes is very well positioned financially and strategically to navigate the near term efficiently. 
We know that the key to success is to move quickly, act decisively and to never lose focus on your customers or your core competency, and for Baker Hughes, our core is innovation. This industry can't simply hope and wait for oil to climb back over $100 a barrel, instead, we must adapt to a new reality of sustained lower commodity prices. A major element in this new reality will be technology. And to that end, we are continuing our investment in fundamental research and product development because our customers' need for innovative new products is more critical than ever before. Today, our scientists and research engineers are focused on redefining what is possible and reshaping the limits of the industry's 3 fundamental challenges: lowering the cost of well construction, optimizing well production and increasing ultimate recoveries. 
We are exploring new uses for recent discoveries and nanotechnology to reduce the cost of an unconventional well. We are researching new sensors and new metallurgy capable of increasing production from ultra-deepwater reservoirs. We launched a breakthrough new chemical product called JETTISON, which removes oil from solids in the production stream, reducing our customers' refining costs. And given the outstanding success of ProductionWave that I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have greatly accelerated the research and engineering of a new product called LEAP, the same artificial lift concept we unveiled at our analyst conference. This technology has the potential to completely redefine production management in low-rate wells and is the latest demonstration of our leadership in production enhancement solutions. These are just a few of the opportunities we've been working on, and it demonstrates that our strategy transcends market conditions and supports our purpose to enable safe, affordable energy, improving people's lives. 
Longer term, the outlook for our industry remain strong. The world's demand for energy will continue to climb and the supply of energy will continue to increase in complexity, requiring greater service intensity and more advanced technologies. In the meantime, we remain committed to our strategy focused on execution, dedicated to safe, reliable service and relentless in our pursuit of positive outcomes for the coming year. 
So with that, Trey, let's go ahead and take some questions."

And I think the -- like almost any industry, the first businesses to feel the most pressure will be your more capital-intensive businesses. So in the pressure pumping world, we're starting to certainly have some serious discussions with the customers around bringing down the prices and helping them adjust the costs. We look at around 4 to 5 rig per frac fleet in terms of utilization. So as those rigs start coming out, there's going to be some capacity brought onto the market. And there's no doubt that product lines are first to witness it. And then it'll cascade through the others, and again, I think from your perspective, the more capital intensive, generally, the more pressure it's going to come under first. But in terms of some of the other ones, such as artificial lift and chemicals, make up a significant part of our North American portfolio, I fully expect those to be not fully insulated, but more insulated, if you will.  And on a geographic basis, Gulf of Mexico would be the least to be -- or the last to be affected. But some of the other higher-cost basins, like the Bakken, the Mississippi Chad and even the Permian, are starting to see pressure, Jud."

But again, I just want to remind you that from a Baker Hughes portfolio, the breadth that we have and the heavy emphasis on the production side of the business and the customers increasing focus on getting every barrel out while they're not drilling plays very well to us, and we will strategically use that and muscle that as much as we can to protect our share and our margins in North America."

But we also have some customer communities, the Middle East as well as some other select NOCs around the world and some possible markets that are going to be more insulated, and so I don't think it will be as broad brushed.

The shelf in the Gulf of Mexico is already starting to come under some pressure, and I think part of that has -- is associated with the customer mix. The other item I'd highlight as it relates to us, Byron, is our position with the floating capacity, the vessels, and you're aware of those. And we have a very large contract that we secured for a super major in the Gulf, multiyear with some nice terms and conditions, and I got to take our -- my hat off to the folks who run the Gulf business there.

Secondly, on the other hand, the geological success, as some of our key customers have reported over the last couple of quarters, over the last couple of years, internationally, has not been great either. So that doesn't bode well for increasing us from the supply side. So we should see eventually some kind of balancing out of oil prices, which will settle the market down. But when it happens and at what price is still very much up in the air, and that kind of dictates what it's going to mean for us. Again, I go back to the earlier comments I made. As we sit around the world, this company has never been stronger, whether it's the talent in place, whether it's the portfolio, whether it's the adherence to processes and controls and supply chain infrastructure, roofline, whatever it is.

We delivered strong results to end a record year for Baker Hughes. I expect 2015 to be pivotal in many ways for our company and our industry, and I will provide you with our views on the marketplace later in the call. 
But first, let me provide perspective on the prior year and the fourth quarter. We entered 2014 with a number of strategic initiatives, which we communicated at our analyst conference in May. We planned to leverage our strength in well construction, to grow share in deepwater and unconventional markets, and we wanted to establish differentiating positions in our well production and midstream product lines through technology development.  
We also outlined 3 financial targets: first, to raise margins in the Western Hemisphere, targeting the mid-teens in North America by year's end; second was to achieve double-digit revenue growth in the Eastern Hemisphere; and third was to maintain capital discipline and deliver strong free cash flow. Achieving these performance objectives would require managing our business more efficiently and delivering on our strategy to convert innovations into earnings. That means leveraging our strength in technology development and our global supply chain to deliver differentiating new products and services, which are designed to solve our customers' 3 biggest challenges: efficient well construction, optimized well production and increased ultimate recovery.  
Cornerstone of this strategy is to accelerate new product development and to maximize returns early in the product life cycle. One of the targets that we shared at our conference was to increase the revenue generated from products within the first 12 months after they have been commercialized. We set an ambitious target of $1 billion in revenue for the year, a 20% increase over the prior year. During the year, our Global Products and Services group introduced more than 160 new products and services to the market. That means, on average, we brought a new solution to the marketplace every 55 hours. 
Now let me share a few examples of technologies, which are reshaping our industry and our financial performance. Among the most impactful innovations we have brought to market has been our ProductionWave solution, which integrates cutting-edge artificial lift technologies with production chemicals and remote monitoring services to optimize production in the unconventionals. ProductionWave has come to market at the right time and at the right price point to become a true differentiator. And today, we already have approximately 5,000 ProductionWave solutions installed in North America and a growing number of international markets. Not surprisingly, artificial lift was our fastest-growing product line in 2014. 
FASTrak is also gaining momentum. This technology remains the world's only commercially available service designed to reduce reservoir uncertainty and maximize ultimate recovery by analyzing and extracting samples while drilling. This service has seen strong demand in exploration markets with deployments in 13 different countries across each of our operating segments and is part of the reason why we've increased our share of drilling services in virtually every deepwater market around the world. 
SHADOW plug is another example of a recent technology breakthrough. By leveraging our strength in completion systems and material sciences, we created the world's first large bore plug, which incorporates a disintegrating metallic ball. This innovation eliminates the need to mill out plugs following well completion, removing a critical barrier to achieving unlimited lateral length and expanding the possibilities of well construction altogether. Sales for SHADOW plug grew exponentially over the year with fourth quarter sales exceeding the first 3 quarters combined. 
These are just a few of the innovations we placed some big bets on and these bets are paying off, creating value for our customers, differentiation for Baker Hughes and more than $1 billion in revenue for new products.  
We also highlighted that our focus is squarely on execution and outcomes. In North America, we set out to completely transform our largest product line, our Pressure Pumping business. This is part of a multiyear initiative we put in place shortly after I became CEO. The plan included key investments, modernize our supply chain, deployment of new technologies to drive efficiencies at the well site and the relentless pursuit of contracts with larger, more efficient customers. In North America, results are a reflection of this plan in action. For the fourth quarter, I'm pleased to report that our U.S. Pressure Pumping margins were the highest they've been in 3 years. 
Taking a look at our international operations, we are also seeing the benefit of investments made over the last few years, leading to significant contract wins in Brazil, Norway, Angola and the Middle East. At the same time, we made the tough decision to exit some projects that weren't generating satisfactory returns. In Iraq, we demobilized on a major contract this summer, freeing up resources to be redeployed to more profitable projects in the region, contributing to better margins in our Middle East/Asia Pacific segment and profitability in Iraq. In Libya, we shut down our onshore operations there and reorganized our North African geomarket, allowing us to service the offshore market safely and efficiently from neighboring countries. During the fourth quarter, North Africa margins were at their highest level since the geomarket was formed more than 5 years ago. In Venezuela, we altered our business model by partnering with local providers, allowing us to maintain support for this vital oil-producing country while, at the same time, significantly reducing our working capital exposure. Today, our net receivables in Venezuela are less than 1% of our total receivables balance, a fraction of what it used to be only a couple of years ago. Across all of our international operations, we are seeing increased earnings from investments made to modernize our infrastructure and enhance our global supply chain.  
During the fourth quarter, we delivered the highest volume of year-end product sales in the history of Baker Hughes. Our manufacturing, operations and supply chain teams all worked in concert to fabricate, sell and deliver an unprecedented volume of completion systems, drilling assemblies, artificial lift products and wireline technologies to customers across Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. Compared to the previous year, fourth quarter product sales increased nearly 20%, a remarkable example of execution and a solid way to punctuate the end of a very positive year. 
We also grew our Industrial segment and increased our capabilities through the acquisition of a complementary pipeline services business. In alignment with our strategy to help customers optimize production, Baker Hughes has established a differentiating and very unique position in the midstream space with unmatched capabilities in process and pipeline services and downstream chemicals. 
By executing our strategy and managing our business more efficiently, we delivered on each of the performance objectives we set out to achieve for the year. We increased share in deepwater with major wins in Brazil, Angola and Norway. We'd strengthened our position in the unconventionals with technologies like SHADOW plug and by transforming our pressure pumping business. We established a differentiating position in well production with ProductionWave, and through acquisition, we have established a very unique position in the midstream market. 
We ended the year with 15% margins in North America and 20% margins in Latin America. And in the east, we achieved 12% growth over the prior year. We achieved these performance objectives while maintaining capital discipline and reducing our cash conversion cycle and delivered the highest free cash flow in the history of Baker Hughes, and we converted these results into greater shareholder returns. We repurchased more shares and increased our dividend, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
But without a doubt, the most notable highlight of the year was secured late in the fourth quarter with the successful negotiation and signing of the merger agreement with Halliburton. We fully expect the closing of this transaction to deliver a premium to our shareholders in the near term and provide a long-term opportunity to benefit from the future upside of the combined companies. We fully believe in the potential of the combined companies to better serve customers with a broad suite of products and technology and to create more opportunities for employees over the long term. Under the leadership of Mark and Belgacem, our integration teams are developing plans for an efficient and thoughtful integration, and I am very pleased with the progress to date.  
Until the transaction closes, our focus remains on execution and navigating the current market downturn. Late in the fourth quarter, we began to see the first evidence that customers are pulling back activity as reflected in the North American rig count. This is the beginning of a trend which will continue to unfold in the weeks and months ahead. Later in today's call, I'll share my thoughts on what the near-term outlook is for our industry, what we are doing to adjust our business accordingly and why I am confident that Baker Hughes has the right people, the right technology and the right strategy to remain strong in the months ahead. 
But first, let me turn it over to Kimberly Ross, who I am pleased to welcome to her first earnings call for Baker Hughes, to provide additional details on the quarter. Kimberly?"
19007,279886095,747183,"Baker Hughes Incorporated, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2015",2015-01-20,"Earnings Calls","Baker Hughes Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported revenue for the fourth quarter of $6.6 billion, a record for Baker Hughes and an increase of $385 million or 6% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was also a record at $1,450",1529,"Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported revenue for the fourth quarter of $6.6 billion, a record for Baker Hughes and an increase of $385 million or 6% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was also a record at $1,450,000,000, up 22% sequentially. On a GAAP basis, net income attributable to Baker Hughes for the fourth quarter was $663 million or $1.52 per share. Adjusted net income excludes a $34 million before and after tax gain or $0.08 per share, resulting from the deconsolidation of a joint venture in North Africa. The effective tax rate on adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was 31.5%, a reduction from the previous quarter due to the recent extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit and a more favorable geographic mix of sales. As a result, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $629 million or $1.44 per share. Compared to the previous quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased $0.42 or 41%.  
Taking a closer look at our results from operations. We posted record revenue in North America of $3.3 billion, up 5% sequentially. North America operating profit was $488 million and operating profit margin was 14.8%, an increase of 270 basis points versus the prior quarter and in line with the goal we communicated a year ago. The increased profitability is attributed primarily to improved pricing and utilization in our U.S. Pressure Pumping business, along with increased contribution from our Gulf of Mexico and Canadian geomarkets. 
In North America onshore, we maintained high activity levels throughout most of the quarter and saw increased demand for newly introduced well construction and well production technologies. As a result, the segment delivered record revenue across most product lines, including pressure pumping, artificial lift, upstream chemicals, completion systems and drill bits. Offshore, delays caused by movements [ph] in the previous quarter began to dissipate in November. When coupled with a large backlog of deepwater simulation activity, we saw a solid rebound in our Gulf of Mexico business for the quarter.  
Moving to international results. We posted revenue of $2,950,000,000, which is a 7% increase versus the prior quarter. Operating profit was $545 million, and operating profit margin was 18.4%. This represents an increase of 490 basis points compared to adjusted results in the prior quarter. Each of our international operating segments posted increased revenue in margins with the strongest incremental operating profit coming from Middle East/Asia Pacific. This segment remains our fastest-growing business and delivered an impressive 13% top line growth sequentially, along with a 430 basis point increase in operating profit margins. Profitable growth was achieved through an exceptionally rich mix of year-end product sales across the region, along with record revenue in drilling services, artificial lift and pressure pumping. Completion systems also delivered record revenue and delivered a major well construction project on our integrated operation in Malaysia. We also saw a positive contribution from Iraq, which was profitable in the fourth quarter. 
We similarly posted record revenue in our Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian segment, along with an increase in operating profit margins of 410 basis points compared to adjusted results in the third quarter. This segment benefited from solid activity in our Angola, Continental Europe and Nigeria geomarkets, along with strong year-end product sales across Africa and the Russian Caspian region. The region also profited from cost-reduction measures taken in the previous quarter in response to activity disruptions in North Africa leading to higher margins. Strong margin improvement was also delivered in Latin America, where we posted a 4% increase in revenue, along with a 750 basis point increase in operating profit margins. This segment benefited from record revenue in artificial lift as a result of exceptionally high year-end product sales, particularly in the Andean region. Additionally, our drilling service product line delivered strong performance and secured additional share in Brazil, resulting in improved profitability for that geomarket. Our Latin America segment ended the year as our highest margin operation worldwide. This is a remarkable turnaround for a business that was unprofitable only 6 quarters ago.  
For our Industrial Services segment, revenue for the fourth quarter was $377 million, which is a 13% increase sequentially. This increase includes a full quarter's revenue contribution from the newly added pipeline services group, which we acquired late in the third quarter. Industrial Services operating profit margins were 6.1% reflecting seasonal reductions in activity, along with costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the new business. 
Looking at cash flow and the balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, we generated $838 million in free cash flow, a record for Baker Hughes. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.7 billion, which is an increase of $531 million or 44% over the prior quarter. Total debt for the quarter declined by $280 million or 6% sequentially to $4.1 billion, and we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 18%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $503 million.  
As we look ahead, we see that market dynamics are evolving rapidly. Customer budgets are being reset, activity levels are declining and currencies continue to fluctuate. The further we look beyond the quarter, the greater the lack of clarity. As a result, we're approaching this year one quarter at a time.  
With that said, in North America, for the first quarter, we expect the U.S. onshore rig count will continue to drop as customers reduce capital spending. The average U.S. rig count in the first quarter is projected to be approximately 15% lower than the fourth quarter average. Additionally, we're seeing a growing inventory of wells drilled but not completed as some customers are electing to delay completions and defer production. In Canada, we would normally expect to see peak activity level in the first quarter. However, this year, rig counts are expected to remain relatively flat until spring when activity normally drops sharply. As a result of the reduction in overall activity in North America, we project decreased demand for our well construction product lines. In general, well production product lines, such as our artificial lift and production chemicals, should be more insulated in the short term.  
Turning to international markets. We expect to see rig counts begin to slowly decline in some offshore and shallow water markets, such as Continental Europe, Mexico, Australia, Iraq and the North Sea. International markets which should remain more resilient in the short term include emerging unconventional plays like Argentina and deepwater markets, such as Brazil and Angola. Nigeria is the exception where activity levels are likely to decline and remain suppressed until the upcoming election is concluded. In contrast to the declining activity predicted in many parts of the world, several Middle Eastern countries are expected to see a modest increase in activity in the near term. Also, as a reminder, seasonal product sales, which were exceptionally high in the fourth quarter, are not expected to repeat in the first quarter of this year.  
In summary, in addition to a sharp drop in product sales, we expect to see reduced well construction activity in most of our geographical operating segments in the first quarter with the highest declines in North America, followed by our Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian segment. These segments will see reduced volumes of work almost immediately, and all markets may see pricing pressures as worldwide demand for well construction services continues to compress. For Latin America, we expect to offset some of the activity declines with an increased share of drilling services in Brazil. Similarly, activity declines in Asia Pacific will be partially offset by increased activity in parts of the Middle East. For our Industrial Services segment, we expect seasonal reductions in our Process and Pipeline Services business resulting in a drop in revenue. Margins, however, should improve modestly as acquisition and integration costs incurred in the fourth quarter are reduced.  
With respect to nonoperational items. Interest expense for the year is expected to be approximately $240 million and the effective tax rate should remain in the low- to mid-30s, excluding any discrete items. For 2015, our goal is to remain nimble and maintain a strong focus on asset utilization, working capital and returns. We plan to proactively adapt to changing market conditions by rightsizing our cost structure to reflect near-term activity levels. While this work is still in progress, based on current estimates, we expect to undertake a workforce reduction of 7,000, most of which to take place in the first quarter. As a result, we expect to book a onetime charge in the range of $160 million to $185 million for severance. Additionally, we are reviewing our operations for potential asset impairments, such as facility closures. At the same time, we plan to increase the rigor around the process of capital deployment. To that end, we expect to reduce capital expenditures by 20% compared to last year. 
We enter the cycle well positioned financially and strategically. At the same time, we will continue to monitor market conditions closely, adapt with agility and remain focused on returns, all while maintaining a strong culture of safety, compliance and controls.  
At this point, I would like to turn the call back over to Martin. Martin?"

And as Kimberly just mentioned, our industry is clearly in the early stages of a down cycle, the same sort of cycle we enter once or twice a decade. As with past cycles, the early days are always marked with a high degree of uncertainty,",595,"Thanks, Kimberly. And as Kimberly just mentioned, our industry is clearly in the early stages of a down cycle, the same sort of cycle we enter once or twice a decade. As with past cycles, the early days are always marked with a high degree of uncertainty, which customers will cut spending and by how much, how fast will rig counts drop and where and when are we going to reach the bottom. And we don't have precise answers to all these questions and no one, frankly, does. But we've been through this before and many times, in fact. 
What we've learned in the past is that when the market turns down, it turns swiftly. In each of the last 3 downturns dating back to the '90s, we've seen North American rig counts fall between 40% and 60% in the space of only 12 months. International rigs don't tend to fall as sharply but begin to drop steadily a couple months after the first signs of weakness appear in North America. And we see no reason to believe that this cycle is going to be any different, but we've navigated changing market conditions many times, both the down cycle and the eventual up cycle. The coming months are going to be challenging, but Baker Hughes is very well positioned financially and strategically to navigate the near term efficiently. 
We know that the key to success is to move quickly, act decisively and to never lose focus on your customers or your core competency, and for Baker Hughes, our core is innovation. This industry can't simply hope and wait for oil to climb back over $100 a barrel, instead, we must adapt to a new reality of sustained lower commodity prices. A major element in this new reality will be technology. And to that end, we are continuing our investment in fundamental research and product development because our customers' need for innovative new products is more critical than ever before. Today, our scientists and research engineers are focused on redefining what is possible and reshaping the limits of the industry's 3 fundamental challenges: lowering the cost of well construction, optimizing well production and increasing ultimate recoveries. 
We are exploring new uses for recent discoveries in nanotechnology to reduce the cost of an unconventional well. We are researching new sensors and new metallurgy capable of increasing production from ultra-deepwater reservoirs. We launched a breakthrough new chemical product called JETTISON, which removes oil from solids in the production stream, reducing our customers' refining costs. And given the outstanding success of ProductionWave that I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have greatly accelerated the research and engineering of a new product called LEAP, the same artificial lift concept we unveiled at our analyst conference. This technology has the potential to completely redefine production management in low-rate wells and is the latest demonstration of our leadership in production enhancement solutions. These are just a few of the opportunities we've been working on, and it demonstrates that our strategy transcends market conditions and supports our purpose to enable safe, affordable energy, improving people's lives. 
Longer term, the outlook for our industry remains strong. The world's demand for energy will continue to climb and the supply of energy will continue to increase in complexity, requiring greater service intensity and more advanced technologies. In the meantime, we remain committed to our strategy focused on execution, dedicated to safe, reliable service and relentless in our pursuit of positive outcomes for the coming year. 
So with that, Trey, let's go ahead and take some questions."

And I think the -- like almost any industry, the first businesses to feel the most pressure will be your more capital-intensive businesses. So in the pressure pumping world, we're starting to certainly have some serious discussions with the customers around bringing down the prices and helping them adjust their costs. We look at around 4 to 5 rigs per frac fleet in terms of utilization. So as those rigs start coming out, there's going to be some capacity brought onto the market. And there's no doubt that product lines are first to witness it. And then it'll cascade through the others, and again, I think from your perspective, the more capital intensive, generally, the more pressure it's going to come under first. But in terms of some of the other ones, such as artificial lift and chemicals, make up a significant part of our North American portfolio, I fully expect those to be not fully insulated, but more insulated, if you will. And on a geographic basis, Gulf of Mexico would be the least to be -- or the last to be affected. But some of the other higher-cost basins, like the Bakken, the Mississippi Chad and even the Permian, are starting to see pressure, Jud."

The shelf in the Gulf of Mexico is already starting to come under some pressure, and I think part of that has -- is associated with the customer mix. The other item I'd highlight as it relates to us, Byron, is our position with the floating capacity, the vessels, and you're aware of those. And we have a very large contract that we secured for a super major in the Gulf, multiyear with some pretty nice terms and conditions, and I got to take our -- my hat off to the folks that run the Gulf business there.

Secondly, on the other hand, the geological success, as some of our key customers have reported over the last couple of quarters, over the last couple of years, internationally, has not been great either. So that doesn't bode well for increasing us from the supply side. So we should see eventually some kind of balancing out of oil prices, which will settle the market down. But when it happens and at what price is still very much up in the air, and that kind of dictates what it's going to mean for us. Again, I go back to the earlier comments I made. As we sit around the world, this company has never been stronger, whether it's the talent in place, whether it's the portfolio, whether it's the adherence to processes and controls and supply chain infrastructure, roofline, whatever it is.

I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you're navigating through your customer base in North America. You've been doing a great job of building up the utilization throughout the year. I'm going to assume that fourth quarter, you were largely at capacity. How do you expect that to play out? I know this is a tough question over the next couple of quarters. But are you trying to keep the utilization as high as possible? Or -- I'm just kind of curious as you're thinking as we head into this, Martin."

Let me just also remind you, though, that the whole business doesn't revolve around -- I know certainly, it's been impactful to everybody's numbers, the Pressure Pumping business, but it's a multi-faceted discussion. To your point on utilization, obviously, again that's around the, again, capital-intensive businesses like pressure pumping, wireline, but that's kind of where it stops, where -- and so yes, utilization is extremely important next to price. In that kind of business, that's your biggest profit driver. And the discussions with customers, they're still looking for every bit of efficiency that they can achieve. And to the point -- to the degree that we can bring a broader solution to the problems, where there's the drilling and the completions and the formation evaluation and all the way through the production cycle, we're going to continue to do that for the purpose of keeping everything active. But as I said earlier, 4 to 5 rigs per frac fleet is generally, depending on the basin, what we see. And there's no doubt that as the quarters unfold here, you're going to see capacity getting stacked because it just doesn't make any sense to keep it running. So I don't know if that answers your question, but that's about the best I can do."
