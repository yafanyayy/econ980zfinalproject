Welcome to the second quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup Fiscal 2015. 
With me here in New Jersey today are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Anthony DiSilvestro, our Chief Financial Officer; and Anna Choi, Senior Manager of Investor Relations. 
As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. This call is open to the media who participate in listen-only mode. 
Today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risks. Please refer to our slide or to our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements. 
While in the current quarter we had no items affecting comparability, our comparisons of fiscal 2015 with fiscal 2014 will exclude previously announced items. 
Also, our fiscal 2015 guidance is on a 52-week to 52-week adjusted basis through 53 weeks last year. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we provided in our appendix a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Denise Morrison."

Today, I will share my perspective on our second quarter and first half performance, our plans for the remainder of the year, and finally, our initiative to create a new enterprise structure, while driving",1426,"Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will share my perspective on our second quarter and first half performance, our plans for the remainder of the year, and finally, our initiative to create a new enterprise structure, while driving significant cost savings over the next 3 years. Our CFO, Anthony DiSilvestro, will discuss our financial performance and segment results in greater detail, then we'll have time for your questions. 
My perspective about the second quarter is highly influenced by some of the factors we shared with you during our first quarter call. As a reminder, we had strong first quarter with organic net sales up 5%, adjusted EBIT up 9% and adjusted EPS up 12%. 
Recall that in quarter 1, we experienced higher input cost than expected and this situation continued into quarter 2. We started the year with a stronger seasonal sell-in. We also had more holiday promotion activity shift in quarter 1 because of the timing of our quarter end and relative to Thanksgiving. 
This shift droves sales growth in Campbell's condensed soups, Swanson Broth and our Pepperidge Farms stuffing businesses ahead of consumption. 
The strong first quarter put pressure on our supply chain to maintain acceptable customer service levels. To serve our customers, we ran our plans over time and shipped product from all over our network to meet the increased demand. We also increased our use of spot market transportation, which resulted in higher rates in a constraint market and fueled additional cost. These supply chain issues continued into the second quarter as we made the decision to incur additional expenses to improve our customer service levels. 
With this as background, let me now offer my perspective on our second quarter results. Our organic sales performance was comparable to year ago. 
In the quarter, declines in U.S. Soup were impacted by quarter 1 sales growth, which benefited from movements in retailer inventory levels and the timing of quarter end relative to the Thanksgiving holiday. This had an expected adverse impact on Q2 soup sales. 
In the quarter, we delivered positive sales growth in our large U.S. Sauce brands, Prego and Pace, as well as in Plum Organics Baby Food, in the CPG portion of Bolthouse Farms, beverages and salad dressings and in our Foodservice business. 
I was pleased with our Global Baking and Snacking business, which delivered solid organic top line growth, as well as strong bottom line growth with contributions from both Arnott's and Pepperidge Farm. 
I was not satisfied with the performance of the U.S. Beverage business. Sales of our V8 V-Fusion franchise declined, while V8 Splash and V8 + Energy performed well in the quarter. 
In January, we started shipping our new V8 Veggie Blends, which has been well received by our customers. 
Our biggest disappointment in the quarter was our gross margin performance. As I mentioned previously, we continue to face persistent challenges with increased inflation and cost pressure in logistics, including higher transportation and warehousing costs and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input cost of our international businesses. 
Despite our efforts to reduce expenses, we posted a double-digit EBIT decline greater than we anticipated. Anthony will discuss our gross margin performance and outlook in much greater detail in a few minutes. 
As a reminder, at the close of our first quarter, we told you that we didn't expect our performance in fiscal 2015 to be the evenly distributed across quarters. As a result, we said at the time that evaluating our business performance on a first half basis rather than a quarterly basis would be more meaningful.  We still believe a first half view gives the most informative picture of the business. 
Turning to our first half performance, organic sales increased plus 2%. For the half, 4 of our 5 reporting segments achieved organic sales growth with gains in U.S. Simple Meals, including steady sales in U.S. Soup. We posted positive organic sales in Global Baking and Snacking, Bolthouse Farms and Foodservice and International Simple Meals.  Sales of U.S. Beverages declined. 
It is important to note that our recent acquisitions, Plum and the CPG portion of Bolthouse Farms, posted double-digit sales gains for the half and Kelsen biscuit sales increased as well. 
For the half, our gross margin was under pressure with the continuation of the input cost of our higher than anticipated and the supply chain issues that I previously discussed. 
Turning now to the back half. We plan to focus on fewer, bigger innovation platforms across our portfolio. As discussed at CAGNY last week, we believe this approach will have a more significant impact on the top line and reduce complexity in our supply chain. 
In the back half, we will continue to ramp up our health and well-being platform across our business. Our health and well-being platform includes new Campbell's organic soup and the continued expansion of our Healthy Request line of soups. 
We were increasing the distribution of new V8 Veggie Blends Juices for affordable mainstream juicing and V8 Protein Bars and Shakes, which are expanding the brand into adult on-the-go nutrition. 
In the packaged fresh category, this spring, we are launching 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, a new cold-pressed ultra premium organic juice. We will continue to expand Bolthouse Farms Kids fresh beverages, veggie and fruit snack tubes and carrot Veggie Snackers in the produce section. 
And we also have spring flavor innovations in place for superpremium fresh beverages, including an on-trend blueberry banana milk variety, a new variety of salad dressings. 
In Simple Meals, we will introduce a range of premium and convenience platforms, including the expansion of our dinner sauces line with the addition of grilling sauces. We are also preparing for the launch of Campbell's fresh fruits soup cups in K-cups. Our joint development project with Keurig Green Mountain. 
And finally, we will introduce Prego and Pace ready meals in convenient, on-the-go microwavable pouches. 
We will also take actions to address the supply chain issues that are within our control. For instance, we are making significant improvements to our freight and transportation management, while our service level to customers and cost management is improving. We're taking steps to increase net price realization on our core business. We believe that these steps will help our gross margin performance improve starting in the third quarter. 
And finally, we're managing SG&A and other cost progressively across a number of areas such as travel and hiring. Even with these efforts, we don't expect to offset the full impact of the margin pressures that we experienced in the first half. 
We recognize the challenging environment that we and our peers are operating in, particularly in center store categories. Consumer behavior and their preferences with respect to food are changing. There are many seismic shifts impacting our industry, which I discussed last week at CAGNY. We're taking these shifts into consideration as we pursue our dual mandate to strengthen our core business, while at the same time to expand into faster-growing space is. 
We recently announced a new enterprise structure to better align our organization to deliver on our strategy. 
After considerable thought and planning, we are reorganizing our company to unlock greater value from our people, brands and assets. This work is underway and will ramp up in the back half. We expect the creation of our 3 new divisions: America's Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks and Packaged Fresh, coupled with our efforts to simplify our organizational structure will result in streamlined operations, better execution and improved financial results over time all while delivering fewer, bigger product innovations that will delight consumers. 
As we implement this leaner and flatter organization structure, we are also adopting zero-based budgeting in fiscal 2016 to drive cost savings and to instill new cost discipline at Campbell. 
Together, we expect these initiatives to ramp up to annual cost savings of $200 million plus over a 3-year period. 
This is a difficult time across the food industry. While we have made solid progress at Campbell's over the past 3.5 years to reshape our portfolio, it has not been enough. We are making necessary changes at our company, changes to the way we organize and manage our business, and changes to where we allocate resources and assets, while managing costs to fund our growth. 
Simply put, we are taking more aggressive action on multiple fronts while staying resolutely focused on the consumer to change the growth trajectory of our business. 
Thank you. And now, I will turn the call over to Anthony DiSilvestro."
258458,275095966,769521,"Campbell Soup Company, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2015",2015-02-25,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before getting into the details, I wanted to give my perspective on our second quarter performance and provide 2015's guidance. First, we are pleased with our overall sales performance. Organic sales following 5% growth",2302,"Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before getting into the details, I wanted to give my perspective on our second quarter performance and provide 2015's guidance. 
First, we are pleased with our overall sales performance. Organic sales following 5% growth in the first quarter were flat in the second quarter with the first half now at plus 2%. 
Our updated sales guidance reflects an increased headwind from currency. Excluding currency, our sales outlook remains unchanged from our previous 2015 guidance. However, reflecting disappointing gross margin performance, second quarter EBIT was down 17% and below our expectations. I'll discuss the details of our gross margin performance shortly. 
Importantly, for the balance of the year, we expect to see improved gross margin performance as inflation and supply chain headwinds moderate, and we take actions to improve our net price realization. 
As we announced on February 12, given our second quarter performance and revised outlook for the balance of the year, including the impact of currency translation, we lowered our full year guidance. 
Now I'll take you through our second quarter results segment highlights and then review the guidance. For the second quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined by 2% to $2,234,000,000 due to the negative impact of currency translation. Organic net sales were comparable to the prior year as gains in both our Global Baking and Snacking and our Bolthouse Farms and Foodservice segments were primarily offset by declines in U.S. Simple Meals and U.S. Beverages. 
Following a strong first quarter, sales in the second quarter were negatively impacted by movements in retail or inventory level, including earlier holiday shipments that benefited the prior quarter. 
With these timing-related items now behind us, first half reported sales increased 1% with organic sales gaining 2%. 
Adjusted EBIT in the quarter fell 17% due to a lower gross margin percentage and unfavorable currency, partly offset by reductions in marketing spending. 
In the first half, adjusted EBIT declined 4% as the negative impact of a lower gross margin percentage and currency were partly offset by volume gains and lower marketing and administrative expenses. 
Reflecting lower interest expense and our lower tax rate, adjusted earnings per share decreased 30% to $0.66 in the quarter, but $1.40 for the first half adjusted EPS is down 1%. 
Decomposing our sales performance, favorable volume mix contributed 1 point the sales growth. Gains in volume mix and the Global Baking and Snacking and Bolthouse and Foodservice segments were partly offset by declines in U.S. Simple Meals segment most impacted by the inventory and holiday shipment timing between the first and second quarters.  Higher selling prices primarily in Global Baking and Snacking added 1 point of growth. 
Overall, increased promotional spending lowered sales by 2 percentage points. Pressure came largely from the Global Baking and Snacking and U.S. Simple Meals segments. 
Currency reduced sales by 2 points as our 2 primary foreign currency, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, both weakened further against the U.S. dollar. 
Here's our gross margin bridge for the second quarter. The gross margin declined by about 3 points in the quarter compared to the prior year. First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative margin impact of 3.6 points. About 2/3 of this was cost inflation, which as a rate increased by approximately 4%, reflecting continuing decreases in meats, tomatoes, dairy, steel cans and chocolate and includes the negative impact of mark-to-market losses at open commodity hedging contract. 
While inflation was slightly higher in the quarter than anticipated, we expect inflation to moderate in the back half. 
The remaining 1/3 came from our supply chain where we experienced increases in manufacturing cost, in freight in distribution and from the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input cost of our international businesses. 
I'll comment further on the first 2. Our manufacturing cost are higher as we temporarily increased the use of co-packers to meet short-term demand and from an equipment outage in one of our major plants. 
On freight and distribution, to meet our customer service levels, we've incurred higher transportation cost, based both on our usage and rates, the impact, of which we've seen moderate during the quarter. 
Looking ahead, to next year, our investments in Soup Common Platform brought capacity and changes in our committed freight capacity to mitigate the impact of these factors. 
Promotional spending negatively impacted gross margin by 100 basis points, primarily due to higher spending in the Baking and Snacking segment and while volumes increased in this segment, trade had a negative impact on margin. 
Higher selling prices, primarily and baking and snacking, added 40 basis points. 
Lastly, we continue to derive meaningful productivity gains in our supply chain, which contributed 130 basis points of improvement. 
As I'll discuss in connection with the guidance, we expect that our gross margins will expand slightly in the second half. 
Marketing and selling expenses decreased 10% in the quarter reflecting reductions in advertising in U.S. Simple Meals and Pepperidge Farm helping to offset some of the gross margin pressure. 
Administrative expenses were down 1% as lower benefit cost, cost savings from prior restructuring initiatives and the impact of currency were mostly offset by increased long-term incentive compensation cost compared to the prior year, which benefited from reduction in estimated payouts. 
On the topic of incentive compensation more broadly, we now expect a full year 2015 headwind on incentive compensation cost of approximately $0.06 per share compared to our original estimate of $0.09 per share as we have lowered our assumption for estimated payouts on long-term and annual bonuses. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS growth between our operating performance and below the line items. 
As you could see, adjusted EPS declined by $0.10 per share, $0.12 of which is attributable to the decline in EBIT. 
Net interest expense declined $4 million versus a year ago as we reduced our debt level and this contributed a $0.01 to EPS growth in the quarter. 
Our tax rate for the quarter was 27.9%, down 310 basis points versus the prior year adjusted rate due to the favorable resolution of an intercompany pricing agreement between the U.S. and Canada. The lower tax rate in the quarter added $0.03 to EPS. We now expect the tax rate for fiscal 2015 in the range of 30% to 31% versus our previous guidance of 31% to 32%. 
Under our strategic share repurchase program, we repurchased $50 million in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $100 million. But rounding, we don't see an EPS impact on the quarter. 
Currency had a $0.02 impact on EPS. For the full year and based on current spot rates, we estimate currency will have a 2 points or $0.05 per share negative impact. 
Now turning to our segment results. Sales declined in U.S. Simple Meals by 3%, primarily driven by volume decline and higher promotional spending. 
U.S. Soup sales decreased 6% following a 6 points gain in Q1 as the timing between quarters was impacted by movement in retail inventory levels and the timing of our quarters relative to the Thanksgiving holiday. 
Sales of other Simple Meals increased 6%, driven by growth in Plum, Prego and our dinner sauce platform. Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals declined, primarily due to higher inflation and the supply chain cost I discussed earlier. 
In Global Baking and Snacking, 4% organic sales growth was driven by the strong performance of Arnott's. We achieved consumption to share gains in the Australian biscuit category and Indonesia delivered another quarter of double-digit sales gain. 
Within Pepperidge Farm, Goldfish crackers delivered strong sales gains, which was partially offset by softness in frozen products. 
Sell-in sales declined slightly reflecting the shift of the Chinese New Year further into our third quarter although baking and snacking posted strong operating earnings driven by the organic sales growth and lower marketing spend. 
In the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment, organic growth were driven by sales gains in Foodservice and in Bolthouse premium beverages and salad dressings, while Bolthouse Farms carrot and natural ingredients sales declined. The decline in operating earnings was primarily driven by lower gross margin percentage and higher administrative expenses as the prior year benefited from a reduction in long-term incentive compensation accruals. The decline in gross margin percentage reflects higher carrot cost, including the impact of adverse weather. 
International Simple Meals and Beverages organic sales declined 2% with lower sales in Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. Sales in Canada were comparable to the prior year following a very strong first quarter. Declines in operating earnings were due to cost inflation, the adverse impact of currency on input cost and the negative impact in currency translation. 
U.S. beverage sales fell 4% as declines in V8 V-Fusion more than offset gains in V8 Splash. Operating earnings declined, primarily due to higher promotional spending, including new item introduction cost caused inflation and increased supply chain costs. 
For the first half, I want to focus your attention specifically on the performance of the U.S. Simple Meals segment. With the timing shift in Q1 and Q2 now behind us, U.S. Simple Meals sales increased 2% for the half, driven by volume gains in the segment. U.S. Soup sales were comparable to the prior year, while sales of other Simple Meals increased 10% driven by growth in Plum, Prego and our dinner sauce platform. 
Operating earnings declined 3%, reflecting cost inflation and higher supply chain cost, partly offset by productivity improvement, lower marketing expenses, sales gains and the benefit of lapping the Plum recall in the prior year. 
For the remaining segments, the results for the half were similar to those of second quarter. 
Within U.S. Soup, 6% lower sales in the second quarter was due to declines in condensed and Swanson Broth, which were impacted by the timing of shipments between the first and second quarters. The ready-to-serve soup sales were comparable to the prior year. 
Our soup sales decreased 6%, consumer takeaway in measure channels for the comparable 13-week period ending February 1 declined 1%. 
For the first half, as shown at the bottom of the chart, soup sales in aggregate were comparable to the prior year as a 3% decline in condensed was offset by 7% growth in broth, ready-to-serve sales comparable to the prior year. We ended the quarter with retailer inventory decisions comparable to the prior year. 
Here's a look at U.S. Soup category performance and our share results as measured by our IRR. For the 52-week period ending February 1, 2015, the category as a whole declined 1.2%. Our sales in measure channels declined 1.9% with weakness in condensed and ready-to-serve, partly offset by strength in broth. 
Our shares declined 50 basis points in the last 52 weeks and has been relatively stable over the past 2 years. All other unit players collectively had a share of 28% with gains driven by smaller players. Private label also grew share, finishing at 13%. 
We had strong cash flow performance in the first half as cash from operations increased by $221 million to $584 million as we wrap the taxes paid in 2014 on the divestiture of the European Simple Meals business and due to lower working capital requirements and pension contributions in 2015.  Capital expenditures increased to $143 million. 
We continue to expect capital expenditures of about $400 million for the year as we increased capacity to support growth in our faster-growing businesses. 
We paid dividends totaling $199 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. 
In aggregate, we repurchased 133 million of shares in the half, 100 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. 
Based on our current plans, we anticipate making strategic share repurchases at this pace on average for the balance of the year. 
Net debt declined by approximately $200 million to $3.7 billion. 
Now I'll step through our 2015 guidance, which is consistent with our news release on February 12. As a reminder, growth rates are based of a 52-week adjusted fiscal 2014 base. 
Beginning with net sales, we expect changes in net sales to be in the range of minus 1% to plus 1%, including a currency headwind of 2 points.  Excluding currency, our sales outlook was unchanged from our previous guidance. 
We expect adjusted EBIT to decline between minus 7% and minus 5%, reflecting weaker-than-anticipated gross margin performance. Our first half performance has been impacted by inflation, supply chain cost and currency. We expect improved year-on-year performance in the back half as inflation and the supply chain impacts moderate as we exit the season, and we realize the benefit of several list price increases and promotional spending reductions, which are now in the marketplace. 
For the full year, we forecast that our gross margin percentage will decline by approximately 1 point. 
At EPS, and reflecting a tax rate in the range of 30% to 31% and this expense slightly below the prior year, we expect adjusted EPS to decline between minus 5% and minus 3%, a range of $2.32 to $2.38. 
In terms of quarters, directionally, we expect a relatively weak third quarter followed by a stronger Q4. 
As we discussed at the CAGNY conference last week, we have launched a major cost-reduction initiative, targeting a $200 million plus annual cost opportunity by adopting a zero-based budgeting approach. While we expected deliver savings beginning in our fiscal 2016, we do not anticipate a material impact on our 2015 results. 
As we said last week, we are in the early stages, and we'll have more to say about the initiative and impact on our performance as we make progress. That concludes my remarks. 
And now, I'll turn it back to Jennifer for Q&A."

So what that resulted in is some more inter-plant shipments, less use of intermodal and a higher utilization of the spot market at a time when carrier capacity is being constrained and the rates have been higher. So those 3 things are the primary drivers of the cost in freight and distribution. Those wages are pretty significant part of the supply chain cost we've been talking about."

Just from looking at what going on in the grocery store, there seems to be a shift into newer products that are all that new packaging format not necessarily the trend and Campbell's is obviously joining this trend with the organic soups and beef broth and so on. But how did that affect your margins over the long-term? In the near term, I imagine using co-packers reduces the margins.

That said, the canned soup business is still several billion dollars and very profitable, and so bringing news to the core business is also an important part of our program here.

Think about the CPG and salad dressing, those businesses we're very pleased with the performance of those business, both top and bottom line. Where the issue in the short term has been, and I think most of this is now behind us has been on natural ingredients and on carrot cost. As you know, we went from a very unique drought situation and that raised our cost in terms of water cost, water extracting cost, land cost. And then we went from that to no rain events within a 10-day period, which also caused us on the carrot cost side. Both of those situations have impacted our business. The reason I said I believe it's behind us is now we've shifted our harvesting to the more Southern region that have the same kind of situation. We saw improved performance in the back-end of our quarter, so we feel pretty good about the outlook. The other issue we've had a little bit on the top line is we export some natural ingredients and concentrates to Japan and that business has been under pressure. But the core business, the CPG beverages and salad dressing continues to perform very, very well."

Or as really a new more reasonable base, from which you try and improve going forward in light of the various reinvestment needs you've got gross margin mix and some of the faster growth areas put against the CVB actions you're going to take. And then just secondly, are you taking some pricing actions even in soups you talked about. I thought it was tough to big pricing sort of interest soup season.

So I think there are opportunities to expand margin over time. In terms of the pricing question, I mean, certainly, in terms of asset, we get more benefit by enacting a pricing action ahead of the soup season, where there's nothing that really prevents us from doing it at any point. The key is to work through the timing and the impact of the promotional activity at our retailers. But this was well planned out, and it's now in the marketplace."

The second area is currency translation, so we went from about 1 point of negative impact to 2 points and about $0.05 impact at EPS now for the year.

Today, I will share my perspective on our second quarter and first half performance, our plans for the remainder of the year and finally, our initiative to create a new enterprise structure while driving significant cost savings over the next 3 years. Our CFO, Anthony DiSilvestro, will discuss our financial performance and segment results in greater detail, and then we'll have time for your questions. 
My perspective about the second quarter is highly influenced by some of the factors we shared with you during our first quarter call. As a reminder, we had strong first quarter with organic net sales up 5%, adjusted EBIT up 9% and adjusted EPS up 12%. Recall that in quarter 1, we experienced higher input cost than expected, and this situation continued into quarter 2. We started the year with a stronger seasonal sell-in. We also had more holiday promotion activity shift in quarter 1 because of the timing of our quarter end relative to Thanksgiving. This shift droves sales growth in Campbell's condensed soups, Swanson broth and our Pepperidge Farms Stuffing businesses ahead of consumption. 
The strong first quarter put pressure on our supply chain to maintain acceptable customer service levels. To serve our customers, we ran our plants overtime and shipped product from all over our network to meet the increased demand. We also increased our use of spot market transportation, which resulted in higher rates in a constraint market and fueled additional cost. These supply chain issues continued into the second quarter as we made the decision to incur additional expenses to improve our customer service levels. 
With this as background, let me now offer my perspective on our second quarter results. Our organic sales performance was comparable to year ago. In the quarter, declines in U.S. soup were impacted by quarter 1 sales growth, which benefited from movements in retailer inventory levels and the timing of quarter end relative to the Thanksgiving holiday. This had an expected adverse impact on Q2 soup sales. In the quarter, we delivered positive sales growth in our large U.S. sauce brands, Prego and Pace, as well as in Plum Organics baby food, in the CPG portion of Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings and in our Foodservice business. 
I was pleased with our Global Baking and Snacking business, which delivered solid organic top line growth as well as strong bottom line growth with contributions from both Arnott's and Pepperidge Farm. I was not satisfied with the performance of the U.S. Beverage business. Sales of our V8 V-Fusion franchise declined while V8 Splash and V8 + Energy performed well in the quarter. In January, we started shipping our new V8 Veggie Blends, which have been well received by our customers. 
Our biggest disappointment in the quarter was our gross margin performance. As I mentioned previously, we continue to face persistent challenges with increased inflation and cost pressure in logistics, including higher transportation and warehousing costs and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input cost of our international businesses. Despite our efforts to reduce expenses, we posted a double-digit EBIT decline greater than we anticipated. Anthony will discuss our gross margin performance and outlook in much greater detail in a few minutes. 
As a reminder, at the close of our first quarter, we told you that we didn't expect our performance in fiscal 2015 to be the evenly distributed across quarters. As a result, we said at the time that evaluating our business performance on a first half basis rather than a quarterly basis would be more meaningful. We still believe a first half view gives the most informative picture of the business. 
Turning to our first half performance. Organic sales increased plus 2%. For the half, 4 of our 5 reporting segments achieved organic sales growth with gains in U.S. Simple Meals, including steady sales in U.S. soup. We posted positive organic sales in Global Baking and Snacking, Bolthouse Farms and Foodservice and International Simple Meals. Sales of U.S. Beverages declined. It is important to note that our recent acquisitions, Plum and the CPG portion of Bolthouse Farms, posted double-digit sales gains for the half and Kelsen biscuit sales increased as well. For the half, our gross margin was under pressure with the continuation of the input costs that were higher than anticipated and the supply chain issues that I previously discussed. 
Turning now to the back half. We plan to focus on fewer, bigger innovation platforms across our portfolio. As discussed at CAGNY last week, we believe this approach will have a more significant impact on the top line and reduce complexity in our supply chain. In the back half, we will continue to ramp up our health and well-being platform across our business. Our health and well-being platform includes new Campbell's Organic soup and the continued expansion of our Healthy Request line of soups. We are increasing the distribution of new V8 Veggie Blends juices for affordable mainstream juicing and V8 Protein Bars and Shakes, which are expanding the brand into adult on-the-go nutrition. In the packaged fresh category, this spring, we are launching 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, a new cold-pressed ultra premium organic juice. We will continue to expand Bolthouse Farms Kids fresh beverages, veggie and fruit snack tubes and carrot Veggie Snackers in the produce section. And we also have spring flavor innovations in place for superpremium fresh beverages, including an on-trend blueberry banana almond milk variety, a new variety of the salad dressings. In Simple Meals, we will introduce a range of premium and convenience platforms, including the expansion of our dinner sauces line with the addition of grilling sauces. We are also preparing for the launch of Campbell's Fresh-Brewed Soup cup  in K-cups, our joint development project with Keurig Green Mountain. And finally, we will introduce Prego and Pace ready meals in convenient, on-the-go microwavable pouches. 
We have also taken actions to address the supply chain issues that are within our control. For instance, we are making significant improvements to our freight and transportation management while our service level to customers and cost management is improving. We're taking steps to increase net price realization on our core business. We believe that these steps will help our gross margin performance improve, starting in the third quarter. And finally, we're managing SG&A and other costs aggressively across a number of areas, such as travel and hiring. Even with these efforts, we don't expect to offset the full impact of the margin pressures that we experienced in the first half. 
We recognize the challenging environment that we and our peers are operating in, particularly in center store categories. Consumer behavior and their preferences with respect to food are changing. There are many seismic shifts impacting our industry, which I discussed last week at CAGNY. We're taking these shifts into consideration as we pursue our dual mandate to strengthen our core business while at the same time to expand into faster-growing spaces. We recently announced a new enterprise structure to better align our organization to deliver on our strategy. 
After considerable thought and planning, we are reorganizing our company to unlock greater value from our people, brands and assets. This work is underway and will ramp up in the back half. We expect the creation of our 3 new divisions, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks and Packaged Fresh, coupled with our efforts to simplify our organizational structure, will result in streamlined operations, better execution and improved financial results over time all while delivering fewer, bigger product innovations that will delight consumers. As we implement this leaner and flatter organization structure, we are also adopting zero-based budgeting in fiscal 2016 to drive cost savings and to instill new cost discipline at Campbell. Together, we expect these initiatives to ramp up to annual cost savings of $200 million-plus over a 3-year period. 
This is a difficult time across the food industry. While we have made solid progress at Campbell's over the past 3.5 years to reshape our portfolio, it has not been enough. We are making necessary changes at our company, changes to the way we organize and manage our business and changes to the way we allocate resources and assets while managing costs to fund our growth. Simply put, we are taking more aggressive action on multiple fronts while staying resolutely focused on the consumer to change the growth trajectory of our business. 
Thank you. And now I will turn the call over to Anthony DiSilvestro."

Before getting into the details, I wanted to give my perspective on our second quarter performance and provide 2015 guidance. First, we are pleased with our overall sales performance. Organic sales, following the 5% growt",2305,"Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before getting into the details, I wanted to give my perspective on our second quarter performance and provide 2015 guidance. First, we are pleased with our overall sales performance. Organic sales, following the 5% growth in the first quarter, were flat in the second quarter with the first half now at plus 2%. Our updated sales guidance reflects an increased headwind from currency. Excluding currency, our sales outlook remains unchanged from our previous 2015 guidance. 
However, reflecting disappointing gross margin performance, second quarter EBIT was down 17% and below our expectations. I'll discuss the details of our gross margin performance shortly. Importantly, for the balance of the year, we expect to see improved gross margin performance as inflation and supply chain headwinds moderate and we take actions to improve our net price realization. As we announced on February 12, given our second quarter performance and revised outlook for the balance of the year, including the impact of currency translation, we lowered our full year guidance. 
Now I'll take you through our second quarter results, segment highlights, and then review the guidance. For the second quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined by 2% to $2,234,000,000 due to the negative impact of currency translation. Organic net sales were comparable to the prior year as gains in both our Global Baking and Snacking and our Bolthouse Farms and Foodservice segments were primarily offset by declines in U.S. Simple Meals and U.S. Beverages. Following a strong first quarter, sales in the second quarter were negatively impacted by movements in retailer inventory levels, including earlier holiday shipments that benefited the prior quarter. With these timing-related items now behind us, first half reported sales increased 1% with organic sales gaining 2%. 
Adjusted EBIT in the quarter fell 17% due to a lower gross margin percentage and unfavorable currency, partly offset by reductions in marketing spending. In the first half, adjusted EBIT declined 4% as the negative impact of a lower gross margin percentage and currency were partly offset by volume gains and lower marketing and administrative expenses. Reflecting lower interest expense and a lower tax rate, adjusted earnings per share decreased 30% to $0.66 in the quarter. At $1.40 for the first half, adjusted EPS is down 1%. 
Decomposing our sales performance. Favorable volume/mix contributed 1 point to sales growth. Gains in volume/mix in the Global Baking and Snacking and Bolthouse and Foodservice segments were partly offset by declines in U.S. Simple Meals, the segment most impacted by the inventory and holiday shipment timing between the first and second quarters. Higher selling prices, primarily in Global Baking and Snacking, added 1 point of growth. Overall, increased promotional spending lowered sales by 2 percentage points. The pressure came largely from the Global Baking and Snacking and U.S. Simple Meals segments. Currency reduced sales by 2 points as our 2 primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, both weakened further against the U.S. dollar. 
Here is our gross margin bridge for the second quarter. The gross margin declined by about 3 points in the quarter compared to the prior year. First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative margin impact of 3.6 points. About 2/3 of this was cost inflation, which as a rate increased by approximately 4%, reflecting continuing decreases in meat, tomatoes, dairy, steel cans and chocolate and includes the negative impact of mark-to-market losses on open commodity hedging contracts. While inflation was slightly higher in the quarter than anticipated, we expect inflation to moderate in the back half. 
The remaining 1/3 came from our supply chain, where we experienced increases in manufacturing costs, in freight and distribution and from the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input cost of our international businesses. I'll comment further on the first 2. Our manufacturing costs are higher as we temporarily increased the use of co-packers to meet short-term demand and from an equipment outage in one of our major plants. On freight and distribution, to meet our customer service levels, we've incurred higher transportation costs based both on our usage and rates, the impact of which we've seen moderate during the quarter. Looking ahead, to next year, our investments in Soup Common Platform, broth capacity and changes in our committed freight capacity should mitigate the impact of these factors. 
Promotional spending negatively impacted gross margin by 100 basis points primarily due to higher spending in the Baking and Snacking segment. And while volumes increased in this segment, trade had a negative impact on margin. Higher selling prices, primarily in Baking and Snacking, added 40 basis points. Lastly, we continue to drive meaningful productivity gains in our supply chain, which contributed 130 basis points of improvement. As I'll discuss in connection with the guidance, we expect that our gross margins will expand slightly in the second half. 
Marketing and selling expenses decreased 10% in the quarter, reflecting reductions in advertising in U.S. Simple Meals and Pepperidge Farm, helping to offset some of the gross margin pressure. Administrative expenses were down 1% as lower benefit costs, cost savings from prior restructuring initiatives and the impact of currency were mostly offset by increased long-term incentive compensation costs compared to the prior year, which benefited from reduction in estimated payouts. On the topic of incentive compensation more broadly, we now expect a full year 2015 headwind on incentive compensation costs of approximately $0.06 per share compared to our original estimate of $0.09 per share as we have lowered our assumption for estimated payouts on long-term and annual bonuses.  
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS growth between our operating performance and below-the-line items. As you could see, adjusted EPS declined by $0.10 per share, $0.12 of which is attributable to the decline in EBIT. Net interest expense declined $4 million versus a year ago as we reduced our debt level. And this contributed $0.01 to EPS growth in the quarter. Our tax rate for the quarter was 27.9%, down 310 basis points versus the prior year adjusted rate due to the favorable resolution of an intercompany pricing agreement between the U.S. and Canada. The lower tax rate in the quarter added $0.03 to EPS. We now expect the tax rate for fiscal 2015 in the range of 30% to 31% versus our previous guidance of 31% to 32%. Under our strategic share repurchase program, we repurchased $50 million in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $100 million. With rounding, you don't see an EPS impact on the quarter. Currency had a $0.02 impact on EPS. For the full year and based on current spot rates, we estimate currency will have a 2 point or $0.05 per share negative impact. 
Now turning to our segment results. Sales declined in U.S. Simple Meals by 3%, primarily driven by volume declines and higher promotional spending. U.S. soup sales decreased 6% following a 6 point gain in Q1 as the timing between quarters was impacted by movement in retailer inventory levels and the timing of our quarters relative to the Thanksgiving holiday. Sales of other Simple Meals increased 6%, driven by growth in Plum, Prego and our dinner sauce platform. Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals declined primarily due to higher inflation and the supply chain cost I discussed earlier. 
In Global Baking and Snacking, 4% organic sales growth was driven by the strong performance of Arnott's. We achieved consumption to share gains in the Australian biscuit category and Indonesia delivered another quarter of double-digit sales gains. Within Pepperidge Farm, Goldfish crackers delivered strong sales gains, which were partially offset by softness in frozen products. Kelsen sales declined slightly reflecting the shift of the Chinese New Year further into our third quarter, although Baking and Snacking posted strong operating earnings driven by the organic sales growth and lower marketing spend. 
In the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment, organic growth was driven by sales gains in Foodservice and in Bolthouse premium beverages and salad dressings while Bolthouse Farms carrot and natural ingredient sales declined. The decline in operating earnings was primarily driven by a lower gross margin percentage and higher administrative expenses as the prior year benefited from a reduction in long-term incentive compensation accruals. The decline in gross margin percentage reflects higher carrot cost, including the impact of adverse weather. 
International Simple Meals and Beverages organic sales declined 2% with the lower sales in Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. Sales in Canada were comparable to the prior year following a very strong first quarter. Declines in operating earnings were due to cost inflation, the adverse impact of currency on input cost and the negative impact in currency translation. U.S. Beverage sales fell 4% as declines in V8 V-Fusion more than offset gains in V8 Splash. Operating earnings declined primarily due to higher promotional spending, including new item introduction cost, cost inflation and increased supply chain costs. 
For the first half, I want to focus your attention specifically on the performance of the U.S. Simple Meals segment. With the timing shift in Q1 and Q2 now behind us, U.S. Simple Meals sales increased 2% for the half, driven by volume gains in the segment. U.S. soup sales were comparable to the prior year while sales of other Simple Meals increased 10% driven by growth in Plum, Prego and our dinner sauce platform. Operating earnings declined 3%, reflecting cost inflation and higher supply chain cost, partly offset by productivity improvements, lower marketing expenses, sales gains and the benefit of lapping the Plum recall in the prior year. 
For the remaining segments, the results for the half were similar to those of second quarter. Within U.S. soup, 6% lower sales in the second quarter was due to declines in condensed and Swanson broth, which were impacted by the timing of shipments between the first and second quarters while the ready-to-serve soup sales were comparable to the prior year. While our soup sales decreased 6%, consumer takeaway in measured channels for the comparable 13-week period ending February 1 declined 1%. For the first half, as shown at the bottom of the chart, soup sales in aggregate were comparable to the prior year as a 3% decline in condensed was offset by 7% growth in broth with ready-to-serve sales comparable to the prior year. We ended the quarter with retailer inventory decisions comparable to the prior year. 
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending February 1, 2015, the category as a whole declined 1.2%. Our sales in measured channels declined 1.9% with weakness in condensed and ready-to-serve, partly offset by strength in broth. Our share declined 50 basis points in the last 52 weeks and has been relatively stable over the past 2 years. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28% with gains driven by smaller players. Private label also grew share, finishing at 13%. 
We had strong cash flow performance in the first half as cash from operations increased by $221 million to $584 million as we wrap the taxes paid in 2014 on the divestiture of the European Simple Meals business and due to lower working capital requirements and pension contributions in 2015. Capital expenditures increased to $143 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures of about $400 million for the year as we increase capacity to support growth in our faster-growing businesses. We paid dividends totaling $199 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. In aggregate, we repurchased 133 million of shares in the half, 100 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. Based on our current plans, we anticipate making strategic share repurchases at this pace on average for the balance of the year. Net debt declined by approximately $200 million to $3.7 billion. 
Now I'll step through our 2015 guidance, which is consistent with our news release on February 12. As a reminder, growth rates are based off a 52-week adjusted fiscal 2014 base. Beginning with net sales, we expect changes in net sales to be in the range of minus 1% to plus 1%, including a currency headwind of 2 points.  Excluding currency, our sales outlook was unchanged from our previous guidance. We expect adjusted EBIT to decline between minus 7% and minus 5%, reflecting weaker-than-anticipated gross margin performance. Our first half performance has been impacted by inflation, supply chain cost and currency. We expect improved year-on-year performance in the back half as inflation and the supply chain impacts moderate as we exit the season and we realize the benefit of several list price increases and promotional spending reductions, which are now in the marketplace. For the full year, we forecast that our gross margin percentage will decline by approximately 1 point. At EPS and reflecting a tax rate in the range of 30% to 31% and this expense slightly below the prior year, we expect adjusted EPS to decline between minus 5% and minus 3%, a range of $2.32 to $2.38. In terms of quarters, directionally we expect a relatively weak third quarter followed by a stronger Q4. 
As we discussed at the CAGNY conference last week, we have launched a major cost reduction initiative, targeting a $200 million-plus annual cost opportunity by adopting a zero-based budgeting approach. While we expected deliver savings beginning in our fiscal 2016, we do not anticipate a material impact on our 2015 results. As we said last week, we are in the early stages and we'll have more to say about the initiative and impact on our performance as we make progress. 
That concludes my remarks. And now I'll turn it back to Jennifer for Q&A."

So what that's resulted in is some more interplant shipments, less use of intermodal and a higher utilization of the spot market at a time when carrier capacity has been constrained and the rates have been higher.

But can I just focus specifically on the soup segment? Just from looking at what's going on in the grocery stores, there seems to be a shift into newer products that are in cartons and other new packaging formats, not necessarily the can. And Campbell's is obviously joining this trend with the organic soups and bisques, broths and so on. But how does that affect your margins over the long-term? In the near term, I imagine using co-packers reduces the margins. Longer term, if you were able to scale those and bring them back in-house, would the gross margins be comparable? And is there also margin pressure across the U.S. Simple Meals category if the new pouched skillets and dinner sauces are replacing sales of condensed soup for cooking?"

Alexia, I do think that the major shift for us in terms of out-of-the-can packaging has been in the area of premium soup, which has been a place where we've expanded our Campbell's Slow Kettle in tubs, our bisques in boxes and now our new organic soups, which are also going to that segment. And that segment is growing. And that segment also commands a higher price point, so we're very pleased with the margins that are in that particular segment. That said, the canned soup business is still several billion dollars and very profitable. And so bringing news to the core business is also an important part of our program here. And I think the best example I can give you in terms of margins is on the broth business. Recall once upon a time, Swanson broth was 100% in cans. And over time, after the introduction of the aseptic Swanson broth at a higher retail and very solid margins, we've been able to manage that conversion at the pace that the consumer has taken us there. And so we now have 2 very profitable offerings in that particular space. So I hope that answers your question."

And what we've realized is if we can cluster our innovation into fewer, bigger platforms that have scale in the marketplace and can have a bigger impact, that would be a better program that we are now prepared to run. And so for example, if you look at health and wellness, innovation in the organic space, innovation in the fresh space and innovation in vegetable nutrition are 3 big platforms that we believe we can build out.

And then we went from that to 4 rain events within a 10-day period, which also caused us on the carrot cost side. And both of those situations have impacted our business.

I'm just trying to get a sense of whether you view the current level of gross margins as maybe somewhat artificially low or as really a new, more reasonable base from which you try and improve going forward in light of the various reinvestment needs you've got, gross margin mix of some of the faster growth areas put against the ZBB actions you're going to take. And then just secondly, you're taking some pricing actions even in soups, you talked about. I always thought it was tough to take pricing sort of intrasoup season. And is it just more on the versions that you know are very inelastic but allow you to do that? Just trying to get a sense of what's changed there."

And I think when you think about the new organizational structure, coupled with the portfolio roles that we've assigned to each of those businesses, we really do have an opportunity to improve gross margin performance both from net price realization, both from a more modest inflation outlook, continuing productivity improvement and the cost savings we expect to garner through our new $200 million program. So I think there are opportunities to expand margin over time. In terms of the pricing question, I mean, certainly in terms of benefit, we get more benefit by enacting a pricing action ahead of the soup season, where there's nothing that really prevents us from doing it at any point. The key is to work through the timing and the impact on the promotional activity with our retailers. But this was well-planned-out and it's now in the marketplace."

That's more of a broth idea than a canned idea. Separate from that in this whole area of fixed cost, it's not a major impact, but our sales came down a little bit inside our own range.

We also expect interest expense to be favorable to our original assumption, so down slightly year-on-year. And then within EBIT, I would say there's 3 things happening.

And that's a combination of the freight and distribution that we've been talking about, the manufacturing cost that we've been talking about, the use of co-packers, we had a slight impact from an equipment outage at one of our plants and from a stronger U.S. dollar that impact on the input cost on some of our international businesses. The second area is currency translation, so we went from about 1 point of negative impact to 2 points and about $0.05 impact at EPS now for the year. And the third, I mentioned a moment ago, is a slight sales reduction within our range, which had some impact on gross margin dollars more so than percentage.

Today, I will share my perspective on our second quarter and first half performance, our plans for the remainder of the year and finally, our initiative to create a new enterprise structure while driving significant cost savings over the next 3 years. Our CFO, Anthony DiSilvestro, will discuss our financial performance and segment results in greater detail, and then we'll have time for your questions. 
My perspective about the second quarter is highly influenced by some of the factors we shared with you during our first quarter call. As a reminder, we had a strong first quarter with organic net sales up 5%, adjusted EBIT up 9% and adjusted EPS up 12%. Recall that in quarter 1, we experienced higher input cost than expected, and this situation continued into quarter 2. We started the year with a stronger seasonal sell-in. We also had more holiday promotion activity ship in quarter 1 because of the timing of our quarter-end relative to Thanksgiving. This shift droves sales growth in Campbell's condensed soups, Swanson broth and our Pepperidge Farms Stuffing businesses ahead of consumption. 
The strong first quarter put pressure on our supply chain to maintain acceptable customer service levels. To serve our customers, we ran our plants overtime and shipped product from all over our network to meet the increased demand. We also increased our use of spot market transportation, which resulted in higher rates in a constrained market and fueled additional cost. These supply chain issues continued into the second quarter as we made the decision to incur additional expenses to improve our customer service levels. 
With this as background, let me now offer my perspective on our second quarter results. Our organic sales performance was comparable to year ago. In the quarter, declines in U.S. soup were impacted by quarter 1 sales growth, which benefited from movements in retailer inventory levels and the timing of quarter end relative to the Thanksgiving holiday. This had an expected adverse impact on Q2 soup sales. In the quarter, we delivered positive sales growth in our large U.S. sauce brands, Prego and Pace, as well as in Plum Organics baby food, in the CPG portion of Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings and in our Foodservice business. 
I was pleased with our Global Baking and Snacking business, which delivered solid organic top line growth as well as strong bottom line growth with contributions from both Arnott's and Pepperidge Farm. I was not satisfied with the performance of the U.S. Beverage business. Sales of our V8 V-Fusion franchise declined while V8 Splash and V8 + Energy performed well in the quarter. In January, we started shipping our new V8 Veggie Blends, which have been well received by our customers. 
Our biggest disappointment in the quarter was our gross margin performance. As I mentioned previously, we continue to face persistent challenges with increased inflation and cost pressure in logistics, including higher transportation and warehousing costs and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input costs of our international businesses. Despite our efforts to reduce expenses, we posted a double-digit EBIT decline greater than we anticipated. Anthony will discuss our gross margin performance and outlook in much greater detail in a few minutes. 
As a reminder, at the close of our first quarter, we told you that we didn't expect our performance in fiscal 2015 to be evenly distributed across quarters. As a result, we said at the time that evaluating our business performance on a first half basis rather than a quarterly basis would be more meaningful. We still believe a first half view gives the most informative picture of the business. 
Turning to our first half performance. Organic sales increased plus 2%. For the half, 4 of our 5 reporting segments achieved organic sales growth with gains in U.S. Simple Meals, including steady sales in U.S. Soup. We posted positive organic sales in Global Baking and Snacking, Bolthouse Farms and Foodservice and International Simple Meals. Sales of U.S. Beverages declined. It is important to note that our recent acquisitions, Plum and the CPG portion of Bolthouse Farms, posted double-digit sales gains for the half and Kelsen biscuit sales increased as well. For the half, our gross margin was under pressure with the continuation of the input costs that were higher than anticipated and the supply chain issues that I previously discussed. 
Turning now to the back half. We plan to focus on fewer, bigger innovation platforms across our portfolio. As discussed at CAGNY last week, we believe this approach will have a more significant impact on the top line and reduce complexity in our supply chain. In the back half, we will continue to ramp up our health and well-being platform across our business. Our health and well-being platform includes new Campbell's Organic soup and the continued expansion of our Healthy Request line of soups. We are increasing the distribution of new V8 Veggie Blends juices for affordable mainstream juicing and V8 Protein Bars and Shakes, which are expanding the brand into adult on-the-go nutrition. In the packaged fresh category, this spring, we are launching 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, a new cold-pressed ultra premium organic juice. We will continue to expand Bolthouse Farms Kids fresh beverages, veggie and fruit snack tubes and carrot Veggie Snackers in the produce section. And we also have spring flavor innovations in place for superpremium fresh beverages, including an on-trend blueberry banana almond milk variety, and new varieties of salad dressings. In Simple Meals, we will introduce a range of premium and convenience platforms, including the expansion of our dinner sauces line with the addition of grilling sauces. We are also preparing for the launch of Campbell's Fresh-Brewed Soup cup -- in K-cups, our joint development project with Keurig Green Mountain. And finally, we will introduce Prego and Pace ready meals in convenient, on-the-go microwavable pouches. 
We have also taken actions to address the supply chain issues that are within our control. For instance, we are making significant improvements to our freight and transportation management while our service level to customers and cost management is improving. We're taking steps to increase net price realization on our core business. We believe that these steps will help our gross margin performance improve, starting in the third quarter. And finally, we're managing SG&A and other costs aggressively across a number of areas, such as travel and hiring. Even with these efforts, we don't expect to offset the full impact of the margin pressures that we experienced in the first half. 
We recognize the challenging environment that we and our peers are operating in, particularly in center store categories. Consumer behavior and their preferences with respect to food are changing. There are many seismic shifts impacting our industry, which I discussed last week at CAGNY. We're taking these shifts into consideration as we pursue our dual mandate to strengthen our core business while at the same time to expand into faster-growing spaces. We recently announced a new enterprise structure to better align our organization to deliver on our strategy. 
After considerable thought and planning, we are reorganizing our company to unlock greater value from our people, brands and assets. This work is underway and will ramp up in the back half. We expect the creation of our 3 new divisions, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks and Packaged Fresh, coupled with our efforts to simplify our organization structure, will result in streamlined operations, better execution and improved financial results over time all while delivering fewer, bigger product innovations that will delight consumers. As we implement this leaner and flatter organization structure, we are also adopting zero-based budgeting in fiscal 2016 to drive cost savings and to instill new cost discipline at Campbell. Together, we expect these initiatives to ramp up to annual cost savings of $200 million-plus over a 3-year period. 
This is a difficult time across the food industry. While we have made solid progress at Campbell's over the past 3.5 years to reshape our portfolio, it has not been enough. We are making necessary changes at our company, changes to the way we organize and manage our business and changes to the way we allocate resources and assets while managing costs to fund our growth. Simply put, we are taking more aggressive action on multiple fronts while staying resolutely focused on the consumer to change the growth trajectory of our business. 
Thank you. And now I will turn the call over to Anthony DiSilvestro."

Before getting into the details, I wanted to give my perspective on our second quarter performance and provide 2015 guidance. First, we are pleased with our overall sales performance. Organic sales, following 5% growth in",2307,"Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before getting into the details, I wanted to give my perspective on our second quarter performance and provide 2015 guidance. First, we are pleased with our overall sales performance. Organic sales, following 5% growth in the first quarter, were flat in the second quarter with the first half now at plus 2%. Our updated sales guidance reflects an increased headwind from currency. Excluding currency, our sales outlook remains unchanged from our previous 2015 guidance. 
However, reflecting disappointing gross margin performance, second quarter EBIT was down 17% and below our expectations. I'll discuss the details of our gross margin performance shortly. Importantly, for the balance of the year, we expect to see improved gross margin performance as inflation and supply chain headwinds moderate and we take actions to improve our net price realization. As we announced on February 12, given our second quarter performance and revised outlook for the balance of the year, including the impact of currency translation, we lowered our full year guidance. 
Now I'll take you through our second quarter results, segment highlights, and then review the guidance. For the second quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined by 2% to $2,234,000,000 due to the negative impact of currency translation. Organic net sales were comparable to the prior year as gains in both our Global Baking and Snacking and our Bolthouse Farms and Foodservice segments were primarily offset by declines in U.S. Simple Meals and U.S. Beverages. Following a strong first quarter, sales in the second quarter were negatively impacted by movements in retailer inventory levels, including earlier holiday shipments that benefited the prior quarter. With these timing-related items now behind us, first half reported sales increased 1% with organic sales gaining 2%. 
Adjusted EBIT in the quarter fell 17% due to a lower gross margin percentage and unfavorable currency, partly offset by reductions in marketing spending. In the first half, adjusted EBIT declined 4% as the negative impact of a lower gross margin percentage and currency were partly offset by volume gains and lower marketing and administrative expenses. Reflecting lower interest expense and a lower tax rate, adjusted earnings per share decreased 13% to $0.66 in the quarter. At $1.40 for the first half, adjusted EPS is down 1%. 
Decomposing our sales performance. Favorable volume/mix contributed 1 point to sales growth. Gains in volume/mix in the Global Baking and Snacking and Bolthouse and Foodservice segments were partly offset by declines in U.S. Simple Meals, the segment most impacted by the inventory and holiday shipment timing between the first and second quarters. Higher selling prices, primarily in Global Baking and Snacking, added 1 point of growth. Overall, increased promotional spending lowered sales by 2 percentage points. The pressure came largely from the Global Baking and Snacking and U.S. Simple Meals segments. Currency reduced sales by 2 points as our 2 primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, both weakened further against the U.S. dollar. 
Here is our gross margin bridge for the second quarter. The gross margin declined by about 3 points in the quarter compared to the prior year. First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative margin impact of 3.6 points. About 2/3 of this was cost inflation, which as a rate increased by approximately 4%, reflecting continuing increases in meat, tomatoes, dairy, steel cans and chocolate and includes the negative impact of mark-to-market losses on open commodity hedging contracts. While inflation was slightly higher in the quarter than anticipated, we expect inflation to moderate in the back half. 
The remaining 1/3 came from our supply chain, where we experienced increases in manufacturing costs, in freight and distribution and from the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input costs of our international businesses. I'll comment further on the first 2. Our manufacturing costs are higher as we've temporarily increased the use of co-packers to meet short-term demand and from an equipment outage in one of our major plants. On freight and distribution, to meet our customer service levels, we've incurred higher transportation costs based both on our usage and rates, the impact of which we've seen moderate during the quarter. Looking ahead, to next year, our investments in Soup Common Platform, broth capacity and changes in our committed freight capacity should mitigate the impact of these factors. 
Promotional spending negatively impacted gross margin by 100 basis points primarily due to higher spending in the Baking and Snacking segment. And while volumes increased in this segment, trade had a negative impact on margin. Higher selling prices, primarily in Baking and Snacking, added 40 basis points. Lastly, we've continued to drive meaningful productivity gains in our supply chain, which contributed 130 basis points of improvement. As I'll discuss in connection with the guidance, we expect that our gross margins will expand slightly in the second half. 
Marketing and selling expenses decreased 10% in the quarter, reflecting reductions in advertising in U.S. Simple Meals and Pepperidge Farm, helping to offset some of the gross margin pressure. Administrative expenses were down 1% as lower benefit costs, cost savings from prior restructuring initiatives and the impact of currency were mostly offset by increased long-term incentive compensation costs compared to the prior year, which benefited from reduction in estimated payouts. On the topic of incentive compensation more broadly, we now expect a full year 2015 headwind on incentive compensation costs of approximately $0.06 per share compared to our original estimate of $0.09 per share as we have lowered our assumption for estimated payouts on long-term and annual bonuses.  
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS growth between our operating performance and below-the-line items. As you can see, adjusted EPS declined by $0.10 per share, $0.12 of which is attributable to the decline in EBIT. Net interest expense declined $4 million versus a year ago as we reduced our debt level. And this contributed $0.01 to EPS growth in the quarter. Our tax rate for the quarter was 27.9%, down 310 basis points versus the prior year adjusted rate due to the favorable resolution of an intercompany pricing agreement between the U.S. and Canada. The lower tax rate in the quarter added $0.03 to EPS. We now expect a tax rate for fiscal 2015 in the range of 30% to 31% versus our previous guidance of 31% to 32%. Under our strategic share repurchase program, we repurchased $50 million in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $100 million. With rounding, you don't see an EPS impact on the quarter. Currency had a $0.02 impact on EPS. For the full year and based on current spot rates, we estimate currency will have a 2 point or $0.05 per share negative impact. 
Now turning to our segment results. Sales declined in U.S. Simple Meals by 3%, primarily driven by volume declines and higher promotional spending. U.S. soup sales decreased 6% following a 6 point gain in Q1 as the timing between quarters was impacted by movements in retailer inventory levels and the timing of our quarters relative to the Thanksgiving holiday. Sales of other Simple Meals increased 6%, driven by growth in Plum, Prego and our dinner sauce platform. Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals declined primarily due to higher inflation and the supply chain costs I discussed earlier. 
In Global Baking and Snacking, 4% organic sales growth was driven by the strong performance of Arnott's. We achieved consumption and share gains in the Australian biscuit category and Indonesia delivered another quarter of double-digit sales gains. Within Pepperidge Farm, Goldfish crackers delivered strong sales gains, which were partially offset by softness in frozen products. Kelsen sales declined slightly reflecting the shift of the Chinese New Year further into our third quarter, although Baking and Snacking posted strong operating earnings driven by the organic sales growth and lower marketing spend. 
In the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment, organic growth was driven by sales gains in Foodservice and in Bolthouse premium beverages and salad dressings while Bolthouse Farms carrot and natural ingredient sales declined. The decline in operating earnings was primarily driven by a lower gross margin percentage and higher administrative expenses as the prior year benefited from a reduction in long-term incentive compensation accruals. The decline in gross margin percentage reflects higher carrot costs, including the impact of adverse weather. 
International Simple Meals and Beverages organic sales declined 2% with lower sales in Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. Sales in Canada were comparable to the prior year following a very strong first quarter. Declines in operating earnings were due to cost inflation, the adverse impact of currency on input costs and the negative impact in currency translation. U.S. Beverage sales fell 4% as declines in V8 V-Fusion more than offset gains in V8 Splash. Operating earnings declined primarily due to higher promotional spending, including new item introduction cost, cost inflation and increased supply chain costs. 
For the first half, I want to focus your attention specifically on the performance of the U.S. Simple Meals segment. With the timing shift in Q1 and Q2 now behind us, U.S. Simple Meals sales increased 2% for the half, driven by volume gains in the segment. U.S. soup sales were comparable to the prior year while sales of other Simple Meals increased 10% driven by growth in Plum, Prego and our dinner sauce platform. Operating earnings declined 3%, reflecting cost inflation and higher supply chain costs, partly offset by productivity improvements, lower marketing expenses, sales gains and the benefit of lapping the Plum recall in the prior year. 
For the remaining segments, the results for the half were similar to those of the second quarter. Within U.S. Soup, 6% lower sales in the second quarter was due to declines in condensed and Swanson broth, which were impacted by the timing of shipments between the first and second quarters while the ready-to-serve soup sales were comparable to the prior year. While our soup sales decreased 6%, consumer takeaway in measured channels for the comparable 13-week period ending February 1 declined 1%. For the first half, as shown at the bottom of the chart, soup sales in aggregate were comparable to the prior year as a 3% decline in condensed was offset by 7% growth in broth with ready-to-serve sales comparable to the prior year. We ended the quarter with retailer inventory positions comparable to the prior year. 
Here's a look at U.S. Wet Soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending February 1, 2015, the category as a whole declined 1.2%. Our sales in measured channels declined 1.9% with weakness in condensed and ready-to-serve, partly offset by strength in broth. Our share declined 50 basis points in the last 52 weeks and has been relatively stable over the past 2 years. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28% with gains driven by smaller players. Private label also grew share, finishing at 13%. 
We had strong cash flow performance in the first half as cash from operations increased by $221 million to $584 million as we wrap the taxes paid in 2014 on the divestiture of the European Simple Meals business and due to lower working capital requirements and pension contributions in 2015. Capital expenditures increased to $143 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures of about $400 million for the year as we increase capacity to support growth in our faster-growing businesses. We paid dividends totaling $199 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. In aggregate, we repurchased 133 million of shares in the half, 100 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. Based on our current plans, we anticipate making strategic share repurchases at this pace on average for the balance of the year. Net debt declined by approximately $200 million to $3.7 billion. 
Now I'll step through our 2015 guidance, which is consistent with our news release on February 12. As a reminder, growth rates are based off a 52-week adjusted fiscal 2014 base. Beginning with net sales, we expect changes in net sales to be in the range of minus 1% to plus 1%, including a currency headwind of 2 points.  Excluding currency, our sales outlook was unchanged from our previous guidance. We expect adjusted EBIT to decline between minus 7% and minus 5%, reflecting weaker than anticipated gross margin performance. Our first half performance has been impacted by inflation, supply chain costs and currency. We expect improved year-on-year performance in the back half as inflation and the supply chain impacts moderate as we exit the season and we realize the benefit of several list price increases and promotional spending reductions, which are now in the marketplace. For the full year, we forecast that our gross margin percentage will decline by approximately 1 point. And EPS, and reflecting a tax rate in the range of 30% to 31% and interest expense slightly below the prior year, we expect adjusted EPS to decline between minus 5% and minus 3%, a range of $2.32 to $2.38. In terms of quarters, directionally we expect a relatively weak third quarter followed by a stronger Q4. 
As we discussed at the CAGNY conference last week, we have launched a major cost reduction initiative, targeting a $200 million-plus annual cost opportunity by adopting a zero-based budgeting approach. While we expect to deliver savings beginning in our fiscal 2016, we do not anticipate a material impact on our 2015 results. As we said last week, we are in the early stages and we'll have more to say about the initiative and impact on our performance as we make progress. 
That concludes my remarks. And now I'll turn it back to Jennifer for Q&A."

So what that's resulted in is some more interplant shipments, less use of intermodal and a higher utilization of the spot market at a time when carrier capacity has been constrained and the rates have been higher. So those 3 things are really the primary drivers of the costs in freight and distribution and those which are a pretty significant part of the supply chain costs we've been talking about."

The other thing that we did was in the biscuit business, we did have higher trade on Pepperidge Farm as we drove more merchandising in particularly the second quarter. And then Arnott's, we had a price increase and we did spend trade to make sure we protected promoted prices in the marketplace. The other thing that affected trade was soup, the launch of our new organic soup and also the launch of Veggie Blends, where we've put new distribution funds in place on those 2 businesses. Going forward, we absolutely believe that advertising is a solid grower of top line, as is consumer. And as we work through our new divisions and their portfolio roles, we will be making sure that we're allocating those investments to the places that have the greatest profitable growth opportunity for us."

And Campbell's is obviously joining this trend with the organic soups and bisques, and so on. But how does that affect your margins over the long-term? In the near term, I imagine using co-packers reduces the margins. Longer term, if you were able to scale those and bring them back in-house, would the gross margins be comparable?

And I think the best example I can give you in terms of margins is on the broth business. Recall once upon a time, Swanson broth was 100% in cans. And over time, after the introduction of the aseptic Swanson broth at a higher retail and very solid margins, we've been able to manage that conversion at the pace that the consumer has taken us there.

We would like to get them to between 13% to 15%. So we still have more work to do, but we are totally in a different place. That said, we've been able to go back and look at literally the plethora of activity in that space. And what we've realized is if we can cluster our innovation into fewer, bigger platforms that have scale in the marketplace and can have a bigger impact, that would be a better program that we are now prepared to run. And so for example, if you look at health and wellness, innovation in the organic space, innovation in the fresh space and innovation in vegetable nutrition are 3 big platforms that we believe we can build out. In Simple Meals, our whole dinner sauces with skillets, oven, slow cooker and now grilling can be a platform that will have a meaningful difference in the category.

As you know, we went from a very unique drought situation and that raised our costs in terms of water costs, water extraction costs, land costs. And then we went from that to 4 rain events within a 10-day period, which also cost us on the carrot cost side. And both of those situations have impacted our business. The reason I said I believe it's behind us is now we've shifted our harvesting to the more Southern region, where they don't have the same kind of situation. We saw improved performance in the back end of our quarter, so we feel pretty good about the outlook.

I think that maybe the best way to answer the question is we expect to spend about $400 million this year on capital, 60% of which is on projects that have an economic return. And those are split between capacity-adding projects and cost-reduction projects. On the capacity-adding projects, we typically see pretty significant and attractive IRRs, I'd say 20% plus kind of levels. On the cost-reduction ones, I'd say we do see returns certainly above the cost of capital. It's kind of hard to come up with one kind of IRR from them to kind of range.

And that's a combination of the freight and distribution that we've been talking about, the manufacturing costs that we've been talking about, the use of co-packers, we had a slight impact from an equipment outage at one of our plants and from a stronger U.S. dollar, that impact on the input costs of some of our international businesses. The second area is currency translation, so we went from about 1 point of negative impact to 2 points and about $0.05 impact at EPS now for the year. And the third, I mentioned a moment ago, is a slight sales reduction within our range, which had some impact on gross margin dollars more so than percentage.

As usual, we've created sides to accompany our earnings presentation. You'll find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. The call's open to the media who participate in listen only mode. 
Today, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 2 in our presentation or to our SEC filings for a list of the factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements. 
In the third quarter, the company incurred charges associated with our recently announced initiatives to implement a new enterprise design that better aligns with our strategy, reduces costs and streamlines organizational structure. The company commenced the voluntary separation program and recorded pretax restructuring charges of $9 million related to the program for severance and benefit-related costs. The company also recorded pretax charges of $9 million in administrative expenses related to the implementation of these initiatives. The after-tax impact of the restructuring charges and implementation cost was $11 million or $0.04 per share. 
Our comparisons in fiscal 2015 with 2014 will exclude those items impacting comparability. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix. 
Before we begin our discussion of the quarter, I'd like to cordially invite our sell side analysts and institutional investors to our Annual Investor Day at Campbell's world headquarters. RSVPs are required. Campbell's [indiscernible] and all others are invited to join via webcast. This year's event will be held the afternoon of Wednesday, July 22. We plan to make it a very informative day for you, featuring presentations by Denise Morrison, Anthony DiSilvestro and our 3 divisional presidents. We'll include updates on our plans for the company, the 3 divisions and our cost saving programs, and we'll also allow plenty of time for interacting with management. So with that, let me turn the call over to Denise Morrison."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our third quarter call. A great deal has transpired since we last spoke in February both at Campbell's and in the marketplace, so I believe it's worthwhile to spend time on both topics today. I will share my perspective on the third quarter and then comment on the broader state of the consumer and events in the food industry since our last earnings call. I'll also provide an update on the progress we made since last quarter in our strategic enterprise redesign, which we discussed in February. 
Overall, I am pleased with our results this quarter, especially the improvement in our gross margin. While sales declined in the quarter, this was primarily due to unfavorable currency and the impact of retailer inventory movements on our U.S. Soup business. Organic net sales declined by 1%. Importantly, gross margin improved as we took several actions to address the declines in the first half, and adjusted EBIT and EPS were better than expected. 
In U.S. Simple Meals, U.S. Soup sales were below our expectations, declining 10%. Consumption and market share remained relatively stable. The gap between consumption and sales performance was primarily due to significant unfavorable inventory movements by retailers. Our analysis suggests that this was largely a result of our reduction and trade spending and merchandising as compared to the prior year quarter. Last year, promotions did not generate the anticipated lift. Therefore, reducing our spending was the right thing to do. In doing so, we expected consumption and shipments to be down with retailer inventories relatively stable. In fact, consumption was actually better than we expected, but retailer inventory declines exceeded our expectations and are now below prior year levels. Consequently, sales were below expectations. 
Within our soup portfolio, we are encouraged by the performance of our premium offerings. Slow Kettle continues to perform well, and our new Campbell organic soups achieved solid distribution gains. Soups for Easy Cooking are below expectation. Looking ahead, we will begin shipping Campbell's fresh fruit, soup and K cups in the fourth quarter. 
In our other Simple Meals, business Prego continued to perform well, led by increases in white sauces and distinctive varieties. Consumption of Campbell dinner sauces remains strong and we will be adding new grilling sauces to the platform. Comp sales increased double digits in the quarter with both share and distribution gains. Plum is now the clear market share leader in organic baby food in the United States. Our shelf-stable U.S. beverage business performed within our expectations. While this business remains challenged, the early read on V8 Veggie Blends is encouraging. ACV distribution is on plan and trial is meeting our expectations. Most importantly, depth of repeat is strong. V8 Protein Bars and shakes are performing below expectations. 
In Global Baking and Snacking, excluding currency, sales rose with solid volume gains in Australia and Indonesia. We feel very good about the progress we've made in Asia Pacific under the new leadership team in that market. In the U.S., our Pepperidge Farm business delivered sales gains in fresh bakery, cookies and crackers. Notably, [indiscernible] sales increased 5% in the quarter, and marketing increased across our biscuit and snacks business. I'm particularly pleased that this segment's operating earnings increased 18%. 
Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings grew slightly. In our premium fresh beverage business, we were cycling inefficient promotions from a year ago, which we did not repeat in the quarter. Sales were also negatively impacted by a planned SKU rationalization and the introduction of fewer new items to reduce complexity. Our decision to optimize promotional spending contributed to much stronger operating earnings for the segment. Looking ahead, our spring innovation is now in the market, including our new coldpressed ultra-premium beverage line, 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, and the initial read has been positive, setting the stage for better sales growth in beverages in the fourth quarter. 
Clearly, our gross margin improvement was the main reason for encouragement in the quarter. We achieved net price realization by reducing promotional spending and taking pricing action. So far, consumer response to our pricing actions has been within our expectations. We benefited from moderating inflation and other factors and delivered an adjusted gross margin increase of 70 basis points, mitigating declines in the first half of the fiscal. Our adjusted EBIT of $305 million and EPS of $0.62 were ahead of what we expected. We are improving our EBIT and EPS guidance to the favorable end of our range. Anthony will discuss our guidance in more detail in a few minutes. 
Turning now to the industry dynamics. This is a tumultuous time in the food industry. We all recognize that the consumer landscape has changed dramatically driven by a number of seismic shifts. The great recession's impact on consumer purchasing behavior, global demographic changes, profound shifts in consumer preferences relative to food and the disruptive impact of digital technologies, all of these are contributing to mounting consumer demand for greater transparency about where and how their food is made. These shifts are converging to create a new normal for the food business. They produced a persistently challenging environment with significant volume pressure on mainstream food products, particularly center store categories. As a consequence of this new normal, industry participants have initiated a series of strategic actions, including spinoffs, consolidation, acquisitions of small purpose-driven brands and aggressive cost-cutting measures. The broad adoption of zero-based budgeting has set a new bar for cost management in the industry, and the recent consolidation only intensifies the situation placing even greater focus on cost management. 
Campbell is focused on creating shareholder value by strengthening our core business and expanding into faster growing spaces. Areas of emphasis include health and well-being, particularly fresh and organic foods, and biscuits and snacks in both developed and developing markets with a focus on Asia and Latin America. We are increasing our investment in digital marketing and connecting with consumers in line with our purpose, real food that matters for life's moments. We are doing all of this while instilling an ownership mindset that will help us aggressively manage our cost. We've been paying close attention to the industry dynamics and strongly believe a strategy that focuses on driving growth, aggressively reducing cost and reinvesting a portion of the savings in the area of our business with the greatest potential is the best way to create shareholder value over the long term. With that as context, let me update you on our strategic enterprise redesign. Anthony DiSilvestro will update you on our major cost reduction efforts in a few moments. 
We've begun to make changes in the structure of our enterprise to unlock the value of our assets, eliminate barriers to growth and fulfill our dual mandate to strengthen our core business and to expand in the faster-growing spaces. These changes are absolutely essential and will enable us to fully leverage or always learn about the key trends in the consumer, customer and business environment. We are working hard to complete the reorganization of our business operations into 3 principal divisions: first, Americas Simple Meals and beverages, which we will now [indiscernible] moderate growth and higher profits; second, Global Biscuits and Snacks, which will help us leverage the scale of our combined Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kelsen businesses across developed and developing markets; and finally, our package fresh division, where we will make focused investments to accelerate our growth in the package fresh category. 
We appointed the leadership teams for both America's Simple Meals and beverages and the Global Biscuits and Snacks division in the third quarter. Additionally, Ed Caroline [ph] has been named to the Campbell leadership team for our new integrated global services group, which will include elements of finance, information technology, marketing services, procurement and human resources. This group will be a key step in our efforts to reduce costs and elevate operational excellence through shared services and capability-building across the enterprise. 
We believe our strategic enterprise redesign, inclusive of our cost reduction efforts, will be game-changing for our company and for our culture. As we pursue our dual mandate guided by our purpose and growth agenda, this represents the logical next step in our goal of shifting our center of gravity, accelerating our growth trajectory and maximizing value for our shareholders. 
In closing, this has been a very eventful quarter for Campbell. Amidst all the organization changes underway at the company, the team remains focused on driving our performance. It's important to remember that while our industry navigates this small, little landscape, we continue to look at our business and the operating environment with clear eyes and a clear plan to make the necessary changes at Campbell to improve our performance. I look forward to sharing more of our strategic plans with you at our Investor Day on July 22. Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Anthony for a detailed discussion of our results."

Overall, we are pleased with our results for the third quarter. Organic sales were modestly below our expectations, declining slightly, which was primarily the result of movements in retailer inventory levels in the U.S. impacting our U.S. Soup business. Our gross margin percentage increased in the quarter, helping to recover some of the declines we experienced in the first half. Gross margin is benefiting from reductions in trade promotion spending across the number of our businesses, list price increases we've taken in a marketplace and a moderating level of cost inflation and improved performance relative to the first half in the area of rate and distribution. 
With 1 quarter remaining in the fiscal year, we're narrowing our guidance ranges. While sales are expected to be at the low end of the range, benefits from our cost reduction efforts and a reduction in expected incentive compensation costs are pushing us to the [indiscernible] end of the ranges for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS. 
As we've discussed, over the next 3 years, we plan to reduce cost by at least $200 million or 2% to 3% of annual sales. Leveraging a zero-based approach, we will streamline our organization structure to eliminate excess layers and target expense reductions across a number of cost categories. In connection with our organization efforts in the quarter for certain U.S.-based employees nearing retirement, we offered a voluntary employee separation program, under which most of the eligible employees who elected to participate will exit by the end of the fiscal year. Additionally, as we begin to implement a zero-based budgeting approach, we are beginning to realize savings in a number of categories. Now I'll review our results in more detail. 
For the third quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined by 4% to $1.9 billion, primarily due to the negative impact of currency translation. Excluding currency, organic net sales decreased 1% as declines in U.S. Simple Meals, driven by the adverse impact of retailer inventory movements on U.S. Soup sales, were probably offset by organic sales gain in our Global Baking and Snacking and international segments. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter fell 2% due to unfavorable currency translation and increased marketing spending on a constant currency basis, partly offset by improved gross margin performance. Reflecting a lower share count from our strategic share repurchase program, adjusted earnings per share of $0.62 was comparable to the prior-year quarter. For the 9-month year-to-date period ending April, reported sales were comparable to the prior year with organic sales gaining 1%, led by our performance in Global Baking and Snacking. Adjusted EBIT declined 4% as the negative impact of a lower gross margin percentage and currency translation were probably offset by volume gains and lower marketing and administrative expenses. EPS of $2.02 is down 1%. 
Decomposing our sales performance, organic sales declined by 1% while currency translation reduced sales by 3 points. Our 2 primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, both weakened against the U.S. dollar. Within organic sales, volume mix contributed 3 points to the sales decline. The decline was primarily related to our U.S. Simple Meals segment. Buyer selling prices, primarily in U.S. Simple Meals and Global Baking and Snacking, added 1 point of growth. Reduced promotional spending across our 4 largest segments contributed 1 point to sales growth. The most significant reductions were in U.S. Soup, Pepperidge Farm and Bolthouse Farms and reflects our efforts to improve price realization across the portfolio. As you'll see on the next chart, these price realization efforts, both on list price and trade promotions, are contributing to improved gross margin performance in the quarter. 
Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 70 basis points compared to the prior year. First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative margin impact of 2.4 points. For the quarter, cost inflation as a rate increased by approximately 2%. In addition, cost of products sold reflects the adverse impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input cost of our international businesses. And while we have made progress in our performance throughout the quarter, particularly in the area of freight and distributions, supply chain costs are above the prior year. Due primarily to the sales decline in U.S. Soup, we experienced 30 basis points of negative mix. In aggregate, our price realization actions have contributed 1.6 points of margin expansion with 70 basis points from higher selling prices, primarily in U.S. Simple Meals and Baking and Snacking and 90 basis points from lower promotional spending across 4 of our 5 reporting segments. Lastly, we continue to drive meaningful productivity gains in our supply chain, which contributed 180 basis points of margin improvement. 
Marketing and selling expenses decreased 2% in the quarter due to the impact of currency and lower marketing overhead expenses, partly offset by an increase in advertising and consumer promotion expenses, which increased by 8%. Increased levels of advertising in Global Baking and Snacking were partly offset by reductions in U.S. Simple Meals and U.S. Beverages. Adjusted administrative expenses were down 1% as spending reductions and the impact of currency were mostly offset by higher incentive compensation cost compared to the year-ago quarter. Across both of these expense lines, we are achieving benefits from our cost managing efforts, including our $200 million cost reduction initiatives. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS changes between our operating performance and below-the-line items. As you can see, adjusted EPS was comparable to the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, growth in adjusted EBIT contributed $0.01 of EPS growth. Net interest expense declined $2 million versus a year ago as we reduced our debt level. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 30.3%, down 40 basis points versus the prior year adjusted rate. With rounding, neither interest expense nor taxes had an EPS impact for the quarter. Under our strategic share repurchase program, we have repurchased 150 million year-to-date and this has added $0.01 to EPS in the quarter. Currency had a $0.02 negative impact on EPS in the quarter. We continue to estimate that currency will have a 2 point or $0.05 per share negative impact for the full year. 
Now turning to our segment results. In U.S. Simple Meals, sales declined 6%, driven by a 10% decline in U.S. Soup sales. While dollar consumption of soup in measured channels declined by just 1%, movements in retailer inventory levels compared to the prior year drove most of the sales decline in the quarter. The decline in soup sales reflects lower volumes, partly offset by a reduction in promotional spending and higher selling prices. Sales in other Simple Meals increased 2%, driven by Prego pasta sauce and Plum Organics. Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals declined 16%, reflecting the lower sales and a lower gross margin percentage, partly offset by lower marketing. The lower gross margin percentage includes cost inflation, which was above the company average and the impact of unfavorable product mix. 
Global Baking and Snacking had a strong quarter as 5% organic sales growth was driven by the performance in Arnott's biscuits with volume gains in Australia and Indonesia. Sales gains in Pepperidge Farm were driven by growth in Goldfish crackers and fresh bakery, partly offset by declines in sales of Pepperidge Farm frozen products. Kelsen grew also sales in the quarter. Operating earnings increased 18%, driven by gains in both Pepperidge Farm and Arnott, reflecting improved gross margin performance and sales growth. 
In the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment, organic sales decreased 1% with sales declines in both house [indiscernible] and the natural ingredients partly offset by growth in Bolthouse Farm beverages and salad dressings and North America Foodservice. Operating earnings increased 35% on lower promotional spending in Bolthouse Farm's beverages and the productivity improvement. 
U.S. Beverages sales fell 2%. Benefiting from lower marketing spending, operating earnings increased by 17%. International Simple Meals and beverages organic sales improved 6% on gains in both the Asia Pacific region and in Canada. Operating earnings were comparable to the prior year as the benefit of higher organic sales was offset by the negative impact of currency translation. For 
U.S. Soup, sales declined by 10% in the quarter with condensed down 4%, RTS down 18% and broth declining 13%. Movements in retailer inventory levels, which we believe were driven by the reduction in year-over-year promotional spending, was the primary driver of the sales decline. As I mentioned, consumer takeaway in measured channels for the comparable 13-week period ending May 3 declined 1% in dollars. Year-to-date, as shown at the bottom of the chart, soup sales declined 3% versus the prior year as the 3% decline in condensed and a 5% decline in ready-to-serve was partly offset by 2% growth in broth. Consumer takeaway in measured channels for the comparable 39-week period ending May 3 also declined 1% in dollars. We ended the quarter with retailer inventory positions below prior year levels. 
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending May 3, 2015, the category as a whole declined 1.1%. Our sales in measured channels declined 1.4% with weakness in ready-to-serve soups, notably Homestyle, partly offset by gains in broth. Our share declined just 20 basis points in the last 52 weeks and has been relatively stable for 3 years. Other branded players in aggregate had a share of 28%, also declining 20 basis points, while private label was a 13% share gained 40 basis points, reflecting recent gains in broth. 
We had strong cash flow performance in the first 9 months. Cash from operations increased by $208 million to $971 million due to lower working capital requirements, wrapping the taxes paid in 2014 on the divestiture of the European Simple Meals business and lower pension contributions. We continue to forecast that cash from operations for the full year will reach $1.1 billion. 
Capital expenditures increased to $242 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures of about $400 million for the year as we increased capacity to support growth in our faster-growing businesses. We paid dividends totaling $297 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of 31.2 cents per share. In aggregate, we repurchased 192 million of shares in the first 9 months, $150 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. Net debt declined by approximately $130 million to $3.6 billion. 
Now I'll review our 2015 guidance. As a reminder, this guidance is based off a 52-week adjusted 2014 as shown on the chart. Our guidance ranges also include an estimated negative impact of currency translation of 2 points across sales, EBIT and EPS. As we announced earlier this morning, given we just have 1 quarter remaining, we are narrowing our fiscal 2015 guidance. For sales, we expect to be closer to the low end of our minus 1% to plus 1% range. For both adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS, we now expect to be at the favorable end of the previously announced ranges of minus 7% to minus 5% for adjusted EBIT and minus 5% to minus 3% for adjusted EPS. The outlook in both adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS reflects our cost management efforts, including benefits from our previously announced $200 million cost reduction initiative as well as a reduction in expected incentive compensation cost. At the end of the second quarter, we said that incentive compensation represented a $0.06 per share headwind for 2015. Based on our current outlook, we are now forecasting that this impact will be approximately $0.04 per share, most of which will impact our fourth quarter performance. For the full year, we continue to forecast that our gross margin percentage will decline by approximately 1 point. The tax rate will be in the range of 30% to 31% and interest expense will be slightly below the prior year. That concludes my remarks, and now I'll turn it back to Jennifer for Q&A"

I want to go back and particularly to U.S. Soup, and I'm going to go back to the year 2013, where we actually increased or we were actually operating our trade at a certain rate, and we had a 14% lift in sales. In 2014, we increased that by about 3% and our sales were flat. So our analytics suggested that, that was not a good spend, and there many unproductive promotions out there that weren't doing the retailer any good or us any good. So we course corrected that in 2015 in the quarter and went back to the same rate we were spending in 2013. We were still within the ACT of 25%, which is our goal, and that strategy really hasn't changed. But that said, we continue to be much more disciplined in our analytics on every dollar that we're spending out there and the return we're getting for that, and that will continue into the future. On Arnott's and Pepperidge Farm, they definitely are different. We have been expanding the Arnott's brand beyond Australia into Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, and also in Asia, in Hong Kong. Pepperidge Farm has been expanding more into Canada, and where we are seeing the synergies is in R&D. There's a lot of sharing going on in that area. But by putting the Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kelsen brands together in one division, we expect that part of that will be a global brands team that we'll start to look at now that we have platforms in these countries, how can we expand with the brands that we have to take advantage of that scale. So more to come on that, but that's the plan."

Welcome to the third quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's fiscal 2015. With me here in New Jersey are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO; and Anna Choi, Senior Manager of Investor Relations. As usual, we've created sides to accompany our earnings presentation. You'll find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. The call's open to the media, who participate in listen-only mode. 
Today, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 2 in our presentation or to our SEC filings for a list of the factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements. 
In the third quarter, the company incurred charges associated with our recently announced initiatives to implement a new enterprise design that better aligns with our strategy, reduces cost and streamlines organizational structure. The company commenced a voluntary separation program and recorded pretax restructuring charges of $9 million related to the program for severance and benefit-related costs. The company also recorded pretax charges of $9 million in administrative expenses related to the implementation of these initiatives. The aggregate after-tax impact of the restructuring charges and implementation cost was $11 million or $0.04 per share. 
Our comparisons of fiscal 2015 with 2014 will exclude those items impacting comparability. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix. 
Before we begin our discussion of the quarter, I'd like to cordially invite our sell-side analysts and institutional investors to our Annual Investor Day at Campbell World Headquarters. RSVPs are required. Campbell's unders [ph] and all others are invited to join by webcast. This year's event will be held the afternoon of Wednesday, July 22. We plan to make it a very informative day for you, featuring presentations by Denise Morrison, Anthony DiSilvestro and our 3 divisional presidents. We'll include updates on our plans for the company, the 3 divisions and our cost-saving programs, and we'll also allow plenty of time for interacting with management.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our third quarter call. A great deal has transpired since we last spoke in February, both at Campbell's and in the marketplace, so I believe it's worthwhile to spend time on both topics today. I will share my perspective on the third quarter and then comment on the broader state of the consumer and events in the food industry since our last earnings call. I'll also provide an update on the progress we made since last quarter in our strategic enterprise redesign, which we discussed in February. 
Overall, I am pleased with our results this quarter, especially the improvement in our gross margin. While sales declined in the quarter, this was primarily due to unfavorable currency and the impact of retailer inventory movements on our U.S. soup business. Organic net sales declined by 1%. Importantly, gross margin improved as we took several actions to address the declines in the first half, and adjusted EBIT and EPS were better than expected. 
In U.S. Simple Meals, U.S. soup sales were below our expectations, declining 10%. Consumption and market share remained relatively stable. The gap between consumption and sales performance was primarily due to significant unfavorable inventory movements by retailers. Our analysis suggest that this was largely a result of our reduction in trade spending and merchandising as compared to the prior year quarter. 
Last year, promotions did not generate the anticipated lift. Therefore, reducing our spending was the right thing to do. In doing so, we expected consumption and shipments to be down with retailer inventories relatively stable. In fact, consumption was actually better than we expected, but retailer inventory declines exceeded our expectations and are now below prior year levels. Consequently, sales were below expectations. 
Within our soup portfolio, we are encouraged by the performance of our premium offerings. Slow Kettle continues to perform well, and our new Campbell organic soups achieved solid distribution gains. Soups for Easy Cooking are below expectation. Looking ahead, we will begin shipping Campbell's Fresh-Brewed Soup in K-Cups in the fourth quarter. 
In our other simple meals business, Prego continued to perform well, led by increases in white sauces and distinctive varieties. Consumption of Campbell dinner sauces remain strong and we will be adding new grilling sauces to the platform. Comp sales increased double digits in the quarter with both share and distribution gains. Plum is now the clear market share leader in organic baby food in the United States. 
Our shelf-stable U.S. Beverage   business performed within our expectations. While this business remains challenged, the early read on V8 Veggie Blends is encouraging. ACV distribution is on plan and trial is meeting our expectations. Most importantly, depth of repeat is strong. V8 Protein Bars and Shakes are performing below expectations. 
In Global Baking and Snacking, excluding currency, sales rose with solid volume gains in Australia and Indonesia. We feel very good about the progress we've made in Asia Pacific under the new leadership team in that market. In the U.S., our Pepperidge Farm business delivered sales gains in fresh bakery, cookies and crackers. Notably, Goldfish sales increased 5% in the quarter, and marketing increased across our biscuit and snacks business. I'm particularly pleased that this segment's operating earnings increased 18%. 
Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings grew slightly. In our premium fresh beverage business, we were cycling inefficient promotions from 1 year ago, which we did not repeat in the quarter. Sales were also negatively impacted by a planned SKU rationalization and the introduction of fewer new items to reduce complexity. Our decision to optimize promotional spending contributed to much stronger operating earnings for the segment. Looking ahead, our spring innovation is now in the market, including our new cold-pressed, ultra-premium beverage line, 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, and the initial read has been positive, setting the stage for better sales growth in beverages in the fourth quarter. 
Clearly, our gross margin improvement was the main reason for encouragement in the quarter. We achieved net price realization by reducing promotional spending and taking pricing action. So far, consumer response to our pricing actions has been within our expectations. We benefited from moderating inflation and other factors and delivered an adjusted gross margin increase of 70 basis points, mitigating declines in the first half of the fiscal. Our adjusted EBIT of $305 million and EPS of $0.62 were ahead of what we expected. We are improving our EBIT and EPS guidance to the favorable end of our range. Anthony will discuss our guidance in more detail in a few minutes.  
Turning now to the industry dynamics. This is a tumultuous time in the food industry. We all recognize that the consumer landscape has changed dramatically, driven by a number of seismic shifts. The great recession's impact on consumer purchasing behavior, global demographic changes, profound shifts in consumer preferences relative to food and the disruptive impact of digital technologies, all of these are contributing to mounting consumer demand for greater transparency about where and how their food is made. These shifts are converging to create a new normal for the food business. They produced a persistently challenging environment with significant volume pressure on mainstream food products, particularly center-store categories. As a consequence of this new normal, industry participants have initiated a series of strategic actions, including spin-offs, consolidation, acquisitions of small purpose-driven brands and aggressive cost-cutting measures. The broad adoption of zero-based budgeting has set a new bar for cost management in the industry, and the recent consolidation only intensifies the situation, placing even greater focus on cost management. 
Campbell is focused on creating shareholder value by strengthening our core business and expanding into faster-growing spaces. Areas of emphasis include health and well-being, particularly fresh and organic foods; and biscuits and snacks in both developed and developing markets, with a focus on Asia and Latin America. We are increasing our investment in digital marketing and connecting with consumers in line with our purpose: Real food that matters for life's moments. 
We are doing all of this while instilling an ownership mindset that will help us aggressively manage our costs. We have been paying close attention to the industry dynamics and strongly believe a strategy that focuses on driving growth, aggressively reducing costs and reinvesting a portion of the savings in the area of our business with the greatest potential is the best way to create shareholder value over the long term. 
With that as context, let me update you on our strategic enterprise redesign. Anthony DiSilvestro will update you on our major cost-reduction efforts in a few moments. 
We've begun to make changes in the structure of our enterprise to unlock the value of our assets, eliminate barriers to growth and fulfill our dual mandate to strengthen our core business and to expand in the faster-growing spaces. These changes are absolutely essential and will enable us to fully leverage all we've learned about the key trends in the consumer, customer and business environment. 
We are working hard to complete the reorganization of our business operations into 3 principal divisions: first, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, which we will map [ph] for moderate growth and higher profit; second, Global Biscuits and Snacks, which will help us leverage the scale of our combined Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kelsen businesses across developed and developing markets; and finally, our Packaged Fresh division, where we will make focused investments to accelerate our growth in the Packaged Fresh category. 
We appointed the leadership teams for both Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and the Global Biscuits and Snacks division in the third quarter. Additionally, Ed Carolan has been named to the Campbell leadership team for our new Integrated Global Services group, which will include elements of finance, information technology, marketing services, procurement and human resources. This group will be a key step in our efforts to reduce costs and elevate operational excellence through shared services and capability building across the enterprise. 
We believe our strategic enterprise redesign, inclusive of our cost-reduction efforts, will be game-changing for our company and for our culture. As we pursue our dual mandate, guided by our purpose and growth agenda, this represents the logical next step in our goal of shifting our center of gravity, accelerating our growth trajectory and maximizing value for our shareholders. 
In closing, it has been a very eventful quarter for Campbell. Amidst all the organization changes underway at the company, the team remains focused on driving our performance. It's important to remember that while our industry navigates this volatile landscape, we continue to look at our business and the operating environment with clear eyes and a clear plan to make the necessary changes at Campbell's to improve our performance. I look forward to sharing more of our strategic plans with you at our Investor Day on July 22. 
Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Anthony for a detailed discussion of our results."

Overall, we are pleased with our results for the third quarter. Organic sales were modestly below our expectations, declining slightly, which was primarily the result of movements in retailer inventory levels in the U.S. impacting our U.S. soup business. Our gross margin percentage increased in the quarter, helping to recover some of the declines we experienced in the first half. Gross margin is benefiting from reductions in trade promotion spending across the number of our businesses, list price increases we've taken in a marketplace, and a moderating level of cost inflation and improved performance relative to the first half in the area of freight and distribution. 
With 1 quarter remaining in the fiscal year, we're narrowing our guidance ranges. While sales are expected to be at the low end of the range, benefits from our cost-reduction efforts and a reduction in expected incentive compensation costs are pushing us to the favorable end of the ranges for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS. 
As we've discussed, over the next 3 years, we plan to reduce cost by at least $200 million or 2% to 3% of annual sales. Leveraging a zero-based approach, we will streamline our organization structure to eliminate excess layer and target expense reductions across a number of cost categories. 
In connection with our organization efforts in the quarter, for certain U.S.-based employees nearing retirement, we offered a voluntary employee separation program, under which most of the eligible employees who elected to participate will exit by the end of the fiscal year. Additionally, as we begin to implement a zero-based budgeting approach, we are beginning to realize savings in a number of categories. Now I'll review our results in more detail. 
For the third quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined by 4% to $1.9 billion, primarily due to the negative impact of currency translation. Excluding currency, organic net sales decreased 1% as declines in U.S. Simple Meals, driven by the adverse impact of retailer inventory movements on U.S. soup sales, were probably offset by organic sales gain in our Global Baking and Snacking and international segments. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter fell 2% due to unfavorable currency translation and increased marketing spending on a constant currency basis, partly offset by improved gross margin performance. Reflecting a lower share count from our strategic share repurchase program, adjusted earnings per share of $0.62 was comparable to the prior year quarter. For the 9-month, year-to-date period ending April, reported sales were comparable to the prior year, with organic sales gaining 1%, led by our performance in Global Baking and Snacking. Adjusted EBIT declined 4% as the negative impact of a lower gross margin percentage and currency translation were probably offset by volume gains and lower marketing and administrative expenses. EPS of $2.02 is down 1%. 
Decomposing our sales performance, organic sales declined by 1% while currency translation reduced sales by 3 points. Our 2 primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, both weakened against the U.S. dollar. Within organic sales, volume mix contributed 3 points to the sales decline. The decline was primarily related to our U.S. Simple Meals segment. Buyer selling prices, primarily in U.S. Simple Meals and Global Baking and Snacking, added 1 point of growth. Reduced promotional spending across our 4 largest segments contributed 1 point to sales growth. The most significant reductions were in U.S. soup, Pepperidge Farm and Bolthouse Farms and reflects our efforts to improve price realization across the portfolio. As you'll see on the next chart, these price realization efforts, both on list price and trade promotions, are contributing to improved gross margin performance in the quarter. 
Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 70 basis points compared to the prior year. First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative margin impact of 2.4 points. For the quarter, cost inflation as a rate increased by approximately 2%. In addition, cost of products sold reflects the adverse impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input cost of our international businesses. And while we have made progress in our performance throughout the quarter, particularly in the area of freight and distributions, supply chain costs are above the prior year. Due primarily to the sales decline in U.S. soup, we experienced 30 basis points of negative mix. In aggregate, our price realization actions have contributed 1.6 points of margin expansion, with 70 basis points from higher selling prices, primarily in U.S. Simple Meals and Baking and Snacking, and 90 basis points from lower promotional spending across 4 of our 5 reporting segments. Lastly, we continue to drive meaningful productivity gains in our supply chain, which contributed 180 basis points of margin improvement. 
Marketing and selling expenses decreased 2% in the quarter due to the impact of currency and lower marketing overhead expenses, partly offset by an increase in advertising and consumer promotion expenses, which increased by 8%. Increased levels of advertising in Global Baking and Snacking were partly offset by reductions in U.S. Simple Meals and U.S. Beverages. Adjusted administrative expenses were down 1% as spending reductions and the impact of currency were mostly offset by higher incentive compensation cost compared to the year-ago quarter. Across both of these expense line, we are achieving benefits from our cost-managing efforts, including our $200 million cost-reduction initiative. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS changes between our operating performance and below-the-line items. As you can see, adjusted EPS was comparable to the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, growth in adjusted EBIT contributed $0.01 of EPS growth. Net interest expense declined $2 million versus a year ago as we reduced our debt level. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 30.3%, down 40 basis points versus the prior year adjusted rate. With rounding, neither interest expense nor taxes had an EPS impact for the quarter. Under our strategic share repurchase program, we have repurchased 150 million year-to-date and this has added $0.01 to EPS in the quarter. Currency had a $0.02 negative impact on EPS in the quarter. We continue to estimate that currency will have a 2 point or $0.05 per share negative impact for the full year. 
Now turning to our segment results. In U.S. Simple Meals, sales declined 6%, driven by a 10% decline in U.S. soup sales. While dollar consumption of soup in measured channels declined by just 1%, movements in retailer inventory levels compared to the prior year drove most of the sales decline in the quarter. The decline in soup sales reflects lower volumes, partly offset by a reduction in promotional spending and higher selling prices. Sales in other simple meals increased 2%, driven by Prego pasta sauce and Plum Organics. Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals declined 16%, reflecting the lower sales and a lower gross margin percentage, partly offset by lower marketing. The lower gross margin percentage includes cost inflation, which was above the company average, and the impact of unfavorable product mix. 
Global Baking and Snacking had a strong quarter as 5% organic sales growth was driven by the performance in Arnott's biscuits, with volume gains in Australia and Indonesia. Sales gains in Pepperidge Farm were driven by growth in Goldfish crackers and fresh bakery, partly offset by declines in sales of Pepperidge Farm frozen products. Kelsen also grew sales in the quarter. Operating earnings increased 18%, driven by gains in both Pepperidge Farm and Arnott, reflecting improved gross margin performance and sales growth. 
In the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment, organic sales decreased 1% with sales declines in Bolthouse carrot and to natural ingredients, partly offset by growth in Bolthouse Farm beverages and salad dressings and North America Foodservice. Operating earnings increased 35% on lower promotional spending in Bolthouse Farms beverages and the productivity improvement. 
U.S. Beverage sales fell 2%. Benefiting from lower marketing spending, operating earnings increased by 17%. International Simple Meals and Beverages organic sales improved 6% on gains in both the Asia Pacific region and in Canada. Operating earnings were comparable to the prior year as the benefit of higher organic sales was offset by the negative impact of currency translation. For 
U.S. soup, sales declined by 10% in the quarter, with condensed, down 4%; RTS, down 18%; and broth declining 13%. Movements in retailer inventory levels, which we believe were driven by the reduction in year-over-year promotional spending, was the primary driver of the sales decline. As I mentioned, consumer takeaway in measured channels for the comparable 13-week period ending May 3 declined 1% in dollars. Year-to-date, as shown at the bottom of the chart, soup sales declined 3% versus the prior year as a 3% decline in condensed and a 5% decline in ready-to-serve was partly offset by 2% growth in broth. Consumer takeaway in measured channels for the comparable 39-week period ending May 3 also declined 1% in dollars. We ended the quarter with retailer inventory positions below prior year levels. 
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending May 3, 2015, the category as a whole declined 1.1%. Our sales in measured channels declined 1.4% with weakness in ready-to-serve soups, notably Homestyle, partly offset by gains in broth. Our share declined just 20 basis points in the last 52 weeks and has been relatively stable for 3 years. Other branded players in aggregate had a share of 28%, also declining 20 basis points. While private label, with a 13% share, gained 40 basis points, reflecting recent gains in broth. 
We had strong cash flow performance in the first 9 months. Cash from operations increased by $208 million to $971 million due to lower working capital requirements, wrapping the taxes paid in 2014 on the divestiture of the European simple meals business and lower pension contributions. We continue to forecast that cash from operations for the full year will reach $1.1 billion. 
Capital expenditures increased to $242 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures of about $400 million for the year as we increase capacity to support growth in our faster-growing businesses. We paid dividends totaling $297 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. In aggregate, we repurchased 192 million of shares in the first 9 months, $150 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. Net debt declined by approximately $130 million to $3.6 billion. 
Now I'll review our 2015 guidance. As a reminder, this guidance is based off a 52-week adjusted 2014 as shown on the chart. Our guidance ranges also include an estimated negative impact of currency translation of 2 points across sales, EBIT and EPS. 
As we announced earlier this morning, given we just have 1 quarter remaining, we are narrowing our fiscal 2015 guidance. For sales, we expect to be closer to the low end of our minus 1% to plus 1% range. For both adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS, we now expect to be at the favorable end of the previously announced ranges of minus 7% to minus 5% for adjusted EBIT and minus 5% to minus 3% for adjusted EPS. The outlook in both adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS reflects our cost-management efforts, including benefits from our previously announced $200 million cost-reduction initiative as well as a reduction in expected incentive compensation costs. 
At the end of the second quarter, we said that incentive compensation represented a $0.06 per share headwind for 2015. Based on our current outlook, we are now forecasting that this impact will be approximately $0.04 per share, most of which will impact our fourth quarter performance. For the full year, we continue to forecast that our gross margin percentage will decline by approximately 1 point, that rate will be in the range of 30% to 31% and the interest expense will be slightly below the prior year.  
That concludes my remarks, and now I'll turn it back to Jennifer for Q&A."

How much additional discipline do you expect to use in the soup franchise and others? 
And then just a quick one on global snacking. Denise, you've talked about global snacking for a while, but Arnott's and Pepperidge Farm, they're different brand names. The packaging is different. There's not a lot of crossover that I see, anyway, in terms of products that are similar. Is there additional kinds of synergies that you could see between the regions that they haven't been capturing yet?"

I want to go back in particularly to U.S. soup, and I'm going to go back to the year 2013, where we actually increased our -- or we were actually operating our trade at a certain rate, and we had a 14% lift in sales. In 2014, we increased that by about 3% and our sales were flat. So our analytics suggested that, that was not a good spend. And there many unproductive promotions out there that weren't doing the retailer any good or us any good. So we course-corrected that in 2015 in the quarter and went back to the same rate we were spending in 2013. We were still within the ACT of 25%, which is our goal, and that strategy really hasn't changed. But that said, we continue to be much more disciplined in our analytics on every dollar that we're spending out there and the return we're getting for that, and that will continue into the future. 
On Arnott's and Pepperidge Farm, they definitely are different. We have been expanding the Arnott's brand beyond Australia into Southeast Asia, and particularly Indonesia, and also in Asia -- in Hong Kong. Pepperidge Farm's been expanding more into Canada, and -- where we are seeing the synergies is in R&D. There's a lot of sharing going on in that area.

We're not going to comment too specifically on 2016, but we are very focused on improving our gross margin over time. And we recognize part of that program has to come from net price realization. And to me, there are 3 areas we'll be looking at: One is, we'll continue to look for opportunities to improve our list price realization. We'll continue to drive our analytics to improve the efficiency of our trade spend, whether that's removing unprofitable deals or improving the profitability of others, and we'll also look for strategic opportunities to move up our promoted price points over time. So those 3 things collectively will contribute to price realization, which will hopefully contribute to gross margin expansion."

In addition, we had our Foodservice sales force responsible for managing those distributors, we have since moved the sales effort to our retail sales force to not only motivate the distributors from a supply standpoint, but also to have end-user customer coverage to create demand. And we've also supplemented that with some broker support for store work. So we believe with this more push-pull model, we set ourselves up for better results. 
Finally, we are introducing more products in the range that distributors have to work with. In the past, they had V8 red juice. They had a couple of SKUs of Splash and a little bit of V8 V-Fusion. Today, they have that plus the V8 Veggie Blends in single-serve, V8 Energy, and we have a pipeline of new products as well. 
So we're very committed to immediate consumption. It's only 10% of our business today, and we know in a lot of beverage companies, it's 50% and very profitable. So this is worth building and being patient and doing it the right way."

Welcome to the third quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's fiscal 2015.

As usual, we've created sides to accompany our earnings presentation. You'll find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. The call's open to the media, who participate in listen-only mode. 
Today, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 2 in our presentation or to our SEC filings for a list of the factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements. 
In the third quarter, the company incurred charges associated with our recently announced initiatives to implement a new enterprise design that better aligns with our strategy, reduces cost and streamlines organizational structure. The company commenced a voluntary separation program and recorded pretax restructuring charges of $9 million related to the program for severance and benefit-related costs. The company also recorded pretax charges of $9 million in administrative expenses related to the implementation of these initiatives. The aggregate after-tax impact of the restructuring charges and implementation cost was $11 million or $0.04 per share. 
Our comparisons of fiscal 2015 with 2014 will exclude those items impacting comparability. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix. 
Before we begin our discussion of the quarter, I'd like to cordially invite our sell-side analysts and institutional investors to our Annual Investor Day at Campbell World Headquarters. RSVPs are required. Campbell's vendors and all others are invited to join by webcast. This year's event will be held the afternoon of Wednesday, July 22. We plan to make it a very informative day for you, featuring presentations by Denise Morrison, Anthony DiSilvestro and our 3 divisional presidents.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our third quarter call. A great deal has transpired since we last spoke in February, both at Campbell's and in the marketplace, so I believe it's worthwhile to spend time on both topics t",1490,"Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our third quarter call. A great deal has transpired since we last spoke in February, both at Campbell's and in the marketplace, so I believe it's worthwhile to spend time on both topics today. I will share my perspective on the third quarter and then comment on the broader state of the consumer and events in the food industry since our last earnings call. I'll also provide an update on the progress we made since last quarter in our strategic enterprise redesign, which we discussed in February. 
Overall, I am pleased with our results this quarter, especially the improvement in our gross margin. While sales declined in the quarter, this was primarily due to unfavorable currency and the impact of retailer inventory movements on our U.S. soup business. Organic net sales declined by 1%. Importantly, gross margin improved as we took several actions to address the declines in the first half, and adjusted EBIT and EPS were better than expected. 
In U.S. Simple Meals, U.S. soup sales were below our expectations, declining 10%. Consumption and market share remained relatively stable. The gap between consumption and sales performance was primarily due to significant unfavorable inventory movements by retailers. Our analysis suggest that this was largely a result of our reduction in trade spending and merchandising as compared to the prior year quarter. 
Last year, promotions did not generate the anticipated lift. Therefore, reducing our spending was the right thing to do. In doing so, we expected consumption and shipments to be down with retailer inventories relatively stable. In fact, consumption was actually better than we expected, but retailer inventory declines exceeded our expectations and are now below prior year levels. Consequently, sales were below expectations. 
Within our soup portfolio, we are encouraged by the performance of our premium offerings. Slow Kettle continues to perform well, and our new Campbell organic soups achieved solid distribution gains. Soups for Easy Cooking are below expectation. Looking ahead, we will begin shipping Campbell's Fresh-Brewed Soup in K-Cups in the fourth quarter. 
In our other simple meals business, Prego continued to perform well, led by increases in white sauces and distinctive varieties. Consumption of Campbell dinner sauces remain strong and we will be adding new grilling sauces to the platform. Plum sales increased double digits in the quarter with both share and distribution gains. Plum is now the clear market share leader in organic baby food in the United States. 
Our shelf-stable U.S. Beverage business performed within our expectations. While this business remains challenged, the early read on V8 Veggie Blends is encouraging. ACV distribution is on plan and trial is meeting our expectations. Most importantly, depth of repeat is strong. V8 Protein Bars and Shakes are performing below expectations. 
In Global Baking and Snacking, excluding currency, sales rose with solid volume gains in Australia and Indonesia. We feel very good about the progress we've made in Asia Pacific under the new leadership team in that market. In the U.S., our Pepperidge Farm business delivered sales gains in fresh bakery, cookies and crackers. Notably, Goldfish sales increased 5% in the quarter, and marketing increased across our biscuit and snacks business. I'm particularly pleased that this segment's operating earnings increased 18%. 
Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings grew slightly. In our premium fresh beverage business, we were cycling inefficient promotions from 1 year ago, which we did not repeat in the quarter. Sales were also negatively impacted by a planned SKU rationalization and the introduction of fewer new items to reduce complexity. Our decision to optimize promotional spending contributed to much stronger operating earnings for the segment. Looking ahead, our spring innovation is now in the market, including our new cold-pressed, ultra-premium beverage line, 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, and the initial read has been positive, setting the stage for better sales growth in beverages in the fourth quarter. 
Clearly, our gross margin improvement was the main reason for encouragement in the quarter. We achieved net price realization by reducing promotional spending and taking pricing action. So far, consumer response to our pricing actions has been within our expectations. We benefited from moderating inflation and other factors and delivered an adjusted gross margin increase of 70 basis points, mitigating declines in the first half of the fiscal. Our adjusted EBIT of $305 million and EPS of $0.62 were ahead of what we expected. We are improving our EBIT and EPS guidance to the favorable end of our range. Anthony will discuss our guidance in more detail in a few minutes.  
Turning now to the industry dynamics. This is a tumultuous time in the food industry. We all recognize that the consumer landscape has changed dramatically, driven by a number of seismic shifts. The great recession's impact on consumer purchasing behavior, global demographic changes, profound shifts in consumer preferences relative to food and the disruptive impact of digital technologies, all of these are contributing to mounting consumer demand for greater transparency about where and how their food is made. These shifts are converging to create a new normal for the food business. They produced a persistently challenging environment with significant volume pressure on mainstream food products, particularly center-store categories. As a consequence of this new normal, industry participants have initiated a series of strategic actions, including spin-offs, consolidation, acquisitions of small purpose-driven brands and aggressive cost-cutting measures. The broad adoption of zero-based budgeting has set a new bar for cost management in the industry, and the recent consolidation only intensifies the situation, placing even greater focus on cost management. 
Campbell is focused on creating shareholder value by strengthening our core business and expanding into faster-growing spaces. Areas of emphasis include health and well-being, particularly fresh and organic foods; and biscuits and snacks in both developed and developing markets, with a focus on Asia and Latin America. We are increasing our investment in digital marketing and connecting with consumers in line with our purpose: Real food that matters for life's moments. 
We are doing all of this while instilling an ownership mindset that will help us aggressively manage our costs. We have been paying close attention to the industry dynamics and strongly believe a strategy that focuses on driving growth, aggressively reducing costs and reinvesting a portion of the savings in the area of our business with the greatest potential is the best way to create shareholder value over the long term. 
With that as context, let me update you on our strategic enterprise redesign. Anthony DiSilvestro will update you on our major cost-reduction efforts in a few moments. 
We've begun to make changes in the structure of our enterprise to unlock the value of our assets, eliminate barriers to growth and fulfill our dual mandate to strengthen our core business and to expand in the faster-growing spaces. These changes are absolutely essential and will enable us to fully leverage all we've learned about the key trends in the consumer, customer and business environment. 
We are working hard to complete the reorganization of our business operations into 3 principal divisions: first, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, which we will map [ph] for moderate growth and higher profit; second, Global Biscuits and Snacks, which will help us leverage the scale of our combined Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kelsen businesses across developed and developing markets; and finally, our Packaged Fresh division, where we will make focused investments to accelerate our growth in the Packaged Fresh category. 
We appointed the leadership teams for both Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and the Global Biscuits and Snacks division in the third quarter. Additionally, Ed Carolan has been named to the Campbell leadership team for our new Integrated Global Services group, which will include elements of finance, information technology, marketing services, procurement and human resources. This group will be a key step in our efforts to reduce costs and elevate operational excellence through shared services and capability building across the enterprise. 
We believe our strategic enterprise redesign, inclusive of our cost-reduction efforts, will be game-changing for our company and for our culture. As we pursue our dual mandate, guided by our purpose and growth agenda, this represents the logical next step in our goal of shifting our center of gravity, accelerating our growth trajectory and maximizing value for our shareholders. 
In closing, it has been a very eventful quarter for Campbell. Amidst all the organization changes underway at the company, the team remains focused on driving our performance. It's important to remember that while our industry navigates this volatile landscape, we continue to look at our business and the operating environment with clear eyes and a clear plan to make the necessary changes at Campbell's to improve our performance. I look forward to sharing more of our strategic plans with you at our Investor Day on July 22. 
Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Anthony for a detailed discussion of our results."

Organic sales were modestly below o",2026,"Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before getting into the details, I wanted to give my perspective on our results, guidance and our cost-reduction efforts. Overall, we are pleased with our results for the third quarter. Organic sales were modestly below our expectations, declining slightly, which was primarily the result of movements in retailer inventory levels in the U.S. impacting our U.S. soup business. Our gross margin percentage increased in the quarter, helping to recover some of the declines we experienced in the first half. Gross margin is benefiting from reductions in trade promotion spending across a number of our businesses, list price increases we've taken in a marketplace, and a moderating level of cost inflation and improved performance relative to the first half in the area of freight and distribution. 
With 1 quarter remaining in the fiscal year, we're narrowing our guidance ranges. While sales are expected to be at the low end of the range, benefits from our cost-reduction efforts and a reduction in expected incentive compensation costs are pushing us to the favorable end of the ranges for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS. 
As we've discussed, over the next 3 years, we plan to reduce cost by at least $200 million or 2% to 3% of annual sales. Leveraging a zero-based approach, we will streamline our organization structure to eliminate excess layers and target expense reductions across a number of cost categories. 
In connection with our organization efforts in the quarter, for certain U.S.-based employees nearing retirement, we offered a voluntary employee separation program, under which most of the eligible employees who elected to participate will exit by the end of the fiscal year. Additionally, as we begin to implement a zero-based budgeting approach, we are beginning to realize savings in a number of categories. Now I'll review our results in more detail. 
For the third quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined by 4% to $1.9 billion, primarily due to the negative impact of currency translation. Excluding currency, organic net sales decreased 1% as declines in U.S. Simple Meals, driven by the adverse impact of retailer inventory movements on U.S. soup sales, were partly offset by organic sales gain in our Global Baking and Snacking and international segments. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter fell 2% due to unfavorable currency translation and increased marketing spending on a constant currency basis, partly offset by improved gross margin performance. Reflecting a lower share count from our strategic share repurchase program, adjusted earnings per share of $0.62 was comparable to the prior year quarter. For the 9-month, year-to-date period ending April, reported sales were comparable to the prior year, with organic sales gaining 1%, led by our performance in Global Baking and Snacking. Adjusted EBIT declined 4% as the negative impact of a lower gross margin percentage and currency translation were partly offset by volume gains and lower marketing and administrative expenses. EPS of $2.02 is down 1%. 
Decomposing our sales performance, organic sales declined by 1% while currency translation reduced sales by 3 points. Our 2 primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, both weakened against the U.S. dollar. Within organic sales, volume mix contributed 3 points to the sales decline. The decline was primarily related to our U.S. Simple Meals segment. Higher selling prices, primarily in U.S. Simple Meals and Global Baking and Snacking, added 1 point of growth. Reduced promotional spending across our 4 largest segments contributed 1 point to sales growth. The most significant reductions were in U.S. soup, Pepperidge Farm and Bolthouse Farms and reflects our efforts to improve price realization across the portfolio. As you'll see on the next chart, these price realization efforts, both on list price and trade promotions, are contributing to improved gross margin performance in the quarter. 
Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 70 basis points compared to the prior year. First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative margin impact of 2.4 points. For the quarter, cost inflation as a rate increased by approximately 2%. In addition, cost of products sold reflects the adverse impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input cost of our international businesses. And while we have made progress in our performance throughout the quarter, particularly in the area of freight and distribution, supply chain costs are above the prior year. Due primarily to the sales decline in U.S. soup, we experienced 30 basis points of negative mix. In aggregate, our price realization actions have contributed 1.6 points of margin expansion, with 70 basis points from higher selling prices, primarily in U.S. Simple Meals and Baking and Snacking, and 90 basis points from lower promotional spending across 4 of our 5 reporting segments. Lastly, we continue to drive meaningful productivity gains in our supply chain, which contributed 180 basis points of margin improvement. 
Marketing and selling expenses decreased 2% in the quarter due to the impact of currency and lower marketing overhead expenses, partly offset by an increase in advertising and consumer promotion expenses, which increased by 8%. Increased levels of advertising in Global Baking and Snacking were partly offset by reductions in U.S. Simple Meals and U.S. Beverages. Adjusted administrative expenses were down 1% as spending reductions and the impact of currency were mostly offset by higher incentive compensation cost compared to the year-ago quarter. Across both of these expense lines, we are achieving benefits from our cost-managing efforts, including our $200 million cost-reduction initiative. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS changes between our operating performance and below-the-line items. As you can see, adjusted EPS was comparable to the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, growth in adjusted EBIT contributed $0.01 of EPS growth. Net interest expense declined $2 million versus a year ago as we reduced our debt level. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 30.3%, down 40 basis points versus the prior year adjusted rate. With rounding, neither interest expense nor taxes had an EPS impact for the quarter. Under our strategic share repurchase program, we have repurchased 150 million year-to-date and this has added $0.01 to EPS in the quarter. Currency had a $0.02 negative impact on EPS in the quarter. We continue to estimate that currency will have a 2 point or $0.05 per share negative impact for the full year. 
Now turning to our segment results. In U.S. Simple Meals, sales declined 6%, driven by a 10% decline in U.S. soup sales. While dollar consumption of soup in measured channels declined by just 1%, movements in retailer inventory levels compared to the prior year drove most of the sales decline in the quarter. The decline in soup sales reflects lower volumes, partly offset by a reduction in promotional spending and higher selling prices. Sales in other simple meals increased 2%, driven by Prego pasta sauce and Plum Organics. Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals declined 16%, reflecting the lower sales and a lower gross margin percentage, partly offset by lower marketing. The lower gross margin percentage includes cost inflation, which was above the company average, and the impact of unfavorable product mix. 
Global Baking and Snacking had a strong quarter as 5% organic sales growth was driven by the performance in Arnott's biscuits, with volume gains in Australia and Indonesia. Sales gains in Pepperidge Farm were driven by growth in Goldfish crackers and fresh bakery, partly offset by declines in sales of Pepperidge Farm frozen products. Kelsen also grew sales in the quarter. Operating earnings increased 18%, driven by gains in both Pepperidge Farm and Arnott, reflecting improved gross margin performance and sales growth. 
In the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment, organic sales decreased 1% with sales declines in Bolthouse carrot and natural ingredients, partly offset by growth in Bolthouse Farm beverages and salad dressings and North America Foodservice. Operating earnings increased 35% on lower promotional spending in Bolthouse Farms beverages and the productivity improvement. 
U.S. Beverage sales fell 2%. Benefiting from lower marketing spending, operating earnings increased by 17%. International Simple Meals and Beverages organic sales improved 6% on gains in both the Asia Pacific region and in Canada. Operating earnings were comparable to the prior year as the benefit of higher organic sales was offset by the negative impact of currency translation. For 
U.S. soup, sales declined by 10% in the quarter, with condensed, down 4%; RTS, down 18%; and broth declining 13%. Movements in retailer inventory levels, which we believe were driven by the reduction in year-over-year promotional spending, was the primary driver of the sales decline. As I mentioned, consumer takeaway in measured channels for the comparable 13-week period ending May 3 declined 1% in dollars. Year-to-date, as shown at the bottom of the chart, soup sales declined 3% versus the prior year as a 3% decline in condensed and a 5% decline in ready-to-serve was partly offset by 2% growth in broth. Consumer takeaway in measured channels for the comparable 39-week period ending May 3 also declined 1% in dollars. We ended the quarter with retailer inventory positions below prior year levels. 
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending May 3, 2015, the category as a whole declined 1.1%. Our sales in measured channels declined 1.4% with weakness in ready-to-serve soups, notably Homestyle, partly offset by gains in broth. Our share declined just 20 basis points in the last 52 weeks and has been relatively stable for 3 years. Other branded players in aggregate had a share of 28%, also declining 20 basis points. While private label, with a 13% share, gained 40 basis points, reflecting recent gains in broth. 
We had strong cash flow performance in the first 9 months. Cash from operations increased by $208 million to $971 million due to lower working capital requirements, wrapping the taxes paid in 2014 on the divestiture of the European simple meals business and lower pension contributions. We continue to forecast that cash from operations for the full year will reach $1.1 billion. 
Capital expenditures increased to $242 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures of about $400 million for the year as we increase capacity to support growth in our faster-growing businesses. We paid dividends totaling $297 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. In aggregate, we repurchased 192 million of shares in the first 9 months, $150 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. Net debt declined by approximately $130 million to $3.6 billion. 
Now I'll review our 2015 guidance. As a reminder, this guidance is based off a 52-week adjusted 2014 as shown on the chart. Our guidance ranges also include an estimated negative impact of currency translation of 2 points across sales, EBIT and EPS. 
As we announced earlier this morning, given we just have 1 quarter remaining, we are narrowing our fiscal 2015 guidance. For sales, we expect to be closer to the low end of our minus 1% to plus 1% range. For both adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS, we now expect to be at the favorable end of the previously announced ranges of minus 7% to minus 5% for adjusted EBIT and minus 5% to minus 3% for adjusted EPS. The outlook in both adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS reflects our cost-management efforts, including benefits from our previously announced $200 million cost-reduction initiative as well as a reduction in expected incentive compensation costs. 
At the end of the second quarter, we said that incentive compensation represented a $0.06 per share headwind for 2015. Based on our current outlook, we are now forecasting that this impact will be approximately $0.04 per share, most of which will impact our fourth quarter performance. For the full year, we continue to forecast that our gross margin percentage will decline by approximately 1 point, the tax rate will be in the range of 30% to 31% and the interest expense will be slightly below the prior year.  
That concludes my remarks, and now I'll turn it back to Jennifer for Q&A."

And then just a quick one on global snacking. Denise, you've talked about global snacking for a while, but Arnott's and Pepperidge Farm, they're different brand names. The packaging is different. There's not a lot of crossover that I see, anyway, in terms of products that are similar. Is there additional kinds of synergies that you could see between the regions that they haven't been capturing yet?"

I want to go back in particularly to U.S. soup, and I'm going to go back to the year 2013, where we actually increased our -- or we were actually operating our trade at a certain rate, and we had a 14% lift in sales. In 2014, we increased that by about 3% and our sales were flat. So our analytics suggested that, that was not a good spend. And there many unproductive promotions out there that weren't doing the retailer any good or us any good. So we course-corrected that in 2015 in the quarter and went back to the same rate we were spending in 2013. We were still within the ACT of 25%, which is our goal, and that strategy really hasn't changed. But that said, we continue to be much more disciplined in our analytics on every dollar that we're spending out there and the return we're getting for that, and that will continue into the future. 
On Arnott's and Pepperidge Farm, they definitely are different. We have been expanding the Arnott's brand beyond Australia into Southeast Asia, and particularly Indonesia, and also in Asia -- in Hong Kong. Pepperidge Farm's been expanding more into Canada, and -- where we are seeing the synergies is in R&D. There's a lot of sharing going on in that area. But by putting the Pepperidge Farm, Arnott's and Kelsen brands together in one division, we expect that part of that will be a global brands team that will start to look at -- now that we have platforms in these countries, how can we expand with the brands that we have to take advantage of that scale. So more to come on that, but that's the plan."

Is that right? Or should that overall kind of 25% of sales start to come down as you get more efficient with your trade spending?"

I mean, as Denise mentioned, most of that gain had to do with our extension of our premium offering. And our Slow Kettle business is growing well above double digit in the marketplace, so we feel really good about the velocities we're seeing on that business. And as you know, we've just launched a line of organic soups into that premium section as well. It's still early days on the organic thing, but we feel really good about the ACV distribution and shelving we've achieved to date on that one. So we feel really good about our premium offering in soup on shelf."

But what I can tell you, that between the cost retainment efforts that we had in place before, the $200 million initiative -- and inclusive of the $200 million initiative, we probably saved somewhere around $15 million in the quarter. 
Now when we get to Analyst Day, we'll try to parse that apart. We're still going through the analysis now. Figure out, well, how much is due to the change in travel policy, for example, or consultant policy relative to the restrictions we had in place already on discretionary spending and headcount. So it gets a bit difficult to do that, and we'll try to do that for you when we get to Analyst Day. We'll try to give you an outlook, looking ahead across the 3 years, at what rate do we expect to realize the $200 million. 
On the incentive comp, just to give you kind of order of magnitude. If I take you all the way back to the beginning of the year, we said that incentive compensation would be a $0.09 headwind. Now we're saying it's a $0.04 headwind. That $0.05 is still hanging out there for next year, probably the way to think about it."

Welcome to the fourth quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's fiscal 2015. 
With me here in New Jersey are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO; and Blake, Senior Manager of Investor Relations. 
As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. 
This call is open to the media, who participate in a listen-only mode. 
Today, we will make forward looking, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to our Slide 2 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. 
Now I'd like to remind you about items impacting comparability. As we said in this morning's news release, in the fourth quarter, the company incurred charges associated with its initiatives to implement a new enterprise design that better aligns with our strategies, to reduce cost and to streamline organizational structure. 
The company recorded pretax restructuring charges of $93 million related to the program and pretax charges of $13 million in administrative expenses related to the implementation of these initiatives. 
The aggregate after-tax impact of the restructuring charges and implementation costs was $0.21 per share. 
Last year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded $21 million of pretax restructuring charges and restructuring-related costs. 
We also recorded an additional $4 million of pretax settlement charges associated with a U.S. pension plan.  The aggregate after-tax impact of these items was $0.06 per share. 
Also as a reminder, fiscal 2014 included 53 weeks, with the extra week falling in the fourth quarter. The extra week was worth an estimated $129 million in net sales, $37 million in EBIT and $0.08 in EPS. The adjusted results exclude the impact of the additional week in the prior year.  Our comparisons of the full year 2015 with 2014 will exclude previously announced items. 
Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix. 
Lastly, please mark your calendars for our planned fiscal 2016 earning dates. We plan to release first quarter earnings in November 24, which will include a new segments and pension and postretirement benefit accounting changes with the recasted prior year Q1 data. Shortly after we release our 10-Q, we will release the remaining recasted financials. The next 3 earnings dates are February 25, May 20 and September 1, 2016.

Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. 
This morning, I will offer my perspective on our performance, provide a progress report on several major strategic actions we initiated in 2015, including our redesign enterprise structure and cost-savings efforts and share my outlook in areas of focus for fiscal 2016. 
At our Investor Day in July, I described how the food industry is in a period of revolutionary change, which presents both challenges and opportunities for Campbell. The changes in the industry are being driven by several seismic shifts: New global economic realities in the U.S. and abroad; major demographic changes and the redefinition of the American family; profound changes in consumer preferences for food with a greater focus on health and well-being; and the impact of digital technologies on marketing, shopping and the growing demand for greater transparency about food. 
The convergence and acceleration of these shifts are reshaping the consumer and retailer landscape, combined with the prevailing industry dynamics of consolidation and cost cutting, these shifts are placing increased pressure on traditional vendor store categories and mainstream food companies. 
With this as a context, I'll focus my remarks this morning on our performance for fiscal 2015, review the important strategic actions we initiated during the year and highlight our key drivers for fiscal 2016. 
First, I'll briefly comment on our fourth quarter results. I'm pleased that we finished fiscal 2015 in line with our revised expectations. 
Sales in the fourth quarter reflected the top consumer operating environment with organic sales increasing 1%. 3 of our 5 segments grew organic sales in the quarter. 
More importantly, we made significant progress in our internal actions to address our supply chain issues related to shipping capacity and customer service. 
We also made substantial strides to improve our cost structure through our cost-saving initiatives and enterprise redesign. 
We reported the largest gross margin improvement in more than 6 years. Adjusted EBIT and earnings per share increased 5% in the fourth quarter. 
I was particularly pleased with the fourth quarter organic sales and earnings performance in U.S. Simple Meals as well as organic sales growth in Bolthouse and Foodservice. 
In the quarter, we also completed the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet, a fresh salsa and hummus business that will provide a platform for our further expansion in the deli section. 
Turning to our full year results. With a solid finish, we delivered sales, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS consistent with our most recent guidance. 
Organic sales increased 1%, with growth in 4 of our 5 reporting segments. Adjusted EBIT was down 2% for the year and adjusted gross margin declined 70 basis points for the year, within the range that we had expected. 
As I look at the year, I'm pleased that our management team responded to our first half cost and margin challenges in a difficult operating environment. I am particularly encouraged with the improvement in gross margin we delivered in the back half and the fact that we posted organic sales growth in 4 of our 5 reporting segments. However, we recognize that we have more work to do. 
Before Anthony provides you with a detailed review of our results, I will offer my perspective on several notable items, focusing on the full year. 
Looking at the year within U.S. Simple Meals, the performance of our Sauce business was a standout, notably, Prego and Campbell's Dinner Sauces. 
Prego had another strong year behind the success of our white sauces and overall product superiority. Sales of Campbell Dinner Sauces increased double digits for the year. 
Our strategically important Plum business drove double-digit sales growth with new products and continue distribution gains, especially in the grocery channel. 
In U.S. Soup, consumer takeaway was relatively stable, and we posted positive share performance. 
For the year, our Global Baking and Snacking performed well. Organic sales increased 3% and operating earnings were up 5%. I feel particularly good about the improvement in Australian biscuits as the team made significant progress in this important core business. 
In Southeast Asia, our Indonesia business delivered another year of double-digit growth, but sales declined in the fourth quarter as a result of worsening economic conditions in this market, which we expect to persist. 
We had another year of decline in shelf-stable U.S. Beverages, while the category remains challenged, the underlying trends of our business are beginning to show signs of improvement. 
Consumer takeaway and share increased in the fourth quarter. Modest sales declines in the V8 Red Juice were more than offset by the introduction of V8 Veggie Blends. Trial and repeat of Veggie Blends continue to meet expectations and depth of repeat remains strong. We expect our new advertising campaign to drive additional trial. 
V8 Splash, our powerhouse brand for kids, and V8 + Energy continue to perform well. In our immediate consumption channel, we're beginning to see some momentum. We feel good about the overall direction of this business, but we still face challenges, particularly with the continued decline of our V-Fusion franchise. 
In fiscal 2016, the entire category will remain under significant pressure. 
While we expect our U.S. Beverages businesses to improve, we're not planning on a return to growth. 
Let's now turn to the Bolthouse and Foodservice segments. As a reminder, Bolthouse Farms consist of The Farms and CPG businesses. Farms includes our retail fresh carrots business and our Ingredients business, mainly carrot concentrate. 
CPG consist of our super premium beverages, ultra premium beverages and refrigerated salad dressings. 
We continue to be enthusiastic about Bolthouse Farms, especially the branded CPG business. 
For the year, CPG sales increased high single digits. Gains were driven by product innovation, increased distribution for beverages and incremental shelf space at existing customers for our salad dressings. 
The initial rollout of our cold-pressed organic ultra premium beverage line, 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, is off to a good start. 
After completing the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet in June, we have begun integrating the business. Thus far, there have been no surprises, and we're pleased with the retailer response to our long-term plans. 
Fiscal 2015 was an eventful year, and we took important steps to lay the foundation for the future. 
We redesigned our enterprise structure and our 3 new divisions are now operating in line with their declared portfolio roles. 
We established our Integrated Global Services organization and move elements of finance, procurement, marketing, sales, HR and IT into this shared service group. 
It's early days, but we're off to a solid start. The focus in fiscal 2016, we'll be working smarter, creating efficiencies and reducing costs, while starting to build new enterprise capabilities within this group. 
We initiated plans for zero-based budgeting process. We are piloting ZBB in 2 cost categories in fiscal 2016 with plans to expand in the future. We believe this discipline will be a great value to Campbell going forward. 
We're off to a very good start to realizing our $250 million cost-savings target. We delivered earlier than expected savings of approximately $85 million across several categories, including headcount reductions, nonworking marketing, reduced travel expenses and spending on consultants. 
We added another growth engine with the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet to bolster our Campbell Fresh portfolio and extend our presence in the perimeter beyond produce into the deli section. 
We initiated an important project to increase consumer trust by providing greater access to information about the ingredients we use and how we make our food. This is accelerating meaningful changes to our recipes. 
For instance, overtime, we're planning to eliminate artificial colors and flavors from nearly all of our North American products. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, we plan to deliver moderate growth in what we believe will continue to be the consumer environment marked by caution. 
As we outlined at our Investor Day in July, starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we'll change our reporting segments, reflecting our 3 new divisions, each with a distinct portfolio role. 
In our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages division, we will focus on driving moderate growth, while expanding our margins. We'll deliver this by focusing on fewer, bigger initiatives that will attract new consumers, while driving additional consumption by our loyal core consumers. 
For example, our Campbell's Fresh-Brewed Soups and K-Cups will provide a new, convenient way for consumers to enjoy soup. This represents an incremental eating occasion that taps into the growing frequency of smaller meals and snacks. 
Additionally, we'll take an industry leadership role by increasing our transparency efforts. We'll provide greater access to information about more of our North American products on whatsinmyfood.com website. We also plan to do improve more of our recipes, consistent with our purpose. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, we're focused on expanding in developed and developing markets, while improving our margins. 
In the developed markets of the United States and Australia, we're concentrating on restoring improved levels of growth. 
In the U.S., we'll a disciplined focus to consumer-driven innovation, increased marketing behind our Goldfish and Milano brands and fuel growth in our fresh bakery portfolio. 
In Australia, we'll continue to improve our core shapes products and drive Tim Tam's momentum, while shifting our marketing mix towards digital. 
We'll also remain focused on faster-growing spaces, building on markets where we have a foothold such as Indonesia and China. We'll monitor and adjust to the economic conditions in both these countries throughout the year. We recognize that there may be short-term economic pressure in these markets. In the long term, we believe that it is essential to become more geographically diverse with a higher percentage of our business in faster growing, developing markets with an expanding middle class. 
In the Campbell Fresh division, we'll make focused investments to accelerate sales growth and expand into new categories. 
As we outlined at Investor Day, our priorities are: To build on the successful launch of our ultra-premium offering, 1915. The product is in 2,000 stores today, and we expect to expand at 8,000 stores during the first quarter. 
We will continue to accelerate our refrigerated salad dressings business through innovation and increased distribution. 
And finally, we will integrate the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition and our existing refrigerated soup business into the Bolthouse Farms fresh platform and significantly expand our market penetration. 
We expect our C-Fresh business to become a full force growth engine for Campbell. 
Across all of our businesses, we'll continue to actively explore external development opportunities that make both strategic and economic sense. We will also remain focused on transforming our cost structure and culture. We're off to a promising start with our cost-reduction efforts, but we must remain diligent and continue to create an ownership mindset where employees treat every dollar as if it were their own. 
In closing, I'm cautious but optimistic about fiscal 2016. I believe that the strategic imperatives we're pursuing, purpose and transparency in our core business, digital marketing and e-commerce, health and well-being and expansion in developing markets, coupled with our divisions clear portfolio roles position us well for the year ahead. We're very clear eyed about our challenges, particularly driving sustainable sales growth, but we're now better organized and better prepared to meet those challenges head-on. 
We believe that our strategy to focus on driving growth, aggressively reducing costs and reinvesting a portion of the savings in the areas of our business with the greatest growth potential is the best way to create shareholder value. I look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes. 
Now let me turn the floor over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro."
258458,275096003,863999,"Campbell Soup Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Sep 03, 2015",2015-09-03,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before reviewing our results and guidance, I wanted to give you my perspective on our performance and future outlook. We finished the year with a solid quarter. I'm very pleased with our gross margin performance in the",2355,"Thanks, Denise, and good morning. 
Before reviewing our results and guidance, I wanted to give you my perspective on our performance and future outlook. We finished the year with a solid quarter. I'm very pleased with our gross margin performance in the fourth quarter, which improved by 180 basis points, better than from our price realization and productivity efforts. 
The improved gross margin and earlier than expected cost reductions drove 5% gains in both adjusted EBIT and EPS for the quarter despite a 2-point negative impact from currency translation. 
We've made very good progress against our 3-year, $250 million cost-savings target, delivering about $85 million of savings in fiscal 2015. 
For the full year, we delivered results within our recent guidance ranges, with EPS of $2.46, at the top end of the range. 
Looking ahead to 2016, our guidance, when you exclude the impact of currency translation and the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, is within our new long-term targets. 
Now I'll review our results in more detail. For the fourth quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined 9% to $1.7 billion, primarily due to the impact of 1 less week and the negative impact of currency translation. Excluding those factors and our recent acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet, organic net sales increased 1% in the quarter as they benefited from higher selling prices. 
Adjusted EBIT increased 5% to $234 million, driven by a higher gross margin percentage, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expenses and a 2-point negative impact from currency translation. 
Adjusted EPS also increased by 5% to $0.43. 
For the full year, reported net sales declined 2% with organic sales gaining 1%, led by the strong performance of our Global Baking and Snacking segment. 
Adjusted EBIT declined 2% to $1.2 billion, reflecting a lower gross margin percentage, a 2-point negative impact from currency translation and higher incentive compensation expense, partially offset by volume gains and the benefit of our cost-savings initiative. 
The decline in gross margin, down 70 basis points, was driven by higher-than-anticipated cost inflation and the supply chain issues we experienced in the first half, partly offset by productivity and pricing gains.  EPS of $2.46 was comparable to the prior year. 
Decomposing our sales performance for the quarter. As reported sales declined 9% with organic sales increasing by 1%. Volume and mix affected 1 point, which was primarily in our Global Baking and Snacking and U.S. Beverages segments. 
Higher selling prices across 4 of our reportable segments added 1 point to the sales. Reduced promotional spending contributed 1 point to sales growth, primarily driven by the Global Baking and Snacking segment. 
Currency translation had an adverse impact of 3 points. Our 2 primary foreign currencies: The Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, both continue to weaken against the U.S. dollar. 
Our recent acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet added 1 point to sales and the impact of 1 less week subtracted 7 points. 
Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 180 basis points to 36.1%. For the quarter and moderating relative to earlier quarters, inflation increased by approximately 2%. Inflation and other factors had a negative impact on gross margin of 1.1 points.  Mix had a negative impact of 40 basis points. 
In aggregate, our price realization actions have contributed 1 point, 2 points of margin expansion, with 40 basis points from reduced promotional spending, principally trade reductions in Pepperidge Farm and 80 basis points from higher selling prices, primarily on condensed soups, Prego and In Canada. 
Lastly, we continue to drive meaningful productivity gains in our supply chain, which contributed 200 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. And overall, our operating efficiencies were above prior year levels. 
Marketing and selling expenses declined by 7% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of currency and reductions in selling expense and non [indiscernible] marketing, both benefiting from our cost management efforts, partly offset by an increase in advertising and consumer promotion expense. 
Adjusted administrative expenses increased 10%, driven by a higher incentive compensation cost compared to the prior year, in which the expense was significantly below targeted levels. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks it down our EPS change between our operating performance and below the line items. 
As you can see, adjusted EPS increased $0.02 compared with the prior year, increasing from $0.41 to $0.43 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, growth in adjusted EBIT contributed $0.04 to EPS. Net interest expense declined $3 million, about $0.01 per share, primarily due to the impact of 1 less week. 
With $200 million of share repurchases throughout the year under our strategic share repurchase program, this has reduced our share count and added $0.01 to EPS in the quarter. 
Going the other way, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 34.8%, up 80 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting a shift in the mix between U.S. and foreign earnings and negatively impacted EPS by $0.01. 
Currency had a $0.01 negative impact on EPS in the quarter, completing the bridge to $0.43. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Global Baking and Snacking, our largest sales segment in the quarter, organic sales increased 1% as growth in Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's were probably offset by a decline in Kelsen. Sales gain in Pepperidge Farm were driven by fresh bakery, Goldfish crackers and frozen products, partially offset by a decline in cookies. 
Organic growth in Arnott’s reflects gains in Australia, partly offset by a decline in Indonesia. Operating earnings declined 26%, driven by the impact of 1 less week, higher marketing and administrative expenses, principally incentive compensation, currency translation and impairment charges to minor trademarks, partly offset by gross margin expansion. 
Excluding the impact of 1 less week, currency translation and the impairment charges, operating profit increased in the quarter. 
In U.S. Simple Meals, organic sales increased 4%, while dollar consumption of soup and measured channels increased 1%, moving to the retail inventory levels contributed to sales gains in the quarter. 
As you may recall, movement in retail inventory level had a negative impact on third quarter sales, and we're experiencing the opposite effect in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with retail inventory level comparable to the prior year. 
Organic sales in other Simple Meals increased, driven by the continued strong growth of Prego pasta sauce. 
Segment sales also benefited from higher selling prices in condensed soups and Prego pasta sauce. 
Operating earnings increased 4%, reflecting organic sales growth, productivity improvements and benefits from our cost-savings initiatives, partly offset the cost inflation and the impact of 1 less week. 
In the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment, organic sales increased 4% with growth in Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings and North America Foodservice, partly offset by declines in Bolthouse Farms carrots. 
Operating earnings fell 3% on higher administrative expenses and the impact of one last week. 
U.S. beverage organic sales fell 4%, primarily due to volume losses in V8 V-Fusion. While consumer takeaway dollar sales in measured channels were positive, sales were negatively impacted by reductions in retail inventory levels and sales declines in the club channel. 
Operating earnings declined 23% due to the sales decline, including the impact of 1 less week. 
International Simple Meals and Beverages organic sales declined 5% from weakness in Canada and Australia. Operating earnings declined $10 million or 48%, primarily due to volume declines, including the impact of 1 less week and currency translation. 
This chart shows the as reported sales performance of U.S. Soup, unadjusted for the impact of 1 less week, which subtracted 7 points for the quarter and 1 point for the full year. 
For the quarter, U.S. Soup sales declined 2%, with condensed down 4%; ready-to-serve, down 3%; and raw down, up 11%. 
Excluding the impact of 1 less week, sales with condensed soups increased with gains in both eating and cooking varieties, driven by net price realization. 
Sales of ready-to-serve soup also increased, excluding the impact of 1 less week, primarily driven by the launches of our fresh fruit soup fruitiric and our line of organic soups. The double-digit sales gains in Swanson Broth was primarily led by aseptic varieties. 
For the fiscal year, as shown towards the bottom of the chart, soup sales declined 3% compared to the prior year as a 3% decline in condensed and a 5% decline in ready-to-serve were partly offset by 3% growth in broth. 
Here's the U.S. wet soup category performance and our shared results as measured by IRI. 
For the 52-week period ending August 2, 2015, the category as a whole declined 0.9%. Our sales in measure channels declined 0.7% with weakness in ready-to-serve soups, partly offset by gains in broth. Our share increased 10 basis points in the last 52 weeks and has now been relatively stable for 3 years. 
Other branded players in aggregate had a share of 28.1%, declining 30 basis points, while private label with 12.6% share gains 20 basis points. 
We had strong cash flow performance in fiscal 2015. Cash from operations increased by $283 million to almost $1.2 billion, driven by lower working capital requirement, wrapping the taxes paid in 2014 on the divestiture of the European Simple Meals business and lower pension contributions. 
Capital expenditures increased to $380 million as we increased the path in Goldfish, Bolthouse Farms beverages, broth in North America and biscuits in Indonesia. 
We pay dividends totaling $394 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. 
In aggregate, we repurchased 244 million of shares in fiscal 2015, 200 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the root purchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. 
Net debt increased by approximately $60 million to $3.8 billion as gains and cash flow are more than offset by the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. 
Now, I'll review our fiscal 2016 guidance. The company expects to grow sales by 0% to 1%, adjusted EBIT to grow by 3% to 5% and adjusted EPS to grow by 3% to 5% or $2.53 to $2.58 per share. 
This guidance includes the estimated date of impact of currency translation of 2 points across sales, EBIT and EPS. 
This guidance also includes the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, which is estimated to contribute 1 point to sales and EBIT growth. 
The acquisition is neutral at EPS, including the impact of reducing our anticipated share repurchases to repay the acquisition debt. 
Excluding the impacts from currency headwinds and acquisition, these growth rates are within our long-term growth target of 1% to 3% organic sales, 4% to 6% for adjusted EBIT and 5% to 7% for adjusted EPS. 
While we don't give quarterly guidance, I will say that we expect some sales headwinds in the first quarter given we're cycling a strong first quarter from last year and from timing related - to our promotional strategies. 
As announced this morning, we intend to adopt mark-to-market pension and retirement benefit accounting in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and recast our historical results. This change eliminates the deferral and subsequent amortization of historic actuarial gains and losses, which will be recognized as incurred. 
The periodic mark-to-market adjustments will be reflected as an item impacting comparability and therefore, excluded from adjusted results. 
We believe this accounting change will improve the transparency of our results and year-to-year comparability. The 2016 guidance do not reflect the impact of the anticipated accounting change. However, 2016 growth rates are not expected to change from the recasted 2015 base. 
As we operationalize our new division structure beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we will move from our current 5 reporting segments to 3: Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks and Campbell Fresh. 
Historical results reflecting both the new segments and change in accounting will be provided shortly after we filed our first quarter 10-Q. 
Turning to some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance. We expect inflation and cost of products sold of approximately 2% to 3%, including the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input cost of our international businesses. 
Cost inflation will be offset by gains from our ongoing productivity program, which, excluding our ZBB initiative, is targeted at 3% of cost of products sold. We expect our gross margin percentage to improve modestly as we continue to achieve net price realization and improve our supply chain performance. 
We are accruing incentive compensation below target levels in 2015 and anticipating headwind of approximately $0.04 per share in 2016. The effective tax rate is estimated to be in the range of 31% to 32% compared to the 2015 adjusted rate of 31%. 
This guidance assumes about $0.02 per share incremental contribution from share repurchases, which are expected to be a level below fiscal 2015. 
We are forecasting capital expenditures to decline by $30 million to approximately $350 million, which is more in line with our historical spending level. 
In fiscal 2015, we launched a comprehensive reorganization and a 3-year cost-reduction initiative leveraging a zero-based budgeting approach and targeting annual savings of $250 million. 
As shown on the chart, we have achieved about $85 million of savings in 2015 as we reduce headcount and realize savings across several cost categories. 
For 2016, we are targeting to increase the savings run rate to $145 million, which will put us more than halfway to our $250 million goal. 
Most of the 2016 games will come in the selling and marketing and administrative expense lines. The majority of the more complex supply chain gains will come later in the program. 
To implement the program, we estimate total program cost in the range of $250 million to $325 million. In fiscal 2015, we recognized costs totaling $124 million, which includes $22 million of implementation cost and $102 million of restructuring charges, principally severance as we implemented both a voluntary incentive separation program and headcount reductions as we streamlined our organization. 
Against this program, we estimate program cost of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2016. 
That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn it back to Ken for the Q&A."

The fourth quarter cost is fairly clean. The only thing that gave us some advantage this year relative to last year is the timing of the mark-to-market adjustment on our commodity hedges, so we had a little bit of favorability this year relative to last year. So a small portion of that 180 basis points is that and the rest is  improvement in the operating performance of the business. In terms of 2016, as I said in my remarks, we expect to see a modest improvement in our gross margin percentage. And I think the way to think about it, there's a number of positives and a number of negatives. On the positive side, our annual comps productivity program where we target 3% of cost, obviously, that's the most significant benefit. We expect to see continued benefit on net price realization, mostly from the pricing actions that we've taken in the back half of this year. We do expect to see some margin improvement from improved supply chain performance year-on-year given the challenges we had in the first half of last year. On the negative side, 3 things to mention. One is cost inflation, which we expect to be about 2% to 3%, and that includes the negative impact currency on the input cost of a number of our international businesses. It also includes some negative mix. And lastly, the cost of some quality improvements we're making in some of our -- both of our products and packaging."

We're pleased with the share and consumption of Goldfish crackers and, in particular, Milano. Although we did experience in the quarter some softness in cookies, that was pretty much as expected because we, in the biscuit business in the United States, particularly in the quarter, we did not promote as heavily as last year because the promotions were not as productive as we would have expected, so that was pretty deliberate. But we expect moderate growth in the United States on our biscuit business. In the Australian business, we're really happy with the year that we had there. That has been a pretty remarkable turnaround. We were challenged in Australia for a couple of years, and they have now posted really outstanding results. And it's been really on the fundamentals, better advertising, more innovation, more brand building, more digital. So we believe that the building blocks they put in place there are very sustainable. We had a great year in Indonesia with double-digit growth, but we did have a slow fourth quarter. All you have to do is pick up a newspaper to see what's going on in Asia these days. But we're watching that very carefully, and we believe -- look, we have a lot of runway in Indonesia to expand our distribution points, but we're going to be very responsible about that business in '16. And then the Kelsen business, this is a very small quarter for Kelsen. The sales are skewed in China, largely toward Chinese New Year. But that said, we just have some inventory overhang from Chinese New Year this year, and we're working through that right now and that hit us predominantly in the fourth quarter."

We started the year and ended the year about the same place, right, which isn't a lot of retail inventories. The issue that we saw all throughout the year was the quarterly volatility, starting with the first quarter with the timing of the holidays changed because we had 1 less week in the fiscal year and then some timing in the third quarter where we pulled back quite a bit on some of our promotional activity in soup, and that led to some reduction in retailer inventories. That corrected in the fourth quarter. And I will say, again, we ended the year at relatively low levels comparable to a year ago, and I can't think of any particular anomaly within that, Jonathan."

I think expecting that business to grow moderately at the top line and expand margins is a more balanced approach to the portfolio in terms of expecting these categories to do what they can do. And that doesn't mean that we won't have pockets of growth. For example, the Plum business resides in that category or in that division, and we expect robust growth from Plum. We also are not taking our foot off the gas on innovation, but we're being a lot more selective about the innovation we put into the marketplace because we're in a different place. And a couple of years ago, we didn't have a pipeline, and so what happened as a result, are some little ideas got out into the marketplace. Today, we have built a pipeline, and we could be more choiceful about the larger ideas where we know we're going to get on impact from. And so I think this is a much more responsible way to run this business, and we believe that we can deliver better value for our shareholders with this approach."

Welcome to the fourth quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's fiscal 2015. With me here in New Jersey are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO; and Blake MacMinn, Senior Manager, Investor Relations. 
As usual, we have created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. 
This call is open to the media, who participate in a listen-only mode. 
Today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to our Slide 2 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. 
Now I'd like to remind you about items impacting comparability. As we said in this morning's news release, in the fourth quarter, the company incurred charges associated with its initiatives to implement a new enterprise design that better aligns with our strategies, to reduce costs and to streamline organizational structure. 
The company recorded pretax restructuring charges of $93 million related to the program and pretax charges of $13 million in administrative expenses related to the implementation of these initiatives. 
The aggregate after-tax impact of the restructuring charges and implementation cost was $0.21 per share. 
Last year, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded $21 million of pretax restructuring charges and restructuring-related costs. We also recorded an additional $4 million of pretax settlement charges associated with a U.S. pension plan. The aggregate after-tax impact of these items was $0.06 per share. 
Also as a reminder, fiscal 2014 included 53 weeks with the extra week falling in the fourth quarter. The extra week was worth an estimated $129 million in net sales, $37 million in EBIT and $0.08 in EPS. The adjusted results exclude the impact of the additional week in the prior year. Our comparisons of the full year 2015 with 2014 will exclude previously announced items. 
Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix. 
Lastly, please mark your calendars for our planned fiscal 2016 earning dates. We plan to release first quarter earnings on November 24, which will include the new segments and pension and postretirement benefit accounting changes with the recasted prior year Q1 data. Shortly after we release our 10-Q, we will release the remaining recasted financials. The next 3 earnings dates are February 25, May 20 and September 1, 2016.

Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. This morning, I will offer my perspective on our performance, provide a progress report on several major strategic actions we initiated in 2015, including our redesigned enterprise structure and cost savings effort, and share my outlook in areas of focus for fiscal 2016. 
At our Investor Day in July, I described how the food industry is in a period of revolutionary change, which presents both challenges and opportunities for Campbell. The changes in the industry are being driven by several seismic shifts: new global economic realities in the U.S. and abroad; major demographic changes and the redefinition of the American family; profound changes in consumer preferences for food with greater focus on health and well-being; and the impact of digital technologies on marketing, shopping and the growing demand for greater transparency about food. 
The convergence and acceleration of these shifts are reshaping the consumer and retailer landscape. Combined with the prevailing industry dynamics of consolidation and cost cutting, these shifts are placing increased pressure on traditional vendor store categories and mainstream food companies. 
With this as context, I'll focus my remarks this morning on our performance for fiscal 2015, review the important strategic actions we initiated during the year and highlight our key drivers for fiscal 2016. 
First, I'll briefly comment on our fourth quarter results. I'm pleased that we finished fiscal 2015 in line with our revised expectations. Sales in the fourth quarter reflected the top consumer operating environment with organic sales increasing 1%. 3 of our 5 segments grew organic sales in the quarter. 
More importantly, we made significant progress in our internal actions to address our supply chain issues related to shipping capacity and customer service. We also made substantial strides to improve our cost structure through our cost savings initiatives and enterprise redesign. 
We reported the largest gross margin improvement in more than 6 years. Adjusted EBIT and earnings per share increased 5% in the fourth quarter. I was particularly pleased with the fourth quarter organic sales and earnings performance in U.S. Simple Meals as well as organic sales growth in Bolthouse and Foodservice. 
In the quarter, we also completed the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet, a fresh salsa and hummus business that will provide a platform for our further expansion in the deli section. 
Turning to our full year results. With the solid finish, we delivered sales, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS consistent with our most recent guidance. Organic sales increased 1% with growth in 4 of our 5 reporting segments. Adjusted EBIT was down 2% for the year and adjusted gross margin declined 70 basis points for the year, within the range that we had expected. 
As I look at the year, I'm pleased that our management team responded to our first half cost and margin challenges in a difficult operating environment. I am particularly encouraged with the improvement in gross margin we delivered in the back half and the fact that we posted organic sales growth in 4 of our 5 reporting segments. However, we recognize that we have more work to do. 
Before Anthony provides you with a detailed review of our results, I will offer my perspective on several notable items, focusing on the full year. 
Looking at the year within U.S. Simple Meals, the performance of our sauce business was a standout, notably Prego and Campbell's Dinner Sauces. 
Prego had another strong year behind the success of our white sauces and overall product superiority. Sales of Campbell's Dinner Sauces increased double digits for the year. 
Our strategically important Plum business drove double-digit sales growth with new products and continued distribution gains, especially in the grocery channel. 
In U.S. soup, consumer takeaway was relatively stable and we posted positive share performance. 
For the year, our Global Baking and Snacking segment performed well. Organic sales increased 3% and operating earnings were up 5%. I feel particularly good about the improvement in Australian biscuits as the team made significant progress in this important core business. 
In Southeast Asia, our Indonesia business delivered another year of double-digit growth, but sales declined in the fourth quarter as a result of worsening economic conditions in this market, which we expect to persist. 
We had another year of decline in shelf-stable U.S. Beverages. While the category remains challenged, the underlying trends of our business are beginning to show signs of improvement. Consumer takeaway and share increased in the fourth quarter. Modest sales declines in the V8 Red juice were more than offset by the introduction of V8 Veggie Blends. Trial and repeat of Veggie Blends continue to meet expectations and depth of repeat remains strong. We expect our new advertising campaign to drive additional trial. V8 Splash, our powerhouse brand for kids, and V8 + Energy continue to perform well. In our immediate consumption channel, we're beginning to see some momentum. 
We feel good about the overall direction of this business, but we still face challenges, particularly with the continued decline of our V-Fusion franchise. In fiscal 2016, the entire category will remain under significant pressure. While we expect our U.S. beverages businesses to improve, we're not planning on a return to growth. 
Let's now turn to the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment. As a reminder, Bolthouse Farms consists of the farms and CPG businesses. Farms includes our retail fresh carrots business and our ingredients business, mainly carrot concentrate. CPG consists of our super premium beverages, ultra-premium beverages and refrigerated salad dressings. 
We continue to be enthusiastic about Bolthouse Farms, especially the branded CPG business. 
For the year, CPG sales increased high single digits. Gains were driven by product innovation, increased distribution for beverages and incremental shelf space at existing customers for our salad dressings. The initial rollout of our cold-pressed organic ultra-premium beverage line, 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, is off to a good start. 
After completing the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet in June, we have begun integrating the business. Thus far, there have been no surprises, and we're pleased with the retailer response to our long-term plans. 
Fiscal 2015 was an eventful year, and we took important steps to lay the foundation for the future. We redesigned our enterprise structure and our 3 new divisions are now operating in line with their declared portfolio roles. We established our Integrated Global Services organization and moved elements of finance, procurement, marketing, sales, HR and IT into this shared service group. It's early days, but we're off to a solid start. The focus in fiscal 2016 will be working smarter, creating efficiencies and reducing costs while starting to build new enterprise capabilities within this group. 
We initiated plans for zero-based budgeting process. We're piloting ZBB in 2 cost categories in fiscal 2016 with plans to expand in the future. We believe this discipline will be of great value to Campbell going forward. 
We're off to a very good start to realizing our $250 million cost savings target. We delivered earlier-than-expected savings of approximately $85 million across several categories, including headcount reductions, nonworking marketing, reduced travel expenses and spending on consultants. 
We added another growth engine with the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet to bolster our Campbell Fresh portfolio and extend our presence in the perimeter beyond produce into the deli section. 
We initiated an important project to increase consumer trust by providing greater access to information about the ingredients we use and how we make our food. This is accelerating meaningful changes to our recipes. For instance, over time, we're planning to eliminate artificial colors and flavors from nearly all of our North American products. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, we plan to deliver moderate growth in what we believe will continue to be a consumer environment marked by caution. 
As we outlined at our Investor Day in July, starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we'll change our reporting segments, reflecting our 3 new divisions, each with a distinct portfolio role. 
In our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages division, we will focus on driving moderate growth while expanding our margins. We'll deliver this by focusing on fewer bigger initiatives that will attract new consumers while driving additional consumption by our loyal core consumers. 
For example, our Campbell's Fresh-Brewed soups in K-Cups will provide a new, convenient way for consumers to enjoy soup. This represents an incremental eating occasion that taps into the growing frequency of smaller meals and snacks. 
Additionally, we'll take an industry leadership role by increasing our transparency efforts. We'll provide greater access to information about more of our North American products on the whatsinmyfood.com website. We also plan to do improve more of our recipes, consistent with our purpose. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, we're focused on expanding in developed and developing markets while improving our margins. 
In the developed markets of the United States and Australia, we're concentrating on restoring improved levels of growth. 
In the U.S., we'll a disciplined focus to consumer-driven innovation, increased marketing behind our Goldfish and Milano brands and fuel growth in our fresh bakery portfolio. 
In Australia, we'll continue to improve our core Shapes product and drive Tim Tam's momentum while shifting our marketing mix towards digital. 
We'll also remain focused on faster-growing spaces, building on markets where we have a foothold such as Indonesia and China. We'll monitor and adjust to the economic conditions in both these countries throughout the year. We recognize that there may be short-term economic pressure in these markets. In the long term, we believe that it's essential to become more geographically diverse with a higher percentage of our business in faster-growing developing markets with an expanding middle class. 
In the Campbell Fresh division, we'll make focused investments to accelerate sales growth and expand into new categories. As we outlined at Investor Day, our priorities are: to build on the successful launch of our ultra-premium offering, 1915. The product is in 2,000 stores today, and we expect to expand to 8,000 stores during the first quarter. 
We will continue to accelerate our refrigerated salad dressing business through innovation and increased distribution. 
And finally, we will integrate the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition and our existing refrigerated soup business into the Bolthouse Farms fresh platform and significantly expand our market penetration. 
We expect our C-Fresh business to become a full force growth engine for Campbell. 
Across all of our businesses, we'll continue to actively explore external development opportunities that make both strategic and economic sense. We will also remain focused on transforming our cost structure and culture. We're off to a promising start with our cost reduction efforts, but we must remain diligent and continue to create an ownership mindset where employees treat every dollar as if it were their own. 
In closing, I'm cautious but optimistic about fiscal 2016. I believe that the strategic imperatives we're pursuing, purpose and transparency in our core business, digital marketing and e-commerce, health and well-being and expansion in developing markets, coupled with our divisions' clear portfolio roles, position us well for the year ahead. We're very clear eyed about our challenges, particularly driving sustainable sales growth, but we're now better organized and better prepared to meet those challenges head-on. We believe that our strategy to focus on driving growth, aggressively reducing cost and reinvesting a portion of the savings in the areas of our business with the greatest growth potential is the best way to create shareholder value. 
I look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro."

We finished the year with a solid quarter. I'm very pleased with our gross margin performance in the fourth quarter, which improved by 180 basis points, benefiting from our price realization and productivity effort. The improved gross margin and earlier-than-expected cost reductions drove 5% gains in both adjusted EBIT and EPS for the quarter despite a 2-point negative impact from currency translation. We've made very good progress against our 3-year, $250 million cost savings target, delivering about $85 million of savings in fiscal 2015. For the full year, we delivered results within our recent guidance ranges with EPS of $2.46, at the top end of the range. 
Looking ahead to 2016, our guidance, when you exclude the impact of currency translation and the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, is within our new long-term targets. 
Now I'll review our results in more detail. For the fourth quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined 9% to $1.7 billion primarily due to the impact of 1 less week and the negative impact of currency translation. Excluding those factors and our recent acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet, organic net sales increased 1% in the quarter as we benefited from higher selling prices. 
Adjusted EBIT increased 5% to $234 million driven by a higher gross margin percentage, partly offset by higher incentive compensation expenses and a 2-point negative impact from currency translation. 
Adjusted EPS also increased by 5% to $0.43. 
For the full year, reported net sales declined 2% with organic sales gaining 1% led by the strong performance of our Global Baking and Snacking segment. 
Adjusted EBIT declined 2% to $1.2 billion, reflecting a lower gross margin percentage, a 2-point negative impact from currency translation and higher incentive compensation expense, partly offset by volume gains and the benefit of our cost savings initiative. The decline in gross margin, down 70 basis points, was driven by higher-than-anticipated cost inflation and the supply chain issues we experienced in the first half, partly offset by productivity and pricing gains.  
EPS of $2.46 was comparable to the prior year. 
Decomposing our sales performance for the quarter, as-reported sales declined 9% with organic sales increasing by 1%. Volume and mix impacted 1 point, which was primarily in our Global Baking and Snacking and U.S. Beverages segments. 
Higher selling prices across 4 of our reportable segments added 1 point to sales. Reduced promotional spending contributed 1 point to sales growth, primarily driven by the Global Baking and Snacking segment. Currency translation had an adverse impact of 3 points. Our 2 primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, both continued to weaken against the U.S. dollar. 
Our recent acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet added 1 point to sales, and the impact of 1 less week subtracted 7 points. 
Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 180 basis points to 36.1%. For the quarter and moderating relative to earlier quarters, inflation increased by approximately 2%. Inflation and other factors had a negative impact on gross margin of 1.1 points.  Mix had a negative impact of 40 basis points. 
In aggregate, our price realization actions have contributed 1.2 points of margin expansion with 40 basis points from reduced promotional spending, principally trade reductions in Pepperidge Farm, and 80 basis points from higher selling prices, primarily on condensed soups, Prego and in Canada. 
Lastly, we continue to drive meaningful productivity gains in our supply chain, which contributed 210 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. And overall, our operating efficiencies were above prior year levels. 
Marketing and selling expenses declined by 7% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of currency and reductions in selling expense and nonworking marketing, both benefiting from our cost management efforts, partly offset by an increase in advertising and consumer promotion expense. 
Adjusted administrative expenses increased 10%, driven by a higher incentive compensation cost compared to the prior year in which the expense was significantly below targeted levels. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks it -- down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. 
As you can see, adjusted EPS increased $0.02 compared with the prior year, increasing from $0.41 to $0.43 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, growth in adjusted EBIT contributed $0.04 to EPS. Net interest expense declined $3 million, about $0.01 per share, primarily due to the impact of 1 less week. 
With $200 million of share repurchases throughout the year under our strategic share repurchase program, this has reduced our share count and added $0.01 to EPS in the quarter. 
Going the other way, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 34.8%, up 80 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting a shift in the mix between U.S. and foreign earnings and negatively impacted EPS by $0.01. 
Currency had a $0.01 negative impact on EPS in the quarter, completing the bridge to $0.43. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Global Baking and Snacking, our largest sales segment in the quarter, organic sales increased 1% as growth in Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's were partly offset by a decline in Kelsen. Sales gains in Pepperidge Farm were driven by fresh bakery, Goldfish crackers and frozen products, partly offset by a decline in cookies. Organic growth in Arnott’s reflects the gains in Australia, partly offset by a decline in Indonesia. 
Operating earnings declined 26%, driven by the impact of 1 less week, higher marketing and administrative expenses, principally incentive compensation, currency translation and impairment charges to minor trademarks, partly offset by gross margin expansion. Excluding the impact of 1 less week, currency translation and the impairment charges, operating profit increased in the quarter. 
In U.S. Simple Meals, organic sales increased 4%. While dollar consumption of soup in measured channels increased 1%, movements in retail inventory levels contributed to sales gains in the quarter. 
As you may recall, movements in retail inventory levels had a negative impact on third quarter sales, and we're experiencing the opposite effect in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with retail inventory levels comparable to the prior year. 
Organic sales in other simple meals increased, driven by the continued strong growth of Prego pasta sauce. 
Segment sales also benefited from higher selling prices in condensed soups and Prego pasta sauce. 
Operating earnings increased 4%, reflecting organic sales growth, productivity improvements and benefits from our cost savings initiatives, partly offset by cost inflation and the impact of 1 less week. 
In the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment, organic sales increased 4% with growth in Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings and North America Foodservice, partly offset by declines in Bolthouse Farms carrots. 
Operating earnings fell 3% on higher administrative expenses and the impact of 1 last week. 
U.S. beverage organic sales fell 4% primarily due to volume losses in V8 V-Fusion. While consumer takeaway dollar sales in measured channels was positive, sales were negatively impacted by reductions in retail inventory levels and sales declines in the club channel. Operating earnings declined 23% due to the sales decline, including the impact of 1 less week. 
International Simple Meals and Beverages organic sales declined 5% from weakness in Canada and Australia. Operating earnings declined $10 million or 48% primarily due to volume declines, including the impact of 1 less week, and currency translation. 
This chart shows the as-reported sales performance of U.S. soup unadjusted for the impact of 1 less week, which subtracted 7 points in the quarter and 1 point for the full year. 
For the quarter, U.S. soup sales declined 2% with condensed down 4%, ready-to-serve down 3% and raw  up 11%. Excluding the impact of one less week, sales of condensed soups increased with gains in both eating and cooking varieties driven by net price realization. 
Sales of ready-to-serve soup also increased, excluding the impact of 1 less week, primarily driven by the launches of our fresh-brewed soup for Keurig and our line of organic soups. The double-digit sales gain on Swanson broth was primarily led by aseptic varieties. 
For the fiscal year, as shown towards the bottom of the chart, soup sales declined 3% [indiscernible] to the prior year as a 3% decline in condensed and a 5% decline in ready-to-serve were partly offset by 3% growth in broth. 
Here's the U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. 
For the 52-week period ending August 2, 2015, the category as a whole declined 0.9%. Our sales in measured channels declined 0.7% with weakness in ready-to-serve soups partly offset by gains in broth. Our share increased 10 basis points in the last 52 weeks and has now been relatively stable for 3 years. 
Other branded players in aggregate had a share of 28.1%, declining 30 basis points, while private label with a 12.6% share gained 20 basis points. 
We had strong cash flow performance in fiscal 2015. Cash from operations increased by $283 million to almost $1.2 billion, driven by lower working capital requirements, wrapping the taxes paid in 2014 on the divestiture of the European Simple Meals business and lower pension contributions. 
Capital expenditures increased to $380 million as we increased capacities in Goldfish, Bolthouse Farms beverages, broth in North America and biscuits in Indonesia. 
We paid dividends totaling $394 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. 
In aggregate, we repurchased 244 million of shares in fiscal 2015, 200 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. 
Net debt increased by approximately $60 million to $3.8 billion as gains in cash flow were more than offset by the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. 
Now I'll review our fiscal 2016 guidance. The company expects to grow sales by 0 to 1%, adjusted EBIT to grow by 3% to 5% and adjusted EPS to grow by 3% to 5% or $2.53 to $2.58 per share. This guidance includes the estimated negative impact of currency translation of 2 points across sales, EBIT and EPS. 
This guidance also includes the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, which is estimated to contribute 1 point to sales and EBIT growth. 
The acquisition is neutral at EPS, including the impact of reducing our anticipated share repurchases to repay the acquisition debt. 
Excluding the impacts from currency headwinds and the acquisition, these growth rates are within our long-term growth targets of 1% to 3% organic sales, 4% to 6% for adjusted EBIT and 5% to 7% for adjusted EPS. 
While we don't give quarterly guidance, I will say that we expect some sales headwinds in the first quarter given we're cycling a strong first quarter from last year and from timing related to our promotional strategies. 
As announced this morning, we intend to adopt mark-to-market pension and postretirement benefit accounting in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and recast our historical results. This change eliminates the deferral and subsequent amortization of historic actuarial gains and losses, which will be recognized as incurred. The periodic mark-to-market adjustments will be reflected as an item impacting comparability and therefore excluded from adjusted results. We believe this accounting change will improve the transparency of our results and year-to-year comparability. 
The 2016 guidance does not reflect the impact of the anticipated accounting change. However, 2016 growth rates are not expected to change from the recasted 2015 base. 
As we operationalize our new division structure beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we will move from our current 5 reporting segments to 3: Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks and Campbell Fresh. 
Historical results reflecting both the new segments and change in accounting will be provided shortly after we file our first quarter 10-Q. 
Turning to some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance. We expect inflation and cost of products sold of approximately 2% to 3%, including the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input costs of our international businesses. 
Cost inflation will be offset by gains from our ongoing productivity program, which, excluding our ZBB initiative, is targeted at 3% of cost of products sold. 
We expect our gross margin percentage to improve modestly as we continue to achieve net price realization and improve our supply chain performance. 
We are accruing incentive compensation below target levels in 2015 and anticipate a headwind of approximately $0.04 per share in 2016. 
The effective tax rate is estimated to be in a range of 31% to 32% compared to the 2015 adjusted rate of 31%. 
This guidance assumes about a $0.02 per share incremental contribution from share repurchases, which are expected to be at levels below fiscal 2015. 
We are forecasting capital expenditures to decline by $30 million to approximately $350 million, which is more in line with our historical spending levels. 
In fiscal 2015, we launched a comprehensive reorganization and a 3-year cost reduction initiative, leveraging a zero-based budgeting approach and targeting annual savings of $250 million. As shown on the chart, we have achieved about $85 million of savings in 2015 as we reduced headcount and realized savings across several cost categories. For 2016, we are targeting to increase the savings run rate to $145 million, which will put us more than halfway to our $250 million goal. Most of the 2016 gains will come in the selling and marketing and administrative expense lines. The majority of the more complex supply chain gains will come later in the program. 
To implement the program, we estimate total program costs in the range of $250 million to $325 million. In fiscal 2015, we recognized costs totaling $124 million, which includes $22 million of implementation cost and $102 million of restructuring charges, principally severance as we implemented both a voluntary incentive separation program and headcount reductions as we streamlined our organization. Against this program, we estimate program costs of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2016. 
That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn it back to Ken for the Q&A."

The fourth quarter cost is fairly clean. The only thing that gave us some advantage this year relative to last year is the timing of the mark-to-market adjustment on our commodity hedges. So we had a little bit of favorability this year relative to last year. So a small portion of that 180 basis points is that and the rest is improvement in the operating performance of the business. In terms of 2016, as I said in my remarks, we expect to see a modest improvement in our gross margin percentage. And I think the way to think about it, there's a number of positives and a number of negatives. On the positive side, our annual COPS productivity program, where we target 3% of costs, obviously that's the most significant benefit. We expect to see continued benefit on net price realization, mostly from the pricing actions that we've taken in the back half of this year. We do expect to see some margin improvement from improved supply chain performance year-on-year given the challenges we had in the first half of last year. On the negative side, 3 things to mention. One is cost inflation, which we expect to be about 2% to 3%, and that includes the negative impact of currency on the input costs of a number of our international businesses. It also includes some negative mix. And lastly, the cost of some quality improvements we're making in some of our -- both our products and packaging."

We are pleased with the share in consumption of Goldfish crackers and, in particular, Milano. Although we did experience in the quarter some softness in cookies, that was pretty much as expected because we in the biscuit business in the United States particularly in the quarter, we did not promote as heavily as last year because the promotions were not as productive as we would have expected. So that was pretty deliberate. But we expect moderate growth in the United States on our biscuit business. In the Australian business, we're really happy with the year that we had there. That has been a pretty remarkable turnaround. We were challenged in Australia for a couple of years, and they have now posted really outstanding results. And it's been really on the fundamentals: better advertising, more innovation, more brand building, more digital. So we believe that the building blocks they've put in place there are very sustainable. We had a great year in Indonesia with double-digit growth, but we did have a slow fourth quarter. And you -- all you have to do is pick up a newspaper to see what's going on in Asia these days. But we're watching that very carefully, and we believe -- look, we have a lot of runway in Indonesia to expand our distribution points, but we're going to be very responsible about that business in '16. And then the Kelsen business, this is a very small quarter for Kelsen. The sales are skewed in China, largely toward Chinese New Year. But that said, we did have some inventory overhang from Chinese New Year this year, and we're working through that right now and that hit us predominantly in the fourth quarter."

And obviously, the category itself has been under a lot of pressure based on the consumer. And so what we've been really focused on is how do we broaden our line and better deliver on the things that consumers are looking for in vegetable juices. And we believe that vegetable juices have an advantage based on the consumer trends. We've learned a lot from Bolthouse. And actually, our V8 Veggie Blends reflect a broadening of vegetable-based beverages very -- based on consumer preferences for those particular flavor profiles, and we think that, that is really taking the business in the right direction. That said, we still have some -- a leaky bucket in our V8 V-Fusion that we're dealing with. Our V8 Splash and V8 + Energy are doing really well, and our immediate consumption has now posted the second quarter of growth. So we've got some good signs on the growth curve but more things working than not. But we still are cautious about declaring victory yet. The other thing we're working on is a mastering complexity project in our supply chain, which we believe will have a really positive impact on our profit going forward. But that is a longer-term play."

I think expecting that business to grow moderately at the top line and expand margins is a more balanced approach to the portfolio in terms of expecting these categories to do what they can do.

We also are not taking our foot off the gas on innovation, but we're being a lot more selective about the innovation we put into the marketplace because we're in a different place. And a couple of years ago, we didn't have a pipeline, and so what happened as a result are some little ideas got out into the marketplace. Today, we have built a pipeline, and we could be more choiceful about the larger ideas where we know we're going to get an impact from.

Welcome to the fourth quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's fiscal 2015. With me here in New Jersey are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO; and Blake MacMinn, Senior Manager, Investor Relations. 
As usual, we have created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. 
This call is open to the media, who participate in a listen-only mode. 
Today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to our Slide 2 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. 
Now I'd like to remind you about items impacting comparability. As we said in this morning's news release, in the fourth quarter, the company incurred charges associated with its initiatives to implement a new enterprise design that better aligns with our strategies, to reduce costs and to streamline organizational structure. 
The company recorded pretax restructuring charges of $93 million related to the program and pretax charges of $13 million in administrative expenses related to the implementation of these initiatives. 
The aggregate after-tax impact of the restructuring charges and implementation cost was $0.21 per share. 
Last year, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded $21 million of pretax restructuring charges and restructuring-related costs. We also recorded an additional $4 million of pretax settlement charges associated with a U.S. pension plan. The aggregate after-tax impact of these items was $0.06 per share. 
Also as a reminder, fiscal 2014 included 53 weeks with the extra week falling in the fourth quarter. The extra week was worth an estimated $129 million in net sales, $37 million in EBIT and $0.08 in EPS. The adjusted results exclude the impact of the additional week in the prior year. Our comparisons of the full year 2015 with 2014 will exclude previously announced items. 
Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix. 
Lastly, please mark your calendars for our planned fiscal 2016 earning dates. We plan to release first quarter earnings on November 24, which will include the new segments and pension and postretirement benefit accounting changes with the recasted prior year Q1 data. Shortly after we release our 10-Q, we will release the remaining recasted financials. The next 3 earnings dates are February 25, May 20 and September 1, 2016. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Denise."

Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. This morning, I will offer my perspective on our performance, provide a progress report on several major strategic actions we initiated in 2015, including our redesigned enterprise structure and cost savings effort, and share my outlook in areas of focus for fiscal 2016. 
At our Investor Day in July, I described how the food industry is in a period of revolutionary change, which presents both challenges and opportunities for Campbell. The changes in the industry are being driven by several seismic shifts: new global economic realities in the U.S. and abroad; major demographic changes and the redefinition of the American family; profound changes in consumer preferences for food with greater focus on health and well-being; and the impact of digital technologies on marketing, shopping and the growing demand for greater transparency about food. 
The convergence and acceleration of these shifts are reshaping the consumer and retailer landscape. Combined with the prevailing industry dynamics of consolidation and cost cutting, these shifts are placing increased pressure on traditional center store categories and mainstream food companies. 
With this as context, I'll focus my remarks this morning on our performance for fiscal 2015, review the important strategic actions we initiated during the year and highlight our key drivers for fiscal 2016. 
First, I'll briefly comment on our fourth quarter results. I'm pleased that we finished fiscal 2015 in line with our revised expectations. Sales in the fourth quarter reflected the top consumer operating environment with organic sales increasing 1%. 3 of our 5 segments grew organic sales in the quarter. 
More importantly, we made significant progress in our internal actions to address our supply chain issues related to shipping capacity and customer service. We also made substantial strides to improve our cost structure through our cost savings initiatives and enterprise redesign. 
We reported the largest gross margin improvement in more than 6 years. Adjusted EBIT and earnings per share increased 5% in the fourth quarter. I was particularly pleased with the fourth quarter organic sales and earnings performance in U.S. Simple Meals as well as organic sales growth in Bolthouse and Foodservice. 
In the quarter, we also completed the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet, a fresh salsa and hummus business that will provide a platform for our further expansion in the deli section. 
Turning to our full year results. With a solid finish, we delivered sales, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS consistent with our most recent guidance. Organic sales increased 1% with growth in 4 of our 5 reporting segments. Adjusted EBIT was down 2% for the year and adjusted gross margin declined 70 basis points for the year, within the range that we had expected. 
As I look at the year, I'm pleased that our management team responded to our first half cost and margin challenges in a difficult operating environment. I am particularly encouraged with the improvement in gross margin we delivered in the back half and the fact that we posted organic sales growth in 4 of our 5 reporting segments. However, we recognize that we have more work to do. 
Before Anthony provides you with a detailed review of our results, I will offer my perspective on several notable items, focusing on the full year. 
Looking at the year within U.S. Simple Meals, the performance of our sauce business was a standout, notably Prego and Campbell's Dinner Sauces. 
Prego had another strong year behind the success of our white sauces and overall product superiority. Sales of Campbell's Dinner Sauces increased double digits for the year. 
Our strategically important Plum business drove double-digit sales growth with new products and continued distribution gains, especially in the grocery channel. 
In U.S. soup, consumer takeaway was relatively stable and we posted positive share performance. 
For the year, our Global Baking and Snacking segment performed well. Organic sales increased 3% and operating earnings were up 5%. I feel particularly good about the improvement in Australian biscuits as the team made significant progress in this important core business. 
In Southeast Asia, our Indonesia business delivered another year of double-digit growth, but sales declined in the fourth quarter as a result of worsening economic conditions in this market, which we expect to persist. 
We had another year of decline in shelf-stable U.S. Beverages. While the category remains challenged, the underlying trends of our business are beginning to show signs of improvement. Consumer takeaway and share increased in the fourth quarter. Modest sales declines in the V8 Red juice were more than offset by the introduction of V8 Veggie Blends. Trial and repeat of Veggie Blends continue to meet expectations and depth of repeat remains strong. We expect our new advertising campaign to drive additional trial. V8 Splash, our powerhouse brand for kids, and V8 + Energy continue to perform well. In our immediate consumption channel, we're beginning to see some momentum. 
We feel good about the overall direction of this business, but we still face challenges, particularly with the continued decline of our V-Fusion franchise. In fiscal 2016, the entire category will remain under significant pressure. While we expect our U.S. beverages businesses to improve, we're not planning on a return to growth. 
Let's now turn to the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment. As a reminder, Bolthouse Farms consists of the farms and CPG businesses. Farms include our retail fresh carrots business and our ingredients business, mainly carrot concentrate. CPG consists of our super premium beverages, ultra-premium beverages and refrigerated salad dressings. 
We continue to be enthusiastic about Bolthouse Farms, especially the branded CPG business. 
For the year, CPG sales increased high single digits. Gains were driven by product innovation, increased distribution for beverages and incremental shelf space at existing customers for our salad dressings. The initial rollout of our cold-pressed organic ultra-premium beverage line, 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, is off to a good start. 
After completing the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet in June, we have begun integrating the business. Thus far, there have been no surprises, and we're pleased with the retailer response to our long-term plans. 
Fiscal 2015 was an eventful year, and we took important steps to lay the foundation for the future. We redesigned our enterprise structure and our 3 new divisions are now operating in line with their declared portfolio roles. We established our Integrated Global Services organization and moved elements of finance, procurement, marketing, sales, HR and IT into this shared service group. Its early days, but we're off to a solid start. The focus in fiscal 2016 will be working smarter, creating efficiencies and reducing costs while starting to build new enterprise capabilities within this group. 
We initiated plans for zero-based budgeting process. We're piloting ZBB in 2 cost categories in fiscal 2016 with plans to expand in the future. We believe this discipline will be of great value to Campbell going forward. 
We're off to a very good start to realizing our $250 million cost savings target. We delivered earlier-than-expected savings of approximately $85 million across several categories, including headcount reductions, nonworking marketing, reduced travel expenses and spending on consultants. 
We added another growth engine with the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet to bolster our Campbell Fresh portfolio and extend our presence in the perimeter beyond produce into the deli section. 
We initiated an important project to increase consumer trust by providing greater access to information about the ingredients we use and how we make our food. This is accelerating meaningful changes to our recipes. For instance, over time, we're planning to eliminate artificial colors and flavors from nearly all of our North American products. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, we plan to deliver moderate growth in what we believe will continue to be a consumer environment marked by caution. 
As we outlined at our Investor Day in July, starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we'll change our reporting segments, reflecting our 3 new divisions, each with a distinct portfolio role. 
In our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages division, we will focus on driving moderate growth while expanding our margins. We'll deliver this by focusing on fewer bigger initiatives that will attract new consumers while driving additional consumption by our loyal core consumers. 
For example, our Campbell's Fresh-Brewed soups in K-Cups will provide a new, convenient way for consumers to enjoy soup. This represents an incremental eating occasion that taps into the growing frequency of smaller meals and snacks. 
Additionally, we'll take an industry leadership role by increasing our transparency efforts. We'll provide greater access to information about more of our North American products on the whatsinmyfood.com website. We also plan to do improve more of our recipes, consistent with our purpose. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, we're focused on expanding in developed and developing markets while improving our margins. 
In the developed markets of the United States and Australia, we're concentrating on restoring improved levels of growth. 
In the U.S., we'll apply a disciplined focus to consumer-driven innovation, increased marketing behind our Goldfish and Milano brands and fuel growth in our fresh bakery portfolio. 
In Australia, we'll continue to improve our core Shapes product and drive Tim Tam's momentum while shifting our marketing mix towards digital. 
We'll also remain focused on faster-growing spaces, building on markets where we have a foothold such as Indonesia and China. We'll monitor and adjust to the economic conditions in both these countries throughout the year. We recognize that there may be short-term economic pressure in these markets. In the long term, we believe that it's essential to become more geographically diverse with a higher percentage of our business in faster-growing developing markets with an expanding middle class. 
In the Campbell Fresh division, we'll make focused investments to accelerate sales growth and expand into new categories. As we outlined at Investor Day, our priorities are: to build on the successful launch of our ultra-premium offering, 1915. The product is in 2,000 stores today, and we expect to expand to 8,000 stores during the first quarter. 
We will continue to accelerate our refrigerated salad dressing business through innovation and increased distribution. 
And finally, we will integrate the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition and our existing refrigerated soup business into the Bolthouse Farms fresh platform and significantly expand our market penetration. 
We expect our C-Fresh business to become a full force growth engine for Campbell. 
Across all of our businesses, we'll continue to actively explore external development opportunities that make both strategic and economic sense. We will also remain focused on transforming our cost structure and culture. We're off to a promising start with our cost reduction efforts, but we must remain diligent and continue to create an ownership mindset where employees treat every dollar as if it were their own. 
In closing, I'm cautious but optimistic about fiscal 2016. I believe that the strategic imperatives we're pursuing, purpose and transparency in our core business, digital marketing and e-commerce, health and well-being and expansion in developing markets, coupled with our divisions' clear portfolio roles, position us well for the year ahead. We're very clear eyed about our challenges, particularly driving sustainable sales growth, but we're now better organized and better prepared to meet those challenges head-on. We believe that our strategy to focus on driving growth, aggressively reducing cost and reinvesting a portion of the savings in the areas of our business with the greatest growth potential is the best way to create shareholder value. 
I look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro."

Before reviewing our results and guidance, I wanted to give you my perspective on our performance and future outlook. We finished the year with a solid quarter. I'm very pleased with our gross margin performance in the",2346,"Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before reviewing our results and guidance, I wanted to give you my perspective on our performance and future outlook. 
We finished the year with a solid quarter. I'm very pleased with our gross margin performance in the fourth quarter, which improved by 180 basis points, benefiting from our price realization and productivity effort. The improved gross margin and earlier-than-expected cost reductions drove 5% gains in both adjusted EBIT and EPS for the quarter despite a 2-point negative impact from currency translation. We've made very good progress against our 3-year, $250 million cost savings target, delivering about $85 million of savings in fiscal 2015. For the full year, we delivered results within our recent guidance ranges with EPS of $2.46, at the top end of the range. 
Looking ahead to 2016, our guidance, when you exclude the impact of currency translation and the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, is within our new long-term targets. 
Now I'll review our results in more detail. For the fourth quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined 9% to $1.7 billion primarily due to the impact of 1 less week and the negative impact of currency translation. Excluding those factors and our recent acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet, organic net sales increased 1% in the quarter as we benefited from higher selling prices. 
Adjusted EBIT increased 5% to $234 million driven by a higher gross margin percentage, partly offset by higher incentive compensation expenses and a 2-point negative impact from currency translation. 
Adjusted EPS also increased by 5% to $0.43. 
For the full year, reported net sales declined 2% with organic sales gaining 1% led by the strong performance of our Global Baking and Snacking segment. 
Adjusted EBIT declined 2% to $1.2 billion, reflecting a lower gross margin percentage, a 2-point negative impact from currency translation and higher incentive compensation expense, partly offset by volume gains and the benefit of our cost savings initiative. The decline in gross margin, down 70 basis points, was driven by higher-than-anticipated cost inflation and the supply chain issues we experienced in the first half, partly offset by productivity and pricing gains.  
EPS of $2.46 was comparable to the prior year. 
Decomposing our sales performance for the quarter, as-reported sales declined 9% with organic sales increasing by 1%. Volume and mix impacted 1 point, which was primarily in our Global Baking and Snacking and U.S. Beverages segments. 
Higher selling prices across 4 of our reportable segments added 1 point to sales. Reduced promotional spending contributed 1 point to sales growth, primarily driven by the Global Baking and Snacking segment. Currency translation had an adverse impact of 3 points. Our 2 primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, both continued to weaken against the U.S. dollar. 
Our recent acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet added 1 point to sales, and the impact of 1 less week subtracted 7 points. 
Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 180 basis points to 36.1%. For the quarter and moderating relative to earlier quarters, inflation increased by approximately 2%. Inflation and other factors had a negative impact on gross margin of 1.1 points.  Mix had a negative impact of 40 basis points. 
In aggregate, our price realization actions have contributed 1.2 points of margin expansion with 40 basis points from reduced promotional spending, principally trade reductions in Pepperidge Farm, and 80 basis points from higher selling prices, primarily on condensed soups, Prego and in Canada. 
Lastly, we continue to drive meaningful productivity gains in our supply chain, which contributed 210 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. And overall, our operating efficiencies were above prior year levels. 
Marketing and selling expenses declined by 7% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of currency and reductions in selling expense and nonworking marketing, both benefiting from our cost management efforts, partly offset by an increase in advertising and consumer promotion expense. 
Adjusted administrative expenses increased 10%, driven by a higher incentive compensation cost compared to the prior year in which the expense was significantly below targeted levels. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks it -- down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. 
As you can see, adjusted EPS increased $0.02 compared with the prior year, increasing from $0.41 to $0.43 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, growth in adjusted EBIT contributed $0.04 to EPS. Net interest expense declined $3 million, about $0.01 per share, primarily due to the impact of 1 less week. 
With $200 million of share repurchases throughout the year under our strategic share repurchase program, this has reduced our share count and added $0.01 to EPS in the quarter. 
Going the other way, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 34.8%, up 80 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting a shift in the mix between U.S. and foreign earnings and negatively impacted EPS by $0.01. 
Currency had a $0.01 negative impact on EPS in the quarter, completing the bridge to $0.43. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Global Baking and Snacking, our largest sales segment in the quarter, organic sales increased 1% as growth in Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's were partly offset by a decline in Kelsen. Sales gains in Pepperidge Farm were driven by fresh bakery, Goldfish crackers and frozen products, partly offset by a decline in cookies. Organic growth in Arnott’s reflected gains in Australia, partly offset by a decline in Indonesia. 
Operating earnings declined 26%, driven by the impact of 1 less week, higher marketing and administrative expenses, principally incentive compensation, currency translation and impairment charges to minor trademarks, partly offset by gross margin expansion. Excluding the impact of 1 less week, currency translation and the impairment charges, operating profit increased in the quarter. 
In U.S. Simple Meals, organic sales increased 4%. While dollar consumption of soup in measured channels increased 1%, movements in retail inventory levels contributed to sales gains in the quarter. 
As you may recall, movements in retail inventory levels had a negative impact on third quarter sales, and we're experiencing the opposite effect in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with retail inventory levels comparable to the prior year. 
Organic sales in other simple meals increased, driven by the continued strong growth of Prego pasta sauce. 
Segment sales also benefited from higher selling prices in condensed soups and Prego pasta sauce. 
Operating earnings increased 4%, reflecting organic sales growth, productivity improvements and benefits from our cost savings initiatives, partly offset by cost inflation and the impact of 1 less week. 
In the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment, organic sales increased 4% with growth in Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings and North America Foodservice, partly offset by declines in Bolthouse Farms carrots. 
Operating earnings fell 3% on higher administrative expenses and the impact of 1 less week. 
U.S. beverage organic sales fell 4% primarily due to volume losses in V8 V-Fusion. While consumer takeaway dollar sales in measured channels was positive, sales were negatively impacted by reductions in retail inventory levels and sales declines in the club channel. Operating earnings declined 23% due to the sales decline, including the impact of 1 less week. 
International Simple Meals and Beverages organic sales declined 5% from weakness in Canada and Australia. Operating earnings declined $10 million or 48% primarily due to volume declines, including the impact of 1 less week, and currency translation. 
This chart shows the as-reported sales performance of U.S. soup unadjusted for the impact of 1 less week, which subtracted 7 points in the quarter and 1 point for the full year. 
For the quarter, U.S. soup sales declined 2% with condensed down 4%, ready-to-serve down 3% and raw  up 11%. Excluding the impact of one less week, sales of condensed soups increased with gains in both eating and cooking varieties driven by net price realization. 
Sales of ready-to-serve soup also increased, excluding the impact of 1 less week, primarily driven by the launches of our fresh-brewed soup for Keurig and our line of organic soups. The double-digit sales gain on Swanson broth was primarily led by aseptic varieties. 
For the fiscal year, as shown towards the bottom of the chart, soup sales declined 3% versus the prior year as a 3% decline in condensed and a 5% decline in ready-to-serve were partly offset by 3% growth in broth. 
Here's the U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. 
For the 52-week period ending August 2, 2015, the category as a whole declined 0.9%. Our sales in measured channels declined 0.7% with weakness in ready-to-serve soups partly offset by gains in broth. Our share increased 10 basis points in the last 52 weeks and has now been relatively stable for 3 years. 
Other branded players in aggregate had a share of 28.1%, declining 30 basis points, while private label with a 12.6% share gained 20 basis points. 
We had strong cash flow performance in fiscal 2015. Cash from operations increased by $283 million to almost $1.2 billion, driven by lower working capital requirements, wrapping the taxes paid in 2014 on the divestiture of the European Simple Meals business and lower pension contributions. 
Capital expenditures increased to $380 million as we increased capacities in Goldfish, Bolthouse Farms beverages, broth in North America and biscuits in Indonesia. 
We paid dividends totaling $394 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. 
In aggregate, we repurchased 244 million of shares in fiscal 2015, 200 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. 
Net debt increased by approximately $60 million to $3.8 billion as gains in cash flow were more than offset by the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. 
Now I'll review our fiscal 2016 guidance. The company expects to grow sales by 0 to 1%, adjusted EBIT to grow by 3% to 5% and adjusted EPS to grow by 3% to 5% or $2.53 to $2.58 per share. This guidance includes the estimated negative impact of currency translation of 2 points across sales, EBIT and EPS. 
This guidance also includes the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, which is estimated to contribute 1 point to sales and EBIT growth. 
The acquisition is neutral at EPS, including the impact of reducing our anticipated share repurchases to repay the acquisition debt. 
Excluding the impacts from currency headwinds and the acquisition, these growth rates are within our long-term growth targets of 1% to 3% organic sales, 4% to 6% for adjusted EBIT and 5% to 7% for adjusted EPS. 
While we don't give quarterly guidance, I will say that we expect some sales headwinds in the first quarter given we're cycling a strong first quarter from last year and from timing related to our promotional strategies. 
As announced this morning, we intend to adopt mark-to-market pension and postretirement benefit accounting in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and recast our historical results. This change eliminates the deferral and subsequent amortization of historic actuarial gains and losses, which will be recognized as incurred. The periodic mark-to-market adjustments will be reflected as an item impacting comparability and therefore excluded from adjusted results. We believe this accounting change will improve the transparency of our results and year-to-year comparability. 
The 2016 guidance does not reflect the impact of the anticipated accounting change. However, 2016 growth rates are not expected to change from the recasted 2015 base. 
As we operationalize our new division structure beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we will move from our current 5 reporting segments to 3: Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks and Campbell Fresh. 
Historical results reflecting both the new segments and change in accounting will be provided shortly after we file our first quarter 10-Q. 
Turning to some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance. We expect inflation and cost of products sold of approximately 2% to 3%, including the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input costs of our international businesses. 
Cost inflation will be offset by gains from our ongoing productivity program, which, excluding our ZBB initiative, is targeted at 3% of cost of products sold. 
We expect our gross margin percentage to improve modestly as we continue to achieve net price realization and improve our supply chain performance. 
We are accruing incentive compensation below target levels in 2015 and anticipate a headwind of approximately $0.04 per share in 2016. 
The effective tax rate is estimated to be in a range of 31% to 32% compared to the 2015 adjusted rate of 31%. 
This guidance assumes about a $0.02 per share incremental contribution from share repurchases, which are expected to be at levels below fiscal 2015. 
We are forecasting capital expenditures to decline by $30 million to approximately $350 million, which is more in line with our historical spending levels. 
In fiscal 2015, we launched a comprehensive reorganization and a 3-year cost reduction initiative, leveraging a zero-based budgeting approach and targeting annual savings of $250 million. As shown on the chart, we have achieved about $85 million of savings in 2015 as we reduced headcount and realized savings across several cost categories. For 2016, we are targeting to increase the savings run rate to $145 million, which would put us more than halfway to our $250 million goal. Most of the 2016 gains will come in the selling and marketing and administrative expense lines. The majority of the more complex supply chain gains will come later in the program. 
To implement the program, we estimate total program costs in the range of $250 million to $325 million. In fiscal 2015, we recognized costs totaling $124 million, which includes $22 million of implementation cost and $102 million of restructuring charges, principally severance as we implemented both a voluntary incentive separation program and headcount reductions as we streamlined our organization. Against this program, we estimate program costs of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2016. 
That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn it back to Ken for the Q&A."

The fourth quarter comp is fairly clean. The only thing that gave us some advantage this year relative to last year is the timing of the mark-to-market adjustment on our commodity hedges. So we had a little bit of favorability this year relative to last year. So a small portion of that 180 basis points is that and the rest is improvement in the operating performance of the business. In terms of 2016, as I said in my remarks, we expect to see a modest improvement in our gross margin percentage. And I think the way to think about it, there's a number of positives and a number of negatives. On the positive side, our annual COPS productivity program, where we target 3% of costs, obviously that's the most significant benefit. We expect to see continued benefit on net price realization, mostly from the pricing actions that we've taken in the back half of this year. We do expect to see some margin improvement from improved supply chain performance year-on-year given the challenges we had in the first half of last year. On the negative side, 3 things to mention. One is cost inflation, which we expect to be about 2% to 3%, and that includes the negative impact of currency on the input costs of a number of our international businesses. It also includes some negative mix. And lastly, the cost of some quality improvements we're making in some of our -- both our products and packaging."

We are pleased with the share in consumption of Goldfish crackers and, in particular, Milano. Although we did experience in the quarter some softness in cookies, that was pretty much as expected because we in the biscuit business in the United States particularly in the quarter, we did not promote as heavily as last year because the promotions were not as productive as we would have expected. So that was pretty deliberate. But we expect moderate growth in the United States on our biscuit business. In the Australian business, we're really happy with the year that we had there. That has been a pretty remarkable turnaround. We were challenged in Australia for a couple of years, and they have now posted really outstanding results. And it's been really on the fundamentals: better advertising, more innovation, more brand building, more digital. So we believe that the building blocks they've put in place there are very sustainable. We had a great year in Indonesia with double-digit growth, but we did have a slow fourth quarter. And you -- all you have to do is pick up a newspaper to see what's going on in Asia these days. But we're watching that very carefully, and we believe -- look, we have a lot of runway in Indonesia to expand our distribution points, but we're going to be very responsible about that business in '16. And then the Kelsen business, this is a very small quarter for Kelsen. The sales are skewed in China, largely toward Chinese New Year. But that said, we did have some inventory overhang from Chinese New Year this year, and we're working through that right now and that hit us predominantly in the fourth quarter."

Welcome to the fourth quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's fiscal 2015. With me here in New Jersey are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO; and Blake MacMinn, Senior Manager, Investor Relations. 
As usual, we have created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. 
This call is open to the media, who participate in a listen-only mode. 
Today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to our Slide 2 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. 
Now I'd like to remind you about items impacting comparability. As we said in this morning's news release, in the fourth quarter, the company incurred charges associated with its initiatives to implement a new enterprise design that better aligns with our strategies, to reduce costs and to streamline organizational structure. 
The company recorded pretax restructuring charges of $93 million related to the program and pretax charges of $13 million in administrative expenses related to the implementation of these initiatives. 
The aggregate after-tax impact of the restructuring charges and implementation cost was $0.21 per share. 
Last year, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded $21 million of pretax restructuring charges and restructuring-related costs. We also recorded an additional $4 million of pretax settlement charges associated with a U.S. pension plan. The aggregate after-tax impact of these items was $0.06 per share. 
Also as a reminder, fiscal 2014 included 53 weeks with the extra week falling in the fourth quarter. The extra week was worth an estimated $129 million in net sales, $37 million in EBIT and $0.08 in EPS. The adjusted results exclude the impact of the additional week in the prior year. Our comparisons of the full year 2015 with 2014 will exclude previously announced items. 
Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix. 
Lastly, please mark your calendars for our planned fiscal 2016 earnings dates. We plan to release first quarter earnings on November 24, which will include the new segments and pension and postretirement benefit accounting changes with the recasted prior year Q1 data. Shortly after we release our 10-Q, we will release the remaining recasted financials. The next 3 earnings dates are February 25, May 20 and September 1, 2016. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Denise."

Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. This morning, I will offer my perspective on our performance, provide a progress report on several major strategic actions we initiated in 2015, including our redesigned enterprise structure and cost savings effort, and share my outlook and areas of focus for fiscal 2016. 
At our Investor Day in July, I described how the food industry is in a period of revolutionary change, which presents both challenges and opportunities for Campbell. The changes in the industry are being driven by several seismic shifts: new global economic realities in the U.S. and abroad; major demographic changes and the redefinition of the American family; profound changes in consumer preferences for food with greater focus on health and well-being; and the impact of digital technologies on marketing, shopping and the growing demand for greater transparency about food. 
The convergence and acceleration of these shifts are reshaping the consumer and retailer landscape. Combined with the prevailing industry dynamics of consolidation and cost cutting, these shifts are placing increased pressure on traditional center store categories and mainstream food companies. 
With this as context, I'll focus my remarks this morning on our performance for fiscal 2015, review the important strategic actions we initiated during the year and highlight our key drivers for fiscal 2016. 
First, I'll briefly comment on our fourth quarter results. I'm pleased that we finished fiscal 2015 in line with our revised expectations. Sales in the fourth quarter reflected the tough consumer operating environment with organic sales increasing 1%. 3 of our 5 segments grew organic sales in the quarter. 
More importantly, we made significant progress in our internal actions to address our supply chain issues related to shipping capacity and customer service. We also made substantial strides to improve our cost structure through our cost savings initiatives and enterprise redesign. 
We reported the largest gross margin improvement in more than 6 years. Adjusted EBIT and earnings per share increased 5% in the fourth quarter. I was particularly pleased with the fourth quarter organic sales and earnings performance in U.S. Simple Meals as well as organic sales growth in Bolthouse and Foodservice. 
In the quarter, we also completed the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet, a fresh salsa and hummus business that will provide a platform for our further expansion in the deli section. 
Turning to our full year results. With a solid finish, we delivered sales, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS consistent with our most recent guidance. Organic sales increased 1% with growth in 4 of our 5 reporting segments. Adjusted EBIT was down 2% for the year and adjusted gross margin declined 70 basis points for the year, within the range that we had expected. 
As I look at the year, I'm pleased that our management team responded to our first half cost and margin challenges in a difficult operating environment. I am particularly encouraged with the improvement in gross margin we delivered in the back half and the fact that we posted organic sales growth in 4 of our 5 reporting segments. However, we recognize that we have more work to do. 
Before Anthony provides you with a detailed review of our results, I will offer my perspective on several notable items, focusing on the full year. 
Looking at the year within U.S. Simple Meals, the performance of our sauce business was a standout, notably Prego and Campbell's Dinner Sauces. 
Prego had another strong year behind the success of our white sauces and overall product superiority. Sales of Campbell's Dinner Sauces increased double digits for the year. 
Our strategically important Plum business drove double-digit sales growth with new products and continued distribution gains, especially in the grocery channel. 
In U.S. soup, consumer takeaway was relatively stable and we posted positive share performance. 
For the year, our Global Baking and Snacking segment performed well. Organic sales increased 3% and operating earnings were up 5%. I feel particularly good about the improvement in Australian biscuits as the team made significant progress in this important core business. 
In Southeast Asia, our Indonesia business delivered another year of double-digit growth, but sales declined in the fourth quarter as a result of worsening economic conditions in this market, which we expect to persist. 
We had another year of decline in shelf-stable U.S. Beverages. While the category remains challenged, the underlining trends of our business are beginning to show signs of improvement. Consumer takeaway and share increased in the fourth quarter. Modest sales declines in the V8 Red juice were more than offset by the introduction of V8 Veggie Blends. Trial and repeat of Veggie Blends continue to meet expectations and depth of repeat remains strong. We expect our new advertising campaign to drive additional trial. V8 Splash, our powerhouse brand for kids, and V8 + Energy continue to perform well. In our immediate consumption channel, we're beginning to see some momentum. 
We feel good about the overall direction of this business, but we still face challenges, particularly with the continued decline of our V-Fusion franchise. In fiscal 2016, the entire category will remain under significant pressure. While we expect our U.S. beverages businesses to improve, we're not planning on a return to growth. 
Let's now turn to the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment. As a reminder, Bolthouse Farms consists of the farms and CPG businesses. Farms include our retail fresh carrots business and our ingredients business, mainly carrot concentrate. CPG consists of our super premium beverages, ultra-premium beverages and refrigerated salad dressings. 
We continue to be enthusiastic about Bolthouse Farms, especially the branded CPG business. 
For the year, CPG sales increased high single digits. Gains were driven by product innovation, increased distribution for beverages and incremental shelf space at existing customers for our salad dressings. The initial rollout of our cold-pressed organic ultra-premium beverage line, 1915 by Bolthouse Farms, is off to a good start. 
After completing the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet in June, we have begun integrating the business. Thus far, there have been no surprises, and we're pleased with the retailer response to our long-term plans. 
Fiscal 2015 was an eventful year, and we took important steps to lay the foundation for the future. We redesigned our enterprise structure and our 3 new divisions are now operating in line with their declared portfolio roles. We established our Integrated Global Services organization and moved elements of finance, procurement, marketing, sales, HR and IT into this shared service group. It's early days, but we're off to a solid start. The focus in fiscal 2016 will be working smarter, creating efficiencies and reducing costs while starting to build new enterprise capabilities within this group. 
We initiated plans for zero-based budgeting process. We're piloting ZBB in 2 cost categories in fiscal 2016 with plans to expand in the future. We believe this discipline will be of great value to Campbell going forward. 
We're off to a very good start to realizing our $250 million cost savings target. We delivered earlier-than-expected savings of approximately $85 million across several categories, including headcount reductions, nonworking marketing, reduced travel expenses and spending on consultants. 
We added another growth engine with the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet to bolster our Campbell Fresh portfolio and extend our presence in the perimeter beyond produce into the deli section. 
We initiated an important project to increase consumer trust by providing greater access to information about the ingredients we use and how we make our food. This is accelerating meaningful changes to our recipes. For instance, over time, we're planning to eliminate artificial colors and flavors from nearly all of our North American products. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, we plan to deliver moderate growth in what we believe will continue to be a consumer environment marked by caution. 
As we outlined at our Investor Day in July, starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we'll change our reporting segments, reflecting our 3 new divisions, each with a distinct portfolio role. 
In our Americas Simple Meals and Beverages division, we will focus on driving moderate growth while expanding our margins. We'll deliver this by focusing on fewer bigger initiatives that will attract new consumers while driving additional consumption by our loyal core consumers. 
For example, our Campbell's Fresh-Brewed soups in K-Cups will provide a new, convenient way for consumers to enjoy soup. This represents an incremental eating occasion that taps into the growing frequency of smaller meals and snacks. 
Additionally, we'll take an industry leadership role by increasing our transparency efforts. We'll provide greater access to information about more of our North American products on the whatsinmyfood.com website. We also plan to do improve more of our recipes, consistent with our purpose. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, we're focused on expanding in developed and developing markets while improving our margins. 
In the developed markets of the United States and Australia, we're concentrating on restoring improved levels of growth. 
In the U.S., we'll apply a disciplined focus to consumer-driven innovation, increased marketing behind our Goldfish and Milano brands and fuel growth in our fresh bakery portfolio. 
In Australia, we'll continue to improve our core Shapes product and drive Tim Tam's momentum while shifting our marketing mix towards digital. 
We'll also remain focused on faster-growing spaces, building on markets where we have a foothold such as Indonesia and China. We'll monitor and adjust to the economic conditions in both these countries throughout the year. We recognize that there may be short-term economic pressure in these markets. In the long term, we believe that it's essential to become more geographically diverse with a higher percentage of our business in faster-growing developing markets with an expanding middle class. 
In the Campbell Fresh division, we'll make focused investments to accelerate sales growth and expand into new categories. As we outlined at Investor Day, our priorities are: to build on the successful launch of our ultra-premium offering, 1915. The product is in 2,000 stores today, and we expect to expand to 8,000 stores during the first quarter. 
We will continue to accelerate our refrigerated salad dressing business through innovation and increased distribution. 
And finally, we will integrate the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition and our existing refrigerated soup business into the Bolthouse Farms fresh platform and significantly expand our market penetration. 
We expect our C-Fresh business to become a full force growth engine for Campbell. 
Across all of our businesses, we'll continue to actively explore external development opportunities that make both strategic and economic sense. We will also remain focused on transforming our cost structure and culture. We're off to a promising start with our cost reduction efforts, but we must remain diligent and continue to create an ownership mindset where employees treat every dollar as if it were their own. 
In closing, I'm cautious but optimistic about fiscal 2016. I believe that the strategic imperatives we're pursuing, purpose and transparency in our core business, digital marketing and e-commerce, health and well-being and expansion in developing markets, coupled with our divisions' clear portfolio roles, position us well for the year ahead. We're very clear eyed about our challenges, particularly driving sustainable sales growth, but we're now better organized and better prepared to meet those challenges head-on. We believe that our strategy to focus on driving growth, aggressively reducing cost and reinvesting a portion of the savings in the areas of our business with the greatest growth potential is the best way to create shareholder value. 
I look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro."
258458,275096003,873963,"Campbell Soup Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Sep 03, 2015",2015-09-03,"Earnings Calls","The Campbell's Company","Executives","Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before reviewing our results and guidance, I wanted to give you my perspective on our performance and future outlook. We finished the year with a solid quarter. I'm very pleased with our gross margin performance in the",2346,"Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before reviewing our results and guidance, I wanted to give you my perspective on our performance and future outlook. 
We finished the year with a solid quarter. I'm very pleased with our gross margin performance in the fourth quarter, which improved by 180 basis points, benefiting from our price realization and productivity effort. The improved gross margin and earlier-than-expected cost reductions drove 5% gains in both adjusted EBIT and EPS for the quarter despite a 2-point negative impact from currency translation. We've made very good progress against our 3-year, $250 million cost savings target, delivering about $85 million of savings in fiscal 2015. For the full year, we delivered results within our recent guidance ranges with EPS of $2.46, at the top end of the range. 
Looking ahead to 2016, our guidance, when you exclude the impact of currency translation and the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, is within our new long-term targets. 
Now I'll review our results in more detail. For the fourth quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined 9% to $1.7 billion primarily due to the impact of 1 less week and the negative impact of currency translation. Excluding those factors and our recent acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet, organic net sales increased 1% in the quarter as we benefited from higher selling prices. 
Adjusted EBIT increased 5% to $234 million driven by a higher gross margin percentage, partly offset by higher incentive compensation expenses and a 2-point negative impact from currency translation. 
Adjusted EPS also increased by 5% to $0.43. 
For the full year, reported net sales declined 2% with organic sales gaining 1% led by the strong performance of our Global Baking and Snacking segment. 
Adjusted EBIT declined 2% to $1.2 billion, reflecting a lower gross margin percentage, a 2-point negative impact from currency translation and higher incentive compensation expense, partly offset by volume gains and the benefit of our cost savings initiative. The decline in gross margin, down 70 basis points, was driven by higher-than-anticipated cost inflation and the supply chain issues we experienced in the first half, partly offset by productivity and pricing gains.  
EPS of $2.46 was comparable to the prior year. 
Decomposing our sales performance for the quarter, as-reported sales declined 9% with organic sales increasing by 1%. Volume and mix subtracted 1 point, which was primarily in our Global Baking and Snacking and U.S. Beverages segments. 
Higher selling prices across 4 of our reportable segments added 1 point to sales. Reduced promotional spending contributed 1 point to sales growth, primarily driven by the Global Baking and Snacking segment. Currency translation had an adverse impact of 3 points. Our 2 primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, both continued to weaken against the U.S. dollar. 
Our recent acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet added 1 point to sales, and the impact of 1 less week subtracted 7 points. 
Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 180 basis points to 36.1%. For the quarter and moderating relative to earlier quarters, inflation increased by approximately 2%. Inflation and other factors had a negative impact on gross margin of 1.1 points.  Mix had a negative impact of 40 basis points. 
In aggregate, our price realization actions have contributed 1.2 points of margin expansion with 40 basis points from reduced promotional spending, principally trade reductions in Pepperidge Farm, and 80 basis points from higher selling prices, primarily on condensed soups, Prego and in Canada. 
Lastly, we continue to drive meaningful productivity gains in our supply chain, which contributed 210 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. And overall, our operating efficiencies were above prior year levels. 
Marketing and selling expenses declined by 7% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of currency and reductions in selling expense and nonworking marketing, both benefiting from our cost management efforts, partly offset by an increase in advertising and consumer promotion expense. 
Adjusted administrative expenses increased 10%, driven by a higher incentive compensation cost compared to the prior year in which the expense was significantly below targeted levels. 
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks it -- down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. 
As you can see, adjusted EPS increased $0.02 compared with the prior year, increasing from $0.41 to $0.43 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, growth in adjusted EBIT contributed $0.04 to EPS. Net interest expense declined $3 million, about $0.01 per share, primarily due to the impact of 1 less week. 
With $200 million of share repurchases throughout the year under our strategic share repurchase program, this has reduced our share count and added $0.01 to EPS in the quarter. 
Going the other way, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 34.8%, up 80 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting a shift in the mix between U.S. and foreign earnings and negatively impacted EPS by $0.01. 
Currency had a $0.01 negative impact on EPS in the quarter, completing the bridge to $0.43. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Global Baking and Snacking, our largest sales segment in the quarter, organic sales increased 1% as growth in Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's were partly offset by a decline in Kelsen. Sales gains in Pepperidge Farm were driven by fresh bakery, Goldfish crackers and frozen products, partly offset by a decline in cookies. Organic growth in Arnott’s reflected gains in Australia, partly offset by a decline in Indonesia. 
Operating earnings declined 26%, driven by the impact of 1 less week, higher marketing and administrative expenses, principally incentive compensation, currency translation and impairment charges to minor trademarks, partly offset by gross margin expansion. Excluding the impact of 1 less week, currency translation and the impairment charges, operating profit increased in the quarter. 
In U.S. Simple Meals, organic sales increased 4%. While dollar consumption of soup in measured channels increased 1%, movements in retail inventory levels contributed to sales gains in the quarter. 
As you may recall, movements in retail inventory levels had a negative impact on third quarter sales, and we're experiencing the opposite effect in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with retail inventory levels comparable to the prior year. 
Organic sales in other simple meals increased, driven by the continued strong growth of Prego pasta sauce. 
Segment sales also benefited from higher selling prices in condensed soups and Prego pasta sauce. 
Operating earnings increased 4%, reflecting organic sales growth, productivity improvements and benefits from our cost savings initiatives, partly offset by cost inflation and the impact of 1 less week. 
In the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment, organic sales increased 4% with growth in Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings and North America Foodservice, partly offset by declines in Bolthouse Farms carrots. 
Operating earnings fell 3% on higher administrative expenses and the impact of 1 less week. 
U.S. beverage organic sales fell 4% primarily due to volume losses in V8 V-Fusion. While consumer takeaway dollar sales in measured channels was positive, sales were negatively impacted by reductions in retail inventory levels and sales declines in the club channel. Operating earnings declined 23% due to the sales decline, including the impact of 1 less week. 
International Simple Meals and Beverages organic sales declined 5% from weakness in Canada and Australia. Operating earnings declined $10 million or 48% primarily due to volume declines, including the impact of 1 less week, and currency translation. 
This chart shows the as-reported sales performance of U.S. soup unadjusted for the impact of 1 less week, which subtracted 7 points in the quarter and 1 point for the full year. 
For the quarter, U.S. soup sales declined 2% with condensed down 4%, ready-to-serve down 3% and broth up 11%. Excluding the impact of one less week, sales of condensed soups increased with gains in both eating and cooking varieties driven by net price realization. 
Sales of ready-to-serve soup also increased, excluding the impact of 1 less week, primarily driven by the launches of our fresh-brewed soup for Keurig and our line of organic soups. The double-digit sales gain on Swanson broth was primarily led by aseptic varieties. 
For the fiscal year, as shown towards the bottom of the chart, soup sales declined 3% versus the prior year as a 3% decline in condensed and a 5% decline in ready-to-serve were partly offset by 3% growth in broth. 
Here's the U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. 
For the 52-week period ending August 2, 2015, the category as a whole declined 0.9%. Our sales in measured channels declined 0.7% with weakness in ready-to-serve soups partly offset by gains in broth. Our share increased 10 basis points in the last 52 weeks and has now been relatively stable for 3 years. 
Other branded players in aggregate had a share of 28.1%, declining 30 basis points, while private label with a 12.6% share gained 20 basis points. 
We had strong cash flow performance in fiscal 2015. Cash from operations increased by $283 million to almost $1.2 billion, driven by lower working capital requirements, wrapping the taxes paid in 2014 on the divestiture of the European Simple Meals business and lower pension contributions. 
Capital expenditures increased to $380 million as we increased capacities in Goldfish, Bolthouse Farms beverages, broth in North America and biscuits in Indonesia. 
We paid dividends totaling $394 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. 
In aggregate, we repurchased 244 million of shares in fiscal 2015, 200 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. 
Net debt increased by approximately $60 million to $3.8 billion as gains in cash flow were more than offset by the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. 
Now I'll review our fiscal 2016 guidance. The company expects to grow sales by 0 to 1%, adjusted EBIT to grow by 3% to 5% and adjusted EPS to grow by 3% to 5% or $2.53 to $2.58 per share. This guidance includes the estimated negative impact of currency translation of 2 points across sales, EBIT and EPS. 
This guidance also includes the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, which is estimated to contribute 1 point to sales and EBIT growth. 
The acquisition is neutral at EPS, including the impact of reducing our anticipated share repurchases to repay the acquisition debt. 
Excluding the impacts from currency headwinds and the acquisition, these growth rates are within our long-term growth targets of 1% to 3% organic sales, 4% to 6% for adjusted EBIT and 5% to 7% for adjusted EPS. 
While we don't give quarterly guidance, I will say that we expect some sales headwinds in the first quarter given we're cycling a strong first quarter from last year and from timing related to our promotional strategies. 
As announced this morning, we intend to adopt mark-to-market pension and postretirement benefit accounting in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and recast our historical results. This change eliminates the deferral and subsequent amortization of historic actuarial gains and losses, which will be recognized as incurred. The periodic mark-to-market adjustments will be reflected as an item impacting comparability and therefore excluded from adjusted results. We believe this accounting change will improve the transparency of our results and year-to-year comparability. 
The 2016 guidance does not reflect the impact of the anticipated accounting change. However, 2016 growth rates are not expected to change from the recasted 2015 base. 
As we operationalize our new division structure beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we will move from our current 5 reporting segments to 3: Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks and Campbell Fresh. 
Historical results reflecting both the new segments and change in accounting will be provided shortly after we file our first quarter 10-Q. 
Turning to some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance. We expect inflation and cost of products sold of approximately 2% to 3%, including the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the input costs of our international businesses. 
Cost inflation will be offset by gains from our ongoing productivity program, which, excluding our ZBB initiative, is targeted at 3% of cost of products sold. 
We expect our gross margin percentage to improve modestly as we continue to achieve net price realization and improve our supply chain performance. 
We are approving incentive compensation below target levels in 2015 and anticipate a headwind of approximately $0.04 per share in 2016. 
The effective tax rate is estimated to be in a range of 31% to 32% compared to the 2015 adjusted rate of 31%. 
This guidance assumes about a $0.02 per share incremental contribution from share repurchases, which are expected to be at levels below fiscal 2015. 
We are forecasting capital expenditures to decline by $30 million to approximately $350 million, which is more in line with our historical spending levels. 
In fiscal 2015, we launched a comprehensive reorganization and a 3-year cost reduction initiative, leveraging a zero-based budgeting approach and targeting annual savings of $250 million. As shown on the chart, we have achieved about $85 million of savings in 2015 as we reduced headcount and realized savings across several cost categories. For 2016, we are targeting to increase the savings run rate to $145 million, which would put us more than halfway to our $250 million goal. Most of the 2016 gains will come in the selling and marketing and administrative expense lines. The majority of the more complex supply chain gains will come later in the program. 
To implement the program, we estimate total program costs in the range of $250 million to $325 million. In fiscal 2015, we recognized costs totaling $124 million, which includes $22 million of implementation cost and $102 million of restructuring charges, principally severance as we implemented both a voluntary incentive separation program and headcount reductions as we streamlined our organization. Against this program, we estimate program costs of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2016. 
That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn it back to Ken for the Q&A."

The fourth quarter comp is fairly clean. The only thing that gave us some advantage this year relative to last year is the timing of the mark-to-market adjustment on our commodity hedges. So we had a little bit of favorability this year relative to last year. So a small portion of that 180 basis points is that and the rest is improvement in the operating performance of the business. In terms of 2016, as I said in my remarks, we expect to see a modest improvement in our gross margin percentage. And I think the way to think about it, there's a number of positives and a number of negatives. On the positive side, our annual COPS productivity program, where we target 3% of costs, obviously that's the most significant benefit. We expect to see continued benefit on net price realization, mostly from the pricing actions that we've taken in the back half of this year. We do expect to see some margin improvement from improved supply chain performance year-on-year given the challenges we had in the first half of last year. On the negative side, 3 things to mention. One is cost inflation, which we expect to be about 2% to 3%, and that includes the negative impact of currency on the input costs of a number of our international businesses. It also includes some negative mix. And lastly, the cost of some quality improvements we're making in some of our -- both our products and packaging."

We are pleased with the share in consumption of Goldfish crackers and, in particular, Milano. Although we did experience in the quarter some softness in cookies, that was pretty much as expected because we in the biscuit business in the United States particularly in the quarter, we did not promote as heavily as last year because the promotions were not as productive as we would have expected. So that was pretty deliberate. But we expect moderate growth in the United States on our biscuit business. In the Australian business, we're really happy with the year that we had there. That has been a pretty remarkable turnaround. We were challenged in Australia for a couple of years, and they have now posted really outstanding results. And it's been really on the fundamentals: better advertising, more innovation, more brand building, more digital. So we believe that the building blocks they've put in place there are very sustainable. We had a great year in Indonesia with double-digit growth, but we did have a slow fourth quarter. And you -- all you have to do is pick up a newspaper to see what's going on in Asia these days. But we're watching that very carefully, and we believe -- look, we have a lot of runway in Indonesia to expand our distribution points, but we're going to be very responsible about that business in '16. And then the Kelsen business, this is a very small quarter for Kelsen. The sales are skewed in China, largely toward Chinese New Year. But that said, we did have some inventory overhang from Chinese New Year this year, and we're working through that right now and that hit us predominantly in the fourth quarter."

I think expecting that business to grow moderately at the top line and expand margins is a more balanced approach to the portfolio in terms of expecting these categories to do what they can do. And that doesn't mean that we won't have pockets of growth. For example, the Plum business resides in that category or in that division, and we expect robust growth from Plum. We also are not taking our foot off the gas on innovation, but we're being a lot more selective about the innovation we put into the marketplace because we're in a different place. And a couple of years ago, we didn't have a pipeline, and so what happened as a result are some little ideas got out into the marketplace. Today, we have built a pipeline, and we could be more choiceful about the larger ideas where we know we're going to get an impact from. And so I think this is a much more responsible way to run this business, and we believe that we can deliver better value for our shareholders with this approach."

As we said in this morning's news release, in fiscal 2016, the company incurred mark-to-market losses associated with the interim remeasurement of certain U.S. pension plans. The impact on EPS was $0.26 per share.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today, I'll share my perspective on the overall operating environment, the changes we've implemented at Campbell and our first quarter business performance. 
The seismic shifts that we've outlined in previous meetings continue to impact the food industry, which remains under pressure from new global economic realities, major demographic shifts, changing consumer preferences for food with an emphasis on health and well-being and the continued growth of digital marketing and e-commerce channels. 
Looking at the operating environment, conditions remain challenging. In the United States, the economic situation is mixed. Unemployment continues to improve, but consumers remain very cautious. We're continuing to see American save more and spend less amid the uncertain economic climate. Outside the U.S., we're seeing macroeconomic challenges in other markets where we have significant operations, including Canada, China and Indonesia. 
Generating growth in this environment has been and remains difficult. As a result, the industry continues to respond with consolidation, spin-offs, aggressive cost-cutting programs and other measures to improve operational efficiency. Meanwhile, food retailers continue to respond by reconfiguring existing stores with a focus on the perimeter by launching new, smaller formats and by investing heavily in e-commerce capabilities. 
Several years ago, we've recognized the early signs of many of the trends that the industry is currently facing, and we started taking steps designed to best enable Campbell to navigate the changing landscape. While we've made progress through fiscal 2015, our actions haven't been sufficient. That's why, last year, we put a bolder plan in place to reshape Campbell. We began fiscal 2016 after successfully implementing significant changes to align our enterprise structure with our strategy. We formed 3 new divisions with clear portfolio roles. We began implementing a 3-year, $250 million cost-savings initiative that is delivering earlier-than-expected benefits. We created a new, Integrated Global Services organization to provide services to our divisions more efficiently and effectively. We initiated the first phase of zero-based budgeting to instill greater cost discipline and create an ownership mindset among employees. We added another growth engine in Garden Fresh Gourmet to bolster our Campbell Fresh division and expand our presence and scale beyond produce into the deli section of the store perimeter. 
As a result of these actions, we entered fiscal 2016 better positioned to execute against our strategic imperatives. With that as context, let me turn to our first quarter results. 
I'm pleased with our overall performance to start the year. Organic sales in the quarter were comparable to a year ago and consistent with our expectations, given that we're cycling an increase of 5%. I'm particularly pleased with our third consecutive quarter of adjusted gross margin expansion and the improvements we've made in our supply chain. Importantly, we delivered strong adjusted EBIT and EPS performance. 
As you saw this morning, we revised our annual guidance. Given our improved margin outlook for the year, we raised guidance for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS, while we lowered sales guidance to reflect increased currency headwinds. 
Our new reportable segments align with our 3 new divisions. Anthony will discuss our revised guidance and provide a detailed review of our segment results in a moment. But I wanted to offer my perspective on several notable items within each of our 3 new divisions. 
Let's start with our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. As a reminder, we're managing this division for moderate growth, consistent with the categories, in which we operate and for margin expansion. As we've discussed with you before, we're focused on increasing price realization, optimizing promotional spending and improving our supply chain performance. While we have more work to do in its early days, I'm encouraged by the progress the Americas team has made on all 3 fronts. As a result of our pricing and lower promotion activity, soup volumes declined as expected. Consumption was soft in the quarter, but this is not surprising due to the fact that our promotional activity and new advertising campaign started later in the quarter versus prior year. 
In early October, we began airing our new made for rear real-life advertising. Built around the strategic insights we've shared with you about the changing mosaic of the American family, this campaign represents a major departure for Campbell and depicts how our real food fits into real people's lives in a authentic and relatable way. Digital media is playing a larger role in this campaign than in previous efforts. Looking ahead, we expect improved sales performance in the second quarter as our marketing spending increases and the campaign gains momentum. 
As we talked about in July, we're focused on fewer, bigger innovations in the Americas division. While our new Swanson bottle broth is off to a slower start than anticipated, both Campbell's Fresh-Brewed Soups and K cups and Campbell's Organic soups are meeting expectations. The highlight in this division was the significant gross margin expansion. A major improvement this quarter was our supply chain performance, as evidenced by better customer service levels. We're cycling significant supply chain challenges especially transportation and warehousing. We're also benefiting from the mild inflationary environment this quarter. 
That said, the supply chain team has driven results ahead of expectations. Overall, the new Americas Simple Meals and Beverages division is off to a promising start in delivering against its portfolio role. 
Our Global Biscuits and Snacks divisions unifies our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott’s and Kelsen businesses and its portfolio role is to expand  and develop in developing markets, while improving markets -- margins. 
This division too is off to a promising start in fulfilling its portfolio role with organic sales growth, improved gross margins and strong earnings. I'm especially encouraged by our sales performance in our core markets, the U.S. and Australia. In U.S. biscuits and bakery, our Pepperidge Farm brands performed very well, driven by strong growth in crackers and fresh bakery, partly offset by declines in cookies. Our Goldfish business have particularly strong quarter with double-digit sales growth. 
Turning to developing markets. We drove organic sales growth in Malaysia, but we're continuing to keep a close eye on Indonesia where the challenging economic conditions we outlined in September continue to impact our business. As we stated at that time, we believe it's important for Campbell to become more geographically diverse despite short-term economic pressure in developing markets. 
Our third division is Campbell's Fresh, which includes Bolthouse Farms, Garden Fresh Gourmet and our refrigerated soup business. Here, we're focused on accelerating sales growth and expanding into new packaged fresh CPG categories. Reported segment sales increased 8% in the quarter, excluding the impact of Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, sales declined 3%. Let's take a closer look at what drove the decline. In Bolthouse Farms, we delivered mid-single-digit sales growth in the CPG business behind premium beverages and refrigerated salad dressings as we cycled double-digit growth in the prior year. However, these gains were more than offset by declines in our farms business, which includes our fresh retail carrots business, where we're the market leader and our ingredients business. 
Sales were down in carrots, although we grew share. As a reminder, carrots are an important business and that they provide both scaled and produce and an effective refrigerated logistics system for CPG business. The main culprit of the sales decline was the ingredients business. As we discussed at our Investor Day in July, the carrot concentrate business began softening last year due to weak demand in Japan. That softness accelerated in the first quarter. 
We expect the rate of decline in ingredients to moderate potentially in the back half of the year. While this is not the growth profile we expect from this division, we remain enthusiastic about C-Fresh and especially the CPG business. We have compelling brands, delicious products, a steady stream of on-trend innovation, investments to expand juice and salad dressing capacity and a strong team leading the business. We expect sales in our Packaged Fresh CPG business to accelerate as the year progresses driven by the continued expansion of 1915, our cold-pressed ultra premium juice line, and the strong spring innovation suite for super premium beverages and salad dressings. 
Now a word on Garden Fresh Gourmet. The integration into C-Fresh is on track and there has been no major surprises. As we outlined in July at our Investor Day meeting, we're focused on driving distribution and increasing market penetration beyond its Midwest stronghold. 
Before wrapping up, I want to spend a moment on our cost-savings initiative. We remain focused on transforming our cost structure in creating an ownership mindset where employees treat every dollar as if it were their own. Our streamlined organization, our ZBB efforts and our Integrated Global Services organization are all having a positive impact on both our cost and our culture. I'm very pleased with our progress in all these areas, particularly in IGS. 
This group is key to driving cost savings and building new capabilities. But IGS is more than efficiency and effectiveness. Beyond the cost savings and capability building underway, IGS is helping to spur significant cultural change by fundamentally altering the way work is performed at Campbell. 
Looking at our 3 new divisions and IGS, it's still early days, and we have more work ahead of us to fully unlock the potential of our redesigned enterprise structure, but we're off to a solid start. Today, we're better positioned to execute against the 4 strategic imperatives we outlined in July. 
First, we're leveraging our purpose, real food that matters for moment and the filter for strategic decisions. For example, we've made recipe changes to several of our core North America products, and we continue to engage consumers in open dialogue about the ingredients we use and the rationale behind our decisions as we strive to set the standard for transparency in the food industry. Second, we're shifting more of our marketing budget to digital channels and remain committed to growing our e-commerce capabilities. Third, we're advancing our health and well-being imperative across our company. Our new 1915 ultra premium juices are meeting our expectations, and we've had other recent successes, including Campbell's Organic soups and the distribution of carrot snacks into the New York City school launch program. And finally, we remain focused on expanding and developing markets, particularly in Southeast Asia with an emphasis on Malaysia and Indonesia. In China, we've added resources to expand Kelsen in anticipation of a positive Chinese New Year. 
In summary, these are unprecedented times of change marked by challenging economic conditions. In the food world, consolidation and intensified competition are disrupting and altering the landscape. At Campbell, we remain clear eyed about our challenges, focused on the consumer, responsive to our customers and dedicated to delivering against our purpose. I'm confident the actions we're taking will set Campbell apart from other food companies and strengthen our growth trajectory over time. 
I look forward to answering your questions. But now, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro."

Before reviewing our results and updated guidance, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter and outlook for the balance of the year. As Denise mentioned, organic sales were in line with our expectations after lapping a solid year ago quarter. 
We made good progress in gross margin, which increased 260 basis points on an adjusted basis, benefiting from net price realization and supply chain performance while cost inflation moderated. I'm very pleased with the progress we're making against our cost-reduction initiatives, delivering $30 million of savings in the first quarter, ahead of our expectations, and as I'll share later, allowing us to raise our 2016 savings target. Our improved outlook for cost inflation and additional cost savings will enable us to both fund investments and longer-term innovation and raise full year guidance for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS. And since we last updated you, we are experiencing an additional 1 point of headwind from currency translation across the P&L as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen. Lastly, as we indicated on our fourth quarter call, we have changed our reporting segments to align with our 3 new divisions and change our method of accounting for pension and postretirement benefits, both of which I will cover in my comments. 
I'll begin with the benefit accounting change and then discuss our results and updated guidance. To provide greater transparency into our financial results, we are changing our method of accounting for pension and postretirement benefits. Previously, actuarial gains and losses were deferred and amortized into earnings over several years. In our case, we have been amortizing significant actuarial losses, which arose over time primarily from declining interest rates. Under the new mark-to-market method, which has been applied to all prior period, actuarial gains and losses will be recognized immediately into earnings rather than amortized. We will identify the mark-to-market adjustment as an item impacting comparability and excluded from our adjusted results. 
Mark-to-market adjustments are recognized on remeasurement dates, typically year-end. What's shown on this chart is the impact on our fiscal 2015 full year and first quarter adjusted results from removing the actuarial loss amortization, recasting our full year 2015 results increased adjusted gross margin by 70 basis points, adjusted EBIT by $97 million and adjusted EPS by $0.19. 
For the first quarter of 2015, the impact is an increase of 60 basis points on gross margin, $21 million of EBIT or $0.04 per share. It is important to note that the benefit accounting change has no impact on cash flow. 
In the presentation of our first quarter 2016 results and guidance, all comparisons to 2015 are against this recasted 2015 adjusted base. Unrelated to the change in benefit accounting method I just described, we are required to remeasure certain U.S. pension plans quarterly during 2016 as a result of a program, in which we offered and paid lump sums to plan participants no longer with the company. This remeasurement led to a mark-to-market loss of $0.26 per share in the first quarter. 
For the first quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined 2% to $2.2 billion, primarily due to the negative impact of currency translation. Excluding currency and the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales were comparable to the prior year as net price realization from both higher list prices and lower promotional spending was offset by lower volumes, reflecting a 440 basis point increase in margin. Adjusted EBIT increased 23% to $479 million, benefiting from a higher gross margin percentage, savings from our cost-reduction initiatives and lower advertising, reflecting a shift in spending to later in the year. These positive drivers were partly offset by currency translation, which had a 4 point negative impact on EBIT, the equivalent of $0.03 per share. Adjusted EPS increased 22% to $0.95. 
Just to be clear, EPS growth on an adjusted basis is not impacted by the accounting change, but reflects improved operating performance of the business. Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Reported net sales declined 2% with organic sales comparable to the prior year. Within organic sales, volume and mix attracted 2 points, which was primarily driven by U.S. Soup within Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and the carrot ingredients business within Campbell Fresh. 
Higher selling prices in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages contributed 1 point, reflecting a pricing actions on condensed soups, Prego pasta sauce and Foodservice in the U.S. and across the Canadian portfolio. Lower promotional spending in Global Biscuits and Snacks also added 1 point to sales group. Currency translation had an average impact of 3 points on the top line. Our 2 primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, both declined against the U.S. dollar. 
To complete the bridge, our most recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet, contributed 1 point to net sales in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 260 basis points to 37.9%, exceeding our expectations on lower-than-anticipated cost inflation and improve supply chain performance. 
Within inflation and other, which negatively impacted margin by 20 basis points, cost inflation of approximately 1%, which is mostly offset by improved supply chain performance primarily in the areas of transportation and warehousing. Mix was slightly negative, reflecting a small negative impact from the acquisition. 
In aggregate, our price realization actions contributed 1.3 points to margin expansion with 40 basis points from reduced promotional spending, principally trade reductions in Pepperidge Farm and U.S. Soup and 90 basis points from higher selling prices. 
Lastly, we're off to a strong start on our supply chain productivity programs, which contributed 160 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. Excluding items impacting comparability, marketing and selling expenses declined 15% in the quarter, primarily due to lower advertising spending, savings from our cost-reduction initiatives and the impact of currency translation. The decline in advertising reflects the shifts and the timing of spending principally in U.S. Soup to later in the year. 
Adjusted administrative expenses decreased 8%, primarily due to savings from our cost-reduction program and the impact of currency translation. For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. 
As you can see, in aggregate, adjusted EPS increased $0.17 compared with the prior year, increasing from $0.78 to $0.95 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, growth in adjusted EBIT mostly from the gross margin expansion contributed $0.23 to EPS growth. The impact from share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program reduced our shared count and added $0.01. Going the other way, net interest expense increased $3 million, about $0.01 per share as we extended the maturity on the debt portfolio. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 34.1%, up 2.2 points versus the prior year, primarily due to our geographic mix and higher U.S. state taxes in 2016, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.03. Currency had a $0.03 negative impact on EPS in the quarter, completing the bridge to $0.95 per share. 
Beginning in 2016, we are aligning our reporting segments with our new division structure. We are now reporting our results in 3 segments: Americas Simple Meals and Beverages; Global Biscuits and Snacks; and Campbell Fresh. In connection with our change in benefit accounting, we have modified our method of allocating pension and postretirement benefit cost to the segments. In 2016, only the service costs, representing the value of the retirement benefit earned in the period, is allocated to segments. The other elements of expense, including interest cost on the liability, expected return on assets and actuarial gains and losses, are reflected in unallocated corporate expense. 
As previously mentioned, we will identify the mark-to-market adjustments as an item impacting comparability and exclude them from our adjusted results. We have adjusted our historical results to reflect these changes with fiscal 2015 sales, operating earnings and margin by segment shown on this chart. 
Immediately following the filing of our first quarter 10-Q, we will also provide recasted historical annual and quarterly results, including quarterly results for our segments, reflecting the benefit accounting changes. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales decreased 1% to $1.3 billion. U.S. Soup sales decreased 3%, reflecting declines in ready-to-serve soups and broth, primary offset by gains in condensed soup. Impacted by our list price actions and changes to our promotional programs, soup volumes, as expected, were negatively impacted. Sales of U.S. beverages declined slightly, primarily due to declines in V8 V-Fusion beverages, partly offset by gains in V8 Splash. 
Sales of other U.S. Simple Meals increased, driven by Prego pasta sauces, Campbell sauces and our new Prego and Pace ready meals. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation, sales in Canada increased driven by gains in soup. Operating earnings increased 19%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage, which benefited from net price realization and improved supply chain performance, particularly in the areas of transportation and warehousing and also from lower marketing and selling expenses. 
Our advertising expenditures were down in the quarter as we've shifted the timing of our activity to later in the fiscal year. Within U.S. Soup, the 3% sales decline was driven by a 10% decline in ready-to-serve soup and a 9% decline in Swanson broth, offset by a 2% gain on condensed. Sales of our fresh soup for Keurig, which are now part of the wet soup category, contributed 50 basis points of growth to total U.S. Soup in the quarter. We began and ended the quarter with retail inventories in aggregate comparable to year ago levels. 
With the formation of the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment and our efforts to diversify the portfolio beyond soup, we do not believe subcategory sales performance in soup is as meaningful a disclosure. We will continue to provide this information for the balance of the year before discontinuing in fiscal 2017. 
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share of results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending November 1, 2015, the category as a whole declined 1.3%. Our sales in measured channels declined 1.7%, with weakness in ready-to-serve and condensed soups, partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share, a decline of 20 basis points. Private label grew share by 20 basis points, finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28%, unchanged versus the prior year. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 2% with growth in Pepperidge Farm and the Asia Pacific region. Sales gains in Pepperidge Farm were driven by Goldfish crackers, fresh bakery and frozen products, partly offset by a decline in cookies. In the Asia Pacific region, excluding the impact of currency translation, growth in Australia biscuits from savory and sweet varieties were offset by declines in Indonesia biscuits as that market is facing some economic challenges. Operating earnings increased 16% primarily driven by a higher gross margin percentage, volume gains and lower selling expenses, partly offset by the negative impact of currency translation. 
In the Campbell Fresh segment, consistent with our expectations, organic sales decreased 3% due to anticipated declines in carrot ingredient export sales and category declines in retail carrots, partly offset by mid-single-digit sales growth in Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings. Not included in organic results is our recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet, which contributed 11 points of sales growth to the segment. Including the acquisition, the integration of which is going well, reported segment sales increased by 8%. Operating earnings doubled to $18 million, driven by a higher gross margin percentage and the impact of acquiring Garden Fresh Gourmet. The improvement in gross margin reflects lower carrot costs and the favorable mix impact of the growth in the higher-margin beverages and salad dressing business relative to the balance of the segment. 
We had strong cash flow performance in the first quarter. Cash from operations increased by $30 million to $218 million driven by higher cash earnings. Capital expenditures increased $9 million to $71 million. We paid dividends totaling $100 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. 
In aggregate, we repurchased $32 million of shares in the first quarter, $25 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. 
Net debt was equal to the prior year at $3.8 billion as positive net cash flow generated by the business offset the impact of the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. 
Now I'll review our revised 2016 guidance. We are now forecasting lower-than-anticipated cost inflation and cost savings in excess of our previous target. Compared to our previous cost inflation outlook of 2% to 3%, we now expect inflation in cost of products sold to be approximately 2% and for our gross margin to increase by approximately 1 percentage point. 
Compared to our previous incremental cost-savings goal of $60 million, we now expect to deliver savings in the range of $80 million to $100 million in fiscal 2016. Our cumulative cost-savings target of $250 million through fiscal 2018 remains unchanged. 
Going in the other direction, we are experiencing some headwinds on the tax line and now expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 32%. And as I mentioned earlier, we also expect the negative impact of currency translation to increase to 3 points as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen. These revised earnings guidance reflects additional investment in innovation as well as our current expectations for the performance of our business for the remainder of 2016. 
Relative to our previous growth rates, we are increasing adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS growth by 2 to 3 points on a currency-neutral basis with an offset to sales, EBIT and EPS of 1 point due to the increased negative impact of currency translation. 
From the recasted 2015 base and including a 3 point negative impact from currency, we now expect sales to change from minus 1% to 0%, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS to both increase 4% to 7%. The guidance also includes the impact of the Garden Fresh acquisition, which adds 1 point to both sales and adjusted EBIT. 
Given that there have been significant changes to our guidance, including the impact of the change in benefit accounting, we thought it would be helpful and this is instance to bridge our EPS guidance in September to the revised guidance we issued today. Starting with the original guidance of $2.53 to $2.58, we've added $0.19 for the benefit accounting change and adopted the incremental currency translation headwind, which is worth $0.03 per share. With the upside from lower-than-anticipated inflation and incremental cost savings, we have taken the opportunity to fund additional investments and longer-term innovation. The improved operating performance net of the additional investments is adding $0.06 to $0.09 to the guidance. Relative to our first quarter EPS growth, keep in mind that about half the Q1 EPS growth comes from marketing timing, which we anticipate will be spent back in the year ago period. 
That concludes my remarks. And now, I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A."

So half the business is the CPG, which is the beverages and salad dressing, the other half is the farms business, which includes the carrot business and ingredient export business. The largest structure within Campbell Fresh is very diverse, so the CPG business carry a much higher margin than the carrots and natural ingredients business. And in fact, that's where all the growth is. So even within the quarter, we see gross margin expansion within Campbell Fresh because of the higher growth on the higher-margin beverages and salad dressings. So if you think about the algorithm, you need to think about not just the Campbell Fresh margin, but the faster growing CPG margin within that. The other thing that has -- that happens to Campbell Fresh because of the Bolthouse acquisition, it carries a pretty high load of depreciation and amortization. The EBIT dollar margin is about 2x the operating margin you see on the chart, so it's another thing to keep in mind. But we think the algorithm works."

First of all, the soup business declined 2% after wrapping 6% increases in the year ago comps.

The fact that promotions have been shifted to later in the year and the fact that advertising started later in October. The consumption was down in line with our expectations. I would say to you that RTS is a bit worse, condense a bit better and broth was pretty flat, but the category was down 4%. And although I'm not a weather person, I do think that, that was a factor. But I believe with all these other dynamics going on were equal factors to that one. And then of course, our fresh fruit soup is not captured in our consumption that's in dry soup. Inventories were comparable. We saw little bit of a difference in broth because we carry some extra inventory into the year as we transition to a new cap on the aseptic broth. We still expect soup to grow modestly, and that's basically how we're looking at it."

As we said in this morning's news release, in fiscal 2016, the company incurred mark-to-market losses associated with the interim remeasurement of certain U.S. pension plans. The impact on EPS was $0.26 per share. The company also incurred restructuring charges, implementation cost and other related costs associated with the new organizational structure and cost-savings initiatives. 
The impact on EPS was $0.07 per share. Our comparisons of fiscal 2016 with fiscal 2015 will exclude these items for comparability. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today, I'll share my perspective on the overall operating environment, the changes we've implemented at Campbell and our first quarter business performance. 
The seismic shifts that we've outlined in previous meetings continue to impact the food industry, which remains under pressure from new global economic realities, major demographic shifts, changing consumer preferences for food with an emphasis on health and well being and the continued growth of Digital Marketing and e-commerce channels. 
Looking at the operating environment, conditions remain challenging. In the United States, the economic situation is mixed. Unemployment continues to improve, but consumers remain very cautious. We're continuing to see Americans save more and spend less amid the uncertain economic climate. Outside the U.S., we're seeing macroeconomic challenges in other markets where we have significant operations, including Canada, China and Indonesia. 
Generating growth in this environment has been and remains difficult. As a result, the industry continues to respond with consolidation, spin-offs, aggressive cost-cutting programs and other measures to improve operational efficiency. Meanwhile, food retailers continue to respond by reconfiguring existing stores with a focus on the perimeter by launching new, smaller formats and by investing heavily in e-commerce capabilities. 
Several years ago, we've recognized the early signs of many of the trends that the industry is currently facing, and we started taking steps designed to best enable Campbell to navigate the changing landscape. While we've made progress through fiscal 2015, our actions haven't been sufficient. That's why, last year, we put a bolder plan in place to reshape Campbell. We began fiscal 2016 after successfully implementing significant changes to align our enterprise structure with our strategy. We formed 3 new divisions with clear portfolio roles. We began implementing a 3-year, $250 million cost-savings initiative that is delivering earlier-than-expected benefits. We created a new, Integrated Global Services organization to provide services to our divisions more efficiently and effectively. We initiated the first phase of zero-based budgeting to instill greater cost discipline and create an ownership mindset among employees. We added another growth engine in Garden Fresh Gourmet to bolster our Campbell Fresh division and extend our presence and scale beyond produce into the deli section of the store perimeter. 
As a result of these actions, we entered fiscal 2016, better positioned to execute against our strategic imperatives. With that as context, let me turn to our first quarter results. 
I'm pleased with our overall performance to start the year. Organic sales in the quarter were comparable to a year ago and consistent with our expectations, given that we're cycling an increase of 5%. I'm particularly pleased with our third consecutive quarter of adjusted gross margin expansion and the improvements we've made in our supply chain. Importantly, we delivered strong adjusted EBIT and EPS performance. 
As you saw this morning, we revised our annual guidance. Given our improved margin outlook for the year, we raised guidance for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS, while we lowered sales guidance to reflect increased currency headwinds. 
Our new reportable segments align with our 3 new divisions. Anthony will discuss our revised guidance and provide a detailed review of our segment results in a moment. But I wanted to offer my perspective on several notable items within each of our 3 new divisions. 
Let's start with our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. As a reminder, we're managing this division for moderate growth, consistent with the categories in which we operate and for margin expansion. As we've discussed with you before, we're focused on increasing price realization, optimizing promotional spending and improving our supply chain performance. While we have more work to do in its early days, I'm encouraged by the progress the Americas team has made on all 3 fronts. As a result of our pricing and lower promotion activity, soup volumes declined as expected. Consumption was soft in the quarter, but this is not surprising due to the fact that our promotional activity and new advertising campaign started later in the quarter versus prior year. 
In early October, we began airing our new made for rear real-life advertising. Built around the strategic insights we've shared with you about the changing mosaic of the American family, this campaign represents a major departure for Campbell and depicts how our real food fits into real people's lives in an authentic and relatable way. Digital media is playing a larger role in this campaign than in previous efforts. Looking ahead, we expect improved sales performance in the second quarter as our marketing spending increases and the campaign gains momentum. 
As we talked about in July, we're focused on fewer, bigger innovations in the Americas division. While our new Swanson bottle broth is off to a slower start than anticipated, both Campbell's Fresh-Brewed Soups in K-Cups and Campbell's Organic soups are meeting expectations. The highlights in this division was the significant gross margin expansion. A major improvement this quarter was our supply chain performance as evidenced by better customer service levels. We're cycling significant supply chain challenges especially transportation and warehousing. We're also benefiting from the mild inflationary environment this quarter. 
That said, the supply chain team has driven results ahead of expectations. Overall, the new Americas Simple Meals and Beverage division is off to a promising start in delivering against its portfolio role. 
Our Global Biscuits and Snacks division unifies our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott’s and Kelsen businesses and its portfolio role is to expand in developed and developing markets while improving markets -- margins. This division too is off to a promising start in fulfilling its portfolio role with organic sales growth, improved gross margins and strong earnings. I'm especially encouraged by our sales performance in our core markets, the U.S. and Australia. In U.S. biscuits and bakery, our Pepperidge Farm brands performed very well, driven by strong growth in crackers and fresh bakery, partly offset by declines in cookies. Our Goldfish business had a particularly strong quarter with double-digit sales growth. 
Turning to developing markets. We drove organic sales growth in Malaysia, but we're continuing to keep a close eye on Indonesia where the challenging economic conditions we outlined in September continue to impact our business. As we stated at that time, we believe it's important for Campbell to become more geographically diverse despite short-term economic pressure in developing markets. 
Our third division is Campbell's Fresh, which includes Bolthouse Farms, Garden Fresh Gourmet and our refrigerated soup business. Here, we're focused on accelerating sales growth and expanding into new packaged fresh CPG categories. Reported segment sales increased 8% in the quarter, excluding the impact of Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, sales declined 3%. Let's take a closer look at what drove the decline. In Bolthouse Farms, we delivered mid-single-digit sales growth in the CPG business behind premium beverages and refrigerated salad dressings as we cycled double-digit growth in the prior year. However, these gains were more than offset by declines in our farms business, which includes our fresh retail carrots business, where we're the market leader and our ingredients business. 
Sales were down in carrots, although we grew share. As a reminder, carrots are an important business in that they provide both scale and produce and an effective refrigerated logistics system for CPG business. The main culprit of the sales decline was the ingredients business. As we discussed at our Investor Day in July, the carrot concentrate business began softening last year due to weak demand in Japan. That softness accelerated in the first quarter. 
We expect the rate of decline in ingredients to moderate potentially in the back half of the year. While this is not the growth profile we expect from this division, we remain enthusiastic about C-Fresh and especially the CPG business. We have compelling brands, delicious products, a steady stream of on-trend innovation, investments to expand juice and salad dressing capacity and a strong team leading the business. We expect sales in our Packaged Fresh CPG business to accelerate as the year progresses driven by the continued expansion of 1915, our cold-pressed ultra-premium juice line, and the strong spring innovation suite for super premium beverages and salad dressings. 
Now a word on Garden Fresh Gourmet. The integration into C-Fresh is on track and there has been no major surprises. As we outlined in July at our Investor Day meeting, we're focused on driving distribution and increasing market penetration beyond its Midwest stronghold. 
Before wrapping up, I want to spend a moment on our cost savings initiative. We remain focused on transforming our cost structure and creating an ownership mindset where employees treat every dollar as if it were their own. Our streamlined organization, our ZBB efforts and our Integrated Global Services Organization are all having a positive impact on both our cost and our culture. I'm very pleased with our progress in all these areas, particularly in IGS.  This group is key to driving cost savings and building new capabilities. But IGS is about more than efficiency and effectiveness. Beyond the cost savings and capability building underway, IGS is helping to spur significant cultural change by fundamentally altering the way work is performed at Campbell. 
Looking at our 3 new divisions and IGS, it's still early days, and we have more work ahead of us to fully unlock the potential of our redesigned enterprise structure, but we're off to a solid start. Today, we're better positioned to execute against the 4 strategic imperatives we outlined in July. 
First, we're leveraging our purpose, real food that matters for life's moments as a filter for strategic decisions. For example, we've made recipe changes to several of our core North America products, and we continue to engage consumers in open dialogue about the ingredients we use and the rationale behind our decisions as we strive to set the standard for transparency in the food industry. Second, we're shifting more of our marketing budget to digital channels and remain committed to growing our e-commerce capabilities. Third, we're advancing our health and well-being imperative across our company. Our new 1915 ultra premium juices are meeting our expectations and we've had other recent successes, including Campbell Organic soups and the distribution of carrot snacks into the New York City school lunch program. And finally, we remain focused on expanding and developing markets, particularly in Southeast Asia with an emphasis on Malaysia and Indonesia. In China, we've added resources to expand Kelsen in anticipation of a positive Chinese New Year. 
In summary, these are unprecedented times of change marked by challenging economic conditions. In the food world, consolidation and intensified competition are disrupting and altering the landscape. At Campbell, we remain clear eyed about our challenges, focused on the consumer, responsive to our customers and dedicated to delivering against our purpose. I'm confident the actions we're taking will set Campbell apart from other food companies and strengthen our growth trajectory over time. 
I look forward to answering your questions. But now, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro."

Before reviewing our results and updated guidance, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter and outlook for the balance of the year. As Denise mentioned, organic sales were in line with our expectations after lapping a solid, year-ago quarter. 
We made good progress and growth margin, which increased 260 basis points on an adjusted basis, benefiting from net price realization and supply chain performance while cost inflation moderated. I'm very pleased with the progress we're making against our cost reduction initiatives, delivering $30 million of savings in the first quarter, ahead of our expectations, and as I'll share later, allowing us to raise our 2016 savings target. Our improved outlook for cost inflation and additional cost savings will enable us to both fund investments and longer-term innovation and raise our full year guidance for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS. And since we last updated you, we are experiencing an additional 1 point of headwind from currency translation across the P&L as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen. Lastly, as we indicated on our fourth quarter call, we have changed our reporting segments to align with our 3 new divisions and change our method of accounting for pension and postretirement benefits, both of which I will cover in my comments. 
I'll begin with the benefit accounting change and then discuss our results and updated guidance. To provide greater transparency into our financial results, we are changing our method of accounting for pension and postretirement benefits. Previously, actuarial gains and losses were deferred and amortized into earnings over several years. In our case, we have been amortizing significant actuarial losses, which arose over time primarily from declining interest rates. Under the new mark-to-market method, which has been applied to all prior period, actuarial gains and losses will be recognized immediately into earnings rather than amortized. We will identify the mark-to-market adjustment as an item impacting comparability and excluded from our adjusted results. 
Mark-to-market adjustments are recognized on remeasurement dates, typically year-end. What's shown on this chart is the impact on our fiscal 2015 full year and first quarter adjusted results from removing the actuarial loss amortization, recasting our full year 2015 results increased since adjusted gross margin by 70 basis points, adjusted EBIT by $97 million and adjusted EPS by $0.19. 
For the first quarter of 2015, the impact is an increase of 60 basis points on gross margin, $21 million of EBIT or $0.04 per share. It is important to note that the benefit accounting change has no impact on cash flow. 
In the presentation of our first quarter 2016 results and guidance, all comparisons to 2015 are against this recasted 2015 adjusted base. Unrelated to the change in benefit accounting method I just described, we are required to remeasure certain U.S. pension plans quarterly during 2016 as a result of a program, in which we offered and paid lump sums to plan participants no longer with the company. This remeasurement led to a mark-to-market loss of $0.26 per share in the first quarter. 
For the first quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined 2% to $2.2 billion, primarily due to the negative impact of currency translation. Excluding currency and the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales were comparable to the prior year as net price realization from both higher list prices and lower promotional spending was offset by lower volumes. Reflecting a 440 basis point increase in margin, adjusted EBIT increased 23% to $479 million, benefiting from a higher gross margin percentage, savings from our cost reduction initiatives and lower advertising, reflecting a shift in spending to later in the year. These positive drivers were partly offset by currency translation, which had a 4-point negative impact on EBIT, the equivalent of $0.03 per share. Adjusted EPS increased 22% to $0.95.  Just to be clear, EPS growth on an adjusted basis is not impacted by the accounting change, but reflects improved operating performance of the business. Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Reported net sales declined 2% with organic sales comparable to the prior year. Within organic sales, volume and mix attracted 2 points, which was primarily driven by U.S. Soup within Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and the carrot ingredients business within Campbell Fresh. 
Higher selling prices in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages contributed 1 point, reflecting a pricing actions on condensed soup, Prego pasta sauce and Foodservice in the U.S. and across the Canadian portfolio. Lower promotional spending in Global Biscuits and Snacks also added 1 point to sales growth. Currency translation had an average impact of 3 points on the top line. Our 2 primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, both declined against the U.S. dollar. 
To complete the bridge, our most recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet, contributed 1 point to net sales in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 260 basis points to 37.9%, exceeding our expectations on lower-than-anticipated cost inflation and improved supply chain performance. 
Within inflation and other, which negatively impacted margin by 20 basis points, cost inflation of approximately 1% was mostly offset by improved supply chain performance, primarily in the areas of transportation and warehousing. Mix was slightly negative, reflecting a small negative impact from the acquisition. 
In aggregate, our price realization actions contributed 1.3 points to margin expansion with 40 basis points from reduced promotional spending, principally trade reductions in Pepperidge Farm and U.S. Soup and 90 basis points from higher selling prices. 
Lastly, we're off to a strong start on our supply chain productivity programs, which contributed 160 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. Excluding items impacting comparability, marketing and selling expenses declined 15% in the quarter, primarily due to lower advertising spending, savings from our cost reduction initiatives and the impact of currency translation. The decline in advertising reflects the shift and the timing of our spending principally in U.S. Soup to later in the year. 
Adjusted administrative expenses decreased 8%, primarily due to savings from our cost reduction program and the impact of currency translation. For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. 
As you can see, in aggregate, adjusted EPS increased $0.17 compared with the prior year, increasing from $0.78 to $0.95 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, growth in adjusted EBIT, mostly from the gross margin expansion contributed $0.23 to EPS growth. The impact from share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program reduced our shared count and added $0.01. Going the other way, net interest expense increased $3 million, about $0.01 per share as we extended the maturity on the debt portfolio. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 34.1%, up 2.2 points versus the prior year, primarily due to our geographic mix and higher U.S. state taxes in 2016, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.03. Currency had a $0.03 negative impact on EPS in the quarter, completing the bridge to $0.95 per share. 
Beginning in 2016, we are aligning our reporting segments with our new division structure. We are now reporting our results in 3 segments: Americas Simple Meals and Beverages; Global Biscuits and Snacks; and Campbell Fresh. In connection with our change in benefit accounting, we have modified our method of allocating pension and postretirement benefit cost to the segments. In 2016, only the service costs, representing the value of the retirement benefit earned in the period, is allocated to segments. The other elements of expense, including interest cost on the liability, expected return on assets and actuarial gains and losses, are reflected in unallocated corporate expense. 
As previously mentioned, we will identify the mark-to-market adjustments as an item impacting comparability and exclude them from our adjusted results. We have adjusted our historical results to reflect these changes with fiscal 2015 sales, operating earnings and margin by segment shown on this chart. 
Immediately following the filing of our first quarter 10-Q, we will also provide recasted historical annual and quarterly results, including quarterly results for our segments, reflecting the benefit accounting changes. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales decreased 1% to $1.3 billion. U.S. Soup sales decreased 3%, reflecting declines in ready-to-serve soups and broth, partly offset by gains in condensed soup. Impacted by our list price actions and changes to our promotional programs, soup volumes, as expected, were negatively impacted. Sales of U.S. beverages declined slightly, primarily due to declines in V8 V-Fusion beverages, partly offset by gains in V8 Splash. 
Sales of other U.S. Simple Meals increased, driven by Prego pasta sauces, Campbell's Dinner Sauces and our new Prego and Pace ready meals. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation, sales in Canada increased, driven by gains in soup. Operating earnings increased 19%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage, which benefited from net price realization and improved supply chain performance, particularly in the areas of transportation and warehousing, and also from lower marketing and selling expenses. 
Our advertising expenditures were down in the quarter as we've shifted the timing of our activity to later in the fiscal year. Within U.S. Soup, the 3% sales decline was driven by a 10% decline in ready-to-serve soup and a 9% decline in Swanson broth, offset by a 2% gain on condensed. Sales of our fresh-brewed soups for Keurig, which are now part of the wet soup category, contributed 50 basis points of growth to total U.S. Soup in the quarter. We began and ended the quarter with retail inventories in aggregate comparable to year ago levels. 
With the formation of the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment and our efforts to diversify the portfolio beyond soup, we do not believe subcategory sales performance in soup is as meaningful a disclosure. We will continue to provide this information for the balance of the year before discontinuing in fiscal 2017. 
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending November 1, 2015, the category as a whole declined 1.3%. Our sales in measured channels declined 1.7% with weakness in ready-to-serve and condensed soups, partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share, a decline of 20 basis points. Private label grew share by 20 basis points finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28%, unchanged versus the prior year. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 2% with growth in Pepperidge Farm and the Asia Pacific region. Sales gains in Pepperidge Farm were driven by Goldfish crackers, fresh bakery and frozen products, partly offset by a decline in cookies. In the Asia Pacific region, excluding the impact of currency translation, growth in Australia biscuits from savory and sweet varieties were offset by declines in Indonesia biscuits as that market is facing some economic challenges. Operating earnings increased 16% primarily driven by a higher gross margin percentage, volume gains and lower selling expenses, partly offset by the negative impact of currency translation. 
In the Campbell's Fresh segment, consistent with our expectations, organic sales decreased 3% due to anticipated declines in carrot ingredient export sales and category declines in retail carrots, partly offset by mid-single-digit sales growth in Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings. Not included in organic results is our recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet, which contributed 11 points of sales growth to the segment. Including the acquisition, the integration of which is going well, reported segment sales increased by 8%. Operating earnings doubled to $18 million driven by a higher gross margin percentage and the impact of acquiring Garden Fresh Gourmet. The improvement in gross margin reflects lower carrot costs and the favorable mix impact of the growth in the higher-margin beverages and salad dressing business relative to the balance of the segment. 
We had strong cash flow performance in the first quarter. Cash from operations increased by $30 million to $218 million driven by higher cash earnings. Capital expenditures increased $9 million to $71 million. We paid dividends totaling $100 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. 
In aggregate, we repurchased $32 million of shares in the first quarter, $25 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. 
Net debt was equal to the prior year at $3.8 billion as positive net cash flow generated by the business offset the impact of the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. 
Now I'll review our revised 2016 guidance. We are now forecasting lower-than-anticipated cost inflation and cost savings in excess of our previous target. Compared to our previous cost inflation outlook of 2% to 3%, we now expect inflation and cost of products sold to be approximately 2% and for our gross margin to increase by approximately 1 percentage point. 
Compared to our previous incremental cost savings goal of $60 million, we now expect to deliver savings in the range of $80 million to $100 million in fiscal 2016. Our cumulative cost savings target of $250 million through fiscal 2018 remains unchanged. 
Going in the other direction, we are experiencing some headwinds on the tax line and now expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 32%. And as I mentioned earlier, we also expect the negative impact of currency translation to increase to 3 points as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen. This revised earnings guidance reflects additional investment in innovation as well as our current expectations for the performance of our business for the remainder of 2016. 
Relative to our previous growth rates, we are increasing adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS growth by 2 to 3 points on a currency-neutral basis with an offset to sales, EBIT and EPS of 1 point due to the increased negative impact of currency translation. 
From the recasted 2015 base and including a 3-point negative impact from currency, we now expect sales to change from minus 1% to 0%, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS to both increase 4% to 7%. The guidance also includes the impact of the Garden Fresh acquisition, which adds 1 point to both sales and adjusted EBIT. 
Given that there have been significant changes to our guidance, including the impact of the change in benefit accounting, we thought it would be helpful and this is an instance to bridge our EPS guidance in September to the revised guidance we issued today. Starting with the original guidance of $2.53 to $2.58, we've added $0.19 for the benefit accounting change and adopted the incremental currency translation headwind, which is worth $0.03 per share. With the upside from lower-than-anticipated inflation and incremental cost savings, we have taken the opportunity to fund additional investments and longer-term innovation. The improved operating performance, net of the additional investments is adding $0.06 to $0.09 to the guidance. Relative to our first quarter EPS growth, keep in mind that about half the Q1 EPS growth, comes from marketing timing, which we anticipate will be spent back in the year ago period. 
That concludes my remarks. And now, I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A."

So half the business is the CPG side, which is the beverages and salad dressing, the other half is the farms business, which includes the carrot business and the ingredient export business. The margin structure within Campbell Fresh is very diverse, so the CPG businesses carry a much higher margin than the carrots and natural ingredients business. And in fact, that's where all the growth is. So even within the quarter, we see gross margin expansion within Campbell Fresh because of the higher growth on the higher-margin beverages and salad dressings. So if you think about the algorithm, you need to think about not just the Campbell Fresh margin, but the faster growing CPG margin within that. The other thing that has -- that happens to Campbell Fresh because of the Bolthouse acquisition, it carries a pretty high load of depreciation and amortization. The EBIT dollar margin is about 2x the operating margin you see on the chart, so it's another thing to keep in mind. But we think the algorithm works."

First of all, the soup business declined 2% after wrapping 6% increases in the year-ago comps.

The fact that promotions have been shifted to later in the year and the fact that advertising started later in October. The consumption was down in line with our expectations. I would say to you that RTS is a bit worse, condensed a bit better and broth was pretty flat, but the category was down 4%. And although I'm not a weather person, I do think that, that was a factor. But I believe that all these other dynamics going on were equal factors to that one. And then of course, our Fresh fruit soup is not captured in our consumption that's in dry soup. Inventories were comparable. We saw little bit of a difference in broth because we carry some extra inventory into the year as we transition to a new screw cap on the aseptic broth. We still expect soup to grow modestly, and that's basically how we're looking at it."

As we said in this morning's news release, in fiscal 2016, the company incurred mark-to-market losses associated with the interim remeasurement of certain U.S. pension plans. The impact on EPS was $0.26 per share. The company also incurred restructuring charges, implementation cost and other related costs associated with the new organizational structure and cost-savings initiatives. 
The impact on EPS was $0.07 per share. Our comparisons of fiscal 2016 with fiscal 2015 will exclude these items for comparability. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today, I'll share my perspective on the overall operating environment, the changes we've implemented at Campbell and our first quarter business performance. 
The seismic shifts that we've outlined in previous meetings continue to impact the food industry, which remains under pressure from new global economic realities, major demographic shifts, changing consumer preferences for food with an emphasis on health and well being and the continued growth of Digital Marketing and e-commerce channels. 
Looking at the operating environment, conditions remain challenging. In the United States, the economic situation is mixed. Unemployment continues to improve, but consumers remain very cautious. We're continuing to see Americans save more and spend less amid the uncertain economic climate. Outside the U.S., we're seeing macroeconomic challenges in other markets where we have significant operations, including Canada, China and Indonesia. 
Generating growth in this environment has been and remains difficult. As a result, the industry continues to respond with consolidation, spin-offs, aggressive cost-cutting programs and other measures to improve operational efficiency. Meanwhile, food retailers continue to respond by reconfiguring existing stores with a focus on the perimeter by launching new, smaller formats and by investing heavily in e-commerce capabilities. 
Several years ago, we recognized the early signs of many of the trends that the industry is currently facing, and we started taking steps designed to best enable Campbell to navigate the changing landscape. While we've made progress through fiscal 2015, our actions haven't been sufficient. That's why, last year, we put a bolder plan in place to reshape Campbell. We began fiscal 2016 after successfully implementing significant changes to align our enterprise structure with our strategy. We formed 3 new divisions with clear portfolio roles. We began implementing a 3-year, $250 million cost-savings initiative that is delivering earlier-than-expected benefits. We created a new, Integrated Global Services organization to provide services to our divisions more efficiently and effectively. We initiated the first phase of zero-based budgeting to instill greater cost discipline and create an ownership mindset among employees. We added another growth engine in Garden Fresh Gourmet to bolster our Campbell Fresh division and extend our presence and scale beyond produce into the deli section of the store perimeter. 
As a result of these actions, we entered fiscal 2016, better positioned to execute against our strategic imperatives. With that as context, let me turn to our first quarter results. 
I'm pleased with our overall performance to start the year. Organic sales in the quarter were comparable to a year ago and consistent with our expectations, given that we're cycling an increase of 5%. I'm particularly pleased with our third consecutive quarter of adjusted gross margin expansion and the improvements we've made in our supply chain. Importantly, we delivered strong adjusted EBIT and EPS performance. 
As you saw this morning, we revised our annual guidance. Given our improved margin outlook for the year, we raised guidance for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS, while we lowered sales guidance to reflect increased currency headwinds. 
Our new reportable segments align with our 3 new divisions. Anthony will discuss our revised guidance and provide a detailed review of our segment results in a moment. But I wanted to offer my perspective on several notable items within each of our 3 new divisions. 
Let's start with our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. As a reminder, we're managing this division for moderate growth, consistent with the categories in which we operate and for margin expansion. As we've discussed with you before, we're focused on increasing price realization, optimizing promotional spending and improving our supply chain performance. While we have more work to do in its early days, I'm encouraged by the progress the Americas team has made on all 3 fronts. As a result of our pricing and lower promotion activity, soup volumes declined as expected. Consumption was soft in the quarter, but this is not surprising due to the fact that our promotional activity and new advertising campaign started later in the quarter versus prior year. 
In early October, we began airing our new made for rear real-life advertising. Built around the strategic insights we've shared with you about the changing mosaic of the American family, this campaign represents a major departure for Campbell and depicts how our real food fits into real people's lives in an authentic and relatable way. Digital media is playing a larger role in this campaign than in previous efforts. Looking ahead, we expect improved sales performance in the second quarter as our marketing spending increases and the campaign gains momentum. 
As we talked about in July, we're focused on fewer, bigger innovations in the Americas division. While our new Swanson bottle broth is off to a slower start than anticipated, both Campbell's Fresh-Brewed Soups in K-Cups and Campbell's Organic soups are meeting expectations. The highlight in this division was the significant gross margin expansion. A major improvement this quarter was our supply chain performance as evidenced by better customer service levels. We're cycling significant supply chain challenges, especially transportation and warehousing. We're also benefiting from the mild inflationary environment this quarter. 
That said, the supply chain team has driven results ahead of expectations. Overall, the new Americas Simple Meals and Beverage division is off to a promising start in delivering against its portfolio role. 
Our Global Biscuits and Snacks division unifies our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott’s and Kelsen businesses and its portfolio role is to expand in developed and developing markets while improving markets -- margins. This division too is off to a promising start in fulfilling its portfolio role with organic sales growth, improved gross margins and strong earnings. I'm especially encouraged by our sales performance in our core markets, the U.S. and Australia. In U.S. biscuits and bakery, our Pepperidge Farm brands performed very well, driven by strong growth in crackers and fresh bakery, partly offset by declines in cookies. Our Goldfish business had a particularly strong quarter with double-digit sales growth. 
Turning to developing markets. We drove organic sales growth in Malaysia, but we're continuing to keep a close eye on Indonesia where the challenging economic conditions we outlined in September continue to impact our business. As we stated at that time, we believe it's important for Campbell to become more geographically diverse despite short-term economic pressure in developing markets. 
Our third division is Campbell's Fresh, which includes Bolthouse Farms, Garden Fresh Gourmet and our refrigerated soup business. Here, we're focused on accelerating sales growth and expanding into new packaged fresh CPG categories. Reported segment sales increased 8% in the quarter, excluding the impact of Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, sales declined 3%. Let's take a closer look at what drove the decline. In Bolthouse Farms, we delivered mid-single-digit sales growth in the CPG business behind premium beverages and refrigerated salad dressings as we cycled double-digit growth in the prior year. However, these gains were more than offset by declines in our farms business, which includes our fresh retail carrots business, where we're the market leader, and our ingredients business. 
Sales were down in carrots, although we grew share. As a reminder, carrots are an important business in that they provide both scale and produce and an effective refrigerated logistics system for our CPG business. The main culprit of the sales decline was the ingredients business. As we discussed at our Investor Day in July, the carrot concentrate business began softening last year due to weak demand in Japan. That softness accelerated in the first quarter. 
We expect the rate of decline in ingredients to moderate potentially in the back half of the year. While this is not the growth profile we expect from this division, we remain enthusiastic about C-Fresh and especially the CPG business. We have compelling brands, delicious products, a steady stream of on-trend innovation, investments to expand juice and salad dressing capacity and a strong team leading the business. We expect sales in our Packaged Fresh CPG business to accelerate as the year progresses driven by the continued expansion of 1915, our cold-pressed ultra-premium juice line, and the strong spring innovation suite for super premium beverages and salad dressings. 
Now a word on Garden Fresh Gourmet. The integration into C-Fresh is on track and there have been no major surprises. As we outlined in July at our Investor Day meeting, we're focused on driving distribution and increasing market penetration beyond its Midwest stronghold. 
Before wrapping up, I want to spend a moment on our cost savings initiative. We remain focused on transforming our cost structure and creating an ownership mindset where employees treat every dollar as if it were their own. Our streamlined organization, our ZBB efforts and our Integrated Global Services Organization are all having a positive impact on both our cost and our culture. I'm very pleased with our progress in all these areas, particularly in IGS.  This group is key to driving cost savings and building new capabilities. But IGS is about more than efficiency and effectiveness. Beyond the cost savings and capability building underway, IGS is helping to spur significant cultural change by fundamentally altering the way work is performed at Campbell. 
Looking at our 3 new divisions and IGS, it's still early days, and we have more work ahead of us to fully unlock the potential of our redesigned enterprise structure, but we're off to a solid start. Today, we're better positioned to execute against the 4 strategic imperatives we outlined in July. 
First, we're leveraging our purpose, real food that matters for life's moments as a filter for strategic decisions. For example, we've made recipe changes to several of our core North America products, and we continue to engage consumers in open dialogue about the ingredients we use and the rationale behind our decisions as we strive to set the standard for transparency in the food industry. Second, we're shifting more of our marketing budget to digital channels and remain committed to growing our e-commerce capabilities. Third, we're advancing our health and well-being imperative across our company. Our new 1915 ultra premium juices are meeting our expectations and we've had other recent successes, including Campbell Organic soups and the distribution of carrot snacks into the New York City school lunch program. And finally, we remain focused on expanding and developing markets, particularly in Southeast Asia with an emphasis on Malaysia and Indonesia. In China, we've added resources to expand Kelsen in anticipation of a positive Chinese New Year. 
In summary, these are unprecedented times of change marked by challenging economic conditions. In the food world, consolidation and intensified competition are disrupting and altering the landscape. At Campbell, we remain clear eyed about our challenges, focused on the consumer, responsive to our customers and dedicated to delivering against our purpose. I'm confident the actions we're taking will set Campbell apart from other food companies and strengthen our growth trajectory over time. 
I look forward to answering your questions. But now, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro."

Before reviewing our results and updated guidance, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter and outlook for the balance of the year. As Denise mentioned, organic sales were in line with our expectations after lapping a solid, year-ago quarter. 
We made good progress on gross margin, which increased 260 basis points on an adjusted basis, benefiting from net price realization and supply chain performance while cost inflation moderated. I'm very pleased with the progress we're making against our cost reduction initiatives, delivering $30 million of savings in the first quarter, ahead of our expectations, and as I'll share later, allowing us to raise our 2016 savings target. Our improved outlook for cost inflation and additional cost savings will enable us to both fund investments in longer-term innovation and raise our full year guidance for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS. And since we last updated you, we are experiencing an additional 1 point of headwind from currency translation across the P&L as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen. Lastly, as we indicated on our fourth quarter call, we have changed our reporting segments to align with our 3 new divisions and changed our method of accounting for pension and postretirement benefits, both of which I will cover in my comments. 
I'll begin with the benefit accounting change and then discuss our results and updated guidance. To provide greater transparency into our financial results, we are changing our method of accounting for pension and postretirement benefits. Previously, actuarial gains and losses were deferred and amortized into earnings over several years. In our case, we have been amortizing significant actuarial losses, which arose over time primarily from declining interest rates. Under the new mark-to-market method, which has been applied to all prior periods, actuarial gains and losses will be recognized immediately into earnings rather than amortized. We will identify the mark-to-market adjustment as an item impacting comparability and excluded from our adjusted results. 
Mark-to-market adjustments are recognized on remeasurement dates, typically year-end. What's shown on this chart is the impact on our fiscal 2015 full year and first quarter adjusted results from removing the actuarial loss amortization, recasting our full year 2015 results increased since adjusted gross margin by 70 basis points, adjusted EBIT by $97 million and adjusted EPS by $0.19. 
For the first quarter of 2015, the impact is an increase of 60 basis points on gross margin, $21 million of EBIT or $0.04 per share. It is important to note that the benefit accounting change has no impact on cash flow. 
In the presentation of our first quarter 2016 results and guidance, all comparisons to 2015 are against this recasted 2015 adjusted base. Unrelated to the change in benefit accounting method I just described, we are required to remeasure certain U.S. pension plans quarterly during 2016 as a result of a program, in which we offered and paid lump sums to plan participants no longer with the company. This remeasurement led to a mark-to-market loss of $0.26 per share in the first quarter. 
For the first quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined 2% to $2.2 billion, primarily due to the negative impact of currency translation. Excluding currency and the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales were comparable to the prior year as net price realization from both higher list prices and lower promotional spending was offset by lower volumes. Reflecting a 440 basis point increase in margin, adjusted EBIT increased 23% to $479 million, benefiting from a higher gross margin percentage, savings from our cost reduction initiatives and lower advertising, reflecting a shift in spending to later in the year. These positive drivers were partly offset by currency translation, which had a 4-point negative impact on EBIT, the equivalent of $0.03 per share. Adjusted EPS increased 22% to $0.95.  Just to be clear, EPS growth on an adjusted basis is not impacted by the accounting change, but reflects improved operating performance of the business. Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Reported net sales declined 2% with organic sales comparable to the prior year. Within organic sales, volume and mix attracted 2 points, which was primarily driven by U.S. Soup within Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and the carrot ingredients business within Campbell Fresh. 
Higher selling prices in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages contributed 1 point, reflecting our pricing actions on condensed soup, Prego pasta sauce and Foodservice in the U.S. and across the Canadian portfolio. Lower promotional spending in Global Biscuits and Snacks also added 1 point to sales growth. Currency translation had an adverse impact of 3 points on the top line. Our 2 primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, both declined against the U.S. dollar. 
To complete the bridge, our most recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet, contributed 1 point to net sales in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 260 basis points to 37.9%, exceeding our expectations on lower-than-anticipated cost inflation and improved supply chain performance. 
Within inflation and other, which negatively impacted margin by 20 basis points, cost inflation of approximately 1% was mostly offset by improved supply chain performance, primarily in the areas of transportation and warehousing. Mix was slightly negative, reflecting a small negative impact from the acquisition. 
In aggregate, our price realization actions contributed 1.3 points of margin expansion with 40 basis points from reduced promotional spending, principally trade reductions in Pepperidge Farm and U.S. Soup and 90 basis points from higher selling prices. 
Lastly, we're off to a strong start on our supply chain productivity programs, which contributed 160 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. Excluding items impacting comparability, marketing and selling expenses declined 15% in the quarter, primarily due to lower advertising spending, savings from our cost reduction initiatives and the impact of currency translation. The decline in advertising reflects the shift and the timing of our spending principally in U.S. Soup to later in the year. 
Adjusted administrative expenses decreased 8%, primarily due to savings from our cost reduction program and the impact of currency translation. For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. 
As you can see, in aggregate, adjusted EPS increased $0.17 compared with the prior year, increasing from $0.78 to $0.95 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, growth in adjusted EBIT, mostly from the gross margin expansion, contributed $0.23 to EPS growth. The impact from share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program reduced our shared count and added $0.01. Going the other way, net interest expense increased $3 million, about $0.01 per share as we extended the maturity on the debt portfolio. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 34.1%, up 2.2 points versus the prior year, primarily due to our geographic mix and higher U.S. state taxes in 2016, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.03. Currency had a $0.03 negative impact on EPS in the quarter, completing the bridge to $0.95 per share. 
Beginning in 2016, we are aligning our reporting segments with our new division structure. We are now reporting our results in 3 segments: Americas Simple Meals and Beverages; Global Biscuits and Snacks; and Campbell Fresh. In connection with our change in benefit accounting, we have modified our method of allocating pension and postretirement benefit cost to the segments. In 2016, only the service costs, representing the value of the retirement benefit earned in the period, is allocated to segments. The other elements of expense, including interest cost on the liability, expected return on assets and actuarial gains and losses, are reflected in unallocated corporate expense. 
As previously mentioned, we will identify the mark-to-market adjustments as an item impacting comparability and exclude them from our adjusted results. We have adjusted our historical results to reflect these changes with fiscal 2015 sales, operating earnings and margin by segment shown on this chart. 
Immediately following the filing of our first quarter 10-Q, we will also provide recasted historical annual and quarterly results, including quarterly results for our segments, reflecting the benefit accounting changes. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales decreased 1% to $1.3 billion. U.S. Soup sales decreased 3%, reflecting declines in ready-to-serve soups and broth, partly offset by gains in condensed soup. Impacted by our list price actions and changes to our promotional programs, soup volumes, as expected, were negatively impacted. Sales of U.S. beverages declined slightly, primarily due to declines in V8 V-Fusion beverages, partly offset by gains in V8 Splash. 
Sales of other U.S. Simple Meals increased, driven by Prego pasta sauces, Campbell's Dinner Sauces and our new Prego and Pace ready meals. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation, sales in Canada increased, driven by gains in soup. Operating earnings increased 19%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage, which benefited from net price realization and improved supply chain performance, particularly in the areas of transportation and warehousing, and also from lower marketing and selling expenses. 
Our advertising expenditures were down in the quarter as we've shifted the timing of our activity to later in the fiscal year. Within U.S. Soup, the 3% sales decline was driven by a 10% decline in ready-to-serve soup and a 9% decline in Swanson broth, offset by a 2% gain on condensed. Sales of our fresh-brewed soups for Keurig, which are now part of the wet soup category, contributed 50 basis points of growth to total U.S. Soup in the quarter. We began and ended the quarter with retail inventories in aggregate comparable to year ago levels. 
With the formation of the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment and our efforts to diversify the portfolio beyond soup, we do not believe subcategory sales performance in soup is as meaningful a disclosure. We will continue to provide this information for the balance of the year before discontinuing in fiscal 2017. 
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending November 1, 2015, the category as a whole declined 1.3%. Our sales in measured channels declined 1.7% with weakness in ready-to-serve and condensed soups, partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share, a decline of 20 basis points. Private label grew share by 20 basis points finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28%, unchanged versus the prior year. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 2% with growth in Pepperidge Farm and the Asia Pacific region. Sales gains in Pepperidge Farm were driven by Goldfish crackers, fresh bakery and frozen products, partly offset by a decline in cookies. In the Asia Pacific region, excluding the impact of currency translation, growth in Australia biscuits from savory and sweet varieties were offset by declines in Indonesia biscuits as that market is facing some economic challenges. Operating earnings increased 16% primarily driven by a higher gross margin percentage, volume gains and lower selling expenses, partly offset by the negative impact of currency translation. 
In the Campbell's Fresh segment, consistent with our expectations, organic sales decreased 3% due to anticipated declines in carrot ingredient export sales and category declines in retail carrots, partly offset by mid-single-digit sales growth in Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings. Not included in organic results is our recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet, which contributed 11 points of sales growth to the segment. Including the acquisition, the integration of which is going well, reported segment sales increased by 8%. Operating earnings doubled to $18 million driven by a higher gross margin percentage and the impact of acquiring Garden Fresh Gourmet. The improvement in gross margin reflects lower carrot costs and the favorable mix impact of the growth in the higher-margin beverages and salad dressing business relative to the balance of the segment. 
We had strong cash flow performance in the first quarter. Cash from operations increased by $30 million to $218 million driven by higher cash earnings. Capital expenditures increased $9 million to $71 million. We paid dividends totaling $100 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. 
In aggregate, we repurchased $32 million of shares in the first quarter, $25 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. 
Net debt was equal to the prior year at $3.8 billion as positive net cash flow generated by the business offset the impact of the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. 
Now I'll review our revised 2016 guidance. We are now forecasting lower-than-anticipated cost inflation and cost savings in excess of our previous target. Compared to our previous cost inflation outlook of 2% to 3%, we now expect inflation and cost of products sold to be approximately 2% and for our gross margin to increase by approximately 1 percentage point. 
Compared to our previous incremental cost savings goal of $60 million, we now expect to deliver savings in the range of $80 million to $100 million in fiscal 2016. Our cumulative cost savings target of $250 million through fiscal 2018 remains unchanged. 
Going in the other direction, we are experiencing some headwinds on the tax line and now expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 32%. And as I mentioned earlier, we also expect the negative impact of currency translation to increase to 3 points as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen. This revised earnings guidance reflects additional investments in innovation as well as our current expectations for the performance of our business for the remainder of 2016. 
Relative to our previous growth rates, we are increasing adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS growth by 2 to 3 points on a currency-neutral basis with an offset to sales, EBIT and EPS of 1 point due to the increased negative impact of currency translation. 
From the recasted 2015 base and including a 3-point negative impact from currency, we now expect sales to change from minus 1% to 0%, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS to both increase 4% to 7%. The guidance also includes the impact of the Garden Fresh acquisition, which adds 1 point to both sales and adjusted EBIT. 
Given that there have been significant changes to our guidance, including the impact of the change in benefit accounting, we thought it would be helpful and this is an instance to bridge our EPS guidance in September to the revised guidance we issued today. Starting with the original guidance of $2.53 to $2.58, we've added $0.19 for the benefit accounting change and deducted the incremental currency translation headwind, which is worth $0.03 per share. With the upside from lower-than-anticipated inflation and incremental cost savings, we have taken the opportunity to fund additional investments and longer-term innovation. The improved operating performance, net of the additional investments is adding $0.06 to $0.09 to the guidance. Relative to our first quarter EPS growth, keep in mind that about half the Q1 EPS growth comes from marketing timing, which we anticipate will be spent back in the year-to-go period. 
That concludes my remarks. And now, I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A."

So half the business is the CPG side, which is the beverages and salad dressing; the other half is the farms business, which includes the carrot business and the ingredient export business. The margin structure within Campbell Fresh is very diverse, so the CPG businesses carry a much higher margin than the carrots and natural ingredients business. And in fact, that's where all the growth is. So even within the quarter, we see gross margin expansion within Campbell Fresh because of the higher growth on the higher-margin beverages and salad dressings. So to think about the algorithm, you need to think about not just the Campbell Fresh margin, but the faster growing CPG margin within that. The other thing that has -- that happens to Campbell Fresh because of the Bolthouse acquisition, it carries a pretty high load of depreciation and amortization. The EBIT dollar margin is about 2x the operating margin you see on the chart, so that's another thing to keep in mind. But we think the algorithm works."

And when you shift to digital, you're spending a lot of time and expense on content, but TV is just a different dynamic.

The fact that promotions have been shifted to later in the year and the fact that advertising started later in October. The consumption was down in line with our expectations. I would say to you that RTS is a bit worse, condensed a bit better and broth was pretty flat, but the category was down 4%. And although I'm not a weather person, I do think that, that was a factor. But I believe that all these other dynamics going on were equal factors to that one. And then of course, our Fresh fruit soup is not captured in our consumption; that's in dry soup. Inventories were comparable. We saw little bit of a difference in broth because we carry some extra inventory into the year as we transition to a new screw cap on the aseptic broth. We still expect soup to grow modestly, and that's basically how we're looking at it."

And we're trying to find win-win solutions for ourselves and our customers with our trade programs. So that's basically where we are right now, and we will definitely keep a close eye on it."

Please refer to Slide 2 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. 
As we said in this morning's news release, in fiscal 2016, the company incurred mark-to-market losses associated with the interim remeasurement of certain U.S. pension plans. The impact on EPS was $0.26 per share. The company also incurred restructuring charges, implementation cost and other related costs associated with the new organizational structure and cost-savings initiatives. 
The impact on EPS was $0.07 per share. Our comparisons of fiscal 2016 with fiscal 2015 will exclude these items for comparability. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today, I'll share my perspective on the overall operating environment, the changes we've implemented at Campbell and our first quarter business performance. 
The seismic shifts that we've outlined in previous meetings continue to impact the food industry, which remains under pressure from new global economic realities, major demographic shifts, changing consumer preferences for food with an emphasis on health and well-being and the continued growth of Digital Marketing and e-commerce channels. 
Looking at the operating environment, conditions remain challenging. In the United States, the economic situation is mixed. Unemployment continues to improve, but consumers remain very cautious. We're continuing to see Americans save more and spend less amid the uncertain economic climate. Outside the U.S., we're seeing macroeconomic challenges in other markets where we have significant operations, including Canada, China and Indonesia. 
Generating growth in this environment has been and remains difficult. As a result, the industry continues to respond with consolidation, spin-offs, aggressive cost-cutting programs and other measures to improve operational efficiency. Meanwhile, food retailers continue to respond by reconfiguring existing stores with a focus on the perimeter by launching new, smaller formats and by investing heavily in e-commerce capabilities. 
Several years ago, we recognized the early signs of many of the trends that the industry is currently facing, and we started taking steps designed to best enable Campbell to navigate the changing landscape. While we've made progress through fiscal 2015, our actions haven't been sufficient. That's why, last year, we put a bolder plan in place to reshape Campbell. We began fiscal 2016 after successfully implementing significant changes to align our enterprise structure with our strategy. We formed 3 new divisions with clear portfolio roles. We began implementing a 3-year, $250 million cost-savings initiative that is delivering earlier-than-expected benefits. We created a new, Integrated Global Services organization to provide services to our divisions more efficiently and effectively. We initiated the first phase of zero-based budgeting to instill greater cost discipline and create an ownership mindset among employees. We added another growth engine in Garden Fresh Gourmet to bolster our Campbell Fresh division and extend our presence and scale beyond produce into the deli section of the store perimeter. 
As a result of these actions, we entered fiscal 2016, better positioned to execute against our strategic imperatives. With that as context, let me turn to our first quarter results. 
I'm pleased with our overall performance to start the year. Organic sales in the quarter were comparable to a year ago and consistent with our expectations, given that we're cycling an increase of 5%. I'm particularly pleased with our third consecutive quarter of adjusted gross margin expansion and the improvements we've made in our supply chain. Importantly, we delivered strong adjusted EBIT and EPS performance. 
As you saw this morning, we revised our annual guidance. Given our improved margin outlook for the year, we raised guidance for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS, while we lowered sales guidance to reflect increased currency headwinds. 
Our new reportable segments align with our 3 new divisions. Anthony will discuss our revised guidance and provide a detailed review of our segment results in a moment. But I wanted to offer my perspective on several notable items within each of our 3 new divisions. 
Let's start with our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. As a reminder, we're managing this division for moderate growth, consistent with the categories in which we operate and for margin expansion. As we've discussed with you before, we're focused on increasing price realization, optimizing promotional spending and improving our supply chain performance. While we have more work to do in its early days, I'm encouraged by the progress the Americas team has made on all 3 fronts. As a result of our pricing and lower promotion activity, soup volumes declined as expected. Consumption was soft in the quarter, but this is not surprising due to the fact that our promotional activity and new advertising campaign started later in the quarter versus prior year. 
In early October, we began airing our new made for rear real-life advertising. Built around the strategic insights we've shared with you about the changing mosaic of the American family, this campaign represents a major departure for Campbell and depicts how our real food fits into real people's lives in an authentic and relatable way. Digital media is playing a larger role in this campaign than in previous efforts. Looking ahead, we expect improved sales performance in the second quarter as our marketing spending increases and the campaign gains momentum. 
As we talked about in July, we're focused on fewer, bigger innovations in the Americas division. While our new Swanson bottle broth is off to a slower start than anticipated, both Campbell's Fresh-Brewed Soups in K-Cups and Campbell's Organic soups are meeting expectations. The highlight in this division was the significant gross margin expansion. A major improvement this quarter was our supply chain performance as evidenced by better customer service levels. We're cycling significant supply chain challenges, especially transportation and warehousing. We're also benefiting from the mild inflationary environment this quarter. 
That said, the supply chain team has driven results ahead of expectations. Overall, the new Americas Simple Meals and Beverage division is off to a promising start in delivering against its portfolio role. 
Our Global Biscuits and Snacks division unifies our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott’s and Kelsen businesses and its portfolio role is to expand in developed and developing markets while improving markets -- margins. This division too is off to a promising start in fulfilling its portfolio role with organic sales growth, improved gross margins and strong earnings. I'm especially encouraged by our sales performance in our core markets, the U.S. and Australia. In U.S. biscuits and bakery, our Pepperidge Farm brands performed very well, driven by strong growth in crackers and fresh bakery, partly offset by declines in cookies. Our Goldfish business had a particularly strong quarter with double-digit sales growth. 
Turning to developing markets. We drove organic sales growth in Malaysia, but we're continuing to keep a close eye on Indonesia where the challenging economic conditions we outlined in September continue to impact our business. As we stated at that time, we believe it's important for Campbell to become more geographically diverse despite short-term economic pressure in developing markets. 
Our third division is Campbell's Fresh, which includes Bolthouse Farms, Garden Fresh Gourmet and our refrigerated soup business. Here, we're focused on accelerating sales growth and expanding into new packaged fresh CPG categories. Reported segment sales increased 8% in the quarter, excluding the impact of Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, sales declined 3%. Let's take a closer look at what drove the decline. In Bolthouse Farms, we delivered mid-single-digit sales growth in the CPG business behind premium beverages and refrigerated salad dressings as we cycled double-digit growth in the prior year. However, these gains were more than offset by declines in our farms business, which includes our fresh retail carrots business, where we're the market leader, and our ingredients business. 
Sales were down in carrots, although we grew share. As a reminder, carrots are an important business in that they provide both scale and produce and an effective refrigerated logistics system for our CPG business. The main culprit of the sales decline was the ingredients business. As we discussed at our Investor Day in July, the carrot concentrate business began softening last year due to weak demand in Japan. That softness accelerated in the first quarter. 
We expect the rate of decline in ingredients to moderate potentially in the back half of the year. While this is not the growth profile we expect from this division, we remain enthusiastic about C-Fresh and especially the CPG business. We have compelling brands, delicious products, a steady stream of on-trend innovation, investments to expand juice and salad dressing capacity and a strong team leading the business. We expect sales in our Packaged Fresh CPG business to accelerate as the year progresses driven by the continued expansion of 1915, our cold-pressed ultra-premium juice line, and the strong spring innovation suite for super premium beverages and salad dressings. 
Now a word on Garden Fresh Gourmet. The integration into C-Fresh is on track and there have been no major surprises. As we outlined in July at our Investor Day meeting, we're focused on driving distribution and increasing market penetration beyond its Midwest stronghold. 
Before wrapping up, I want to spend a moment on our cost savings initiative. We remain focused on transforming our cost structure and creating an ownership mindset where employees treat every dollar as if it were their own. Our streamlined organization, our ZBB efforts and our Integrated Global Services Organization are all having a positive impact on both our cost and our culture. I'm very pleased with our progress in all these areas, particularly in IGS.  This group is key to driving cost savings and building new capabilities. But IGS is about more than efficiency and effectiveness. Beyond the cost savings and capability building underway, IGS is helping to spur significant cultural change by fundamentally altering the way work is performed at Campbell. 
Looking at our 3 new divisions and IGS, it's still early days, and we have more work ahead of us to fully unlock the potential of our redesigned enterprise structure, but we're off to a solid start. Today, we're better positioned to execute against the 4 strategic imperatives we outlined in July. 
First, we're leveraging our purpose, real food that matters for life's moments as a filter for strategic decisions. For example, we've made recipe changes to several of our core North America products, and we continue to engage consumers in open dialogue about the ingredients we use and the rationale behind our decisions as we strive to set the standard for transparency in the food industry. Second, we're shifting more of our marketing budget to digital channels and remain committed to growing our e-commerce capabilities. Third, we're advancing our health and well-being imperative across our company. Our new 1915 ultra premium juices are meeting our expectations and we've had other recent successes, including Campbell Organic soups and the distribution of carrot snacks into the New York City school lunch program. And finally, we remain focused on expanding and developing markets, particularly in Southeast Asia with an emphasis on Malaysia and Indonesia. In China, we've added resources to expand Kelsen in anticipation of a positive Chinese New Year. 
In summary, these are unprecedented times of change marked by challenging economic conditions. In the food world, consolidation and intensified competition are disrupting and altering the landscape. At Campbell, we remain clear eyed about our challenges, focused on the consumer, responsive to our customers and dedicated to delivering against our purpose. I'm confident the actions we're taking will set Campbell apart from other food companies and strengthen our growth trajectory over time. 
I look forward to answering your questions. But now, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro."

Before reviewing our results and updated guidance, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter and outlook for the balance of the year. As Denise mentioned, organic sales were in line with our expectations after lapping a solid, year-ago quarter. 
We made good progress on gross margin, which increased 260 basis points on an adjusted basis, benefiting from net price realization and supply chain performance while cost inflation moderated. I'm very pleased with the progress we're making against our cost reduction initiatives, delivering $30 million of savings in the first quarter, ahead of our expectations, and as I'll share later, allowing us to raise our 2016 savings target. Our improved outlook for cost inflation and additional cost savings will enable us to both fund investments in longer-term innovation and raise our full year guidance for adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS. And since we last updated you, we are experiencing an additional 1 point of headwind from currency translation across the P&L as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen. Lastly, as we indicated on our fourth quarter call, we have changed our reporting segments to align with our 3 new divisions and changed our method of accounting for pension and postretirement benefits, both of which I will cover in my comments. 
I'll begin with the benefit accounting change and then discuss our results and updated guidance. To provide greater transparency into our financial results, we are changing our method of accounting for pension and postretirement benefits. Previously, actuarial gains and losses were deferred and amortized into earnings over several years. In our case, we have been amortizing significant actuarial losses, which arose over time primarily from declining interest rates. Under the new mark-to-market method, which has been applied to all prior periods, actuarial gains and losses will be recognized immediately into earnings rather than amortized. We will identify the mark-to-market adjustment as an item impacting comparability and excluded from our adjusted results. 
Mark-to-market adjustments are recognized on remeasurement dates, typically year-end. What's shown on this chart is the impact on our fiscal 2015 full year and first quarter adjusted results from removing the actuarial loss amortization, recasting our full year 2015 results increased since adjusted gross margin by 70 basis points, adjusted EBIT by $97 million and adjusted EPS by $0.19. 
For the first quarter of 2015, the impact is an increase of 60 basis points on gross margin, $21 million of EBIT or $0.04 per share. It is important to note that the benefit accounting change has no impact on cash flow. 
In the presentation of our first quarter 2016 results and guidance, all comparisons to 2015 are against this recasted 2015 adjusted base. Unrelated to the change in benefit accounting method I just described, we are required to remeasure certain U.S. pension plans quarterly during 2016 as a result of a program, in which we offered and paid lump sums to plan participants no longer with the company. This remeasurement led to a mark-to-market loss of $0.26 per share in the first quarter. 
For the first quarter, net sales on an as-reported basis declined 2% to $2.2 billion, primarily due to the negative impact of currency translation. Excluding currency and the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition, organic net sales were comparable to the prior year as net price realization from both higher list prices and lower promotional spending was offset by lower volumes. Reflecting a 440 basis point increase in margin, adjusted EBIT increased 23% to $479 million, benefiting from a higher gross margin percentage, savings from our cost reduction initiatives and lower advertising, reflecting a shift in spending to later in the year. These positive drivers were partly offset by currency translation, which had a 4-point negative impact on EBIT, the equivalent of $0.03 per share. Adjusted EPS increased 22% to $0.95.  Just to be clear, EPS growth on an adjusted basis is not impacted by the accounting change, but reflects improved operating performance of the business. Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter. Reported net sales declined 2% with organic sales comparable to the prior year. Within organic sales, volume and mix attracted 2 points, which was primarily driven by U.S. Soup within Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and the carrot ingredients business within Campbell Fresh. 
Higher selling prices in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages contributed 1 point, reflecting our pricing actions on condensed soup, Prego pasta sauce and Foodservice in the U.S. and across the Canadian portfolio. Lower promotional spending in Global Biscuits and Snacks also added 1 point to sales growth. Currency translation had an adverse impact of 3 points on the top line. Our 2 primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, both declined against the U.S. dollar. 
To complete the bridge, our most recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet, contributed 1 point to net sales in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased by 260 basis points to 37.9%, exceeding our expectations on lower-than-anticipated cost inflation and improved supply chain performance. 
Within inflation and other, which negatively impacted margin by 20 basis points, cost inflation of approximately 1% was mostly offset by improved supply chain performance, primarily in the areas of transportation and warehousing. Mix was slightly negative, reflecting a small negative impact from the acquisition. 
In aggregate, our price realization actions contributed 1.3 points of margin expansion with 40 basis points from reduced promotional spending, principally trade reductions in Pepperidge Farm and U.S. Soup and 90 basis points from higher selling prices. 
Lastly, we're off to a strong start on our supply chain productivity programs, which contributed 160 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. Excluding items impacting comparability, marketing and selling expenses declined 15% in the quarter, primarily due to lower advertising spending, savings from our cost reduction initiatives and the impact of currency translation. The decline in advertising reflects the shift and the timing of our spending principally in U.S. Soup to later in the year. 
Adjusted administrative expenses decreased 8%, primarily due to savings from our cost reduction program and the impact of currency translation. For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS change between our operating performance and below-the-line items. 
As you can see, in aggregate, adjusted EPS increased $0.17 compared with the prior year, increasing from $0.78 to $0.95 per share. On a currency-neutral basis, growth in adjusted EBIT, mostly from the gross margin expansion, contributed $0.23 to EPS growth. The impact from share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program reduced our shared count and added $0.01. Going the other way, net interest expense increased $3 million, about $0.01 per share as we extended the maturity on the debt portfolio. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 34.1%, up 2.2 points versus the prior year, primarily due to our geographic mix and higher U.S. state taxes in 2016, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.03. Currency had a $0.03 negative impact on EPS in the quarter, completing the bridge to $0.95 per share. 
Beginning in 2016, we are aligning our reporting segments with our new division structure. We are now reporting our results in 3 segments: Americas Simple Meals and Beverages; Global Biscuits and Snacks; and Campbell Fresh. In connection with our change in benefit accounting, we have modified our method of allocating pension and postretirement benefit cost to the segments. In 2016, only the service costs, representing the value of the retirement benefit earned in the period, is allocated to segments. The other elements of expense, including interest cost on the liability, expected return on assets and actuarial gains and losses, are reflected in unallocated corporate expense. 
As previously mentioned, we will identify the mark-to-market adjustments as an item impacting comparability and exclude them from our adjusted results. We have adjusted our historical results to reflect these changes with fiscal 2015 sales, operating earnings and margin by segment shown on this chart. 
Immediately following the filing of our first quarter 10-Q, we will also provide recasted historical annual and quarterly results, including quarterly results for our segments, reflecting the benefit accounting changes. 
Now turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales decreased 1% to $1.3 billion. U.S. Soup sales decreased 3%, reflecting declines in ready-to-serve soups and broth, partly offset by gains in condensed soup. Impacted by our list price actions and changes to our promotional programs, soup volumes, as expected, were negatively impacted. Sales of U.S. beverages declined slightly, primarily due to declines in V8 V-Fusion beverages, partly offset by gains in V8 Splash. 
Sales of other U.S. Simple Meals increased, driven by Prego pasta sauces, Campbell's Dinner Sauces and our new Prego and Pace ready meals. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation, sales in Canada increased, driven by gains in soup. Operating earnings increased 19%, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage, which benefited from net price realization and improved supply chain performance, particularly in the areas of transportation and warehousing, and also from lower marketing and selling expenses. 
Our advertising expenditures were down in the quarter as we've shifted the timing of our activity to later in the fiscal year. Within U.S. Soup, the 3% sales decline was driven by a 10% decline in ready-to-serve soup and a 9% decline in Swanson broth, offset by a 2% gain on condensed. Sales of our fresh-brewed soups for Keurig, which are now part of the wet soup category, contributed 50 basis points of growth to total U.S. Soup in the quarter. We began and ended the quarter with retail inventories in aggregate comparable to year ago levels. 
With the formation of the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment and our efforts to diversify the portfolio beyond soup, we do not believe subcategory sales performance in soup is as meaningful a disclosure. We will continue to provide this information for the balance of the year before discontinuing in fiscal 2017. 
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending November 1, 2015, the category as a whole declined 1.3%. Our sales in measured channels declined 1.7% with weakness in ready-to-serve and condensed soups, partly offset by strength in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share, a decline of 20 basis points. Private label grew share by 20 basis points finishing at 13%. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28%, unchanged versus the prior year. 
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales increased 2% with growth in Pepperidge Farm and the Asia Pacific region. Sales gains in Pepperidge Farm were driven by Goldfish crackers, fresh bakery and frozen products, partly offset by a decline in cookies. In the Asia Pacific region, excluding the impact of currency translation, growth in Australia biscuits from savory and sweet varieties were offset by declines in Indonesia biscuits as that market is facing some economic challenges. Operating earnings increased 16% primarily driven by a higher gross margin percentage, volume gains and lower selling expenses, partly offset by the negative impact of currency translation. 
In the Campbell's Fresh segment, consistent with our expectations, organic sales decreased 3% due to anticipated declines in carrot ingredient export sales and category declines in retail carrots, partly offset by mid-single-digit sales growth in Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings. Not included in organic results is our recent acquisition, Garden Fresh Gourmet, which contributed 11 points of sales growth to the segment. Including the acquisition, the integration of which is going well, reported segment sales increased by 8%. Operating earnings doubled to $18 million driven by a higher gross margin percentage and the impact of acquiring Garden Fresh Gourmet. The improvement in gross margin reflects lower carrot costs and the favorable mix impact of the growth in the higher-margin beverages and salad dressing business relative to the balance of the segment. 
We had strong cash flow performance in the first quarter. Cash from operations increased by $30 million to $218 million driven by higher cash earnings. Capital expenditures increased $9 million to $71 million. We paid dividends totaling $100 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 per share. 
In aggregate, we repurchased $32 million of shares in the first quarter, $25 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. 
Net debt was equal to the prior year at $3.8 billion as positive net cash flow generated by the business offset the impact of the $232 million acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. 
Now I'll review our revised 2016 guidance. We are now forecasting lower-than-anticipated cost inflation and cost savings in excess of our previous target. Compared to our previous cost inflation outlook of 2% to 3%, we now expect inflation and cost of products sold to be approximately 2% and for our gross margin to increase by approximately 1 percentage point. 
Compared to our previous incremental cost savings goal of $60 million, we now expect to deliver savings in the range of $80 million to $100 million in fiscal 2016. Our cumulative cost savings target of $250 million through fiscal 2018 remains unchanged. 
Going in the other direction, we are experiencing some headwinds on the tax line and now expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 32%. And as I mentioned earlier, we also expect the negative impact of currency translation to increase to 3 points as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen. This revised earnings guidance reflects additional investments in innovation as well as our current expectations for the performance of our business for the remainder of 2016. 
Relative to our previous growth rates, we are increasing adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS growth by 2 to 3 points on a currency-neutral basis with an offset to sales, EBIT and EPS of 1 point due to the increased negative impact of currency translation. 
From the recasted 2015 base and including a 3-point negative impact from currency, we now expect sales to change from minus 1% to 0%, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS to both increase 4% to 7%. The guidance also includes the impact of the Garden Fresh acquisition, which adds 1 point to both sales and adjusted EBIT. 
Given that there have been significant changes to our guidance, including the impact of the change in benefit accounting, we thought it would be helpful and this is an instance to bridge our EPS guidance in September to the revised guidance we issued today. Starting with the original guidance of $2.53 to $2.58, we've added $0.19 for the benefit accounting change and deducted the incremental currency translation headwind, which is worth $0.03 per share. With the upside from lower-than-anticipated inflation and incremental cost savings, we have taken the opportunity to fund additional investments and longer-term innovation. The improved operating performance, net of the additional investments is adding $0.06 to $0.09 to the guidance. Relative to our first quarter EPS growth, keep in mind that about half the Q1 EPS growth comes from marketing timing, which we anticipate will be spent back in the year-to-go period. 
That concludes my remarks. And now, I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A."

So half the business is the CPG side, which is the beverages and salad dressing; the other half is the farms business, which includes the carrot business and the ingredient export business. The margin structure within Campbell Fresh is very diverse, so the CPG businesses carry a much higher margin than the carrots and natural ingredients business. And in fact, that's where all the growth is. So even within the quarter, we see gross margin expansion within Campbell Fresh because of the higher growth on the higher-margin beverages and salad dressings. So to think about the algorithm, you need to think about not just the Campbell Fresh margin, but the faster growing CPG margin within that. The other thing that has -- that happens to Campbell Fresh because of the Bolthouse acquisition, it carries a pretty high load of depreciation and amortization. The EBIT dollar margin is about 2x the operating margin you see on the chart, so that's another thing to keep in mind. But we think the algorithm works."

But I believe that all these other dynamics going on were equal factors to that one. And then of course, our Fresh fruit soup is not captured in our consumption; that's in dry soup. Inventories were comparable. We saw little bit of a difference in broth because we carry some extra inventory into the year as we transition to a new screw cap on the aseptic broth. We still expect soup to grow modestly, and that's basically how we're looking at it."

The second quarter comp is not too difficult, but it will start to lap some of the gross margin gains we had last year in the back half. So all those things taken together would dampen that growth in the year-to-go period."

But I also thought I heard reference to actually increasing those flush funds to mitigate some of the price increases you had going forward. So, a, is that right? That you are going to ramp more trade to deal back some of the price increases? B, do you concur with the broader observation that there seems to be a big opportunity to pull some of those inefficient dollars out? And then, c, what's the obstacle?
