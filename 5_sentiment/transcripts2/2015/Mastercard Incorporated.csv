6477196,281088409,752400,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2015",2015-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. I'm very pleased that we were able to deliver strong results of both our fourth quarter and the full year performance despite what everybody knows as a mixed economic environment. In the fourth quarter, after a",2003,"Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. I'm very pleased that we were able to deliver strong results of both our fourth quarter and the full year performance despite what everybody knows as a mixed economic environment. In the fourth quarter, after adjusting for currency, we had net revenue growth of 17% and EPS growth of 25%, driven by solid underlying metrics. For the full year, we saw net revenue growth of 14% and EPS growth of 19%. Both EPS growth figures exclude the impact of last year's special item for the charge related to the U.S. merchant litigation.
So in total, we have a good year where we were able to continue to meaningfully invest in growth initiatives that I think will position us very well for the future. And those initiatives and triggered actions resulting in a restructuring charge in this past year's fourth quarter, which Martina is going to go through in some detail later.
So moving on to look at the some of the current underlying global economic trends. Let's start with the United States, which is in relatively decent shape. Our SpendingPulse data showed U.S. retail sales growth, x auto, was 2.9% in the fourth quarter, but that's down from the third quarter growth of 4.2%. And most of that deceleration is due to lower gas prices. By excluding auto and gas, retail sales growth of [ph] 4.1% for the fourth quarter versus 4.80% for the third quarter, showing just a modest deceleration in spending.
And even though 4% growth is nothing to [indiscernible] at, we haven't yet seen the extra savings from lowered gas prices translate into additional discretionary consumer spending. So while overall retail spending grew softer in the quarter, underlying economic indicators that remain positive with unemployment levels and consumer sentiment both showing some improvement. 
Looking at our own U.S. business, as we said for the past couple of quarters, the share deconversion is having an impact on our U.S. GDV growth rate, but if you take out, the underlying growth remains roughly the same over the course of 2014.
Outside of the U.S., Europe's recovery slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter. It still remains challenged and across the region, consumer confidence and economic sentiment decelerated slightly. And while unemployment levels are high, the event [indiscernible] was the prior quarter. But there were a few bright spots in the U.K. experienced good momentum in the quarter. SpendingPulse data for the U.K. is showing fourth quarter retail sales growth of 3.6%, up from 2.9% in the third quarter. 
Even in Spain, preliminary indicators are showing some early signs of recovery. MasterCard's total European volume growth for the fourth quarter was in the midteens and processed transaction growth in the lower 20s, both of which increased from the last quarter due in part to a number of our recent wins across several European markets.
Latin America. Number of indicators there that highlighted the sluggish economic performance across the region. And our fourth quarter SpendingPulse data for Brazil showed retail sales growth of just 0.9%, down from the 2.4% growth that Brazil saw in the third quarter. For the entire region, annual GDP growth is now expected to be around 1%, down slightly from earlier projections of 1.3%.
Mexico, however, is an exception. It continues to benefit from improving [indiscernible] the U.S. and actually undergoing a slow recovery. Our business in the region remains solid. Our fourth quarter GDV and processed transaction growth is in the midteens, about the same as the last quarter.
Across Asia Pacific. Overall business sentiment actually improved in the fourth quarter. Optimism from Indian companies following the recent elections has driven some of that, but is temporary by lingering concerns over the slowing economic growth in China. Consumer confidence across the region holding steady. Our business in the region continues to do well. GDV growth in the midteens. Process transactions growth in the mid-20s, about the same as the last quarter.
So overall, the economic environment hasn't changed much from last quarter. The U.S. tends to be in the better shape. Challenges remaining for continental Europe, for Brazil, parts of Asia. But despite all of this, you can see the strong fundamentals that our business has not changed.
So before we go to our business highlights, there's been some recent news about European regulatory matters and Russia, so let me touch on those a little bit first. And let me start with the proposed European legislation related to card payments.
The European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission have reached an agreement in December and we are awaiting for the formal adoption and publication of the final text. As expected, [indiscernible] that are now being established for consumer credit and consumer debit cards. Commercial cards are excluded. The regulation provides for the level playing field by imposing interchange caps on 3-party [ph] networks when they operate similarly to a 4-party network. There are some possible exceptions to this but overall, we are pleased with outcome in this part is an important one for us.
Also, a network will no longer be allowed to charge a co-value fee if it does not process the transaction. And finally, the regulation requires the functional rather than legal separation of team and processing functions and outcome [indiscernible] was to became clear that some form of separation will be required. We are working to bring this separation, the functional separation into our operations.
The next form of text is for the language of the agreement to be endorsed by parliament and by the member states. Our best estimates is [indiscernible] in the first half of 2015. Interchange caps have become effective 6 months after that. All of parts of legislation will apply to us starting 12 months after the endorsement. So that's probably sometime in 2016.
So a little bit about Russia. We've been working through the challenges of connecting to [indiscernible], which is the domestic processing switch of the Russian Central Bank in order to meet their late March 31 deadline. I'm going forward by the way. Nothing has changed in terms of being able to issue MasterCard-branded cards for use in the Russian market in terms of the financial impact to our business. Our best estimate is still something less than $50 million on an annualized basis. It will now hit our G&A line. The expense line has a data processing expense rather than the revenue line as previously shared. 
So moving on to some of our recent business activity. We've expanded the relationships, the couple of our large global customers and that's great news. We renewed our multiyear global partnership with Bank of America that will expand share opportunity for us both domestically and outside of the U.S. and primarily on commercial side.
We recently won new business with HSBC, which should all converting to the remainder of our U.S. consumer credit portfolio to MasterCard in the first half of this year.
In the Middle East and Africa, we find a number of new business agreements in the quarter. That should help us increase our credit, debit, commercial and prepaid businesses in countries such as Nigeria, Tanzania, Rowanda, Jordan, Kuwait and the UAE over the course of 2015. And we will build with a strong momentum that we've developed in the region. Over the last 2 years, we signed close to 100 new business agreements that now will [indiscernible] footprint in 30 of Africa's 35 markets.
We feel strongly about activities that take our services to people who were previously excluded from access to the financial system. In Africa, close to 95% of the region's transaction are [indiscernible] in cash. 80% of adults don't have access to a bank account. And working around on their whole aspect and reflecting our commitment towards going in Africa, we've also launched a number of financial inclusion in this [indiscernible]. 
Today, I will pick on 2 of those. First, last week, we announced the start of a collaboration with the African Development Bank to broaden access to financial services. We're going to do that in partnership with local governments in Africa and private sector companies. We have the experties to design and to scale financial solutions. And the African Development Bank is a major source of funding for the economic development of its if 34 [ph] member countries.
So we believe together we can help drive financial execution and economic development across Africa over the next 2 years.
Secondly, last September, in partnership with the [indiscernible] Foundation, we announced that we will be opening a MasterCard lab for financial inclusion in Kenya. This is our seventh global innovation, but it's the first that we have in Africa. It's also the first to receive outside funding.
The last will be dedicated specifically to creating and incubating programs that are targeted to more than 100 million people in this part of the world who are financially included or underserved.
Our efforts on innovation, by the way, are not limited to 1 region like [indiscernible] Africa but only to labs. We're also opening up our technology to external developers. Something we've been trying to do for a while now. The most recent example is the 10-city [indiscernible] competition that starts next month in Sydney in Australia and go on Hong Kong, Singapore, Israel, Brazil, Canada, the U.K. and the United States. In this competition, which is already being planned to some of most of these -- beyond these will bring together developers and entrepreneurs using MasterCard APIs to create a new generation of commerce applications that leverages our platforms, our product capabilities such as the information for the business of Mastercards and our prepared, our loyalty and our product solutions.
In the meanwhile, we're continuing the global expansion of MasterPass. Since it's introduction in the spring of 2013, we now have the platform launched in 16 countries. And just recently, signed on a number of new merchants, Neimann Marcus, Office Depot, Blue Nile, Broadway.com, just some new names in the merchant list. We're also creating some new and [indiscernible] 20 [ph] partnerships. One example is the in France. Caliph was essentially followed by BNP Paribas [indiscernible] and Societe Generale, who by the way, mainly customers of 1 of our key competitors. And has chosen to partner with MasterPass because of what we believe is our global reach in handling all of that cross-border e-commerce transactions as well as some other domestic transactions, too.
With this partnership, up to 40 million people will have access to MasterPass acceptance with a pay linked to a card from their bank.
And so before I turn it over to Martina, I will quickly update you on 2 recent acquisitions. In December, we acquired the payment gateway services business of Transaction Network Services, TNS. And that deal gives us the ability to expand our payment gateway to the U.S. and Mexico and to position ourselves more competitively around the rest of the world where, as you know, we deal with cash and our original mixed platform we only have a presence. 
And so for example, in Asia Pacific and the Middle East/africa, we will add new capabilities: Tokenization, fraud management and we'll also be able to leverage where I think our highly skilled product and software teams that have now recently joined the company with this transaction.
Additionally, we acquired Five One Marketing Limited. That's a marketing, analytics and consulting firm and their plants are basically large retailers across many different consumer sectors. Five One has a proprietary software. They've used that to develop insights from a retailer's own data that can be used for marketing, for merchandising and for operational decisions. If you take that and you combine that kind of in-depth merchant understanding with our existing adviser's capability, that will then allow us to provide greater insight for retailers and the ability to expand our business opportunities with the merchant community.
So with that, Martina, for an update on financial results and operational metrics."
6477196,281088409,752400,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2015",2015-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. As Ajay already said, we're very pleased with our 2014 full year performance, which delivered net revenue growth of 14% and EPS growth of 19%. I'll now go to the details of our fourth quarter results.So let me b",2272,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. As Ajay already said, we're very pleased with our 2014 full year performance, which delivered net revenue growth of 14% and EPS growth of 19%. I'll now go to the details of our fourth quarter results.
So let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck and where you see that the difference between as reported and FX adjusted of growth rate for this quarter is more significant than it has been in recent past. This is primarily due to the hedged [indiscernible] from the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rates, especially with what we saw in the FX markets during the last 45 days of the quarter and this continuation into this quarter.
These figures also exclude the impact of the special item related to the U.S. merchant litigation taken in the fourth quarter of 2013.
I'd like to highlight 3 things right on the slide and then dive into the details of the major P&L line items in subsequent slides. So first, EPS growth was 25% after adjusting for currency and share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share.
During the fourth quarter, we have purchased 2.1 million shares at a cost of approximately $155 million. And through January 23, we will purchase an additional 2.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $213 million and we now have $3.8 billion remaining under the current authorization. We continue to look to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis.
Second, part of the EPS growth is the result of a very favorable tax rate of 20.3% in the quarter as some initiatives only came together within the last couple of months to better align our tax structure to our European business footprint between Belgium and the U.K. We took some of that benefit to reinvest that into the business, which I discussed on the operating expense slide. And third, cash flow from operations were $725 million. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and other liquid investments of about $6.4 billion.
So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Our worldwide growth star volume, or GDV, was up 13% on a local currency basis, up slightly from last quarter. Overall, our used GDV grew 8%, similar to last quarter. Credit growth was 7% and debit growth was 8%. Both the same as last quarter.
Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 13% [ph] on a local-currency basis and primarily driven by Europe.
Cross-border volume grew 19% on a local currency basis, higher than the 15% we saw in the third quarter, primarily driven by Europe. Growth in Europe was in the low 20s. Key contributors to this growth included the U.K., Italy, Germany and Sweden. All regions, except the U.S., saw an increase in cross-border volume growth in the fourth quarter.
Let me turn to Page 5. And here, you can see process transactions grew 11% globally to $11.6 billion. We continued to see double-digit growth in most regions. Growth increase from the 10% we saw in the third quarter primarily due to Europe, driven by Russia, Sweden, Poland and the Netherlands. Globally, the number of calls grew 9% with 2.1 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
So let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of our revenue line items. Overall net revenue growth was 14% as reported or 17% FX suggested due to currency headwinds, primarily from the euro exchange rate. Additionally, the impact of local currency exchanges through the [indiscernible] currency billing rate was a little more than 1 ppt. In total, acquisitions contributed 3 ppt to our net revenue growth. So after excluding the impact of both local exceptional currencies as well as the impact of acquisitions, we saw a very strong underlying growth of 15%.
Looking at the individual revenue line items on an FX adjusted basis. Domestic assessments grew 7% while worldwide GDV grew 13%. This 6 ppt gap [ph] is primarily due to the impact of local currency and lower-than-average revenue yields in some markets outside of the U.S. similar to prior quarters.
Cross-border volume fees grew 8% while cross-border volume grew 19%. Of the 11 ppt gap [ph], about 7 ppt is due to the impact of local currency. The remaining portion of this difference is mainly due to the higher mix of intra-European activity.
Transaction processing fees grew 13%, primarily driven by the 11% growth in processed transactions. This line item also benefited from additional revenues not driven by transaction count and some pricing partially offset by mix.
Other revenues grew 28%, driven largely by contributions from our Pinpoint acquisition as well as our Advisors business.
Moving on to Page 7. You can see the total operating expenses were up 26% in the quarter or 29% on an FX adjusted basis. Of this close, 9 ppt was due to expenses related to our acquisitions. The other big driver was the restructuring charge, which contributed 8 ppt to the growth. So let me focus on that a bit more.
So specifically, we took an $87 million restructuring charge to cover a series of actions. First, as you know, we have made a number of acquisitions in the processing space and we're now consolidating all of our processing assets under 1 organization that's driving significant synergies.
Second, we are realigning some roles within the company's business groups and redeploying resources geographically in order to invest in and enhance our capabilities in new product areas and technology such as digital and mobile. Overall, these actions would impact over 500 people but our total headcount will decline by a smaller amount given the reinvestment that I just mentioned.
The remaining OpEx growth of 12% was primarily driven by some opportunistic spent such as adding a spend around our autopay and price initiatives as well as continuing our digital investments such MasterPass and tokenization, similar to prior quarters.
Let me turn to Slide 8. And here, we discussed what we've seen in January through the 21st. Most of our business drivers are similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter after excluding the impact of lower gas prices, particularly in the U S. So the numbers through January 21 are as follows: Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 9%, down 2 ppt from the fourth quarter. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 3%, down 2 ppt from what we saw the last quarter, primarily driven by lower gas prices. Processed volume outside of the U.S. grew 16%, about 1 ppt lower than the fourth quarter with growth of mid- to high-teens in each region. process transaction growth was 11%, similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter with double-digit growth in all regions except the U.S., which grew in the low-single digits.
With respect to cross-border, our volume grew at 19% globally, the same as our fourth quarter growth. We continue to see growth in major European markets including the U.K., Italy and Sweden.
Looking ahead, let me start with some commentary about full year 2015. Given what's happening with currency rates and the impact being seen by U.S. multinationals across a number of industries, I'm going to start with that, especially since it was back in 2012, the MasterCard last faced such a big impact from FX. Remember that currency impact does it 2 ways. So first, we have the impact of local currency rates or [indiscernible] transaction currencies. And then with the FX exposure that [indiscernible] hedged by normally on a rolling 12 months basis that typically, as you know, we hedged about 50% to 75% of our total net exposure for about 30 currency pairs. And given that many currencies have depreciated against the U.S. dollar and the euro, new hedge contracts will come on at lower rates over the year. Thus, we continue to expect some net headwind throughout the year both to revenue and the bottom line. 
Based on currency rates -- based on the current rate, this is likely to be around 2 ppt, in the 2 ppt range and this is already included in our FX adjusted guidance.
Second, we have the impact of the translation of our major functional currencies, which are particularly euro and the Brazilian real into U.S. dollars to consolidate our financials. But we do not hedge those exposures. When we talk about FX adjusted growth rates, we are only adjusting for the impact of these 2 functional exchange rates. As the rates to our functional currencies remain similar to where they are today, so that's the euro trading at the 1 13 level and the Brazilian real at the 2 58 level for the rest of the year, the net impact of the euro and the real would be a 4 to 6 ppt [indiscernible] and has actually driven mostly from the euro to our as reported results for the full year. Depending on which line item we're talking about. Revenue, net income or EPS and I will get into that a little bit more.
With that backdrop, now let me get into some of the P&L line items. We expect high single digit net revenue growth for 2015 on an FX adjusted basis. And that will be before and after a roughly 2 ppt contribution from last year's M&A transactions. Our underlying business remained strong and we are seeing traction from many of our recent portfolio wins and new product initiative. However, this year's FX adjusted revenue growth will be impacted by some items specific to 2015. And that's including the remaining case portfolio attrition, largely impacting the first half of the year, as well as the local currency headwinds I just talked about.
Also included are a couple of expected significant contract renewals, some of which will likely have more front-loaded rebates and incentives than our typical agreements. But these renewals provide the foundation for future growth.
On an as reported basis, the net revenue growth rate will likely be in the mid-single-digit range sa a result of strong FX headwinds, primarily from the euro functional translation. Based on current FX rates, this will be about a 4 ppt to 5 ppt impacts.
Overall, we project the growth rate for total operating expense for full year 2015 to be in the high-single digits on an FX adjusted basis. This growth is predominantly due to a roughly 6 [ph] ppt impact from our previously announced acquisitions, with more of that impact occurring in the first half of the year. The as reported growth will likely be in the mid-single-digit range after considering a roughly 10 to 3 ppt range impact mostly again from the euro translation.
Let me give you an update on potential dilution from last year's acquisitions. Now that we've found a few more deals like TNS and Five beyond that Ajay just mentioned, we now expect total EPS dilution to be about $0.08 to $0.10 for the full year 2015 and a little less than half of the expected dilution is actually due to the amortization of acquired intangibles. You should now assume a full year 2015 tax rate of about 28%, due to the continued balance rate we expect from the cash initiatives I discuss earlier. So this is a sustainable tax benefit for future years.
Now then on the details that I just went through, let me step back and summarize for you. We expect solid fundamentals to drive our business in 2015 despite the mixed economic environment and significant headwinds from FX and gas prices. We continue to sign customer contracts and invest in the right strategic areas while managing our expenses prudently.
So finally, let me move onto our long-term performance objective for the 2013 to 2015 period.
Given our expectations for 2015 revenue growth, we now believe that we would deliver at the low-end of our 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR. We continue to expect at least 20% EPS CAGR for the 3-year period, due to continued expense management as well as benefits from our lower tax rate and share repurchases. We remain committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%. Remember, these objectives are at constant currency basis and exclude our 2014 M&A activities as well as any new ones that may occur this year.
As a reference point for your modeling, when looking at our performance on 2 -- from a 2-year CAGR perspective, so that's for 2013 and 2014, on a constant currency basis, we have delivered a net revenue CAGR of 12.5% and an EPS CAGR of 21.1%, which is based on the 2012 normalized EPS of $2.14 per share that we provided to you earlier.
Now many of you have asked when we will be rolling our performance objectives forward. As you can see, the underlying drivers of our business are in good shape and we are expanding our reach in areas that we're strategically targeting such as processing, royalty, information services and all things digital. The overall growth prospects for the payments industry have not changed. And for now we have given you some clarity around 2015 as this is the last year of our current 2013 to '15 performance period. Once we have worked to the many moving parts, including the impact of those resulting from the final European payment regulation and the new payment environment in Russia both from a revenue and an expense perspective, we will provide you with our new long-term objective before the end of this year.

As a big picture here, as we are trying to expand our presence in the payments value chain, not just from being in the clearing authorization and [indiscernible] business but everything [indiscernible] before doing and after the transaction. How can we expand our presence so we can be still here and we can, therefore, excite the value for the service of the offer and [indiscernible] with some new capabilities and hopefully gives us some space to become bigger leaders or better leaders in key growth areas. So what could those areas be? Data and analytics, which is the information services of ours. So Five One, for example, is right in that space. Processing, which is what they are doing with [indiscernible] and with ECS. And TNS also does fit in there, demand the keyholes businesses but overtime. So a lot of these things that all ignite to processing and why we're doing processing because the idea is to be able to see more of the transactions around the world. Because that allows me to use that knowledge in my data analytics business. So interconnected to that space. And then the third area is safety and security. So DataCash got us some great fraud management solutions. There are similar ones in some of these. The [indiscernible] JV could actually be very useful not just from moving money around the world but also for safety and security. And then loyalty, which is why Pinpoint came into it then. It is through assets some years ago. And so this is all in that daily wake of data and analytics, processing, safety, security and loyalty. And mostly, we transfigured out of this strategic fit how these companies giving us some critical capabilities. We didn't have our own technology, product, distribution, some geographic reach maybe. And do we have the right kind of risk profile and are we getting some talented skills we were not been able to get easily. So [indiscernible], for example, brought us a number of very highly qualified mobile payment technicians, hiring hundreds of them organically would be a very slow build. This give us the ability to get with it much quicker. Kind of a mix of those reasons and that's what they're trying to do."

So we put all that into context, you were part of fill through. But the way I think about it [indiscernible] we talked to so many other fields about this. I just feel that maybe it is -- that it's going to take 3 or 4 months for the U.S. consumer to feel that this is something that's going to be down for a little while. If you have longer-term perspective on the price of gas not going back to $100, but maybe settling at $75, $80, that's a real thinking. I don't think the U.S. consumer knows whether they expect this to be sticking around or not. So I think there's some degree of, let's say, the desire to see that through before they really start spending that kind of money. That kind of where I think this is.

Contactless is still relatively small in the U.S. Online browsing tends to be the large amount. A number of the merchants and retailers have been launching their own apps in an effort to get people to come straight to their and then hopefully control more of the transaction as well as the relationship with the consumer when they're inside their app as compared to having the usual way. So it depends who you believe but everybody is making projections based, well, whatever they think about where these 3 will go over the next 2 years. And my sense is you're going to get MSE going decently but internally with. And I believe terminalization will happen with all the EMV and chip migration as well as the fact there are new double that are coming contactless. So you're probably seeing a 2- or 3-year cycle of a fairly dramatic increase in contactless equipped terminals in the United States. That's only happening, by the way, in Australia and Canada, Turkey and some other countries. For the U.S., which is the large one, I think you'll see that. In terms of browsing, browsing tends to do a lot of chunk. And I still believe that online browsing will remain a pretty large number for 2 years to.

And I don't think you should read too much in to it quarter here or a quarter there. These things are slow burns. And you saw Apple Pay talk about their mobile payment growth. But at the end of the day, yes, they've done a great job and it's excited the market but it's still very small percentage of what the total number of transactions are. So I will take orders in that context and not [indiscernible] with more than that. We're very focused on tokenization effect. Just to make sure I don't miss that aspect, it's a very important aspect to where we're going for safety and security. Apple Pay was the first version to come out. We're bringing into MasterPass, just regular MasterPass, over the next few period of time, let me put it that way. So let me give you information that's beyond what is likely. And that will be -- you'll see in a year or 2 time, tokenization will become kind of table stakes in the games on e-commerce. So that's how we're going to go."

So I think you know that we're doing extra business and have it in 50-plus [ph] currencies but we really picked the most significant currency peers in order to do our hedging. In order to do hedging, you have to have really appropriate exposure forecast coming out over the next 12 months rolling period. And that is where you typically take a step back and take a little bit of a more conservative view and don't layer in 100% of the exposure in terms of hedges. You do 30% to 75%. So we don't take a view, but 50% to 75% is not taking a view in terms of hedging a particular currency pair, but it is in terms of making sure that between the old exposure that we know and the hedges that we lay on that we have the right kind of balance. The one other thing that I wanted to let you know is just to make sure we are hedging things on a net basis, which means we take revenues in that particular currencies and we deduct the operating expenses that we spend in that particular currency and then we do another hedge on that and you would not see the gain or the loss of the hedge showing up on the revenue line. Most of that is actually reflected in our G&A line item."

So when Martina talked to you about the 50% to 75%, you're probably looking at a higher-level hedge in the immediate quarter because you have most activity of that net exposure between those currency pairs that she just had for 2. You hedge a little less out 4 quarters because you had less activity in those currency pairs that she's referring to. Also remember, the euro and the real are not being discussed in those currency pairs peers. The 2 percentage points headwind that we've already [indiscernible] in our revenue growth as [indiscernible] for next year is from these currency pairs.

I mean, 17% revenue growth in fourth quarter [indiscernible] '14 with FX not a bad place to be. Volumes, shares, innovation, deals, we've done all that while navigating through what I would say was one of the more complex economic and political years that I've seen over the last decade. And aside from the actual couple of years of the financial crisis, this was done on a more difficult years. For 2015, we see the same underlying trends economically and for our own business. We believe that we will deliver our 3 objectives and that means that net revenue growth this year will be in the high single-digit range at constant currency. So your question will be why is that growth lower than 2014? Because, one, we have those local FX headwinds [indiscernible] discussing in the Q&A and those 30 currency pairs. So that's before the euro and the real translation impact, which, as you know, is larger. But just those local FX headwinds and because we have some very good deals in the pipeline both renewals and wins that probably are going to have an upfront load. But they're good deals, they're good for us. And so if you look at all that at the same time, we plan to keep investing in our business and our capabilities. We know how to dial our expenses up and down. And we are going to keep a very close eye on that, if needed. I just don't want to do that through short-term cycle. Now we took advantage of the tax benefit, but why is that sustainable, as Martina talked about. They come to us in the latter part of the quarter and got finalized and she said, you know what, this is a good time. Apple Pay is out of the market. Price initiatives are out of the market. It's a good season for all of us. Let's take some of those benefits and put it back into the system. Those kinds of provisions are taken every week and every day by us together as a team.

6477196,281088409,752756,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2015",2015-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. I'm very pleased that we were able to deliver strong results for both our fourth quarter and the full year performance despite what everybody knows is a mixed economic environment.

I'm very pleased that we were able to deliver strong results for both our fourth quarter and the full year performance despite what everybody knows is a mixed economic environment. 
In the fourth quarter, after adjusting for currency, we had net revenue growth of 17% and EPS growth of 25%, driven by solid underlying metrics. For the full year, we saw net revenue growth of 14% and EPS growth of 19%. Both EPS growth figures exclude the impact of last year's special item for the charge related to the U.S. merchant litigation.
So in total, we had a good year where we were able to continue to meaningfully invest in growth initiatives that I think will position us very well for the future. And those initiatives then triggered actions resulting in a restructuring charge in this past year's fourth quarter, which Martina is going to go through in some detail later.
So moving on to look at the some of the current underlying global economic trends, let's start with the United States, which is in relatively decent shape. Our SpendingPulse data showed U.S. retail sales growth, x auto, was 2.9% in the fourth quarter. Now that's down from the third quarter growth of 4.2%. And most of that deceleration is due to lower gas prices. Now excluding auto and gas, retail sales growth was 4.1% for the fourth quarter versus 4.80% for the third quarter, showing just a modest deceleration in spending.  And even though 4% growth is nothing to sneeze at, we haven't yet seen the extra savings from lowered gas prices translate into additional discretionary consumer spending. So while overall retail spending grows softer in the quarter, underlying economic indicators did remain positive, with unemployment levels and consumer sentiment both showing some improvement. 
Looking at our own U.S. business, as we have said for the past couple of quarters, that share de-conversion is having an impact on our U.S. GDV growth rate. But if you take that out, the underlying growth remains roughly the same over the course of 2014.
Outside of the U.S., Europe's recovery slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter. It still remains challenged. And across the region, consumer confidence and economic sentiment decelerated slightly. And while unemployment levels were high, they remained steady with the prior quarter. 
But there were few bright spots, and the U.K. experienced good momentum in the quarter. SpendingPulse data for the U.K. is showing fourth quarter retail sales growth of 3.6%, up from 2.9% in the third quarter. 
Even in Spain, preliminary indicators are showing some early signs of recovery. MasterCard's total European volume growth for the fourth quarter was in the mid-teens and processed transaction growth in the lower 20s, both of which increased from the last quarter due in part to a number of our recent wins across several European markets.
Latin America. Number of indicators there that highlighted the sluggish economic performance across the region. And our fourth quarter SpendingPulse data for Brazil showed retail sales growth of just 0.9%, down from the 2.4% growth that Brazil saw in the third quarter. For the entire region, annual GDV growth is now expected to be around 1%, down slightly from earlier projections of 1.3%.
Mexico, however, is an exception. It continues to benefit from improving exports to U.S. and actually is undergoing a slow recovery. And our business in the region remains solid. Our fourth quarter GDV and processed transaction growth is in the mid-teens, about the same as the last quarter.
Across Asia Pacific, overall business sentiment actually improved in the fourth quarter. Optimism from Indian companies following the recent elections has driven some of that, but is temporary abated by lingering concerns over the slowing economic growth in China. Consumer confidence across the region's holding steady. Our business in the region continues to do well. GDV growth in the mid-teens. Processed transactions growth in the mid-20s, about the same as the last quarter.
So overall, the economic environment hasn't changed much from last quarter. The U.S. looks to be in a little better shape. Challenges remaining for continental Europe, for Brazil, parts of Asia. But despite all of this, you can see the strong fundamentals of our business has not changed.
So before we go to our business highlights, there's been some recent news about European regulatory matters and Russia, so let me touch on those a little bit first. And let me start with the proposed European legislation related to card payments.
The European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission have reached agreement in December, and we are waiting for the formal adoption and publication of the final text. As expected, have we got interchange caps that are now being established for consumer credit and consumer debit cards. Commercial cards are excluded. The regulation provides for a level playing field by imposing interchange caps on 3-party networks when they operate similarly to a 4-party network. There are some possible exceptions to this, but overall, we are pleased with the outcome in this part is an important one for us.
Also, a network will no longer be allowed to charge a co-badging fee if it does not process the transaction. And finally, the regulation requires the functional rather than legal separation of scheme and processing functions and outcome that we had thought once it became clear that some form of separation will be required. We're now working to build this separation, the functional separation, into our operations.
The next formal step is for the language of the agreement to be endorsed by parliament and by the member states. Our best estimate is this will occur in the first half of 2015. Interchange caps have become effective 6 months after that. All of the parts of legislation will apply to us starting 12 months after the endorsement, so that's probably sometime in 2016.
So now, a little bit about Russia. We've been working through the challenges of connecting to [indiscernible], which is the domestic processing switch of the Russian Central Bank in order to meet their late March 31 deadline. And going forward by the way. Nothing has changed in terms of being able to issue MasterCard-branded cards for use; in the Russian market. In terms of the financial impact to our business, our best estimate is still something less than $50 million on an annualized basis. It'll now hit our G&A line, the expense line, as a data processing expense, rather than the revenue line as previously shared. 
So moving on to some of our recent business activity. We've expanded relationships with a couple of our large global customers, and that's great news. We renewed our multiyear global partnership with Bank of America that will expand share opportunity for us both domestically and outside of the U.S. and primarily on commercial side.  We recently won new business with HSBC, which involves converting the remainder of their U.S. consumer credit portfolio to MasterCard in the first half of this year.
In the Middle East and Africa, we signed a number of new business agreements in the quarter. That should help us increase our credit, debit, commercial and prepaid businesses in countries such as Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, Jordan, Kuwait and the UAE over the course of 2015, and we will build the strong momentum that we've developed in the region. Over the last 2 years, we've signed close to 100 new business agreements, we now have an accepted footprint in 50 out of Africa's 55 markets.
You know we feel strongly about activities that take our services to people who were previously excluded from access to the financial system. In Africa, close to 95% of the region's transaction are still done on cash. 80% of adults don't have access to a bank account. And working around the whole aspect and reflecting our commitment to what's going in Africa, we've also launched a number of financial inclusion initiatives, and today, I'm going to pick on 2 of those. 
First, last week, we announced the start of a collaboration with the African Development Bank to broaden access to financial services. We are going to do that in partnership with local governments in Africa and private sector companies. We have the expertise to design and to scale financial solutions, and the African Development Bank is a major source of funding for the economic development of its 54 member countries.
So we believe together we can help drive financial inclusion and economic development across Africa over the next 2 years.
Secondly, last September, in partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we announced that we will be opening a MasterCard Lab for financial inclusion in Kenya. This is our seventh global innovation hub, but it's the first that we have in Africa. It's also the first to receive outside funding.  The lab will be dedicated specifically to creating and incubating programs that are targeted to more than 100 million people in this part of the world who are financially excluded or underserved.
Our efforts on innovation, by the way, are not limited to 1 region like I just discussed in Africa or only to the labs. We're also opening up our technology to external developers, something we've been trying to do for a while now. The most recent example is the 10-city hackathon competition that starts next month in Sydney in Australia and will go on to Hong Kong, Singapore, Israel, Brazil, Canada, the U.K. and the United States. In this competition, which is already being planned for some more cities beyond these will bring together developers and entrepreneurs using MasterCard APIs to create a new generation of commerce applications that leverages our platforms, our product capabilities, such as those from our information services business of MasterPass and our prepaid, our loyalty and our fraud solutions.
And the meanwhile, we're continuing with the global expansion of MasterPass. Since it's introduction in the spring of 2013, we now have the platform launched in 16 countries, and just recently, signed on a number of new merchants, Neiman Marcus, Office Depot, Blue Nile, Broadway.com, just some new names in the merchant list. 
We're also creating some new and noteworthy partnerships. One example is the Paylib in France. Paylib was initially followed by BNP Paribas, La Banque Postale and Société Générale, who are, by the way, mainly customers of one of our key competitors, and yet chosen to partner with MasterPass because of what we believe is our global reach in handling all their cross-border e-commerce transactions as well as some of the domestic transactions, too.  With this partnership, up to 40 million people will have access to MasterPass acceptance with Paylib wallet linked to a card from their bank.
And so before I turn it over to Martina, let me quickly update you on 2 recent acquisitions. In December, we acquired the payment gateway services business of Transaction Network Services, TNS. And that deal gives us the ability to expand our payment gateway to the U.S. and Mexico and to position ourselves more competitively around the rest of the world where, as you know, with DataCash and our original mixed platform, we only had a presence. 
And so for example, in Asia Pacific and the Middle East/Africa, we will add new capabilities: Tokenization, fraud management, and we'll also be able to leverage what I think our highly-skilled product and software teams that have now recently joined the company with this transaction.
Additionally, we acquired 5one Marketing Limited. That's a marketing, analytics and consulting firm and their clients are basically large retailers across many different consumer sectors. 5one has some proprietary software. They've used that to develop insights from a retailer's own data that can be used for marketing, for merchandising and for operational decisions. You take that and you combine that kind of in-depth merchant understanding with our existing Advisors capabilities, I think that will allow us to provide greater insight for retailers and the ability to expand our business opportunities with the merchant community.
So with that, Martina, for an update on financial results and operational metrics."

As Ajay already said, we are very pleased with our 2014 full year performance, which delivered net revenue growth of 14% and EPS growth of 19%. I'll now turn to the details of our fourth quarter results.So let",2254,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. 
As Ajay already said, we are very pleased with our 2014 full year performance, which delivered net revenue growth of 14% and EPS growth of 19%. I'll now turn to the details of our fourth quarter results.
So let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck, where you see the difference between as-reported and FX-adjusted growth rates for this quarter is more significant than it has been in recent past. This is primarily due to the headwinds from the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate, especially with what we saw in the FX markets during the last 45 days of the quarter and its continuation into this quarter.  These figures also exclude the impact of the special item related to the U.S. merchant litigation taken in the fourth quarter of 2013.
I'd like to highlight 3 things while on this slide, and then dive into the details of the major P&L line items in subsequent slides. 
So first, EPS growth was 25% after adjusted for currency, and share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share.  During the fourth quarter, we have purchased 2.1 million shares at a cost of approximately $155 million. And through January 23, we repurchased an additional 2.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $215 million, and we now have $3.8 billion remaining under the current authorization. We continue to look to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis.
Second, part of the EPS growth is the result of a very favorable tax rate of 20.3% in the quarter as some initiatives only came together within the last couple of months to better align our tax structure to our European business footprint between Belgium and the U.K. We took some of that benefit to reinvest back into the business, which I discussed on the operating expense slide. 
And third, cash flow from operations was $725 million. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and other liquid investments of about $6.4 billion.
So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, was up 13% on a local currency basis, up slightly from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 8%, similar to last quarter. Credit growth was 7% and debit growth was 8%. Both the same as last quarter.  Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 15% on a local-currency basis and primarily driven by Europe.
Cross-border volume grew 19% on a local currency basis, higher than the 15% we saw in the third quarter, primarily driven by Europe. Growth in Europe was in the low 20s. Key contributors to this growth included the U.K., Italy, Germany and Sweden. All regions, except the U.S., saw an increase in cross-border volume growth in the fourth quarter.
Let me turn to Page 5. And here, you can see processed transactions grew 11% globally to $11.6 billion. We continued to see double-digit growth in most regions. Growth increased from the 10% we saw in the third quarter primarily due to Europe, driven by Russia, Sweden, Poland and the Netherlands. Globally, the number of cards grew 9% with 2.1 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of our revenue line items. Overall net revenue growth was 14% as-reported, or 17% FX-adjusted due to currency headwinds, primarily from the euro exchange rate. Additionally, the impact of local currency exchange rates to the functional currency billing rate was a little more than 1 ppt. In total, acquisitions contributed 3 ppt to our net revenue growth. So after excluding the impact of both local and functional currencies, as well as the impact of acquisitions, we saw a very strong underlying growth of 15%.
Looking at the individual revenue line items on an FX-adjusted basis. Domestic assessments grew 7%, while worldwide GDV grew 13%. This 6 ppt gap is primarily due to the impact of local currency and lower-than-average revenue yields in some markets outside of the U.S. similar to prior quarters.
Cross-border volume fees grew 8% while cross-border volume grew 19%. Of the 11 ppt gap, about 7 ppt is due to the impact of local currency. The remaining portion of the difference is mainly due to the higher mix of intra-European activity.
Transaction processing fees grew 15%, primarily driven by the 11% growth in processed transactions. This line item also benefited from additional revenues not driven by transaction count and some pricing partially offset by mix.
Other revenues grew 28%, driven largely by contributions from our Pinpoint acquisition as well as our Advisors business.
Moving on to Page 7, you can see the total operating expenses were up 26% in the quarter or 29% on an FX-adjusted basis. Of this growth, 9 ppt was due to expenses related to our acquisitions. The other big driver was the restructuring charge, which contributed 8 ppt to the growth. So let me focus on that a bit more.
So specifically, we took an $87 million restructuring charge to cover a series of actions. First, as you know, we have made a number of acquisitions in the processing space and we are now consolidating all of our processing assets under 1 organization that's driving significant synergies.
Second, we are realigning some roads within the company's business groups and redeploying resources geographically in order to invest in and enhance our capabilities in new product areas and technology such as digital and mobile. Overall, these actions will impact over 500 people, but our total headcount will decline by a smaller amount given the reinvestment that I just mentioned.
The remaining OpEx growth of 12% was primarily driven by some opportunistic spend such as adding A&M spend around our Apple Pay and prices initiative, as well as continuing our digital investments such MasterPass and tokenization, similar to prior quarters.
Let me turn to Slide 8. And here, we discussed what we've seen in January through the 21st. Most of our business drivers are similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter after excluding the impact of lower gas prices, particularly in the U S. So the numbers through January 21 are as follows: 
Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 9%, down 2 ppt from the fourth quarter. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 3%, down 2 ppt from what we saw the last quarter, primarily driven by lower gas prices. Processed volume outside of the U.S. grew 16%, about 1 ppt lower than the fourth quarter, with growth of mid- to high-teens in each region. Globally, processed transaction growth was 11%, similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter with double-digit growth in all regions except the U.S., which grew in the low-single digits.  With respect to cross-border, our volume grew at 19% globally, the same as our fourth quarter growth. We continue to see high growth in major European markets, including the U.K., Italy and Sweden.
Looking ahead, let me start with some commentary about full year 2015. 
Given what's happening with currency rates and the impact being seen by U.S. multinationals across a number of industries, I'm going to start with that, especially since it was back in 2012 the MasterCard last faced such a big impact from FX. Remember that currency impact us it 2 ways. So first, we have the impact of local currency rates relative to the functional currencies. And this is the FX exposure that we actively hedge normally on a rolling 12-month basis, and typically, as you know, we hedge about 50% to 75% of our total net exposure for about 30 currency pairs. And given that many currencies have depreciated against the U.S. dollar and the euro, new hedge contracts will come on at lower rates over the year. Thus, we continue to expect some net headwind throughout the year, both to revenue and the bottom line.  Based on currency rates -- based on the current rates, this is likely to be around 2 ppt or the 2 ppt range, and this is already included in our FX-adjusted guidance.
Second, we have the impact of the translation of our major functional currencies, which are particularly euro and the Brazilian real, into U.S. dollars, to consolidate our financials, and we do not hedge those exposures. When we talk about FX-adjusted growth rates, we are only adjusting for the impact of these 2 functional exchange rates. If the rates to our functional currencies remain similar to where they are today, so that's the euro trading at the $1.13 level and the Brazilian real at the $2.58 level for the rest of the year, the net impact of the euro and the real would be a 4 to 6 ppt headwind and it's actually driven mostly from the euro to our as-reported results for the full year, depending on which line item we are talking about, revenue, net income or EPS, and I will get into that a little bit more.
With that backdrop, now let me get into some of the P&L line items. We expect high-single digit net revenue growth for 2015 on an FX-adjusted basis. And that will be before and after a roughly 2 ppt contribution from last year's M&A transactions. Our underlying business remains strong and we are seeing traction from many of our recent portfolio wins and new product initiative. However, this year's FX-adjusted revenue growth will be impacted by some items specific to 2015. And that's including the remaining case portfolio attrition mostly impacting the first half of the year, as well as the local currency headwinds I just talked about.
Also included are a couple of expected significant contract renewals, some of which will likely have more front-loaded rebates and incentives than our typical agreements. But these renewals provide the foundation for future growth.
On an as-reported basis, the net revenue growth rate will likely be in the mid-single-digit range as a result of strong FX headwinds, primarily from the euro functional translation. Based on current FX rates, this would be about a 4 to 5 ppt impact.
Overall, we project the growth rate for total operating expense for full year 2015 to be in the high-single digits on an FX-adjusted basis. This growth is predominantly due to a roughly 6 ppt impact from our previously announced acquisitions, with more of that impact occurring in the first half of the year. The as-reported growth will likely be in the mid-single-digit range after considering a roughly 2 to 3 ppt range impact mostly again from the euro translation.
Let me give you an update on potential dilution from last year's acquisitions. Now that we've done a few more deals like TNS and 5one that Ajay just mentioned, we now expect total EPS dilution to be about $0.08 to $0.10 for the full year 2015 and a little less than half of the expected dilution is actually due to the amortization of acquired intangibles. You should now assume a full year 2015 tax rate of about 28%, due to the continued benefits we expect from the tax initiatives I discussed earlier. So this is a sustainable tax benefit for future years.
Now given all the detail that I just went through, let me step back and summarize for you. We expect solid fundamentals to drive our business in 2015 despite the mixed economic environment and significant headwinds from FX and gas prices. We continue to sign customer contracts and invest in the right strategic areas while managing our expenses prudently.
So finally, let me move on to our long-term performance objective for the 2013 to 2015 period.  Given our expectations for 2015 revenue growth, we now believe that we will deliver at the low-end of our 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR. We continue to expect at least 20% EPS CAGR for the 3-year period, due to continued expense management as well as benefits from our lower tax rate and share repurchases. We remain committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%. Remember, these objectives are on a constant currency basis and exclude our 2014 M&A activities as well as any new ones that may occur this year.
As a reference point for your modeling, when looking at our performance on 2 -- from a 2-year CAGR perspective, so that's for 2013 and 2014, on a constant currency basis, we have delivered a net revenue CAGR of 12.5% and an EPS CAGR of 21.1%, which is based on the 2012 normalized EPS of $2.14 per share that we provided to you earlier.
Now many of you have asked when we will be rolling our performance objective forward. As you can see, the underlying drivers of our business are in good shape and we are expanding our reach in areas that we are strategically targeting such as processing, royalty, information services and all things digital. The overall growth prospects for the payments industry have not changed. And for now, we have given you some clarity around 2015 as this is the last year of our current 2013 to '15 performance period. Once we have worked through the many moving parts, including the impact of those resulting from the final European payment regulation and the new payments environment in Russia, both from a revenue and an expense perspective, we will provide you with our new long-term objective before the end of this year.

And we had TNS, 5one, Pinpoint, ECS, C-SAM and Provus starting in January through December, and then the HomeSend JV. But that's -- I wouldn't say you should take that as the norm. Deals are deals when they happen. You cannot look at 25, 30 deals in a year, and sometimes, in the previous 2 years, 1 or 2 worked out. It so happened that a number of these were in the hopper, so to say, and they began to close at different times of the year. So the first thing I'd say is, don't take this, the trend level hard. This is just the way deals work out. Now your deeper question was around the work we are doing and where we are going forward. What's the big picture here? And the big picture here is we are trying to expand our presence in the payments value chain, not just in being in the clearing, authorization and settlement business, but every little before, during and after the transaction. How can we expand our presence so we can be stickier and we can, therefore, extract better value for the services we offer and that provides us with some new capabilities and, hopefully, gives us some space to become bigger leaders or better leaders in key growth areas? So what could those areas be? Data and analytics, which is what the information services is about. So 5one, for example, is right in that space. Processing, which is what Paylib will be doing with, say, Provus and with ECS, and TNS also does fit in there. We've had the key commerce gateway businesses bought overtime. That will be things that all tie back to processing. And why are we doing processing? Because the idea is to be able to see more of the transactions around the world. Because then that allows me to use that knowledge in my data analytics business. So it's interconnected to that space. And then the third area is safety and security. So DataCash got us some great fraud management solutions. There are similar ones in some of these. The HomeSend JV could actually be very useful not just for moving money around the world, but also for safety and security. And then loyalty, which is why Pinpoint came into it and we did Truaxis some years ago. And so these are all in that daily wake of data and analytics, processing, safety, security and loyalty. And mostly, we try and figured out if there's a good strategic fit. Are these companies giving us some critical capabilities we didn't have on our own technology, product, distribution, some geographic reach maybe? And do we have the right kind of risk profile? And are we getting some talented skills we would not have been able to get easily? So C-SAM, for example, brought us a number of very highly qualified mobile payment technicians, hiring hundreds of them organically would be a very slow build. This gave us the ability to get with it much quicker. Kind of a mix of those reasons, and that's what we're trying to do."

And we do very traditional cash flow modeling with the right kind of hurdle rates, married by the type of business, the riskiness of the business, where the business is located.

So if we put all that into context, you're entitled to flow through. But the way I think about it, when I was in Davos [ph],  we talked to so many other fields about this. I just feel that maybe it is -- that it's going to take 3 or 4 months for the U.S. consumer to feel that this is something that's going to leave it down for a little while. If you have a longer-term perspective of the price of gas, not going back to $100 but maybe settling at $75, $80, that's sort of weird thinking. I don't think the U.S. consumer knows whether to expect this to be sticking around or not. So I think there's some degree of, let's say, the desire to see that through before they really start spending that kind of money. That's kind of where I think this is. So if you were to ask my opinion, then I guess I would say probably 1 month or 2 or 3 away if this price stays where it is from them saying, you know what, I do have $800 a month more in my pocket and I could afford to go and buy x. I think that's kind of what I think about it. But on pricing, Martina?"

A number of the merchants and retailers have been launching their own apps in an effort to get people to come straight to their digit, and then, hopefully, control more of the transaction, as well as the relationship with the consumer when they're inside their app, as compared to coming the usual way. So it depends who you believe, but everybody is making projections based on, well, whatever they think about where these 3 will go over the next 2 years. And my sense is you're going to get NFC growing decently, but it's really with terminalization. And I believe terminalization will happen with all the EMV and chip migration, as well as the fact that all the new terminals are coming contactless-equipped. So you're probably seeing a 2- or 3-year cycle of a fairly dramatic increase in contactless-equipped terminals in the United States. That's only happening, by the way, in Australia and Canada, Turkey and some other countries. But the U.S., which is the large one, I think you'll see that. In terms of browsing, browsing tends to be the large chunk. And I still believe that online browsing will remain a pretty large number for a few years to come. And I think you will get 2 or 3 kinds of efforts there. You'll get a lot of effort made around improving the card on file experience. Then you'll get a lot of these efforts made around improving the use of easy-use checkout wallets, whether it be MasterPass or Visa's offering or PayPal or other such offerings. And I think you'll get all of those getting a degree of capability built with tokenization, just making it safer and safer over the next few quarters. So we are all working on similar things. And I don't think you should read too much into a quarter here or a quarter there. These things are slow burns. You saw Apple Pay talk about their mobile payment growth. But at the end of the day, yes, they've done a great job and it's excited the market, but it's still a very small percentage of what the total number of transactions are. So I will take all this in that context and not try to erase this with more than that. We're very focused on -- tokenization is perfect,  just to make sure I don't miss that aspect. It's a very important aspect of where we're going for safety and security. Apple Pay was the first version of that to come out there. We're putting it into MasterPass, just regular MasterPass, over the next few period of time, let me put it that way, so I don't give you information that's beyond what is likely. And that will be, you'll see in 1 year or 2's time, tokenization will become kind of table stakes in the games on e-commerce. So that's what I would hope."

We lay in our -- layer in our hedges over a 12 months volume period, so we never run, so to speak, naked during any type of period. But we do it for this most significant currency pairs. So I think you know that we are doing, actually, business in 150-plus currencies, but we really pick the most significant currency pairs in order to do our hedging. In order to do hedging, you have to have really appropriate exposure forecast coming out over the next 12 months rolling period, and that is where you typically take a step back and take a little bit of a more conservative view and don't layer in 100% of the exposure in terms of hedges. You do 50% to 75%. So we don't take a few.  The 50% to 75% is not taking a few in terms of hedging a particular currency pair, but it is in terms of making sure that between the old exposure that we know and the hedges that we lay on, that we have the right kind of balance. The one other thing that I wanted to let you know is just to make sure, we are hedging things on a net basis, which means we take revenues in that particular currencies and we deduct the operating expenses that we spend in that particular currency, and then we do a net hedge on that, and you would not see the gain or the loss of the hedge showing up in the revenue line. Most of that is actually reflected in our G&A line item."

And so when Martina talks to you about the 50% to 75%, you're probably looking at a higher-level hedge in the immediate quarter because you have most fertility of that net exposure between those currency pairs, as she just said, for 2. You hedge a little less out 4 quarters because you have less facility in those currency pairs that she's referring to. Also remember, the euro and the real are not being discussed in those currency pairs. The 2 percentage points headwind as we've already paired in our revenue growth estimate for next year is from these currency pairs. The euro and the real comes over and beyond that and kind of could be a far more significant one, particularly because of the euro, as Martina was pointing out."

And I'm going just leave you with a few closing thoughts. We ended what I think was a very good year on a strong note. I mean, 17% revenue growth in fourth quarter x FX, 14% with FX, that's not a bad place to be. Volumes, share, innovation, deals, we've done all of that while navigating through what I would say was one of the more complex economic and political years that I've seen over the last decade. And aside from the actual couple of years of the financial crisis, this was probably one of the more difficult years. 
For 2015, we see the same underlying trends economically and for our own business. We believe that we will deliver our 3-year objectives, and that means that net revenue growth this year will be in the high single-digit range at constant currency. So your question will be, why is that growth lower than 2014? Because, one, we have those local FX headwinds that we were just discussing in the Q&A and those 30 currency pairs. And so that's before the euro, by the way, and the real translation impact, which as you know, is larger. But just those local FX headwinds and because we have some very good deals in the pipeline, both renewals and wins, that are probably going to have an upfront load. But those are good deals, they're good for us. 
And so if you look at all that at the same time, we plan to keep investing in our business and our capabilities. We know how to dial our expenses up and down. And we're going to keep a very close eye on that, if needed. I just don't want to do that through short-term cycle. We took advantage of the tax benefits that, while sustainable, as Martina talked about, they came to us in the latter part of the quarter and got finalized. And she and I sat down and said, ""You know what, this is a good time. Apple Pay is out on the market. Prices initiatives is out of the market. It's a good seasonal quarter for us. Let's take some of these benefits and put it back into the system."" Those kinds of decisions are taken every week and every day by us together as a team. 
So overall, we haven't changed our thinking about our business prospects from what we indicated at our Investor Day a few months ago, or rather, the 2 investor days.

Good morning, everybody. I'm very pleased that we were able to deliver strong results for both our fourth quarter and the full year performance despite what everybody knows is a mixed economic environment. In the fourth quarter, afte",2027,"Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. I'm very pleased that we were able to deliver strong results for both our fourth quarter and the full year performance despite what everybody knows is a mixed economic environment. 
In the fourth quarter, after adjusting for currency, we had net revenue growth of 17% and EPS growth of 25%, driven by solid underlying metrics. For the full year, we saw net revenue growth of 14% and EPS growth of 19%. Both EPS growth figures exclude the impact of last year's special item for the charge related to the U.S. merchant litigation.
So in total, we had a good year where we were able to continue to meaningfully invest in growth initiatives that I think will position us very well for the future. And those initiatives then triggered actions resulting in a restructuring charge in this past year's fourth quarter, which Martina is going to go through in some detail later.
So moving on to look at the some of the current underlying global economic trends, let's start with the United States, which is in relatively decent shape. Our SpendingPulse data showed U.S. retail sales growth, x auto, was 2.9% in the fourth quarter. Now that's down from the third quarter growth of 4.2%. And most of that deceleration is due to lower gas prices. Now excluding auto and gas, retail sales growth was 4.1% for the fourth quarter versus 4.80% for the third quarter, showing just a modest deceleration in spending. And even though 4% growth is nothing to sneeze at, we haven't yet seen the extra savings from lower gas prices translate into additional discretionary consumer spending. So while overall retail spending growth softened in the quarter, underlying economic indicators did remain positive, with unemployment levels and consumer sentiment both showing some improvement. 
Looking at our own U.S. business, as we have said for the past couple of quarters, that share de-conversion is having an impact on our U.S. GDV growth rate. But if you take that out, the underlying growth remains roughly the same over the course of 2014.
Outside of the U.S., Europe's recovery slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter. It still remains challenged. And across the region, consumer confidence and economic sentiment decelerated slightly. And while unemployment levels were high, they remained steady with the prior quarter. 
But there were few bright spots, and the U.K. experienced good momentum in the quarter. SpendingPulse data for the U.K. is showing fourth quarter retail sales growth of 3.6%, up from 2.9% in the third quarter. 
Even in Spain, preliminary indicators are showing some early signs of recovery. MasterCard's total European volume growth for the fourth quarter was in the mid-teens and processed transaction growth in the lower 20s, both of which increased from the last quarter due in part to a number of our recent wins across several European markets.
Latin America. Number of indicators there that highlighted the sluggish economic performance across the region. And our fourth quarter SpendingPulse data for Brazil showed retail sales growth of just 0.9%, down from the 2.4% growth that Brazil saw in the third quarter. For the entire region, annual GDV growth is now expected to be around 1%, down slightly from earlier projections of 1.3%.
Mexico, however, is an exception. It continues to benefit from improving exports to the U.S. and actually is undergoing a slow recovery. And our business in the region remains solid. Our fourth quarter GDV and processed transaction growth is in the mid-teens, about the same as the last quarter.
Across Asia Pacific, overall business sentiment actually improved in the fourth quarter. Optimism from Indian companies following the recent elections has driven some of that, but it's tempered a bit by lingering concerns over the slowing economic growth in China. Consumer confidence across the region's holding steady. Our business in the region continues to do well. GDV growth in the mid-teens. Processed transactions growth in the mid-20s, about the same as the last quarter.
So overall, the economic environment hasn't changed much from last quarter. The U.S. looks to be in a little better shape. Challenges remaining for continental Europe, for Brazil, parts of Asia. But despite all of this, you can see the strong fundamentals of our business has not changed.
So before we go to our business highlights, there's been some recent news about European regulatory matters and Russia, so let me touch on those a little bit first. And let me start with the proposed European legislation related to card payments.
The European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission have reached agreement in December, and we are waiting for the formal adoption and publication of the final text. As expected, have we got [ph] interchange caps that are now being established for consumer credit and consumer debit cards. Commercial cards are excluded. The regulation provides for a level playing field by imposing interchange caps on 3-party networks when they operate similarly to a 4-party network. There are some possible exceptions to this, but overall, we are pleased with the outcome in this part, it is an important one for us.
Also, a network will no longer be allowed to charge a co-badging fee if it does not process the transaction. And finally, the regulation requires the functional rather than legal separation of scheme and processing functions an outcome that we had thought once it became clear that some form of separation will be required. We're now working to build this separation, the functional separation, into our operations.
The next formal step is for the language of the agreement to be endorsed by parliament and by the member states. Our best estimate is this will occur in the first half of 2015. Interchange caps will become effective 6 months after that. All of the parts of legislation will apply to us starting 12 months after the endorsement, so that's probably sometime in 2016.
So now, a little bit about Russia. We've been working through the challenges of connecting to [indiscernible], which is the domestic processing switch of the Russian Central Bank in order to meet their late March 31 deadline. And going forward by the way, nothing has changed in terms of being able to issue MasterCard-branded cards for use; in the Russian market. In terms of the financial impact to our business, our best estimate is still something less than $50 million on an annualized basis. It'll now hit our G&A line, the expense line, as a data processing expense, rather than the revenue line as we previously shared. 
So moving on to some of our recent business activity. We've expanded relationships with a couple of our large global customers, and that's great news. We renewed our multiyear global partnership with Bank of America that will expand share opportunity for us both domestically and outside of the U.S. and primarily on commercial side.  We recently won new business with HSBC, which involves converting the remainder of their U.S. consumer credit portfolio to MasterCard in the first half of this year.
In the Middle East and Africa, we signed a number of new business agreements in the quarter. That should help us increase our credit, debit, commercial and prepaid businesses in countries such as Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, Jordan, Kuwait and the UAE over the course of 2015, and we will build the strong momentum that we've developed in the region. Over the last 2 years, we've signed close to 100 new business agreements, we now have an accepted footprint in 50 out of Africa's 55 markets.
You know we feel strongly about activities that take our services to people who were previously excluded from access to the financial system. In Africa, close to 95% of the region's transaction are still done in cash. 80% of adults don't have access to a bank account. And working around the whole aspect and reflecting our commitment to what's going in Africa, we've also launched a number of financial inclusion initiatives, and today, I'm going to pick on 2 of those. 
First, last week, we announced the start of a collaboration with the African Development Bank to broaden access to financial services. We are going to do that in partnership with local governments in Africa and private sector companies. We have the expertise to design and to scale financial solutions, and the African Development Bank is a major source of funding for the economic development of its 54 member countries.
So we believe together we can help drive financial inclusion and economic development across Africa over the next 2 years.
Secondly, last September, in partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we announced that we will be opening a MasterCard Lab for financial inclusion in Kenya. This is our seventh global innovation hub, but it's the first that we have in Africa. It's also the first to receive outside funding.  The lab will be dedicated specifically to creating and incubating programs that are targeted to more than 100 million people in this part of the world who are financially excluded or underserved.
Our efforts on innovation, by the way, are not limited to 1 region like I just discussed in Africa or only to the labs. We're also opening up our technology to external developers, something we've been trying to do for a while now. The most recent example is the 10-city hackathon competition that starts next month in Sydney in Australia and will go on to Hong Kong, Singapore, Israel, Brazil, Canada, the U.K. and the United States. In this competition, which is already being planned for some more cities beyond these will bring together developers and entrepreneurs using MasterCard APIs to create a new generation of commerce applications that leverages our platforms, our product capabilities, such as those from our information services business of MasterPass and our prepaid, our loyalty and our fraud solutions.
And the meanwhile, we're continuing with the global expansion of MasterPass. Since it's introduction in the spring of 2013, we now have the platform launched in 16 countries, and just recently, signed on a number of new merchants, Neiman Marcus, Office Depot, Blue Nile, Broadway.com, just some new names in the merchant list. 
We're also creating some new and noteworthy partnerships. One example is with Paylib in France. Paylib was initially formed by BNP Paribas, La Banque Postale and Société Générale, who are, by the way, mainly customers of one of our key competitors, and yet chosen to partner with MasterPass because of what we believe is our global reach in handling all their cross-border e-commerce transactions as well as some of the domestic transactions, too.  With this partnership, up to 40 million people will have access to MasterPass acceptance with Paylib wallet linked to a card from their bank.
And so before I turn it over to Martina, let me quickly update you on 2 recent acquisitions. In December, we acquired the payment gateway services business of Transaction Network Services, TNS. And that deal gives us the ability to expand our payment gateway to the U.S. and Mexico and to position ourselves more competitively around the rest of the world where, as you know, with DataCash and our original mixed platform, we only had a presence. 
And so for example, in Asia Pacific and the Middle East/Africa, we will add new capabilities: Tokenization, fraud management, and we'll also be able to leverage what I think are highly-skilled product and software teams that have now recently joined the company with this transaction.
Additionally, we acquired 5one Marketing Limited. That's a marketing, analytics and consulting firm and their clients are basically large retailers across many different consumer sectors. 5one had some proprietary software. They've used that to develop insights from a retailer's own data that can be used for marketing, for merchandising and for operational decisions. You take that and you combine that kind of in-depth merchant understanding with our existing Advisors capabilities, I think that will allow us to provide greater insight for retailers and the ability to expand our business opportunities with the merchant community.
So with that, Martina, for an update on financial results and operational metrics."

As Ajay already said, we are very pleased with our 2014 full year performance, which delivered net revenue growth of 14% and EPS growth of 19%. I'll now turn to the details of our fourth quarter results.So let",2255,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. 
As Ajay already said, we are very pleased with our 2014 full year performance, which delivered net revenue growth of 14% and EPS growth of 19%. I'll now turn to the details of our fourth quarter results.
So let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck, where you see the difference between as-reported and FX-adjusted growth rates for this quarter is more significant than it has been in recent past. This is primarily due to the headwinds from the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate, especially with what we saw in the FX markets during the last 45 days of the quarter and its continuation into this quarter.  These figures also exclude the impact of the special item related to the U.S. merchant litigation taken in the fourth quarter of 2013.
I'd like to highlight 3 things while on this slide, and then dive into the details of the major P&L line items in subsequent slides. 
So first, EPS growth was 25% after adjusted for currency, and share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share.  During the fourth quarter, we have purchased 2.1 million shares at a cost of approximately $155 million. And through January 23, we repurchased an additional 2.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $215 million, and we now have $3.8 billion remaining under the current authorization. We continue to look to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis.
Second, part of the EPS growth is the result of a very favorable tax rate of 20.3% in the quarter as some initiatives only came together within the last couple of months to better align our tax structure to our European business footprint between Belgium and the U.K. We took some of that benefit to reinvest back into the business, which I discussed on the operating expense slide. 
And third, cash flow from operations was $725 million. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and other liquid investments of about $6.4 billion.
So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, was up 13% on a local currency basis, up slightly from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 8%, similar to last quarter. Credit growth was 7% and debit growth was 8%. Both the same as last quarter.  Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 15% on a local-currency basis and primarily driven by Europe.
Cross-border volume grew 19% on a local currency basis, higher than the 15% we saw in the third quarter, primarily driven by Europe. Growth in Europe was in the low 20s. Key contributors to this growth included the U.K., Italy, Germany and Sweden. All regions, except the U.S., saw an increase in cross-border volume growth in the fourth quarter.
Let me turn to Page 5. And here, you can see processed transactions grew 11% globally to $11.6 billion. We continued to see double-digit growth in most regions. Growth increased from the 10% we saw in the third quarter primarily due to Europe, driven by Russia, Sweden, Poland and the Netherlands. Globally, the number of cards grew 9% with 2.1 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of our revenue line items. Overall net revenue growth was 14% as-reported, or 17% FX-adjusted due to currency headwinds, primarily from the euro exchange rate. Additionally, the impact of local currency exchange rates to the functional currency billing rates was a little more than 1 ppt. In total, acquisitions contributed 3 ppt to our net revenue growth. So after excluding the impact of both local and functional currencies, as well as the impact of acquisitions, we saw a very strong underlying growth of 15%.
Looking at the individual revenue line items on an FX-adjusted basis. Domestic assessments grew 7%, while worldwide GDV grew 13%. This 6 ppt gap is primarily due to the impact of local currency and lower-than-average revenue yields in some markets outside of the U.S. similar to prior quarters.
Cross-border volume fees grew 8% while cross-border volume grew 19%. Of the 11 ppt gap, about 7 ppt is due to the impact of local currency. The remaining portion of the difference is mainly due to the higher mix of intra-European activity.
Transaction processing fees grew 15%, primarily driven by the 11% growth in processed transactions. This line item also benefited from additional revenues not driven by transaction count and some pricing partially offset by mix.
Other revenues grew 28%, driven largely by contributions from our Pinpoint acquisition as well as our Advisors business.
Moving on to Page 7, you can see the total operating expenses were up 26% in the quarter or 29% on an FX-adjusted basis. Of this growth, 9 ppt was due to expenses related to our acquisitions. The other big driver was the restructuring charge, which contributed 8 ppt to the growth. So let me focus on that a bit more.
So specifically, we took an $87 million restructuring charge to cover a series of actions. First, as you know, we have made a number of acquisitions in the processing space and we are now consolidating all of our processing assets under 1 organization that's driving significant synergies.
Second, we are realigning some roads within the company's business groups and redeploying resources geographically in order to invest in and enhance our capabilities in new product areas and technology such as digital and mobile. Overall, these actions will impact over 500 people, but our total headcount will decline by a smaller amount given the reinvestment that I just mentioned.
The remaining OpEx growth of 12% was primarily driven by some opportunistic spend such as adding A&M spend around our Apple Pay and prices initiative, as well as continuing our digital investments such MasterPass and tokenization, similar to prior quarters.
Let me turn to Slide 8. And here, we discussed what we've seen in January through the 21st. Most of our business drivers are similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter after excluding the impact of lower gas prices, particularly in the U S. So the numbers through January 21 are as follows: 
Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 9%, down 2 ppt from the fourth quarter. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 3%, down 2 ppt from what we saw the last quarter, primarily driven by lower gas prices. Processed volume outside of the U.S. grew 16%, about 1 ppt lower than the fourth quarter, with growth of mid- to high-teens in each region. Globally, processed transaction growth was 11%, similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter with double-digit growth in all regions except the U.S., which grew in the low-single digits.  With respect to cross-border, our volume grew at 19% globally, the same as our fourth quarter growth. We continued to see high growth in major European markets, including the U.K., Italy and Sweden.
Looking ahead, let me start with some commentary about full year 2015. 
Given what's happening with currency rates and the impact being seen by U.S. multinationals across a number of industries, I'm going to start with that, especially since it was back in 2012 that MasterCard last faced such a big impact from FX. Remember that currency impact us it 2 ways. So first, we have the impact of local currency rates relative to the functional currencies. And this is the FX exposure that we actively hedge normally on a rolling 12-month basis, and typically, as you know, we hedge about 50% to 75% of our total net exposure for about 30 currency pairs. And given that many currencies have depreciated against the U.S. dollar and the euro, new hedge contracts will come on at lower rates over the year. Thus, we continue to expect some net headwind throughout the year, both to revenue and the bottom line.  Based on currency rates -- based on the current rates, this is likely to be around 2 ppt or the 2 ppt range, and this is already included in our FX-adjusted guidance.
Second, we have the impact of the translation of our major functional currencies, which are particularly the euro and the Brazilian real, into U.S. dollars, to consolidate our financials, and we do not hedge those exposures. When we talk about FX-adjusted growth rates, we are only adjusting for the impact of these 2 functional exchange rates. If the rates to our functional currencies remain similar to where they are today, so that's the euro trading at the $1.13 level and the Brazilian real at the $2.58 level for the rest of the year, the net impact of the euro and the real would be a 4 to 6 ppt headwind and it's actually driven mostly from the euro to our as-reported results for the full year, depending on which line item we are talking about, revenue, net income or EPS, and I will get into that a little bit more.
With that backdrop, now let me get into some of the P&L line items. We expect high-single digit net revenue growth for 2015 on an FX-adjusted basis. And that will be before and after a roughly 2 ppt contribution from last year's M&A transactions. Our underlying business remains strong and we are seeing traction from many of our recent portfolio wins and new product initiative. However, this year's FX-adjusted revenue growth will be impacted by some items specific to 2015. And that's including the remaining Chase portfolio attrition mostly impacting the first half of the year, as well as the local currency headwinds I just talked about.
Also included are a couple of expected significant contract renewals, some of which will likely have more front-loaded rebates and incentives than our typical agreements. But these renewals provide the foundation for future growth.
On an as-reported basis, the net revenue growth rate will likely be in the mid-single-digit range as a result of strong FX headwinds, primarily from the euro functional translation. Based on current FX rates, this would be about a 4 to 5 ppt impact.
Overall, we project the growth rate for total operating expense for full year 2015 to be in the high-single digits on an FX-adjusted basis. This growth is predominantly due to a roughly 6 ppt impact from our previously announced acquisitions, with more of that impact occurring in the first half of the year. The as-reported growth will likely be in the mid-single-digit range after considering a roughly 2 to 3 ppt range impact mostly again from the euro translation.
Let me give you an update on potential dilution from last year's acquisitions. Now that we've done a few more deals like TNS and 5one that Ajay just mentioned, we now expect total EPS dilution to be about $0.08 to $0.10 for the full year 2015 and a little less than half of the expected dilution is actually due to the amortization of acquired intangibles. You should now assume a full year 2015 tax rate of about 28%, due to the continued benefits we expect from the tax initiatives I discussed earlier. So this is a sustainable tax benefit for future years.
Now given all the detail that I just went through, let me step back and summarize for you. We expect solid fundamentals to drive our business in 2015 despite the mixed economic environment and significant headwinds from FX and gas prices. We continue to sign customer contracts and invest in the right strategic areas while managing our expenses prudently.
So finally, let me move on to our long-term performance objective for the 2013 to 2015 period.  Given our expectations for 2015 revenue growth, we now believe that we will deliver at the low-end of our 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR. We continue to expect at least 20% EPS CAGR for the 3-year period, due to continued expense management as well as benefits from our lower tax rate and share repurchases. We remain committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%. Remember, these objectives are on a constant currency basis and exclude our 2014 M&A activities as well as any new ones that may occur this year.
As a reference point for your modeling, when looking at our performance on 2 -- from a 2-year CAGR perspective, so that's for 2013 and 2014, on a constant currency basis, we have delivered a net revenue CAGR of 12.5% and an EPS CAGR of 21.1%, which is based on the 2012 normalized EPS of $2.14 per share that we provided to you earlier.
Now many of you have asked when we will be rolling our performance objective forward. As you can see, the underlying drivers of our business are in good shape and we are expanding our reach in areas that we are strategically targeting such as processing, royalty, information services and all things digital. The overall growth prospects for the payments industry have not changed. And for now, we have given you some clarity around 2015 as this is the last year of our current 2013 to '15 performance period. Once we have worked through the many moving parts, including the impact of those resulting from the final European payment regulations and the new payments environment in Russia, both from a revenue and an expense perspective, we will provide you with our new long-term objective before the end of this year.

And we had TNS, 5one, Pinpoint, ECS, C-SAM and Provus starting in January through December, and then the HomeSend JV. But that's -- I wouldn't say you should take that as the norm. Deals are deals when they happen. You cannot look at 25, 30 deals in a year, and sometimes, in the previous 2 years, 1 or 2 worked out. It so happened that a number of these were in the hopper, so to say, and they began to close at different times of the year. So the first thing I'd say is, don't take this, the trend level out of this. This is just the way deals work out. Now your deeper question was around the work we are doing and where we are going forward. What's the big picture here? And the big picture here is we are trying to expand our presence in the payments value chain, not just in being in the clearing, authorization and settlement business, but every [indiscernible] before, during and after the transaction. How can we expand our presence so we can be stickier and we can, therefore, extract better value for the services we offer and that provides us with some new capabilities and, hopefully, gives us some space to become bigger leaders or better leaders in key growth areas. So what would those areas be? Data and analytics, which is what the information services is about. So 5one, for example, is right in that space. Processing, which is what Paylib will be doing with, say, Provus and with ECS, and TNS also does fit in there. We've had the key commerce gateway businesses bought over time. Some of these things that all tie back to processing. And why are we doing processing? Because the idea is to be able to see more of the transactions around the world. Because then that allows me to use that knowledge in my data analytics business. So it's interconnected to that space. And then the third area is safety and security. So DataCash got us some great fraud management solutions. There are similar ones in some of these. The HomeSend JV could actually be very useful not just for moving money around the world, but also for safety and security. And then loyalty, which is why Pinpoint came into it and we did Truaxis some years ago. And so these are all in that bailiwick of data and analytics, processing, safety, security and loyalty. And mostly, we try and figure out if there's a good strategic fit. Are these companies giving us some critical capabilities we didn't have on our own? Technology, product, distribution, some geographic reach maybe? And do we have the right kind of risk profile? And are we getting some talent or skills we would not have been able to get easily? So C-SAM, for example, brought us a number of very highly qualified mobile payment technicians, hiring hundreds of them organically would be a very slow build. This gave us the ability to get with it much quicker. Kind of a mix of those reasons, and that's what we're trying to do."

I think about the fact that it's $800 a month or whatever it is to a middle-class family. The gas prices are down 12% over the same time the previous year, and that's not a small number. So if we put all that into context, you would have thought it would flow through. But the way I think about it, and I think Davos [ph], we talked to so many other fields about this. I just feel that maybe it is -- that it's going to take 3 or 4 months for the U.S. consumer to feel that this is something that's going to be with them for a little while. If you have a longer-term perspective of the price of gas, not going back to $100 but maybe settling at $75, $80, that's sort of we are thinking. I don't think the U.S. consumer knows whether to expect this to be sticking around or not. So I think there's some degree of, let's say, the desire to see that through before they really start spending that kind of money. That's kind of where I think this is. So if you were to ask my opinion, then I guess I would say probably 1 month or 2 or 3 away if this price stays where it is from them saying, you know what, I do have $800 a month more in my pocket and I could afford to go and buy x.

A number of the merchants and retailers have been launching their own apps in an effort to get people to come straight to their digit [ph], and then, hopefully, control more of the transaction, as well as the relationship with the consumer when they're inside their app, as compared to coming the usual way. So it depends who you believe, but everybody is making projections based on, well, whatever they think about where these 3 will go over the next 2 years. And my sense is you're going to get NFC growing decently, but it's really with terminalization. And I believe terminalization will happen with all the EMV and chip migration, as well as the fact that all the new terminals are coming contactless-equipped. So you're probably seeing a 2- or 3-year cycle of a fairly dramatic increase in contactless-equipped terminals in the United States. That's only happening, by the way, in Australia and Canada, Turkey and some other countries. But the U.S., which is the large one, I think you'll see that. In terms of browsing, browsing tends to be the large chunk. And I still believe that online browsing will remain a pretty large number for a few years to come. And I think you will get 2 or 3 kinds of efforts there. You'll get a lot of effort made around improving the card on file experience. Then you'll get a lot of these efforts made around improving the use of easy-use checkout wallets, whether it be MasterPass or Visa's offering or PayPal or other such offerings. And I think you'll get all of those getting a degree of capabilities built with tokenization, just making it safer and safer over the next few quarters. So we are all working on similar things. And I don't think you should read too much into a quarter here or a quarter there. These things are slow burns. You saw Apple Pay talk about their mobile payment growth. But at the end of the day, yes, they've done a great job and it's excited the market, but it's still a very small percentage of what the total number of transactions are. So I will take all this in that context and not drive to the races with more than that. We're very focused on -- tokenization is [indiscernible], just to make sure I don't miss that aspect. It's a very important aspect of where we're going for safety and security. Apple Pay was the first version of that to come out. We're putting it into MasterPass, just regular MasterPass, over the next few period of time, let me put it that way, so I don't give you information that's beyond what is likely. And that will be, you'll see in 1 year or 2's time, tokenization will become kind of table stakes in the game on e-commerce. So that's what I would hope."

So first of all, with the last comment, of course, we listen to each other's comments from time to time, and I would believe that we do a hedging strategy and have a hedging philosophy that is extremely similar. We lay in our -- layer in our hedges over a 12 months volume period, so we never run, so to speak, naked during any type of period. But we do it for this most significant currency pairs. So I think you know that we are doing, actually, business in 150-plus currencies, but we really pick the most significant currency pairs in order to do our hedging. In order to do hedging, you have to have really appropriate exposure forecast coming out over the next 12 months rolling period, and that is where you typically take a step back and take a little bit of a more conservative view and don't layer in 100% of the exposure in terms of hedges. You do 50% to 75%. So we don't take a view -- the 50% to 75% is not taking a view in terms of hedging a particular currency pair, but it is in terms of making sure that between the old exposure that we know and the hedges that we lay on, that we have the right kind of balance. The one other thing that I wanted to let you know is just to make sure, we are hedging things on a net basis, which means we take revenues in that particular currencies and we deduct the operating expenses that we spend in that particular currency, and then we do a net hedge on that, and you would not see the gain or the loss of the hedge showing up in the revenue line. Most of that is actually reflected in our G&A line item."

You go in and you tend to hedge more of the exposure in the immediate quarter out there, a little less in the quarter after, a little less in the quarter after, a little even lesser in the quarter after. And so when Martina talks to you about the 50% to 75%, you're probably looking at a higher-level hedge in the immediate quarter because you have most certainty of that net exposure between those currency pairs, as she just said, for 2. You hedge a little less out 4 quarters because you have less certainty in those currency pairs that she's referring to. Also remember, the euro and the real are not being discussed in those currency pairs. The 2 percentage points headwind as we've already put in our revenue growth estimate for next year is from these currency pairs. The euro and the real comes over and beyond that and kind of could be a far more significant one, particularly because of the euro, as Martina was pointing out."

And I'm going just leave you with a few closing thoughts. We ended what I think was a very good year on a strong note. I mean, 17% revenue growth in fourth quarter x FX, 14% with FX, that's not a bad place to be. Volumes, share, innovation, deals, we've done all of that while navigating through what I would say was one of the more complex economic and political years that I've seen over the last decade. And aside from the actual couple of years of the financial crisis, this was probably one of the more difficult years. 
For 2015, we see the same underlying trends economically and for our own business. We believe that we will deliver our 3-year objectives, and that means that net revenue growth this year will be in the high single-digit range at constant currency. So your question will be, why is that growth lower than 2014? Because, one, we have those local FX headwinds that we were just discussing in the Q&A and those 30 currency pairs. And so that's before the euro, by the way, and the real translation impact, which as you know, is larger. But just those local FX headwinds and because we have some very good deals in the pipeline, both renewals and wins, that are probably going to have an upfront load. But those are good deals, they're good for us. 
And so if you look at all that at the same time, we plan to keep investing in our business and our capabilities. We know how to dial our expenses up and down. And we're going to keep a very close eye on that, if needed. I just don't want to do that through short-term cycle. We took advantage of the tax benefits that, while sustainable, as Martina talked about, they came to us in the latter part of the quarter and got finalized. And she and I sat down and said, ""You know what, this is a good time. Apple Pay is out on the market. Prices initiatives is out of the market. It's a good seasonal quarter for us. Let's take some of these benefits and put it back into the system."" Those kinds of decisions are taken every week and every day by us together as a team. 
So overall, we haven't changed our thinking about our business prospects from what we indicated at our Investor Day a few months ago, or rather, the 2 investor days. 
The payment space is a terrific place to be. We are very confident in our ability to guide this company through a current mixed environment. We're going to keep growing share and we're going to keep driving the conversion of cash to electronic payments around the world. I think we can expect to continue to deliver strong financial performance in the foreseeable future. 
So thank you so much for your continued support of our company. Thank you for taking the time to join us today."

Good morning, everybody. In the first quarter, we have reported net revenue growth of 3%, and that's 8% after adjusting for currency.

In the first quarter, we have reported net revenue growth of 3%, and that's 8% after adjusting for currency. And that, combined with a decrease in operating expense of 1%, or an increase of 3% on an ethics adjusted basis, is what helped us drive EPS growth of 22%, and that number is 29% when adjusted for currency. So as we expected and, I guess, no different from other large global companies, FX is having a noticeable impact on our results and especially the euro and real, both have depreciated about 18% against the U.S. dollar versus this time last year, that is last year's first quarter. 
However, our EPS growth continues to be strong, both on as reported and an ethics adjusted basis. So as usual, let's begin to look at some of the current underlying global economic trends and let's start with the United States. Our spending data, showed that U.S. retail sales growth x auto was 1.1% in the first quarter and that's down from the fourth quarter growth rate of 2.9%, and that deceleration continues basically to be due to lower gas prices. If you were to exclude auto and gas, retail sales growth was 5.1% for the first quarter versus 4.1% for the fourth quarter, and that shows a healthier growth rate. So what I think is happening is that consumer are only using a small portion of that savings from gas to buy new goods and services, rather what they are doing is using those savings from gas to increase their personal savings rate, which looks like it declined to the highest level since December 2012. And they're probably using it to pay down some debt. And therefore, any additional consumer spend has not been enough to make up for the lower gas spending. 
However, underlying economic indicators have remained steady. Unemployment levels are stable, consumer sentiment is tracking upwards. So when you look at our U.S. business, lower gas prices had an impact of about 2 percentage points on our U.S. GDV growth rate, which is slightly greater than the 1 percentage point headwind we saw in the fourth quarter. GDV growth, excluding gas and process transactions, were essentially the same as last quarter. 
In Europe, the environment there are showing signs of improvement. And across the region consumer confidence, economic confidence, economic sentiment, unemployment levels have all slightly improved over the prior quarter. Consumer confidence in the U.K. has reached a 13-year high in March, and U.K. retail sales also continue to gain momentum with spending data in the U.K. showing that first quarter retail sales growth of 3.8% is up from the 3.6% in the fourth quarter. 
And MasterCard's total European volume growth for the first quarter was in the mid-teens, processed transaction growth in the low 20s, very similar to the last quarter. 
Latin America, that continues to be challenged economically, and our first quarter and postnatal for Brazil showed retail sales growth basically flat. And that's down from the almost 1% growth in the fourth quarter and as the Brazilian economy settles into some form of recession and unemployment levels are continuing to rise. Lower oil prices are also slowing Mexico's economic recovery, but there, consumer spending has held steady. And the region's annual GDP growth is now expected to be around 0.8%, and that's down slightly from the earlier projections of 1%. 
But despite those challenges, our business in the region remain solid. First quarter GDV and processed transaction growth is in the mid-teens, which is the same last last quarter. 
In Asia-Pacific, business sentiment is currently held steady in the first quarter, led by the continued optimism of Indian companies about economically funds, but way down by the Chinese economic slowdown. Consumer confidence across the region is still highly, despite some recent declines, and our business in the region is continuing to do well. GDV growth in the mid-teens the same as last quarter. Processed transaction growth of the low 20s, down slightly from the last quarter. 
So overall, when you put all this together, economic environment in the U.S. and Europe are showing signs of improvement, but challenges still remain in some areas of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. 
and our business continues to be impacted by the strong U.S. dollar, but the underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong and we run the business for those underlying fundamentals, and that's what's going to help us navigate through these economic and dollar challenges. 
So before we go to our business highlights, let me quickly update you on the European regulatory matters on Russia and on China. So I'll start with the European registration related to the card payments. The European Parliament and the Council of Ministers have signed the final text. We expect official publication of the legislation in the next couple of weeks. Interchange caps will become effective 6 months later, so sometime towards the end of the year. And all other parts of the legislation will apply starting 12 months after the effective date, so we are talking mid-2016 for that. 
In Russia, we've actually successfully migrated our local card transactions to the new domestic NSPK platform by the April 1 deadline. And we were the first network to do so. The network requirements of the Russian the legislation will have no service disruption to card orders and without searching domestic transactions through area, but we're continuing to provide all the value-added services to our customers through our direct capabilities. In terms of the financial impact to our business, no change in our previous estimate of something less than $50 million on an annualized basis of additional costs. 
Last week, as you all read, China announced that international payment companies, like MasterCard, will be allowed to establish domestic switching operations in China. Of this security a large opportunity for us over the next long-term decade or whichever way you look at it, it's a great opportunity. It's a large marketplace, and they're keen to play there, and we are encouraged by the announcement. We want to switch domestic transaction in China. As soon as possible, we want to leverage the investments we already made in that market. But having said that, there are number of steps that need to be completed before we reach that point. Detailed regulations are yet to be issued. Some combination of the people Bank of China and the China Banking Regulatory Commission will put out the details originations over the next data of time. It's unclear to me exactly when those will get published. We will need to then submit a license application. Clearly, they're already preparing that, so we can go over that as soon as the regulations are issued. Then, we'll meet to work with government, get their application up, satisfy the detailed requirements of the regulations, so we don't really know how long that process will take for sure. But we do know some of the requirements already today, so there is, for example, a capital commitment required to the tune of roughly USD 160 million. We also know we'll need to provide some form of unsourced switching. And as you know, we have distributed network processes, but in addition to those, we have been investing on soil in China over the last period of time. We will need to assess the extent to which those existing investments already satisfy what regulations need and do whatever else is required to meet their needs, and then we will be the right place to be able to fully capable -- to be able to fully capable of taking advantage of these new domestic switching regulations. 
So all that said, the full requirements only to become clear when these detailed relations are issued. I kind of think that we should expect to be in a position to switch in China sometime toward the end of 2016. And obviously, as it moves more quickly, that's great for us. But in the meantime, there's a lot of people in the company working very hard to get ready for this opportunity to take advantage of it as soon as we possibly can. 
So recent business activity. During the quarter, we signed a number of new agreements and renewals supporting the expansion of our business around the world, and let me give you a few examples. The first, we enhanced our global partnership at Citi. City, as you know, is the world's largest credit card issuer. They have got a new an expanded 10-year agreement to move all that proprietary consumer credit and debit card portfolios to MasterCard. In Brazil, we signed a new 20-year agreement with Itaú, and that further strengthens our long-term strategic relationship with the institution that is truly our largest customer in the Latin American region. And this agreement increases our share of Itaú's credit, debit and prepaid portfolios. It gives us exclusive rights to switch all of the domestic and international transactions, allows us to create a new payment network in Brazil jointly with Itaú and us. Of course, that's subject -- the last part is subject to getting regulatory approval. But overall, we are very pleased with this opportunity to be a stronger partner of both Citibank and Itaú's. 
In the meanwhile, we signed new agreements of a Berkeley card in the U.K. They're converting a significant part of that commercial card business to MasterCard. In Ireland, we signed with the Bank of Ireland to convert the commercial and consumer credit portfolios to MasterCard. Having these deals should help us substantially increase our share in the commercial credit market in the U.K. and our overall credit share in Ireland. 
In New Zealand, Westpac and New Zealand are going to convert the points of both credit and commercial programs to MasterCard branded courts. So developments in different parts of the world. 
Meanwhile, we're continuing we did on our innovation efforts across the digital space. And starting with MasterPass. Last quarter, I mentioned our MasterPass platform was live in 16 countries around the world. And I'm very pleased to share that we since added Korea to the list of live markets, as well as more than doubled our global merchant acceptance of MasterPass to nearly 1.25 million merchants, and there are more in the pipeline, on those [indiscernible] more to come. 
So some specific examples of our progress include: We announced a 3-year strategic partnership and relationship with McDonald's in the U.A.E. and across 14 key markets in Middle East, Africa and Europe. And what we're doing with them is introducing contactless payments in their restaurants and enabling MasterPass for online ordering. One of the area of MasterPass is gaining momentum is transit. We just recently announced the global partnership with cubic transportation systems that are leading provider for smart city transit solutions in London and Chicago and other such cities. As part of their agreement, MasterPass will be integrated with Kubrick's ticketing and journey planning up, which already means we'll have to accelerate conversion of cash payments in transit into these digital payments. 
So quick service restaurants, the McDonald's example, transit systems, the cubic example, here are just 2 of what we are doing to extend our reach in cash. Couple of other examples that always mobile point of sales. Remember that mobile is not just about underlying consumers to make payments with their phones. It is actually bit in even more interesting option is to involve expanding acceptance to merchants who previously have no ability to take electronic payments to standard POS terminals. You had a number of those mobile point-of-sale rollout this quarter. In Nigeria, we part to the first bank of Nigeria and the guaranteed trust back. we've got MTOS devices to micro small and medium businesses that accept card transactions for the first time. In Hungary, we partnered with the insurance company of ligands to provide their sales agent with an MTOS device that accepts chip and contactless cards, submissively that client don't need to make cash payments at a post office or through a bank transfer. They can use that card and MPOS device that's with the insurance agent. 
So beginning in the mobile front. We all launch of Apple payment interest. And as you know, there were the first digital giant to enter that space. And as you know, the new Apple Watch has Apple Pay capabilities built into it. But in March, we also announced that we're working with Samsung to enable Samsung Pay, which will soon launch in the United States. 
You probably heard us talk about the factor of the technology agnostic when it comes to mobile and digital payments and we've determined to support implementations based on different market models. And one of the first implementations of the cloud-based mobile solution is that Bank of Australia, which has recently launched the tap and paid mobile payment solution across Android devices. 
Another example of a different mobile model is our recently announced agreement with the Egyptian government that we will extend financial services to more than 54 million Egyptians, but providing a platform that links of their national ID with the first national mobile wallet. included in the program is the financial inclusion aspect, but it's much broader because it provides every Egyptian  citizen with the tools to electronically receive government payments at a companion card to be used and purchases, bill payments, domestic evidences. 
And finally, a little word about our recent announcement about the intention to acquire Applied Predictive Technologies. APT is a leading cloud-based analytics company that platform basically enables companies across a number of industries to use their own data to accurately measure the profit impact of marketing, of merchandising, of operations, of capital initiatives. And last quarter, we talked about the acquisition of 5 1, a retail consulting and analytics firm. And by adding APT's capabilities with 5 1, what we're trying to do is advance capably to deliver differentiated products to merchants. And on analytic and consulting capabilities, in our own shop, along with our global footprint, will allow for the expansion of APT's platform and, of course, 5 1s, that's a for both of us. So we expect to complete this APT acquisition sometime over the second quarter. 
With that, I will turn it over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operating metrics. Martina?"

Although the Brazilian real have some impact, the differential was primarily driven by the euro-U.S. based dollar exchange rate. So here, you can see EPS growth continues to be strong at 22% on an as-reported basis and 29% after adjusting for currency. Continued revenue momentum, good cost controls and executing on our tax strategies and the current share repurchase program all contributed to that performance. 
I'd like to point out a few items here and then I talk about the major P&L line items in the subsequent slides. So first of all,, acquisitions that we made in 2014 drove $0.02 of dilution. Second, you can see the tax rate was favorable at 23.9% in the quarter, primarily due to our continued focus on initiatives to better align our tax structure with our business footprint, as well as a discreet item that resulted in our ability to claim foreign tax credit in the U.S. of this quarter. Third, share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased 11 million shares as a cost of about $947 million. And through April 22, we have purchased an additional 2.7 million shares at a cost of approximately $240 million. And we now have 2.8 billion remaining under the current authorization. 
Lastly, cash flow from operations was a little over $911 million. We ended the quarter with cash, clash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $5.9 billion. 
So let me turn to Page 4. Here, you can see as usual our operational metrics for the first quarter. Our gross dollar volume or GDV was up 12% on a local currency basis, down slightly from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV was 7%, made up of credit and debit growth of 5% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV was about 1% down from last quarter, primarily due to the increased headwinds from lower gas prices. Set differently, this means that gas had a 2 PPT impact in the first quarter of 2015 versus a 1 PPT impact in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 15% on a local currency basis, about the same as last quarter and primarily driven by Turkey, Sweden and Canada. Cross-border volume, you can see grew 19% on a local currency basis, and that is the same of what we saw in the fourth quarter, which continues to be primarily driven by Europe. Growth in Europe was in the low 20s with the U.K., Germany, Italy and Sweden as key contributors to the growth. 
On Page 5, you see processed transactions grew 12% globally to $11 billion, and we continue to see double-digit growth in most regions. Growth increased from the 11% that we saw in the fourth quarter, primarily due to Europe and it was again driven by Sweden, Russia, Poland and Netherlands, similar to last quarter. 
Globally, the number of cards grew 8% with $2.2 billion MasterCard and branded cards. 
I'm now turning to Page 6 for highlights of view of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 3% as reported or 8% when you adjust for currency. This differential is due to the currency headwinds, primarily from the euro-U.S. based dollar exchange rate. Additionally, the impact of local currency exchange rates was about 2 PPT headwind. Acquisitions also contributed a little more than 2 PPT to the net revenue growth. And after you exclude the impact of both local and functional currencies, as well as the impact of acquisitions, we saw underlying net revenue growth of 8%. This reflects the underlying volume performance we expected, as well as a higher level of rebates and incentives that I talked about on our last earnings call. Specifically, rebates and incentives grew 25% in line with our expectations, primarily driven by the front-loaded impact over the life of the contract from certain customer renewals, which, Ajay mentioned in his comments. 
Now let me look it be at the other individual revenue line items on an FX adjusted basis. Domestic assessments grew 8%, while worldwide GDV grew 12%. This 4 PPT gap is primarily due to the impact of local currency, somewhat offset by pricing. Cross-border volume fees grew 9%, but cross-border grew 9%. Of the 10 PPT gap, the majority is due to a higher mix of inter-Europe activity, as well as some local currency impact. Transaction processing fees grew 13%, primarily driven by the 12% growth in processed transactions. 
And finally, other revenues grew 29%, which continues to be driven largely by contributions from our pinpoint acquisition, as well as our advisers business. 
Moving on to Page 7. You can see that total operating expenses decreased 1% in the quarter but increased 3% on an FX adjusted basis. Overall, M&A activities contributed 9 PPT to total expense growth. 
So let me spend a minute on G&A, which grew only 1% year-over-year, and explain how that happened. First, we continue to organically invest in our strategic initiatives, while managing our expenses very carefully. As a result, the underlying level of G&A expense grew 2 PPT this quarter. Second, acquisitions added 10 PPT to this growth quarter. This is in the G&A line, as we made a number of acquisitions in the second half of last year, which haven't yet last into our base run rate. However, these factors were offset by 2 FX related gains that were $69 million higher than last year or 11 PPT, and thus lowered overall G&A expense growth to 1%. 
The first was FX gains related to our normal hedging activities, mainly due to the depreciating U.S. dollar. and the second was a balance sheet remeasurement again, primarily related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. 
With that, let me turn to Slide 8 and let's discuss what we have seen in April through the 21st. Most of our business drivers are similar to what we experienced in the first quarter. The numbers through April 21 are as follows. Starting with processed volume, we saw a global growth of 10%, similar to the first quarter. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 4%, the same as what we saw last quarter, including run rate, a 2 PPT impact from lower gas prices. Processed volume outside the U.S. grew 16%, about 1 PPT lower than the first quarter, with growth of mid to high teens in each region. 
And globally, processed transaction growth was 12% and that's similar to what we saw in the first quarter, with double-digit growth in all regions except the U.S, which grew in the mid-single digits. And with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew at 17% globally, down 2 PPT from our first quarter growth. While the U.S. saw somewhat under growth in April, most other regions saw a deceleration. 
Looking ahead, let me start with some commentary about full year 2015. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar impacting many U.S. multinationals, including us, I'm going to start by summarizing our thoughts about FX. And remember, currency impacts us in 2 ways: First, since the beginning of the year, the significant depreciation of the euro and the real, the Brazilian real, versus the U.S. dollar, has increased the impact of the functional FX translation since my January commentary. If the rates for our functional currencies remain similar to where we are today -- they are today, that the euro trading at the EUR 1.09 level and the Brazilian real at the BRL 2.94 for the rest of the year, the net impact of the euro and real would be a 6 to 8 PPT headwind, mostly from the euro actually to our as-reported results for the full year. And it's depending on what line item we are talking about. So revenue, net income or EPS. 
Second, we have the impact of local currency rates, relatively to the functional currencies. And we continue to expect some net headwind throughout the year, both to revenue and the bottom line. And based on the current rates, this is still likely to be in the 2 PPT range, similar to our estimate in late January. The impact of this is already included in our FX adjusted guidance. 
At current FX rates, both of these impacts will provide a headwind of about $700 million to net revenue and about $300 million to net income for full year 2015. 
So with that as a backdrop, now let me get into some specific P&L line items. Our underlying business remain strong. However, some components of our 2015 outlook have changed due to the impact of FX, that I just talked about, and our latest acquisition, Applied Predictive Technologies or APT. On an FX adjusted basis, we continue to expect high single-digit net revenue growth for 2015, including roughly 2 PPT from our M&A transactions. We're seeing good traction for many of our recent portfolio wins and new product initiatives. However, revenue growth will be impacted by some items specific to 2015, which we highlighted back in January. The first, as we have already seen in the first quarter, a couple of significant contract renewals that provide the foundation for future growth come with the front-loaded incentives over the life of the contract than our typical agreements. And the next 3 quarters will reflect that, too. 
Second, while the Chase conversion to a competitor is essentially no complete, we will continue to see the lapping impact over the remainder of 2015. So on an as-reported basis, the net revenue growth rates will now likely be in the low single-digit range as a result of the stronger FX headwinds than we forecasted at the beginning of the year, primarily from the euro functional translation. And based on the current FX rates, this will be about a 6 PPT impact. 
Moving to rebates and incentives. Let me direct some questions we've been getting about what we mean by you front-loaded incentives. This is a reference to tinkering more incentives in the earlier years of a contract. Also, with the recent signings, we now expect full year 2015 rebate and incentive growth to be similar to what we saw in Q1 with as somewhat harder growth rate in the second quarter. 
Overall, we now project the growth rate for total operating expenses to full year 2015 to be in the mid-single digits on an FX adjusted basis. And this continues to be predominantly due to the roughly 7 PPT impact from our announced M&A activities, with more of that impact occurring in the first half of the year. However, as-reported expense growth will now likely be in the low single-digit range after considering a roughly 4 PPT tailwind from the euro and the real translation. 
Let me give you an update on potential dilution from M&A activities, with the expected addition of APT by the end of the second quarter. We now project total EPS dilution would be about $0.11 to $0.13 to for full year 2015. Less than half of the expected diffusion is due to the amortization of acquired intangible. 
As I said in the last quarter, you should assume a full year 2015 tax rate of about 28%. That has not changed, but it's due to the continued benefit we expect from the tax initiative I discussed in our January earnings call. 
And given all the detail I just went through, let me just step back and summarize a bit here. The continue to expect solid fundamentals that drive our underlying business in 2015 and that's despite a mixed economic environment, as well as of the more significant headwinds from FX than we expected back in January. As you can see, we continue to sign customer contracts and we continue to invest in the right strategic areas, while managing our expenses prudently. 
Finally, let me move on to our long-term performance objectives of 2013 to '15 for that period, which remained unchanged from what I said on our year-end earnings call back in late January. Given our expectations for 2015 revenue growth, we expect to deliver our low-end of the 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR range. We continue to expect at least 20% EPS CAGR for the 3-year period due continued expense management, as well as benefits from our lower tax rate and share repurchases. And we will remain committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%. Just remember, these objectives are on a constant currency basis and they do exclude our 2014 M&A activities, as well as any new ones that might occur this year. 
As far as owning our performance objectives forward, again, nothing different from what I said in January. The overall growth prospects for the payments industries have not changed. The underlying drivers of our business remain solid and we are expanding our reach in areas that we're strategically targeting, such as processing, the guilty, information services and all things digital. We will provide you with our new long-term objective before the end of this year, most likely at our Investor Day in September.

They go to banks, they go to consumer product companies, depending on what kind of need for analytical capability that company has.

One is their own sales force, which essentially reaches merchants and thus the analytical capability like us offset the service provider, as provide on the computer screens of individuals in the merchant management system. And the other way, of course, will be through our own sales force in our advisers and information services business, where we believe we can add value to what they're doing. So the idea is to you put sales forces, but to embed the capability in the clients end-use systems by embedding the Software-as-a-Service approach to the business. That's what APT does. It's a little different from the way we do our current data stuff, which tends to be more engagement by engagement, and that's the difference in the 2 models.

You must be the only guy who think China is answerable in quick questions, right? But I -- Craig, the fact is that the data around China and the current economic of the domestic payment system, which is asking about, is opaque because that is a public data obviously available. But what I do know from all the many trips I've but make and then a better part of 10 to 12 years is that interchange rates on domestic transactions tend to be lower than the interchange rates that you would see on the average across the world in both credit and debit. You need to know that credit domestically is much smaller than debit today. And in fact, the largest use of payment cards domestically in China today is to take out cash from an ATM. And an even larger use is for the cards to remain dormant. This is the marketplace of that is ready in spending activity on cards across all categories. It's a marketplace with a very large domestic card issuance with a fairly large dormant card base with what is used -- being used for taking out cash sort of ATM on a bank branch rather than the point-of-sale use with lower credit use than debit. It's a typical early-stage electronic payments developing market with 1 dynamic, which is an interchange rate, are lower than you would normally expected. Network economics depend on what you were able to strike deals with a different issuers and merchants. I'm going to reserve my judgment and that I get my chance to really get into those deals because right now, they don't have those deals. our deals tend to be on cross-border use of these cards, both outward and inward. And so we grabbed we can see how it goes. But there's no denying one big enormous volume you can get and if European is constructed like us where we have a relatively low variable cost per transaction, that is an attractive opportunity. There's no denying that because you need to know a lot of work with insurers, you need to do a lot of work with merchants and acquire us to drive acceptance. There's a lot of things to be done over the next few years, but I see it as a really large and interesting opportunity for companies like ours."

I've seen like consumer optimistic because they think serving so from that gas prices. Although gas price substantially. And if you did an average individual households math, you are probably putting between $8 million and $10 million from the spending on gas, which could be available to go into other avenues. So they're optimistic because if you left that money in that pocket. What they're doing with it, is there pay down some debt, which you can see in the numbers on consumer debt across the country, both in revolving debt, but also into personal and secured loans. And also, to an extent, in mortgages. And then you can see that some of the market is printed -- the savings rate and saving rates, I think, in March has high as 5.8%. They've gone down to 2% 6, 7 months ago. As you remember, just after the crisis, they were at 6% and 7%. So I don't know the 5.8% is a bad thing for the country for the long term by the way. Probably a good thing. But probably not all the money is coming out into goods and services spending, so when a company like ours because we don't really get any benefit out of all higher spending rate directly, we don't get any benefit out of a high saving rates directly. we also getting the benefit out of lower pay down of that. We don't get me any benefit. We get benefit when this spend. And overall spending is not going in the form that you would see it once you added gas back in. That's what we're seeing. Now it doesn't -- an amount into this, which that luxury good sales and you can see in the results there are number of other luxury goods of retailers, recently, others like that. Their sales are not going the way they were 6, 8 months ago. And most of that, I think, is caused by the fact that inbound tourist arrivals into the U.S. and their spending patterns, given the relative strength of the dollar to the euro, the Japanese yen, the Brazilian real, the people who are spending of course, Russian coming in as much as they were some time ago, all that is impacting luxury good spending, which also, by the way, feeds them to the total retail spend numbers. So that's a little extra digging probably more than you wanted, but that's what's going on. Now I don't see that as a long-term issue. I actually not even a medium term issue. I think easy to reason probably improving over the next few months. I think you'll see Americans traveling out in the summer. I think you'll see others coming in and they're coming in somewhat different pattern of consumer spending over the next 2 to 6 months, just because underlying consumer sentiment is positive. So that's I see right now."

So I'd just like to put that genie in a bottle where it belongs. It's very important. It's very critical for securitizing -- for security digital transactions. No doubt, it's got an implementation time line, which will take some time for it to become more ubiquitous than just the phone-based transaction today. That's the concepts I'd like to put it in. We are very committed to it. They're investing a large amount of money in ensuring our capabilities in it. they're investing money and rolling it out into other markets overseas and different people claim different dates and reach the markets. I will tell you, discount all that that you see it in the market, this is not an easy thing to get done. It's not an easy thing to roll out. So we're working very hard on that. As far as the actual adoption by merchants of different -- or the request by merchants think about different interchange rates their budget, look at the end of the day, this card-not-present rate from the can't presently, both have been applying for a period of time. If digitization were to become ubiquitous, will there be a change in those 2 buckets of rates?  Will there be a third with 1 move down, 1 move up? Or there be 4, 5 different buckets, that's just speculation right now.

So of course, we are going to do that, but we're going to do that with a very astute and careful Expense Management that we have put into the company. So that's our put together. It gets to that mid-single digit growth number for the year. In terms of the Venezuelan bolivar, so a couple of things on that. First of all, part of our business in Venezuela is in bolivars. Part of our board business in Venezuela is in U.S. dollars. The business that we have in bolivars in Venezuela is done as such as we can take the bolivars out of the country, right? The currency has currency restrictions. So what we have engaged like any other multinationals, international hedging strategies that allow us over time to be protecting the investment that we have in this country. Part of that hedging strategy involves for us to actually take up a loan sometime ago where we bought some real property in the country. And what happens when you have a devaluation of that currency of the Bolivar, is you actually having to devalue that monetary asset to loan, and that was also the gain. That gain is basically buffering. The impact that we will be having from the Bolivar devaluation on our revenues for the year, that's about a $40 million impact to our top line that's all included in the discussions that I have with you this morning for 2015 revenues. But that's how this works."

So first of all, on the M&A investments, what we are typically targeting is -- so first of all, we're looking at every M&A transaction from a discounted cash flow analysis, right?

And we typically like to see a pay back over a Tier 2 or 3-year period from a cash flow point of view. That does not necessarily narrow the accounting view, simply because accounting is done differently than what you see coming through in the cash. But again, and we've said it a numbers of people, we try to hope to get to the dilution impact of no more than 2 years. And so you should be seeing these acquisitions coming to fruition, the 2014 acquisition sometime later in 2016, as well as the 2015 acquisitions that we're doing, which APT is the big one at this point in time. You would be seeing that coming through later in 2017. So that's how we think about acquisition. From a rebates and incentive point of view, I'll just have to remind you every deal is different, right? We have 1,000 of deals, every deal is different. Every year, we're writing hundreds of deals. When you look at some deals, you can get out quick payback, it could be in the 6, 7, 9 months period, but it also depends when you have cards converting or whether you have that portfolio already and you're do just making out of the portfolio, i.e. encouraging more volume in transactions coming on. Some of the bigger deals might have a longer payback because you have to do certain investments in order to encourage that portfolio to behave the way that you would like it to behave. So it's -- mostly, I have to tell you, it's a fairly wide range in terms of the payback calculation."

So I'm not asking for a way to x acquisitions into infinity. It's too early for an acquisition. So Martina something in this conversation about the 2014 acquisition is what she's excluding from the guidance because of '14 and '15, we didn't do that 2-year period. The deals we did before that has a prepaid worldwide, which is taken from travel x or DataCash that we bought or other of that type are all in our base. And frankly, without access prepaid worldwide, I doubt we will have achieved the kind of success we've achieved on our prepaid business over the last 5 years as we've gone from a small market share to one of the largest players in the business around the world today. So we get to think back and it's just that we kind of make sure you understand that our guidance is exclusing them for 2 years because I don't know what deal I'm going to do when I give you the guidance for the 2 years.

Our deals has constructed in such a way that we give higher rebates incentives for those clients will deliver more volume and transactions to us.

I just refer to prepaid and we talked about the acquisitions and the healthy from Access Prepaid worldwide to help us in the prepaid program management business. I consider that to be an opportunity still for various reasons. One of those is there's an increasing design across the world to get to the underserved in financial inclusion terms. Clearly, prepaid this the best product in some form or the other, with the deliver court or deliver through the phone or delivered through a fingerprint to that population. It reduces the risk, it's more appropriate for governments to transfer. Benefits, it's better for NGOs. I think you'll see the numbers go there. Those tend to come with lower economics because those people to take out cash first and use it at a point of sale later in the development cycle. This low part of our percentage. So yes, we're getting a mix of growth from commercial and prepaid. And I think commercial will keep going and I think prepaid will different economics from commercial."

6477196,289283810,797502,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. In the first quarter, we have reported net revenue growth of 3%, and that's 8% after adjusting for currency. And that, combined with a decrease in operating expense of 1%, or an increase of 3% on an FX-adjusted",2410,"Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. In the first quarter, we have reported net revenue growth of 3%, and that's 8% after adjusting for currency. And that, combined with a decrease in operating expense of 1%, or an increase of 3% on an FX-adjusted basis, is what helped us drive EPS growth of 22%, and that number is 29% when adjusted for currency. So as we expected and I guess no different from other large global companies, FX is having a noticeable impact on our results and especially as the euro and real both have depreciated about 18% against the U.S. dollar versus this time last year, that is last year's first quarter. 
However, our EPS growth continues to be strong, both on as reported and an FX-adjusted basis. So as usual, let's begin to look at some of the current underlying global economic trends and let's start with the United States. Our SpendingPulse data, showed that U.S. retail sales growth x auto was 1.1% in the first quarter, and that's down from the fourth quarter growth rate of 2.9%. And that deceleration continues basically to be due to lower gas prices. If you were to exclude auto and gas, retail sales growth was 5.1% for the first quarter versus 4.1% for the fourth quarter, and that shows a healthier growth rate. So what is I think is happening is that consumers are only using a small portion of that savings from gas to buy new goods and services, rather what they are doing is using those savings from gas to increase their personal savings rate, which looks like it's climbed to the highest level since December 2012. And they're also probably using it to pay down some debt. And therefore, any additional consumer spend has not been enough to make up for the lower gas spending. 
However, underlying economic indicators have remained steady. Unemployment levels are stable, consumer sentiment is tracking upwards. So when you look at our U.S. business, lower gas prices had an impact of about 2 percentage points on our U.S. GDV growth rate, which is slightly greater than the 1 percentage point headwind we saw in the fourth quarter. GDV growth, excluding gas and processed transactions, were essentially the same as last quarter. 
In Europe, the environment there are showing signs of improvement. And across the region, consumer confidence, economic sentiment, unemployment levels have all slightly improved over the prior quarter. Consumer confidence in the U.K. has reached a 13-year high in March, and U.K. retail sales also continue to gain momentum with SpendingPulse data in the U.K. showing that first quarter retail sales growth of 3.8% is up from the 3.6% in the fourth quarter. And MasterCard's total European volume growth for the first quarter was in the mid-teens, processed transaction growth in the low 20s, very similar to the last quarter. 
Latin America, there continues to be challenged economically. And our first quarter SpendingPulse data for Brazil showed retail sales growth basically flat. And that's down from the almost 1% growth in the fourth quarter as the Brazilian economy settles into some form of recession and unemployment levels are continuing to rise. Lower oil prices are also slowing Mexico's economic recovery, but their consumer spending has held steady. And the region's annual GDP growth is now expected to be around 0.8%, and that's down slightly from the earlier projections of 1%. 
But despite those challenges, our business in the region remain solid. First quarter GDV and processed transaction growth is in the mid-teens, which is the same as last quarter. 
In Asia-Pacific, business sentiment has kind of held steady in the first quarter, led by the continued optimism of Indian companies about economic refunds, but weighed down by the Chinese economic slowdown. Consumer confidence across the region is still high, despite some recent declines, and our business in the region is continuing to do well. GDV growth in the mid-teens is the same as last quarter. Processed transaction growth in the low 20s, down slightly from the last quarter. 
So overall, when you put all this together, economic environment in the U.S. and Europe are showing signs of improvement, but challenges still remain in some areas of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. 
And our business continues to be impacted by the strong U.S. dollar, but the underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong, and we run the business for those underlying fundamentals. And that's what's going to help us navigate through these economic and dollar challenges. 
So before we go to our business highlights, let me quickly update you on the European regulatory matters on Russia and on China. So I'll start with the European registration related to card payments. The European Parliament and the Council of Ministers have signed the final text. We expect official publication of the legislation in the next couple of weeks. Interchange caps will become effective 6 months later, so sometime towards the end of the year. And all other parts of the legislation will apply, starting 12 months after the effective date, so we are talking mid-2016 for that. 
In Russia, we've actually successfully migrated our local card transactions to the new domestic NSPK platform by the April 1 deadline, and we were the first network to do so. The master requirements of the Russian legislation will have no service disruption to cardholders and without switching domestic transactions through NSPK, but we're continuing to provide all the value-added services to our customers through our direct capabilities. In terms of the financial impact to our business, no change in our previous estimate of something less than $50 million on an annualized basis of additional costs. 
Last week, as you all read, China announced that international payment companies, like MasterCard, will be allowed to establish domestic switching operations in China. Obviously and clearly, a large opportunity for us over the next long-term decade. Or whichever way you look at it, it's a great opportunity. It's a large marketplace, and they're keen to play there, and we are encouraged by the announcement. We want to switch domestic transaction in China. As soon as possible, we want to leverage the investments we've already made in that market. But having said that, there are number of steps that need to be completed before we reach that point. Detailed regulations are yet to be issued. Some combination of the People's Bank of China and the China Banking Regulatory Commission will put out those detailed regulations over the next period of time. It's unclear to me exactly when those will get published. We will need to then submit a license application. Clearly, we're already preparing that, so we can go over that as soon as the regulations are issued. Then, we'll need to work with the government, get that application approved, satisfy the detailed requirements of the regulations, so we don't really know how long that process would take for sure. But we do know some of the requirements already today. So there is, for example, a capital commitment required to the tune of roughly USD 160 million. We also know we'll need to provide some form of on-soil switching. And as you know, we have distributed network processes, but in addition to those, we have been investing on-soil in China over the last period of time. We will need to assess the extent to which those existing investments already satisfy what regulations need and do whatever else is required to meet their needs, and then we will be in the right place to be able to fully capable -- to be able to fully capable of taking advantage of these new domestic switching regulations. 
So all that said, the full requirements only become clear when these detailed relations are issued. I kind of think that we should expect to be in a position to switch in China sometime towards the end of 2016. And obviously, as it moves more quickly, that's great for us. But in the meantime, there's a lot of people in the company working very hard to get ready for this opportunity to take advantage of it as soon as we possibly can. 
So recent business activity. During the quarter, we signed a number of new agreements and renewals supporting the expansion of our business around the world. And let me give you a few examples. The first, we enhanced our global partnership at Citi. Citi, as you know, is the world's largest credit card issuer. We now got a new and expanded 10-year agreement to move all that proprietary consumer credit and debit card portfolios to MasterCard. In Brazil, we signed a new 20-year agreement with Itaú, and that further strengthens our long-term strategic relationship with the institution that is truly our largest customer in the Latin American region. And this agreement increases our share of Itaú's credit, debit and prepaid portfolios. It gives us exclusive rights to switch all of their domestic and international transactions, allows us to create a new payment network in Brazil jointly with Itaú and us. Of course, that's subject -- the last part is subject to getting regulatory approvals. But overall, we are very pleased with this opportunity to be a stronger partner of both Citibank's and Itaú's. 
And meanwhile, we signed new agreements with Barclaycard in the U.K. They're converting a significant part of their commercial card business to MasterCard. In Ireland, we signed with the Bank of Ireland to convert to commercial and consumer credit portfolios to MasterCard. Having these deals should help us substantially increase our share in the commercial credit market in the U.K. and our overall credit share in Ireland. 
In New Zealand, Westpac and New Zealand are going to convert the Airpoints reward credit and commercial programs to MasterCard-branded cards. So developments in different parts of the world. 
Meanwhile, we're continuing with all our innovation efforts across the digital space. And starting with MasterPass. Last quarter, I mentioned our MasterPass platform was live in 16 countries around the world. And I'm very pleased to share that we've since added Korea to the list of live markets, as well as more than doubled our global merchant acceptance of MasterPass to nearly 0.25 million merchants, and there are more in the pipeline. It's like one of those ads you hear on TV that says, ""Wait, there's more to come.""
So some specific examples of our progress include: We announced a 3-year strategic partnership and relationship with McDonald's in the U.A.E. and across 14 key markets in Middle East, Africa and Europe. And what we're doing with them is introducing contactless payments in their restaurants and enabling MasterPass for online ordering. 
Another area where MasterPass is gaining momentum is transit. We just recently announced a global partnership with Cubic Transportation Systems. They are leading provider for smart city transit solutions in London and Chicago and other such cities. As part of that agreement, MasterPass will be integrated with Cubic's NextWave ticketing and journey planning app, which really means we'll have to accelerate conversion of cash payments in transit into these digital payments. 
So quick-service restaurants, the McDonald's example; transit systems, the Cubic example, here are just 2 of what we are doing to extend our reach in cash stronghold. A couple of other examples are always mobile point of sales. Remember that mobile is not just about relying consumers to make payments with their phones. It's actually -- an even more interesting option is to involve expanding acceptance to merchants who previously have no ability to take electronic payments to standard POS terminals. You've had a number of those mobile point-of-sale rollouts this quarter. In Nigeria, we partnered with First Bank of Nigeria and the Guaranty Trust Bank. We've got MPOS devices to micro, small and medium businesses that accept card transactions for the first time. In Hungary, we partnered with the insurance company Alliance to provide their sales agents with an MPOS device that accepts mag stripe chip and contactless cards. So basically, their clients don't need to make cash payments at a post office or through a bank transfer. They can use their card and the MPOS device that's with the insurance agent. 
So continuing with the mobile front. We've all watched the launch of Apple Pay with great interest. And as you know, they were the first digital giant to enter that space. And as you now know, their new Apple Watch has Apple Pay capabilities built into it. But in March, we also announced that we're working with Samsung to enable Samsung Pay, which will soon launch in the United States. 
You've probably heard us talk about the fact that we're technology agnostic when it comes to mobile and digital payments, and we're determined to support implementations based on different market models. And one of the first implementations of the cloud-based mobile solution is that Commonwealth Bank of Australia, who just recently launched their tap-and-pay mobile payment solution across Android devices. 
Another example of a different mobile model is our recently announced agreement with the Egyptian government that we will extend financial services to more than 54 million Egyptians by providing the platform that links their national ID with the first national mobile wallet. Included in the program is the financial-inclusion aspect, but it's much broader because it provides every Egyptian citizen with the tools to electronically receive government payments, add a companion card to be used in purchases, bill payments, domestic remittances [ph].
And finally, a little word about our recent announcement about the intention to acquire Applied Predictive Technologies. APT is a leading cloud-based analytics company. Their platform basically enables companies across a number of industries to use their own data to accurately measure the profit impact of marketing, of merchandising, of operations, of capital initiatives. And last quarter, we talked about the acquisition of 5one, a retail consulting and analytics firm. And by adding APT's capabilities with 5one's, what we're trying to do is advance that ability to deliver differentiated products to merchants. And our analytic and consulting capabilities, in our own shop, along with our global footprint, will allow for the expansion of APT's platform and, of course, 5one's, and that's a win-win for both of us. So we expect to complete this APT acquisition sometime over the second quarter. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operating metrics. Martina?"
6477196,289283810,797502,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck, where you can see the difference between as reported and FX-adjusted growth rates for this quarter. Although the Brazilian real have some impact, the differential was pr",2214,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck, where you can see the difference between as reported and FX-adjusted growth rates for this quarter. 
Although the Brazilian real have some impact, the differential was primarily driven by the euro-U.S. based dollar exchange rate. So here, you can see EPS growth continues to be strong at 22% on an as-reported basis and 29% after adjusting for currency. Continued revenue momentum, good cost controls and executing on our tax strategies and the current share repurchase program all contributed to that performance. 
I'd like to point out a few items here and then I talk about the major P&L line items in the subsequent slides. So first of all, acquisitions that we made in 2014 drove $0.02 of dilution. Second, you can see the tax rate was favorable at 23.9% in the quarter, primarily due to our continued focus on initiatives to better align our tax structure with our business footprint, as well as a discrete item that resulted in our ability to claim foreign tax credits in the U.S. this quarter. Third, share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share. During the first quarter, we repurchased 11 million shares at a cost of about $947 million. And through April 22, we repurchased an additional 2.7 million shares at a cost of approximately $240 million. And we now have 2.8 billion remaining under the current authorization. 
Lastly, cash flow from operations was a little over $911 million. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $5.9 billion. 
So let me turn to Page 4. Here, you can see as usual our operational metrics for the first quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV was up 12% on a local currency basis, down slightly from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 7%, made up of credit and debit growth of 5% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV was about 1% down from last quarter, primarily due to the increased headwinds from lower gas prices. Set differently, this means that gas had a 2 ppt impact in the first quarter of 2015 versus a 1 ppt impact in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 15% on a local currency basis, about the same as last quarter and primarily driven by Turkey, Sweden and Canada. Cross-border volume, you can see grew 19% on a local currency basis. That is the same of what we saw in the fourth quarter, which continues to be primarily driven by Europe. Growth in Europe was in the low 20s with the U.K., Germany, Italy and Sweden as key contributors to the growth. 
On Page 5, you see processed transactions grew 12% globally to $11 billion, and we continue to see double-digit growth in most regions. Growth increased from the 11% that we saw in the fourth quarter, primarily due to Europe. And it was again driven by Sweden, Russia, Poland and Netherlands, similar to last quarter. Globally, the number of cards grew 8%, with $2.2 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards. 
Now I'm turning to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 3% as reported or 8% when you adjust for currency. This differential is due to the currency headwinds, primarily from the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate. Additionally, the impact of local currency exchange rates was about 2 ppt headwind. Acquisitions also contributed a little more than 2 ppt to the net revenue growth. And after you exclude the impact of both local and functional currencies, as well as the impact of acquisitions, we saw underlying net revenue growth of 8%. This reflects the underlying volume performance we expected, as well as a higher level of rebates and incentives that I talked about on our last earnings call. Specifically, rebates and incentives grew 25% in line with our expectations, primarily driven by the front-loaded impact over the life of the contract from certain customer renewals, which Ajay mentioned in his comments. 
Now let me look quickly at the other individual revenue line items on an FX-adjusted basis. Domestic assessments grew 8%, while worldwide GDV grew 12%. This 4 ppt gap is primarily due to the impact of local currency, somewhat offset by pricing. Cross-border volume fees grew 9%, but cross-border volume grew 19%. Of the 10 ppt gap, the majority is due to a higher mix of inter-Europe activity, as well as some local currency impact. Transaction processing fees grew 13%, primarily driven by the 12% growth in processed transactions. 
And finally, other revenues grew 29%, which continues to be driven largely by contributions from our pinpoint acquisition, as well as our Advisors business. 
Moving on to Page 7. You can see that total operating expenses decreased 1% in the quarter but increased 3% on an FX-adjusted basis. Overall, M&A activities contributed 9 ppt to total expense growth. 
So let me spend a minute on G&A, which grew only 1% year-over-year, and explain how that happened. First, we continue to organically invest in our strategic initiatives, while managing our expenses very carefully. As a result, the underlying level of G&A expense grew 2 ppt this quarter. Second, acquisitions added 10 ppt to this growth quarter. This is in the G&A line, as we made a number of acquisitions in the second half of last year, which haven't yet lapped into our base run rate. However, these factors were offset by 2 FX-related gains that were $69 million higher than last year or 11 ppt, and thus lowered overall G&A expense growth to 1%. 
The first was FX gains related to our normal hedging activities, mainly due to the appreciating U.S. dollar. And the second was a balance sheet remeasurement gains, primarily related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. 
With that, let me turn to Slide 8, and let's discuss what we have seen in April through the 21st. Most of our business drivers are similar to what we experienced in the first quarter. The numbers through April 21 are as follows. Starting with processed volume, we saw a global growth of 10%, similar to the first quarter. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 4%, the same as what we saw last quarter, including roughly, a 2 ppt impact from lower gas prices. Processed volume outside the U.S. grew 16%, about 1 ppt lower than the first quarter, with growth of mid to high teens in each region. 
And globally, processed transaction growth was 12%. And that's similar to what we saw in the first quarter, with double-digit growth in all regions except the U.S, which grew in the mid-single digits. And with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew at 17% globally, down 2 ppt from our first quarter growth. While the U.S. saw somewhat higher growth in April, most other regions saw a deceleration. 
Looking ahead, let me start with some commentary about full year 2015. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar impacting many U.S. multinationals, including us, I'm going to start by summarizing our thoughts about FX. And remember, currency impacts us in 2 ways: First, since the beginning of the year, the significant depreciation of the euro and the real, the Brazilian real, versus the U.S. dollar, has increased the impact of the functional FX translation since my January commentary. If the rates for our functional currencies remain similar to where we are today -- they are today, that is the euro trading at the EUR 1.09 level and the Brazilian real at the BRL 2.94 level for the rest of the year, the net impact of the euro and real would be a 6 to 8 ppt headwind, mostly from the euro actually to our as-reported results for the full year. And it's depending on what line item we are talking about, so revenue, net income or EPS. 
Second, we have the impact of local currency rates, relatively to the functional currencies. And we continue to expect some net headwind throughout the year, both to revenue and the bottom line. And based on the current rates, this is still likely to be in the 2 ppt range, similar to our estimate in late January. The impact of this is already included in our FX-adjusted guidance. 
At current FX rates, both of these impacts will provide a headwind of about $700 million to net revenue and about $300 million to net income for full year 2015. 
So with that as a backdrop, now let me get into some specific P&L line items. Our underlying business remain strong. However, some components of our 2015 outlook have changed due to the impact of FX, as I just talked about, and our latest acquisition, Applied Predictive Technologies or APT. On an FX-adjusted basis, we continue to expect high single-digit net revenue growth for 2015, including roughly 2 ppt from our M&A transactions. And we're seeing good traction for many of our recent portfolio wins and new product initiatives. However, revenue growth will be impacted by some items specific to 2015, which we highlighted back in January. The first, as we have already seen in the first quarter, a couple of significant contract renewals that provide the foundation for future growth come with more front-loaded incentives over the life of the contract than our typical agreements. And the next 3 quarters will reflect that, too. 
Second, while the Chase conversion to a competitor is essentially now complete, we will continue to see the lapping impact over the remainder of 2015. So on an as-reported basis, the net revenue growth rate will now likely be in the low single-digit range as a result of the stronger FX headwinds than we forecasted at the beginning of the year, primarily from the euro functional translation. And based on the current FX rates, this would be about a 6 ppt impact. 
Moving to rebates and incentives. Let me direct some questions we've been getting about what we mean by front-loaded incentives. This is a reference to incurring more incentives in the earlier years of a contract. Also, with the recent deal signings, we now expect full year 2015 rebate and incentive growth to be similar to what we saw in Q1 with as somewhat harder growth rate in the second quarter. 
Overall, we now project the growth rate for total operating expenses to full year 2015 to be in the mid-single digits on an FX-adjusted basis. And this continues to be predominantly due to the roughly 7 ppt impact from our announced M&A activities, with more of that impact occurring in the first half of the year. However, as-reported expense growth will now likely be in the low single-digit range after considering a roughly 4 ppt tailwind from the euro and the real translation. 
Let me give you an update on potential dilution from M&A activities, with the expected addition of APT by the end of the second quarter. We now project total EPS dilution will be about $0.11 to $0.13 to for full year 2015. Less than half of the expected dilution is due to the amortization of acquired intangibles. 
As I said in the last quarter, you should assume a full year 2015 tax rate of about 28%. That has not changed, but it's due to the continued benefit we expect from the tax initiative I discussed in our January earnings call. 
And given all the detail I just went through, let me just step back and summarize a bit here. We continue to expect solid fundamentals to drive our underlying business in 2015, and that's despite a mixed economic environment as well as of the more significant headwinds from FX than we expected back in January. As you can see, we continue to sign customer contracts and we continue to invest in the right strategic areas, while managing our expenses prudently. 
Finally, let me move on to our long-term performance objectives of 2013 to '15 for that period, which remained unchanged from what I said on our year-end earnings call back in late January. Given our expectations for 2015 revenue growth, we expect to deliver our low-end of the 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR range. We continue to expect at least 20% EPS CAGR for the 3-year period due to continued expense management as well as benefits from our lower tax rate and share repurchases. And we remain committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%. Just remember, these objectives are on a constant currency basis, and they do exclude our 2014 M&A activities as well as any new ones that might occur this year. 
As far as rolling our performance objectives forward, again, nothing different from what I said in January. The overall growth prospects for the payments industries has not changed. The underlying drivers of our business remain solid, and we are expanding our reach in areas that we're strategically targeting, such as processing, loyalty, information services and all things digital. We will provide you with our new long-term objective before the end of this year, most likely at our Investor Day in September.

One is their own sales force, which essentially reaches merchants and embeds the analytical capability like a Software-as-a-Service provider, a SaaS provider on the computer screens of individuals in the merchant management system. And the other way, of course, will be through our own sales force in our advisers and information services business, where we believe we can add value to what they're doing.

It's a little different from the way we do our current data stuff, which tends to be more bespoke engagement by engagement. And that's the difference in the 2 models. And I think that speaks for both in this growing big data market."

You must be the only guy who thinks that China is answerable in quick questions, right? But I -- Craig, the fact is that the data around China and the current economics of the domestic payment system, which is what you're asking about, is opaque because there is no public data obviously available. What I do know from all the many trips I've been making there now for the better part of 10 to 12 years is that interchange rates on domestic transactions tend to be lower than the interchange rates that you would see on the average across the world in both credit and debit. You need to know that credit domestically is much smaller than debit today. And in fact, the largest use of payment cards domestically in China today is to take out cash from an ATM. And an even larger use is for the cards to remain dormant. So this is not a marketplace that is ready in spending actively on cards across all categories. It's a marketplace with a very large domestic card issuance with a fairly large dormant card base with what is used -- being used more for taking out cash sort of ATM on a bank branch rather than a point-of-sale use with lower credit use than debit. It's a typical early-stage electronic payments developing market with one dynamic, which is that interchange rates are lower than you would normally have expected. Network economics depend on what you're able to strike deals with the different issuers and merchants. I'm going to reserve my judgment on that till I get my chance to really get into those deals because right now, we don't have those deals. Our deals tend to be on cross-border use of these cards, both outward and inward. And so we're going to have to wait and see how that goes. But there's no denying one big enormous volume you can get and if your P&L is constructed like us where we have a relatively low variable cost per transaction, that is an attractive opportunity. There's no denying that. You'll need to do a lot of work with issuers. You'll need to do a lot of work with merchants and acquirers to drive acceptance. There's a lot of things to be done over the next few years, but I see it as a really large and interesting opportunity for companies like ours."

We talked a little bit about where the U.S. is high. I feel like consumers are optimistic because they're seeing savings from the gas price. After all, gas prices are down substantially.

I feel like consumers are optimistic because they're seeing savings from the gas price. After all, gas prices are down substantially. And if you did an average individual household's math, you probably are pulling between $8 billion and $10 billion out from the spending on gas, which could be available to go into other avenues. So they're optimistic because they feel that money in their pocket. What they're doing with it, is they're paying down some debt, which you can see in the numbers on consumer debt across the country, both in revolving debt, but also in personal and secured loans and also, to an extent, in mortgages. And then you can see that some of the money is currently being used to bump up personal savings rate. And personal saving rates were, I think, in March as high as 5.8%. They had gone down to 2% 6, 7 months ago. As you remember, just after the crisis, they were at 6% and 7%. So I don't know if the 5.8% is a bad thing for the country long term, by the way. It's probably a good thing. But I think what's going on here is that not all the money is coming out into goods and services spending, so where a company like us because we don't really get any benefit out of a higher spending rate directly. We don't get any benefit out of a high savings rate, I'm sorry, directly. We also don't get any real benefit out of a lower paydown of debt. We don't get any said benefit. We get benefit when they spend. And overall spending is not growing in the form that you would see it once you added gas back in. That's what we're seeing. Now doesn't -- an extra nugget into this, which that luxury good sales and you can see it in the results of -- a number of the luxury goods, retailers, Coach recently, others like that. Their sales are not growing the way they were 6, 8 months ago. And most of that, I think, is caused by the fact that inbound tourist arrivals into the U.S. and their spending patterns, given the relative strength of the dollar to the euro, the Japanese yen, the Brazilian real, the people who are spending, of course, the Russian aren't coming in as much as they were some time ago. All that is impacting luxury good spending, which also by the way feeds them to the total retail spend numbers. So that's a little extra digging probably more than you wanted, but that's what's going on. Now I don't see this as a long-term issue. I actually -- not even a medium-term issue. I think you'll see tourism reason probably improving over the next few months. I think you'll see Americans traveling out in the summer. I think you'll see others coming in, and I think they're going to look at a somewhat different pattern of consumer spending over the next 3 to 6 months, just because underlying consumer sentiment is positive. So that's how I the see bar."

That's kind of what we've all said. The idea right now is to ensure tokenization gets adopted in the market. And remember, even if you do something in January, with the tokenization rates, right now, tokenization is only going in for transactions over the phone, over mobile phone kind of transactions. And as you know, from your own research and details on this, that's still a small part of total expenditure and transactions in the United States. So I'd just like to put that genie into its bottle and where it belongs. It's very important. It's very critical for securitizing -- for securing digital transactions. No doubt, it's got an implementation time line, which is going to take some time for it to become more ubiquitous than just the phone-based transactions today. That's the context I'd like to put it in. We are very committed to it. They're investing a very large sum of money in ensuring our capabilities in it. We're investing money and rolling it out into other markets overseas and different people claim different dates when they're going to reach the markets. I will tell you, discount all that till you see it in the market. This is not an easy thing to get done. It's not an easy thing to roll out. So we're working very hard on that. As far as the actual adoption by merchants of different -- or the request by merchants to think about different interchange rates are concerned, look, at the end of the day, this card's now present rate from this card's present rates, and both have been applying for a period of time. If digitization were to become ubiquitous, will there be a change in those 2 buckets of rates? Will there be a third with 1 move down, 1 move up? Or there be 4, 5 different buckets, that's just speculation right now. We are far away from a stage where tokenized transactions comprise an adequate percentage of the total to drive great changes in the marketplace, other than the excitement around finally getting a really secured system for digital transactions."

It goes -- gets to that mid-single digit growth number for the year. In terms of the Venezuelan bolivar, so a couple of things on that. First of all, part of our business in Venezuela is in bolivars. Part of our business in Venezuela is in U.S. dollars. The business that we have in bolivars in Venezuela is done as such as that we can't take the bolivars out of the country, right? The currency has currency restrictions. So what we have engaged, like any other multinationals, international hedging strategies that allow us over time to be protecting the investment that we have in this country. Part of that hedging strategy involves for us to actually take up a loan sometime ago where we bought some real property in the country. And what happens when you have a devaluation of that currency of the Bolivar, is you actually having to devalue that monetary asset to loan, and that was also in the gain. That gain is basically buffering the impact that we will be having from that bolivar devaluation on our revenues for the year. That's about a $40 million impact to our top line. That's all included in the discussions that I have with you this morning for 2015 revenues. But that's how this works."

That does not necessarily mirror the accounting view, simply because accounting often is done differently than what you'd see coming through in the cash. But again, and we've said that a number of times publicly, we try to hope to get to the dilution impact of no more than 2 years. And so you should be seeing these acquisitions coming to fruition, the 2014 acquisition sometime later in 2016, as well as the 2015 acquisitions that we're doing, which APT is the big one at this point in time. You would be seeing that coming through later in 2017. So that's how we think about acquisitions. From a rebates and incentive point of view, I just have to remind you every deal is different, right? We have 1,000 of deals, every deal is different. Every year, we're writing hundreds of deals. When you look at some deals, you can get actually a relatively quick payback. It could be in the 6-, 7-, 9-month period, but it also depends when you have cards converting or whether you have that portfolio already and you're do just making out of the portfolio, i.e. you're encouraging more volume and transactions coming on. Some of the bigger deals might have a longer payback because you have to do certain investments in order to encourage that portfolio to behave the way that you would like it to behave.

The deals we did before that, Access Prepaid Worldwide, which was taken from Travelex, or DataCash that we bought, or others of that type, are all in our base. And frankly, without Access Prepaid Worldwide, I doubt we will have achieved the kind of success we've achieved on our prepaid business over the last 5 years as we've gone from a small market share to one of the largest players in the business around the world today.

It's not just large commercial. Inside our commercial business, it certainly is some of the large commercial businesses, but also there's all the small business, and there's portions of business we're doing where we use MasterCard's virtual card number capability to intervene in the flow between businesses. So there's a number of things inside the commercial business. And maybe over the -- one of the things we could do at Investor Day is to give you guys a little more insight into the different things we're doing around the commercial business. And we probably should do that. But it's not more than just the large commercial insight. I actually continue to believe that we have a real opportunity for growth as a company in that space because we have a series of good assets that we have put together from our virtual card number capability to our ability with our acceptance being superior to that of certain other brands, which will remain unnamed, to our ability to do business across the world with one technology across all the regions. There's a number of advantages there, which I still believe commercial has that we can play with. It's a data capability with smart data. There's a whole series of these. So I still think of that as a big and decent opportunity. On prepaid, yes, prepaid's been growing well over the last 3 to 4 years. I just refer to prepaid and we talked about the acquisitions and the help we got from Access Prepaid Worldwide to help us in the prepaid program management business. I consider that to be an opportunity still for various reasons. One of those is there's an increasing desire across the world to get to the underserved, in financial inclusion terms. Clearly, prepaid is the best product in some form or the other, where they deliver on your card or delivered over the phone or delivered through a fingerprint for that population. It reduces the risk. It's more appropriate for governments to transfer. Benefits, it's better for NGOs. No luck. So I think you'll see numbers grow there. Those tend to come with lower economics because those people tend to take out cash first and use it at a point of sale later in that development cycle. But this lull part of our [indiscernible] growth percentage. So yes, we're getting a mix of growth from commercial and prepaid. And I think commercial will keep growing, and I think prepaid will but with different economics from commercial."

Great. Well, thank you, all, for your questions and we'll leave you with a couple of closing thoughts. We just talked about this in the Q&A, but the world economy continues to be complicated and things aren't completely clear yet. But the U.S. looks to be in better shape and people aren't yet spending all their savings from lower gas prices as I was explaining in response to Sanjay's question, but it's there. They're spending excess gas, and I believe you will see improvements in there. I think Europe is slowly improving, but the Russian economy remains challenged. And that's a fairly large economy around the world to have that challenging. In Asia and Latin America markets, with economics problems as well. Currency moves have added to the challenges. I think we're managing our way through it with tight cost controls. The strong underlying dynamics of our business remain unchanged. Our momentum continues. We're launching new products. We're working with the digital giants. We're working with banks, getting new deals from them. We're building new relationships with merchants that are acquiring things to help us cement those relationships. That's all good stuff. We're very focused on all the right things.

6477196,289283810,797649,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. In the first quarter, we have reported net revenue growth of 3%, and that's 8% after adjusting for currency. And that, combined with a decrease in operating expense of 1%, or an increase of 3% on an FX-adjusted",2414,"Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. In the first quarter, we have reported net revenue growth of 3%, and that's 8% after adjusting for currency. And that, combined with a decrease in operating expense of 1%, or an increase of 3% on an FX-adjusted basis, is what helped us drive EPS growth of 22%, and that number is 29% when adjusted for currency. So as we expected and I guess no different from other large global companies, FX is having a noticeable impact on our results and especially as the euro and real both have depreciated about 18% against the U.S. dollar versus this time last year, that is last year's first quarter. 
However, our EPS growth continues to be strong, both on as reported and an FX-adjusted basis. So as usual, let's begin to look at some of the current underlying global economic trends and let's start with the United States. Our SpendingPulse data, showed that U.S. retail sales growth x auto was 1.1% in the first quarter, and that's down from the fourth quarter growth rate of 2.9%. And that deceleration continues basically to be due to lower gas prices. If you were to exclude auto and gas, retail sales growth was 5.1% for the first quarter versus 4.1% for the fourth quarter, and that shows a healthier growth rate. So what is I think is happening is that consumers are only using a small portion of that savings from gas to buy new goods and services, rather what they are doing is using those savings from gas to increase their personal savings rate, which looks like it's climbed to the highest level since December 2012. And they're also probably using it to pay down some debt. And therefore, any additional consumer spend has not been enough to make up for the lower gas spending. 
However, underlying economic indicators have remained steady. Unemployment levels are stable, consumer sentiment is tracking upwards. So when you look at our U.S. business, lower gas prices had an impact of about 2 percentage points on our U.S. GDV growth rate, which is slightly greater than the 1 percentage point headwind we saw in the fourth quarter. GDV growth, excluding gas and processed transactions, were essentially the same as last quarter. 
In Europe, the environment there are showing signs of improvement. And across the region, consumer confidence, economic sentiment, unemployment levels have all slightly improved over the prior quarter. Consumer confidence in the U.K. has reached a 13-year high in March, and U.K. retail sales also continue to gain momentum with SpendingPulse data in the U.K. showing that first quarter retail sales growth of 3.8% is up from the 3.6% in the fourth quarter. And MasterCard's total European volume growth for the first quarter was in the mid-teens, processed transaction growth in the low 20s, very similar to the last quarter. 
Latin America, there continues to be challenged economically. And our first quarter SpendingPulse data for Brazil showed retail sales growth basically flat. And that's down from the almost 1% growth in the fourth quarter as the Brazilian economy settles into some form of recession and unemployment levels are continuing to rise. Lower oil prices are also slowing Mexico's economic recovery, but their consumer spending has held steady. And the region's annual GDP growth is now expected to be around 0.8%, and that's down slightly from the earlier projections of 1%. 
But despite those challenges, our business in the region remain solid. First quarter GDV and processed transaction growth is in the mid-teens, which is the same as last quarter. 
In Asia-Pacific, business sentiment has kind of held steady in the first quarter, led by the continued optimism of Indian companies about economic reforms, but weighed down by the Chinese economic slowdown. Consumer confidence across the region is still high, despite some recent declines, and our business in the region is continuing to do well. GDV growth in the mid-teens is the same as last quarter. Processed transaction growth in the low 20s, down slightly from the last quarter. 
So overall, when you put all this together, economic environment in the U.S. and Europe are showing signs of improvement, but challenges still remain in some areas of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. 
And our business continues to be impacted by the strong U.S. dollar, but the underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong, and we run the business for those underlying fundamentals. And that's what's going to help us navigate through these economic and dollar challenges. 
So before we go to our business highlights, let me quickly update you on the European regulatory matters on Russia and on China. So I'll start with the European registration related to card payments. The European Parliament and the Council of Ministers have signed the final text. We expect official publication of the legislation in the next couple of weeks. Interchange caps will become effective 6 months later, so sometime towards the end of the year. And all other parts of the legislation will apply, starting 12 months after the effective date, so we are talking mid-2016 for that. 
In Russia, we've actually successfully migrated our local card transactions to the new domestic NSPK platform by the April 1 deadline, and we were the first network to do so. We met the requirements of the Russian legislation will have no service disruption to cardholders and without switching domestic transactions through NSPK, but we're continuing to provide all the value-added services to our customers through our direct capabilities. In terms of the financial impact to our business, no change in our previous estimate of something less than $50 million on an annualized basis of additional costs. 
Last week, as you all read, China announced that international payment companies, like MasterCard, will be allowed to establish domestic switching operations in China. Obviously and clearly, a large opportunity for us over the next long-term decade. Or whichever way you look at it, it's a great opportunity. It's a large marketplace, and they're keen to play there, and we are encouraged by the announcement. We want to switch domestic transaction in China. As soon as possible, we want to leverage the investments we've already made in that market. But having said that, there are number of steps that need to be completed before we reach that point. Detailed regulations are yet to be issued. Some combination of the People's Bank of China and the China Banking Regulatory Commission will put out those detailed regulations over the next period of time. It's unclear to me exactly when those will get published. We will need to then submit a license application. Clearly, we're already preparing that, so we can go with that as soon as the regulations are issued. Then, we'll need to work with the government, get that application approved, satisfy the detailed requirements of the regulations, so we don't really know how long that process would take for sure. But we do know some of the requirements already today. So there is, for example, a capital commitment required to the tune of roughly USD 160 million. We also know we'll need to provide some form of on-soil switching. And as you know, we have distributed network processors, but in addition to those, we have been investing on-soil in China over the last period of time. We will need to assess the extent to which those existing investments already satisfy what regulations need and do whatever else is required to meet their needs, and then we will be in the right place to be able to fully capable -- to be able to fully capable of taking advantage of these new domestic switching regulations. 
So all that said, the full requirements only become clear when these detailed regulations are issued. I kind of think that we should expect to be in a position to switch in China sometime towards the end of 2016. And obviously, as it moves more quickly, that's great for us. But in the meantime, there's a lot of people in the company working very hard to get ready for this opportunity to take advantage of it as soon as we possibly can. 
So recent business activity. During the quarter, we signed a number of new agreements and renewals supporting the expansion of our business around the world. And let me give you a few examples. The first, we enhanced our global partnership at Citi. Citi, as you know, is the world's largest credit card issuer. We've now got a new and expanded 10-year agreement to move all that proprietary consumer credit and debit card portfolios to MasterCard. In Brazil, we signed a new 20-year agreement with Itaú, and that further strengthens our long-term strategic relationship with the institution that is today our largest customer in the Latin American region. And this agreement increases our share of Itaú's credit, debit and prepaid portfolios. It gives us exclusive rights to switch all of their domestic and international transactions, allows us to create a new payment network in Brazil jointly with Itaú and us. Of course, that's subject -- the last part is subject to getting regulatory approvals. But overall, we are very pleased with this opportunity to be a stronger partner of both Citibank's and Itaú's. 
And meanwhile, we signed new agreements with Barclaycard in the U.K. We're converting a significant part of their commercial card business to MasterCard. In Ireland, we signed with the Bank of Ireland to convert to commercial and consumer credit portfolios to MasterCard. Having these deals should help us substantially increase our share in the commercial credit market in the U.K. and our overall credit share in Ireland. 
In New Zealand, Westpac and Air New Zealand are going to convert the Airpoints reward credit and commercial programs to MasterCard-branded cards. So developments in different parts of the world. 
Meanwhile, we're continuing with all our innovation efforts across the digital space. And starting with MasterPass. Last quarter, I mentioned our MasterPass platform was live in 16 countries around the world. And I'm very pleased to share that we've since added Korea to the list of live markets, as well as more than doubled our global merchant acceptance of MasterPass to nearly 0.25 million merchants, and there are more in the pipeline. It's like one of those ads you hear on TV that says, ""Wait, there's more to come.""
So some specific examples of our progress include: We announced a 3-year strategic partnership and relationship with McDonald's in the U.A.E. and across 14 key markets in Middle East, Africa and Europe. And what we're doing with them is introducing contactless payments in their restaurants and enabling MasterPass for online ordering. 
Another area where MasterPass is gaining momentum is transit. We just recently announced a global partnership with Cubic Transportation Systems. They are a leading provider for smart city transit solutions in London and Chicago and other such cities. As part of that agreement, MasterPass will be integrated with Cubic's NextWave ticketing and journey planning app, which really means it will help to accelerate conversion of cash payments in transit into these digital payments. 
So quick-service restaurants, the McDonald's example; transit systems, the Cubic example, here are just 2 of what we are doing to extend our reach in cash stronghold. A couple of other examples are always mobile point of sales. Remember that mobile is not just about relying consumers to make payments with their phones. It's actually -- an even more interesting option is to involve expanding acceptance to merchants who previously have no ability to take electronic payments to standard POS terminals. You've had a number of those mobile point-of-sale rollouts this quarter. In Nigeria, we partnered with First Bank of Nigeria and the Guaranty Trust Bank. We've got MPOS devices to micro, small and medium businesses that accept card transactions for the first time. In Hungary, we partnered with the insurance company Alliance to provide their sales agents with an MPOS device that accepts mag stripe chip and contactless cards. So basically, their clients don't need to make cash payments at a post office or through a bank transfer. They can use their card and the MPOS device that's with the insurance agent. 
So continuing on the mobile front. We've all watched the launch of Apple Pay with great interest. And as you know, they were the first digital giant to enter that space. And as you now know, their new Apple Watch has Apple Pay capabilities built into it. But in March, we also announced that we're working with Samsung to enable Samsung Pay, which will soon launch in the United States. 
You've probably heard us talk about the fact that we're technology agnostic when it comes to mobile and digital payments, and we're determined to support implementations based on different market models. And one of the first implementations of the cloud-based mobile solution is that Common of Bank of Australia, who just recently launched their tap-and-pay mobile payment solution across Android devices. 
Another example of a different mobile model is our recently announced agreement with the Egyptian government where we will extend financial services to more than 54 million Egyptians by providing the platform that links their national ID with the first national mobile wallet. Included in the program is the financial-inclusion aspect, but it's much broader because it provides every Egyptian citizen with the tools to electronically receive government payments, add a companion card to be used in purchases, bill payments, domestic remittances.
And finally, a little word about our recent announcement about the intention to acquire Applied Predictive Technologies. APT is a leading cloud-based analytics company. Their platform basically enables companies across a number of industries to use their own data to accurately measure the profit impact of marketing, of merchandising, of operations, of capital initiatives. And last quarter, we talked about the acquisition of 5one, a retail consulting and analytics firm. And by adding APT's capabilities with 5one's, what we're trying to do is advance that ability to deliver differentiated products to merchants. And our analytic and consulting capabilities, in our own shop, along with our global footprint, will allow for the expansion of APT's platform and, of course, 5one's, and that's a win-win for both of us. So we expect to complete this APT acquisition sometime over the second quarter.

Let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck, where you can see the difference between as reported and FX-adjusted growth rates for this quarter. Although the Brazilian real have some impact, the differential was pr",2212,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck, where you can see the difference between as reported and FX-adjusted growth rates for this quarter. 
Although the Brazilian real have some impact, the differential was primarily driven by the euro-U.S. based dollar exchange rate. So here, you can see EPS growth continues to be strong at 22% on an as-reported basis and 29% after adjusting for currency. Continued revenue momentum, good cost controls and executing on our tax strategies and the current share repurchase program all contributed to that performance. 
I'd like to point out a few items here and then I talk about the major P&L line items in the subsequent slides. So first of all, acquisitions that we made in 2014 drove $0.02 of dilution. Second, you can see the tax rate was favorable at 23.9% in the quarter, primarily due to our continued focus on initiatives to better align our tax structure with our business footprint, as well as a discrete item that resulted in our ability to claim foreign tax credits in the U.S. this quarter. Third, share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share. During the first quarter, we repurchased 11 million shares at a cost of about $947 million. And through April 22, we repurchased an additional 2.7 million shares at a cost of approximately $240 million. And we now have 2.8 billion remaining under the current authorization. 
Lastly, cash flow from operations was a little over $911 million. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $5.9 billion. 
So let me turn to Page 4. Here, you can see as usual our operational metrics for the first quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV was up 12% on a local currency basis, down slightly from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 7%, made up of credit and debit growth of 5% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV was about 1% down from last quarter, primarily due to the increased headwinds from lower gas prices. Set differently, this means that gas had a 2 ppt impact in the first quarter of 2015 versus a 1 ppt impact in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 15% on a local currency basis, about the same as last quarter and primarily driven by Turkey, Sweden and Canada. Cross-border volume, you can see grew 19% on a local currency basis. That is the same of what we saw in the fourth quarter, which continues to be primarily driven by Europe. Growth in Europe was in the low 20s with the U.K., Germany, Italy and Sweden as key contributors to the growth. 
On Page 5, you see processed transactions grew 12% globally to $11 billion, and we continue to see double-digit growth in most regions. Growth increased from the 11% that we saw in the fourth quarter, primarily due to Europe. And it was again driven by Sweden, Russia, Poland and Netherlands, similar to last quarter. Globally, the number of cards grew 8%, with $2.2 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards. 
Now I'm turning to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 3% as reported or 8% when you adjust for currency. This differential is due to the currency headwinds, primarily from the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate. Additionally, the impact of local currency exchange rates was about 2 ppt headwind. Acquisitions also contributed a little more than 2 ppt to the net revenue growth. And after you exclude the impact of both local and functional currencies, as well as the impact of acquisitions, we saw underlying net revenue growth of 8%. This reflects the underlying volume performance we expected, as well as a higher level of rebates and incentives that I talked about on our last earnings call. Specifically, rebates and incentives grew 25% in line with our expectations, primarily driven by the front-loaded impact over the life of the contract from certain customer renewals, which Ajay mentioned in his comments. 
Now let me look quickly at the other individual revenue line items on an FX-adjusted basis. Domestic assessments grew 8%, while worldwide GDV grew 12%. This 4 ppt gap is primarily due to the impact of local currency, somewhat offset by pricing. Cross-border volume fees grew 9%, but cross-border volume grew 19%. Of the 10 ppt gap, the majority is due to a higher mix of intra-Europe activity, as well as some local currency impact. Transaction processing fees grew 13%, primarily driven by the 12% growth in processed transactions. 
And finally, other revenues grew 29%, which continues to be driven largely by contributions from our pinpoint acquisition, as well as our Advisors business. 
Moving on to Page 7. You can see that total operating expenses decreased 1% in the quarter but increased 3% on an FX-adjusted basis. Overall, M&A activities contributed 9 ppt to total expense growth. 
So let me spend a minute on G&A, which grew only 1% year-over-year, and explain how that happened. First, we continue to organically invest in our strategic initiatives, while managing our expenses very carefully. As a result, the underlying level of G&A expense grew 2 ppt this quarter. Second, acquisitions added 10 ppt to this growth quarter. This is in the G&A line, as we made a number of acquisitions in the second half of last year, which haven't yet lapped into our base run rate. However, these factors were offset by 2 FX-related gains that were $69 million higher than last year or 11 ppt, and thus lowered overall G&A expense growth to 1%. 
The first was FX gains related to our normal hedging activities, mainly due to the appreciating U.S. dollar. And the second was a balance sheet remeasurement gains, primarily related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. 
With that, let me turn to Slide 8, and let's discuss what we have seen in April through the 21st. Most of our business drivers are similar to what we experienced in the first quarter. The numbers through April 21 are as follows. Starting with processed volume, we saw a global growth of 10%, similar to the first quarter. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 4%, the same as what we saw last quarter, including roughly, a 2 ppt impact from lower gas prices. Processed volume outside the U.S. grew 16%, about 1 ppt lower than the first quarter, with growth of mid to high teens in each region. 
And globally, processed transaction growth was 12%. And that's similar to what we saw in the first quarter, with double-digit growth in all regions except the U.S, which grew in the mid-single digits. And with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew at 17% globally, down 2 ppt from our first quarter growth. While the U.S. saw somewhat higher growth in April, most other regions saw a deceleration. 
Looking ahead, let me start with some commentary about full year 2015. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar impacting many U.S. multinationals, including us, I'm going to start by summarizing our thoughts about FX. And remember, currency impacts us in 2 ways: First, since the beginning of the year, the significant depreciation of the euro and the real, the Brazilian real, versus the U.S. dollar, has increased the impact of the functional FX translation since my January commentary. If the rates for our functional currencies remain similar to where we are today -- they are today, that is the euro trading at the EUR 1.09 level and the Brazilian real at the BRL 2.94 level for the rest of the year, the net impact of the euro and real would be a 6 to 8 ppt headwind, mostly from the euro actually to our as-reported results for the full year. And it's depending on what line item we are talking about, so revenue, net income or EPS. 
Second, we have the impact of local currency rates, relatively to the functional currencies. And we continue to expect some net headwind throughout the year, both to revenue and the bottom line. And based on the current rates, this is still likely to be in the 2 ppt range, similar to our estimate in late January. The impact of this is already included in our FX-adjusted guidance. 
At current FX rates, both of these impacts will provide a headwind of about $700 million to net revenue and about $300 million to net income for full year 2015. 
So with that as a backdrop, now let me get into some specific P&L line items. Our underlying business remain strong. However, some components of our 2015 outlook have changed due to the impact of FX, as I just talked about, and our latest acquisition, Applied Predictive Technologies or APT. On an FX-adjusted basis, we continue to expect high single-digit net revenue growth for 2015, including roughly 2 ppt from our M&A transactions. And we're seeing good traction for many of our recent portfolio wins and new product initiatives. However, revenue growth will be impacted by some items specific to 2015, which we highlighted back in January. The first, as we have already seen in the first quarter, a couple of significant contract renewals that provide the foundation for future growth come with more front-loaded incentives over the life of the contract than our typical agreements. And the next 3 quarters will reflect that, too. 
Second, while the Chase conversion to a competitor is essentially now complete, we will continue to see the lapping impact over the remainder of 2015. So on an as-reported basis, the net revenue growth rate will now likely be in the low single-digit range as a result of the stronger FX headwinds than we forecasted at the beginning of the year, primarily from the euro functional translation. And based on the current FX rates, this would be about a 6 ppt impact. 
Moving to rebates and incentives. Let me direct some questions we've been getting about what we mean by front-loaded incentives. This is a reference to incurring more incentives in the earlier years of a contract. Also, with the recent deal signings, we now expect full year 2015 rebate and incentive growth to be similar to what we saw in Q1 with as somewhat harder growth rate in the second quarter. 
Overall, we now project the growth rate for total operating expenses to full year 2015 to be in the mid-single digits on an FX-adjusted basis. And this continues to be predominantly due to the roughly 7 ppt impact from our announced M&A activities, with more of that impact occurring in the first half of the year. However, as-reported expense growth will now likely be in the low single-digit range after considering a roughly 4 ppt tailwind from the euro and the real translation. 
Let me give you an update on potential dilution from M&A activities, with the expected addition of APT by the end of the second quarter. We now project total EPS dilution will be about $0.11 to $0.13 for full year 2015. Less than half of the expected dilution is due to the amortization of acquired intangibles. 
As I said in the last quarter, you should assume a full year 2015 tax rate of about 28%. That has not changed, but it's due to the continued benefit we expect from the tax initiative I discussed in our January earnings call. 
And given all the detail I just went through, let me just step back and summarize a bit here. We continue to expect solid fundamentals to drive our underlying business in 2015, and that's despite a mixed economic environment as well as the more significant headwinds from FX than we expected back in January. As you can see, we continue to sign customer contracts and we continue to invest in the right strategic areas, while managing our expenses prudently. 
Finally, let me move on to our long-term performance objectives of 2013 to '15 for that period, which remained unchanged from what I said on our year-end earnings call back in late January. Given our expectations for 2015 revenue growth, we expect to deliver our low-end of the 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR range. We continue to expect at least 20% EPS CAGR for the 3-year period due to continued expense management as well as benefits from our lower tax rate and share repurchases. And we remain committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%. Just remember, these objectives are on a constant currency basis, and they do exclude our 2014 M&A activities as well as any new ones that might occur this year. 
As far as rolling our performance objectives forward, again, nothing different from what I said in January. The overall growth prospects for the payments industries has not changed. The underlying drivers of our business remain solid, and we are expanding our reach in areas that we're strategically targeting, such as processing, loyalty, information services and all things digital. We will provide you with our new long-term objective before the end of this year, most likely at our Investor Day in September.

They go to consumer product companies, depending on what kind of need for analytical capability that company has. A large part of their current client base is merchants, in which case, they have their 2 methods of getting out there. One is their own sales force, which essentially reaches merchants and embeds the analytical capability like a Software-as-a-Service provider, a SaaS provider on the computer screens of individuals in the merchant management system. And the other way, of course, will be through our own sales force in our advisers and information services business, where we believe we can add value to what they're doing. So the idea is to use both sales forces, but to embed the capability in the client's end-use system by embedding the Software-as-a-Service approach to the business. That's what APT does. It's a little different from the way we do our current data stuff, which tends to be more bespoke engagement by engagement. And that's the difference in the 2 models. And I think that there's space for both in this growing big data market."

You must be the only guy who thinks that China is answerable in quick questions, right? But I -- Craig, the fact is that the data around China and the current economics of the domestic payment system, which is what you're asking about, is opaque because there is no public data obviously available. What I do know from all the many trips I've been making there now for the better part of 10 to 12 years is that interchange rates on domestic transactions tend to be lower than the interchange rates that you would see on the average across the world in both credit and debit. You need to know that credit domestically is much smaller than debit today. And in fact, the largest use of payment cards domestically in China today is to take out cash from an ATM. And an even larger use is for the cards to remain dormant. So this is not a marketplace that is ready in spending actively on cards across all categories. It's a marketplace for the very large domestic card issuance with a fairly large dormant card base with what is used -- being used more for taking out cash sort of ATM on a bank branch rather than a point-of-sale use with lower credit use than debit. It's a typical early-stage electronic payments developing market with one dynamic, which is that interchange rates are lower than you would normally have expected. Network economics depend on what you're able to strike as deals with the different issuers and merchants. I'm going to reserve my judgment on that till I get my chance to really get into those deals because right now, we don't have those deals. Our deals tend to be on cross-border use of these cards, both outward and inward. And so we're going to have to wait and see how that goes. But there's no denying one big enormous volume you can get and if your P&L is constructed like us where we have a relatively low variable cost per transaction, that is an attractive opportunity. There's no denying that. You'll need to do a lot of work with issuers. You'll need to do a lot of work with merchants and acquirers to drive acceptance. There's a lot of things to be done over the next few years, but I see it as a really large and interesting opportunity for companies like ours."

We talked a little bit about where the U.S. is right. I feel like consumers are optimistic because they're seeing savings from the gas price. After all, gas prices are down substantially.

I feel like consumers are optimistic because they're seeing savings from the gas price. After all, gas prices are down substantially. And if you did an average individual household's math, you probably are pulling between $8 billion and $10 billion out from the spending on gas, which could be available to go into other avenues. So they're optimistic because they feel that money in their pocket. What they're doing with it, is they're paying down some debt, which you can see in the numbers on consumer debt across the country, both in revolving debt, but also in personal and secured loans and also, to an extent, in mortgages. And then you can see that some of the money is clearly being used to bump up personal savings rate. And personal saving rates were, I think, in March as high as 5.8%. They had gone down to 2% 6, 7 months ago. As you remember, just after the crisis, they were at 6% and 7%. So I don't know that the 5.8% is a bad thing for the country long term, by the way. It's probably a good thing. But I think what's going on here is that not all the money is coming out into goods and services spending, so for a company like us because we don't really get any benefit out of a higher spending rate directly. We don't get any benefit out of a higher savings rate, I'm sorry, directly. We also don't get any real benefit out of a lower paydown of debt. We don't get any said [ph] benefit. We get benefit when they spend. And overall spending is not growing in the form that you would see it once you added gas back in. That's what we're seeing. Now doesn't -- an extra nugget into this, which that luxury good sales and you can see it in the results of -- a number of the luxury goods, retailers, Coach recently, others like that. Their sales are not growing the way they were 6, 8 months ago. And most of that, I think, is caused by the fact that inbound tourist arrivals into the U.S. and their spending patterns, given the relative strength of the dollar to the euro, the Japanese yen, the Brazilian real, the people who are spending, of course, the Russian aren't coming in as much as they were some time ago. All that is impacting luxury good spending, which also by the way feeds them to the total retail spend numbers. So that's a little extra digging probably more than you wanted, but that's what's going on. Now I don't see this as a long-term issue. I actually -- not even a medium-term issue. I think you'll see tourism probably improving over the next few months. I think you'll see Americans traveling out in the summer. I think you'll see others coming in, and I think they're going to look at a somewhat different pattern of consumer spending over the next 3 to 6 months, just because underlying consumer sentiment is positive. So that's how I the feel about it."

That's kind of what we've all said. The idea right now is to ensure tokenization gets adopted in the market. And remember, even if you do something in January, with the tokenization rates, right now, tokenization is only going in for transactions over the phone, over mobile phone kind of transactions. And as you know, from your own research and details on this, that's still a small part of total expenditure and transactions in the United States. So I'd just like to put that genie into its bottle and where it belongs. It's very important. It's very critical for securitizing -- for securing digital transactions. No doubt, it's got an implementation time line, which is going to take some time for it to become more ubiquitous than just the phone-based transactions today. That's the context I'd like to put it in. We are very committed to it. They're investing a very large sum of money in ensuring our capabilities in it. We're investing money and rolling it out into other markets overseas and different people claim different dates when they're going to reach the markets. I will tell you, discount all that till you see it in the market. This is not an easy thing to get done. It's not an easy thing to roll out. So we're working very hard on that. As far as the actual adoption by merchants of different -- or the request by merchants to think about different interchange rates are concerned, look, at the end of the day, this card's now present rate from this card's present rates, and both have been applying for a period of time. If digitization were to become ubiquitous, will there be a change in those 2 buckets of rates? Will there be a third with 1 move down, 1 move up? Or there be 4, 5 different buckets, that's just speculation right now. We are far away from a stage where tokenized transactions comprise an adequate percentage of the total to drive great changes in the marketplace, other than the excitement around finally getting a really secured system for digital transactions."

And that is predominantly driven by the 7 ppt impact from all of our announced M&A activities. So of course, we are going to continue to organically invest in all of our strategic areas that are carried out, the processing area, the loyalty area. You just saw that we did the acquisition in the information services area. So of course, we are going to do that, but we are going to do that with a very astute and careful expense management that we have put into the company. So that's our put together. It goes -- gets to that mid-single digit growth number for the year. In terms of the Venezuelan bolivar, so a couple of things on that. First of all, part of our business in Venezuela is in bolivars. Part of our business in Venezuela is in U.S. dollars. The business that we have in bolivars in Venezuela is done as such as that we can't take the bolivars out of the country, right? The currency has currency restrictions. So what we have engaged, like any other multinationals, international hedging strategies that allow us over time to be protecting the investment that we have in this country. Part of that hedging strategy involves for us to actually take up a loan sometime ago where we bought some real property in the country. And what happens when you have a devaluation of that currency of the Bolivar, is you actually having to devalue that monetary asset to loan, and that was also in the gain. That gain is basically buffering the impact that we will be having from that bolivar devaluation on our revenues for the year. That's about a $40 million impact to our top line. That's all included in the discussions that I have with you this morning for 2015 revenues. But that's how this works."

So first of all, on the M&A investments, what we are typically targeting is -- so first of all, we're looking at every M&A transaction from a discounted cash flow analysis, right?

And we typically like to see a payback over a Tier 2 or 3-year period from a cash flow point of view. That does not necessarily mirror the accounting view, simply because accounting often is done differently than what you'd see coming through in the cash. But again, and we've said that a number of times publicly, we try to hope to get to the dilution impact of no more than 2 years. And so you should be seeing these acquisitions coming to fruition, the 2014 acquisition sometime later in 2016, as well as the 2015 acquisitions that we're doing, which APT is the big one at this point in time. You would be seeing that coming through later in 2017. So that's how we think about acquisitions. From a rebates and incentive point of view, I just have to remind you every deal is different, right? We have 1,000 of deals, every deal is different. Every year, we're writing hundreds of deals. When you look at some deals, you can get actually a relatively quick payback. It could be in the 6-, 7-, 9-month period, but it also depends when you have cards converting or whether you have that portfolio already and you're just making out of the portfolio, i.e. you're encouraging more volume and transactions coming on. Some of the bigger deals might have a longer payback because you have to do certain investments in order to encourage that portfolio to behave the way that you would like it to behave. So it's -- mostly, I have to tell you, it's a fairly wide range in terms of the payback calculation."

Remember that when we talked about our guidance x acquisitions, by the time the second year of a deal is complete, that acquisition is in our base. It is part of what we run. So I'm not asking for a way to x acquisitions into infinity. It's 2 years for any acquisition. So Martina said something in this conversation about the 2014 acquisitions are what she's excluding from the guidance because of '14 and '15, within that 2-year period. The deals we did before that, Access Prepaid Worldwide, which was taken from Travelex, or DataCash that we bought, or others of that type, are all in our base. And frankly, without Access Prepaid Worldwide, I doubt we would have achieved the kind of success we've achieved on our prepaid business over the last 5 years as we've gone from a small market share to one of the largest players in the business around the world today. So we get to think back and it's just that we kind of make sure you understand that our guidance is excluding them for 2 years because I don't know what deal I'm going to do when I give you the guidance for the 2 years. That's all I'm trying to do."

Our deals are constructed in such a way that we give higher rebates incentives for those clients who deliver more volume and transactions to us.

It's not just large commercial. Inside our commercial business, it certainly is some of the large commercial businesses, but also there's all the small business, and there's portions of business we're doing where we use MasterCard's virtual card number capability to intervene in the flow between businesses. So there's a number of things inside the commercial business. And maybe over the -- one of the things we could do at Investor Day is to give you guys a little more insight into the different things we're doing around the commercial business. And we probably should do that. But it's got more than just the large commercial insight. I actually continue to believe that we have a real opportunity for growth as a company in that space because we have a series of good assets that we have put together from our virtual card number capability to our ability with our acceptance being superior to that of certain other brands, which will remain unnamed, to our ability to do business across the world with one technology across all the regions. There's a number of advantages there, which I still believe commercial has that we can play with. It's a data capability with smart data. There's a whole series of these. So I still think of that as a big and decent opportunity. On prepaid, yes, prepaid's been growing well over the last 3 to 4 years. I just refer to prepaid when we talked about the acquisitions and the help we got from Access Prepaid Worldwide to help us in the prepaid program management business. I consider that to be an opportunity still for various reasons. One of those is there's an increasing desire across the world to get to the underserved, in financial inclusion terms. Clearly, prepaid is the best product in some form or the other, where they deliver on your card or delivered over the phone or delivered through a fingerprint for that population. It reduces the risk. It's more appropriate for governments to transfer. Benefits, it's better for NGOs. No luck [ph]. So I think you'll see numbers grow there. Those tend to come with lower economics because those people tend to take out cash first and use it at a point of sale later in their development cycle. But this lull part of where this growth is headed. So yes, we're getting a mix of growth from commercial and prepaid. And I think commercial will keep growing, and I think prepaid will but with different economics from commercial."

They're spending excess gas, and I believe you will see improvements in there. I think Europe is slowly improving, but the Russian economy remains challenged. And that's a fairly large economy around the world to have that challenging. In Asia and Latin America markets, with economics problems as well. Currency moves have added to the challenges. I think we're managing our way through it with tight cost controls. The strong underlying dynamics of our business remain unchanged. Our momentum continues. We're launching new products.

6477196,289283810,798347,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. In the first quarter, we have reported net revenue growth of 3%, and that's 8% after adjusting for currency. And that, combined with a decrease in operating expense of 1%, or an increase of 3% on an FX-adjusted",2413,"Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. In the first quarter, we have reported net revenue growth of 3%, and that's 8% after adjusting for currency. And that, combined with a decrease in operating expense of 1%, or an increase of 3% on an FX-adjusted basis, is what helped us drive EPS growth of 22%, and that number is 29% when adjusted for currency. So as we expected and I guess no different from other large global companies, FX is having a noticeable impact on our results and especially as the euro and real both have depreciated about 18% against the U.S. dollar versus this time last year, that is last year's first quarter. 
However, our EPS growth continues to be strong, both on as reported and an FX-adjusted basis. So as usual, let's begin to look at some of the current underlying global economic trends and let's start with the United States. Our SpendingPulse data, showed that U.S. retail sales growth x auto was 1.1% in the first quarter, and that's down from the fourth quarter growth rate of 2.9%. And that deceleration continues basically to be due to lower gas prices. If you were to exclude auto and gas, retail sales growth was 5.1% for the first quarter versus 4.1% for the fourth quarter, and that shows a healthier growth rate. So what is I think is happening is that consumers are only using a small portion of that savings from gas to buy new goods and services, rather what they are doing is using those savings from gas to increase their personal savings rate, which looks like it's climbed to the highest level since December 2012. And they're also probably using it to pay down some debt. And therefore, any additional consumer spend has not been enough to make up for the lower gas spending. 
However, underlying economic indicators have remained steady. Unemployment levels are stable, consumer sentiment is tracking upwards. So when you look at our U.S. business, lower gas prices had an impact of about 2 percentage points on our U.S. GDV growth rate, which is slightly greater than the 1 percentage point headwind we saw in the fourth quarter. GDV growth, excluding gas and processed transactions, were essentially the same as last quarter. 
In Europe, the environment there are showing signs of improvement. And across the region, consumer confidence, economic sentiment, unemployment levels have all slightly improved over the prior quarter. Consumer confidence in the U.K. has reached a 13-year high in March, and U.K. retail sales also continue to gain momentum with SpendingPulse data in the U.K. showing that first quarter retail sales growth of 3.8% is up from the 3.6% in the fourth quarter. And MasterCard's total European volume growth for the first quarter was in the mid-teens, processed transaction growth in the low 20s, very similar to the last quarter. 
Latin America, there continues to be challenged economically. And our first quarter SpendingPulse data for Brazil showed retail sales growth basically flat. And that's down from the almost 1% growth in the fourth quarter as the Brazilian economy settles into some form of recession and unemployment levels are continuing to rise. Lower oil prices are also slowing Mexico's economic recovery, but their consumer spending has held steady. And the region's annual GDP growth is now expected to be around 0.8%, and that's down slightly from the earlier projections of 1%. 
But despite those challenges, our business in the region remain solid. First quarter GDV and processed transaction growth is in the mid-teens, which is the same as last quarter. 
In Asia-Pacific, business sentiment has kind of held steady in the first quarter, led by the continued optimism of Indian companies about economic reforms, but weighed down by the Chinese economic slowdown. Consumer confidence across the region is still high, despite some recent declines, and our business in the region is continuing to do well. GDV growth in the mid-teens is the same as last quarter. Processed transaction growth in the low 20s, down slightly from the last quarter. 
So overall, when you put all this together, economic environment in the U.S. and Europe are showing signs of improvement, but challenges still remain in some areas of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. 
And our business continues to be impacted by the strong U.S. dollar, but the underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong, and we run the business for those underlying fundamentals. And that's what's going to help us navigate through these economic and dollar challenges. 
So before we go to our business highlights, let me quickly update you on the European regulatory matters on Russia and on China. So I'll start with the European registration related to card payments. The European Parliament and the Council of Ministers have signed the final text. We expect official publication of the legislation in the next couple of weeks. Interchange caps will become effective 6 months later, so sometime towards the end of the year. And all other parts of the legislation will apply, starting 12 months after the effective date, so we are talking mid-2016 for that. 
In Russia, we've actually successfully migrated our local card transactions to the new domestic NSPK platform by the April 1 deadline, and we were the first network to do so. We met the requirements of the Russian legislation will have no service disruption to cardholders and without switching domestic transactions through NSPK, but we're continuing to provide all the value-added services to our customers through our direct capabilities. In terms of the financial impact to our business, no change in our previous estimate of something less than $50 million on an annualized basis of additional costs. 
Last week, as you all read, China announced that international payment companies, like MasterCard, will be allowed to establish domestic switching operations in China. Obviously and clearly, a large opportunity for us over the next long-term decade. Or whichever way you look at it, it's a great opportunity. It's a large marketplace, and they're keen to play there, and we are encouraged by the announcement. We want to switch domestic transaction in China. As soon as possible, we want to leverage the investments we've already made in that market. But having said that, there are number of steps that need to be completed before we reach that point. Detailed regulations are yet to be issued. Some combination of the People's Bank of China and the China Banking Regulatory Commission will put out those detailed regulations over the next period of time. It's unclear to me exactly when those will get published. We will need to then submit a license application. Clearly, we're already preparing that, so we can go with that as soon as the regulations are issued. Then, we'll need to work with the government, get that application approved, satisfy the detailed requirements of the regulations, so we don't really know how long that process would take for sure. But we do know some of the requirements already today. So there is, for example, a capital commitment required to the tune of roughly USD 160 million. We also know we'll need to provide some form of on-soil switching. And as you know, we have distributed network processors, but in addition to those, we have been investing on-soil in China over the last period of time. We will need to assess the extent to which those existing investments already satisfy what regulations need and do whatever else is required to meet their needs, and then we will be in the right place to be able to fully capable -- to be able to fully capable of taking advantage of these new domestic switching regulations. 
So all that said, the full requirements only become clear when these detailed regulations are issued. I kind of think that we should expect to be in a position to switch in China sometime towards the end of 2016. And obviously, as it moves more quickly, that's great for us. But in the meantime, there's a lot of people in the company working very hard to get ready for this opportunity to take advantage of it as soon as we possibly can. 
So recent business activity. During the quarter, we signed a number of new agreements and renewals supporting the expansion of our business around the world. And let me give you a few examples. The first, we enhanced our global partnership at Citi. Citi, as you know, is the world's largest credit card issuer. We've now got a new and expanded 10-year agreement to move all that proprietary consumer credit and debit card portfolios to MasterCard. In Brazil, we signed a new 20-year agreement with Itaú, and that further strengthens our long-term strategic relationship with the institution that is today our largest customer in the Latin American region. And this agreement increases our share of Itaú's credit, debit and prepaid portfolios. It gives us exclusive rights to switch all of their domestic and international transactions, allows us to create a new payment network in Brazil jointly with Itaú and us. Of course, that's subject -- the last part is subject to getting regulatory approvals. But overall, we are very pleased with this opportunity to be a stronger partner of both Citibank's and Itaú's. 
And meanwhile, we signed new agreements with Barclaycard in the U.K. We're converting a significant part of their commercial card business to MasterCard. In Ireland, we signed with the Bank of Ireland to convert to commercial and consumer credit portfolios to MasterCard. Having these deals should help us substantially increase our share in the commercial credit market in the U.K. and our overall credit share in Ireland. 
In New Zealand, Westpac and Air New Zealand are going to convert the Airpoints reward credit and commercial programs to MasterCard-branded cards. So developments in different parts of the world. 
Meanwhile, we're continuing with all our innovation efforts across the digital space. And starting with MasterPass. Last quarter, I mentioned our MasterPass platform was live in 16 countries around the world. And I'm very pleased to share that we've since added Korea to the list of live markets, as well as more than doubled our global merchant acceptance of MasterPass to nearly 0.25 million merchants, and there are more in the pipeline. It's like one of those ads you hear on TV that says, ""Wait, there's more to come.""
So some specific examples of our progress include: We announced a 3-year strategic partnership and relationship with McDonald's in the U.A.E. and across 14 key markets in Middle East, Africa and Europe. And what we're doing with them is introducing contactless payments in their restaurants and enabling MasterPass for online ordering. 
Another area where MasterPass is gaining momentum is transit. We just recently announced a global partnership with Cubic Transportation Systems. They are a leading provider for smart city transit solutions in London and Chicago and other such cities. As part of that agreement, MasterPass will be integrated with Cubic's NextWave ticketing and journey planning app, which really means it will help to accelerate conversion of cash payments in transit into these digital payments. 
So quick-service restaurants, the McDonald's example; transit systems, the Cubic example, here are just 2 of what we are doing to extend our reach in cash stronghold. A couple of other examples are always mobile point of sales. Remember that mobile is not just about relying consumers to make payments with their phones. It's actually -- an even more interesting option is to involve expanding acceptance to merchants who previously have no ability to take electronic payments to standard POS terminals. You've had a number of those mobile point-of-sale rollouts this quarter. In Nigeria, we partnered with First Bank of Nigeria and the Guaranty Trust Bank. We've got MPOS devices to micro, small and medium businesses that accept card transactions for the first time. In Hungary, we partnered with the insurance company Alliance to provide their sales agents with an MPOS device that accepts mag stripe chip and contactless cards. So basically, their clients don't need to make cash payments at a post office or through a bank transfer. They can use their card and the MPOS device that's with the insurance agent. 
So continuing on the mobile front. We've all watched the launch of Apple Pay with great interest. And as you know, they were the first digital giant to enter that space. And as you now know, their new Apple Watch has Apple Pay capabilities built into it. But in March, we also announced that we're working with Samsung to enable Samsung Pay, which will soon launch in the United States. 
You've probably heard us talk about the fact that we're technology agnostic when it comes to mobile and digital payments, and we're determined to support implementations based on different market models. And one of the first implementations of the cloud-based mobile solution is that Commonwealth Bank of Australia, who just recently launched their tap-and-pay mobile payment solution across Android devices. 
Another example of a different mobile model is our recently announced agreement with the Egyptian government where we will extend financial services to more than 54 million Egyptians by providing the platform that links their national ID with the first national mobile wallet. Included in the program is the financial-inclusion aspect, but it's much broader because it provides every Egyptian citizen with the tools to electronically receive government payments, add a companion card to be used in purchases, bill payments, domestic remittances.
And finally, a little word about our recent announcement about the intention to acquire Applied Predictive Technologies. APT is a leading cloud-based analytics company. Their platform basically enables companies across a number of industries to use their own data to accurately measure the profit impact of marketing, of merchandising, of operations, of capital initiatives. And last quarter, we talked about the acquisition of 5one, a retail consulting and analytics firm. And by adding APT's capabilities with 5one's, what we're trying to do is advance that ability to deliver differentiated products to merchants. And our analytic and consulting capabilities, in our own shop, along with our global footprint, will allow for the expansion of APT's platform and, of course, 5one's, and that's a win-win for both of us. So we expect to complete this APT acquisition sometime over the second quarter. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operating metrics. Martina?"
6477196,289283810,798347,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck, where you can see the difference between as reported and FX-adjusted growth rates for this quarter. Although the Brazilian real have some impact, the differential was pr",2212,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck, where you can see the difference between as reported and FX-adjusted growth rates for this quarter. 
Although the Brazilian real have some impact, the differential was primarily driven by the euro-U.S. based dollar exchange rate. So here, you can see EPS growth continues to be strong at 22% on an as-reported basis and 29% after adjusting for currency. Continued revenue momentum, good cost controls and executing on our tax strategies and the current share repurchase program all contributed to that performance. 
I'd like to point out a few items here and then I talk about the major P&L line items in the subsequent slides. So first of all, acquisitions that we made in 2014 drove $0.02 of dilution. Second, you can see the tax rate was favorable at 23.9% in the quarter, primarily due to our continued focus on initiatives to better align our tax structure with our business footprint, as well as a discrete item that resulted in our ability to claim foreign tax credits in the U.S. this quarter. Third, share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share. During the first quarter, we repurchased 11 million shares at a cost of about $947 million. And through April 22, we repurchased an additional 2.7 million shares at a cost of approximately $240 million. And we now have 2.8 billion remaining under the current authorization. 
Lastly, cash flow from operations was a little over $911 million. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $5.9 billion. 
So let me turn to Page 4. Here, you can see as usual our operational metrics for the first quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV was up 12% on a local currency basis, down slightly from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 7%, made up of credit and debit growth of 5% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV was about 1% down from last quarter, primarily due to the increased headwinds from lower gas prices. Set differently, this means that gas had a 2 ppt impact in the first quarter of 2015 versus a 1 ppt impact in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 15% on a local currency basis, about the same as last quarter and primarily driven by Turkey, Sweden and Canada. Cross-border volume, you can see grew 19% on a local currency basis. That is the same of what we saw in the fourth quarter, which continues to be primarily driven by Europe. Growth in Europe was in the low 20s with the U.K., Germany, Italy and Sweden as key contributors to the growth. 
On Page 5, you see processed transactions grew 12% globally to $11 billion, and we continue to see double-digit growth in most regions. Growth increased from the 11% that we saw in the fourth quarter, primarily due to Europe. And it was again driven by Sweden, Russia, Poland and Netherlands, similar to last quarter. Globally, the number of cards grew 8%, with $2.2 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards. 
Now I'm turning to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 3% as reported or 8% when you adjust for currency. This differential is due to the currency headwinds, primarily from the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate. Additionally, the impact of local currency exchange rates was about 2 ppt headwind. Acquisitions also contributed a little more than 2 ppt to the net revenue growth. And after you exclude the impact of both local and functional currencies, as well as the impact of acquisitions, we saw underlying net revenue growth of 8%. This reflects the underlying volume performance we expected, as well as a higher level of rebates and incentives that I talked about on our last earnings call. Specifically, rebates and incentives grew 25% in line with our expectations, primarily driven by the front-loaded impact over the life of the contract from certain customer renewals, which Ajay mentioned in his comments. 
Now let me look quickly at the other individual revenue line items on an FX-adjusted basis. Domestic assessments grew 8%, while worldwide GDV grew 12%. This 4 ppt gap is primarily due to the impact of local currency, somewhat offset by pricing. Cross-border volume fees grew 9%, but cross-border volume grew 19%. Of the 10 ppt gap, the majority is due to a higher mix of intra-Europe activity, as well as some local currency impact. Transaction processing fees grew 13%, primarily driven by the 12% growth in processed transactions. 
And finally, other revenues grew 29%, which continues to be driven largely by contributions from our pinpoint acquisition, as well as our Advisors business. 
Moving on to Page 7. You can see that total operating expenses decreased 1% in the quarter but increased 3% on an FX-adjusted basis. Overall, M&A activities contributed 9 ppt to total expense growth. 
So let me spend a minute on G&A, which grew only 1% year-over-year, and explain how that happened. First, we continue to organically invest in our strategic initiatives, while managing our expenses very carefully. As a result, the underlying level of G&A expense grew 2 ppt this quarter. Second, acquisitions added 10 ppt to this growth quarter. This is in the G&A line, as we made a number of acquisitions in the second half of last year, which haven't yet lapped into our base run rate. However, these factors were offset by 2 FX-related gains that were $69 million higher than last year or 11 ppt, and thus lowered overall G&A expense growth to 1%. 
The first was FX gains related to our normal hedging activities, mainly due to the appreciating U.S. dollar. And the second was a balance sheet remeasurement gains, primarily related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. 
With that, let me turn to Slide 8, and let's discuss what we have seen in April through the 21st. Most of our business drivers are similar to what we experienced in the first quarter. The numbers through April 21 are as follows. Starting with processed volume, we saw a global growth of 10%, similar to the first quarter. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 4%, the same as what we saw last quarter, including roughly, a 2 ppt impact from lower gas prices. Processed volume outside the U.S. grew 16%, about 1 ppt lower than the first quarter, with growth of mid to high teens in each region. 
And globally, processed transaction growth was 12%. And that's similar to what we saw in the first quarter, with double-digit growth in all regions except the U.S, which grew in the mid-single digits. And with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew at 17% globally, down 2 ppt from our first quarter growth. While the U.S. saw somewhat higher growth in April, most other regions saw a deceleration. 
Looking ahead, let me start with some commentary about full year 2015. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar impacting many U.S. multinationals, including us, I'm going to start by summarizing our thoughts about FX. And remember, currency impacts us in 2 ways: First, since the beginning of the year, the significant depreciation of the euro and the real, the Brazilian real, versus the U.S. dollar, has increased the impact of the functional FX translation since my January commentary. If the rates for our functional currencies remain similar to where we are today -- they are today, that is the euro trading at the EUR 1.09 level and the Brazilian real at the BRL 2.94 level for the rest of the year, the net impact of the euro and real would be a 6 to 8 ppt headwind, mostly from the euro actually to our as-reported results for the full year. And it's depending on what line item we are talking about, so revenue, net income or EPS. 
Second, we have the impact of local currency rates, relatively to the functional currencies. And we continue to expect some net headwind throughout the year, both to revenue and the bottom line. And based on the current rates, this is still likely to be in the 2 ppt range, similar to our estimate in late January. The impact of this is already included in our FX-adjusted guidance. 
At current FX rates, both of these impacts will provide a headwind of about $700 million to net revenue and about $300 million to net income for full year 2015. 
So with that as a backdrop, now let me get into some specific P&L line items. Our underlying business remain strong. However, some components of our 2015 outlook have changed due to the impact of FX, as I just talked about, and our latest acquisition, Applied Predictive Technologies or APT. On an FX-adjusted basis, we continue to expect high single-digit net revenue growth for 2015, including roughly 2 ppt from our M&A transactions. And we're seeing good traction for many of our recent portfolio wins and new product initiatives. However, revenue growth will be impacted by some items specific to 2015, which we highlighted back in January. The first, as we have already seen in the first quarter, a couple of significant contract renewals that provide the foundation for future growth come with more front-loaded incentives over the life of the contract than our typical agreements. And the next 3 quarters will reflect that, too. 
Second, while the Chase conversion to a competitor is essentially now complete, we will continue to see the lapping impact over the remainder of 2015. So on an as-reported basis, the net revenue growth rate will now likely be in the low single-digit range as a result of the stronger FX headwinds than we forecasted at the beginning of the year, primarily from the euro functional translation. And based on the current FX rates, this would be about a 6 ppt impact. 
Moving to rebates and incentives. Let me direct some questions we've been getting about what we mean by front-loaded incentives. This is a reference to incurring more incentives in the earlier years of a contract. Also, with the recent deal signings, we now expect full year 2015 rebate and incentive growth to be similar to what we saw in Q1 with as somewhat harder growth rate in the second quarter. 
Overall, we now project the growth rate for total operating expenses to full year 2015 to be in the mid-single digits on an FX-adjusted basis. And this continues to be predominantly due to the roughly 7 ppt impact from our announced M&A activities, with more of that impact occurring in the first half of the year. However, as-reported expense growth will now likely be in the low single-digit range after considering a roughly 4 ppt tailwind from the euro and the real translation. 
Let me give you an update on potential dilution from M&A activities, with the expected addition of APT by the end of the second quarter. We now project total EPS dilution will be about $0.11 to $0.13 for full year 2015. Less than half of the expected dilution is due to the amortization of acquired intangibles. 
As I said in the last quarter, you should assume a full year 2015 tax rate of about 28%. That has not changed, but it's due to the continued benefit we expect from the tax initiative I discussed in our January earnings call. 
And given all the detail I just went through, let me just step back and summarize a bit here. We continue to expect solid fundamentals to drive our underlying business in 2015, and that's despite a mixed economic environment as well as the more significant headwinds from FX than we expected back in January. As you can see, we continue to sign customer contracts and we continue to invest in the right strategic areas, while managing our expenses prudently. 
Finally, let me move on to our long-term performance objectives of 2013 to '15 for that period, which remained unchanged from what I said on our year-end earnings call back in late January. Given our expectations for 2015 revenue growth, we expect to deliver our low-end of the 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR range. We continue to expect at least 20% EPS CAGR for the 3-year period due to continued expense management as well as benefits from our lower tax rate and share repurchases. And we remain committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%. Just remember, these objectives are on a constant currency basis, and they do exclude our 2014 M&A activities as well as any new ones that might occur this year. 
As far as rolling our performance objectives forward, again, nothing different from what I said in January. The overall growth prospects for the payments industries has not changed. The underlying drivers of our business remain solid, and we are expanding our reach in areas that we're strategically targeting, such as processing, loyalty, information services and all things digital. We will provide you with our new long-term objective before the end of this year, most likely at our Investor Day in September.

One is their own sales force, which essentially reaches merchants and embeds the analytical capability like a Software-as-a-Service provider, a SaaS provider on the computer screens of individuals in the merchant management system. And the other way, of course, will be through our own sales force in our advisers and information services business, where we believe we can add value to what they're doing. So the idea is to use both sales forces, but to embed the capability in the client's end-use system by embedding the Software-as-a-Service approach to the business. That's what APT does.

You must be the only guy who thinks that China is answerable in quick questions, right? But I -- Craig, the fact is that the data around China and the current economics of the domestic payment system, which is what you're asking about, is opaque because there is no public data obviously available. What I do know from all the many trips I've been making there now for the better part of 10 to 12 years is that interchange rates on domestic transactions tend to be lower than the interchange rates that you would see on the average across the world in both credit and debit. You need to know that credit domestically is much smaller than debit today. And in fact, the largest use of payment cards domestically in China today is to take out cash from an ATM. And an even larger use is for the cards to remain dormant. So this is not a marketplace that is ready in spending actively on cards across all categories. It's a marketplace for the very large domestic card issuance with a fairly large dormant card base with what is used -- being used more for taking out cash sort of ATM on a bank branch rather than a point-of-sale use with lower credit use than debit. It's a typical early-stage electronic payments developing market with one dynamic, which is that interchange rates are lower than you would normally have expected. Network economics depend on what you're able to strike as deals with the different issuers and merchants. I'm going to reserve my judgment on that till I get my chance to really get into those deals because right now, we don't have those deals. Our deals tend to be on cross-border use of these cards, both outward and inward. And so we're going to have to wait and see how that goes. But there's no denying one big enormous volume you can get and if your P&L is constructed like us where we have a relatively low variable cost per transaction, that is an attractive opportunity. There's no denying that. You'll need to do a lot of work with issuers. You'll need to do a lot of work with merchants and acquirers to drive acceptance. There's a lot of things to be done over the next few years, but I see it as a really large and interesting opportunity for companies like ours."

We talked a little bit about where the U.S. is right. I feel like consumers are optimistic because they're seeing savings from the gas price. After all, gas prices are down substantially. And if you did an a",537,"And Sanjay, back to your question on economics. We talked a little bit about where the U.S. is right. I feel like consumers are optimistic because they're seeing savings from the gas price. After all, gas prices are down substantially. And if you did an average individual household's math, you probably are pulling between $8 billion and $10 billion out from the spending on gas, which could be available to go into other avenues. So they're optimistic because they feel that money in their pocket. What they're doing with it, is they're paying down some debt, which you can see in the numbers on consumer debt across the country, both in revolving debt, but also in personal and secured loans and also, to an extent, in mortgages. And then you can see that some of the money is clearly being used to bump up personal savings rate. And personal saving rates were, I think, in March as high as 5.8%. They had gone down to 2% 6, 7 months ago. As you remember, just after the crisis, they were at 6% and 7%. So I don't know that the 5.8% is a bad thing for the country long term, by the way. It's probably a good thing. But I think what's going on here is that not all the money is coming out into goods and services spending, so for a company like us because we don't really get any benefit out of a higher spending rate directly. We don't get any benefit out of a higher savings rate, I'm sorry, directly. We also don't get any real benefit out of a lower paydown of debt. We don't get any said [ph] benefit. We get benefit when they spend. And overall spending is not growing in the form that you would see it once you added gas back in. That's what we're seeing. Now doesn't -- an extra nugget into this, which that luxury good sales and you can see it in the results of -- a number of the luxury goods, retailers, Coach recently, others like that. Their sales are not growing the way they were 6, 8 months ago. And most of that, I think, is caused by the fact that inbound tourist arrivals into the U.S. and their spending patterns, given the relative strength of the dollar to the euro, the Japanese yen, the Brazilian real, the people who are spending, of course, the Russian aren't coming in as much as they were some time ago. All that is impacting luxury good spending, which also by the way feeds them to the total retail spend numbers. So that's a little extra digging probably more than you wanted, but that's what's going on. Now I don't see this as a long-term issue. I actually -- not even a medium-term issue. I think you'll see tourism probably improving over the next few months. I think you'll see Americans traveling out in the summer. I think you'll see others coming in, and I think they're going to look at a somewhat different pattern of consumer spending over the next 3 to 6 months, just because underlying consumer sentiment is positive. So that's how I feel about it."

That's kind of what we've all said. The idea right now is to ensure tokenization gets adopted in the market. And remember, even if you do something in January, with the tokenization rates, right now, tokenization is only going in for transactions over the phone, over mobile phone kind of transactions. And as you know, from your own research and details on this, that's still a small part of total expenditure and transactions in the United States. So I'd just like to put that genie into its bottle and where it belongs. It's very important. It's very critical for securitizing -- for securing digital transactions. No doubt, it's got an implementation time line, which is going to take some time for it to become more ubiquitous than just the phone-based transactions today. That's the context I'd like to put it in. We are very committed to it. They're investing a very large sum of money in ensuring our capabilities in it. We're investing money and rolling it out into other markets overseas and different people claim different dates when they're going to reach the markets. I will tell you, discount all that till you see it in the market. This is not an easy thing to get done. It's not an easy thing to roll out. So we're working very hard on that. As far as the actual adoption by merchants of different -- or the request by merchants to think about different interchange rates are concerned, look, at the end of the day, this card's now present rate from this card's present rates, and both have been applying for a period of time. If digitization were to become ubiquitous, will there be a change in those 2 buckets of rates? Will there be a third with 1 move down, 1 move up? Or there be 4, 5 different buckets, that's just speculation right now. We are far away from a stage where tokenized transactions comprise an adequate percentage of the total to drive great changes in the marketplace, other than the excitement around finally getting a really secured system for digital transactions."

It goes -- gets to that mid-single digit growth number for the year. In terms of the Venezuelan bolivar, so a couple of things on that. First of all, part of our business in Venezuela is in bolivars. Part of our business in Venezuela is in U.S. dollars. The business that we have in bolivars in Venezuela is done as such as that we can't take the bolivars out of the country, right? The currency has currency restrictions. So what we have engaged, like any other multinationals, international hedging strategies that allow us over time to be protecting the investment that we have in this country. Part of that hedging strategy involves for us to actually take up a loan some time ago where we bought some real property in the country. And what happens when you have a devaluation of that currency of the Bolivar, is you actually having to devalue that monetary asset to loan, and that was also in the gain. That gain is basically buffering the impact that we will be having from that bolivar devaluation on our revenues for the year. That's about a $40 million impact to our top line. That's all included in the discussions that I have with you this morning for 2015 revenues. But that's how this works."

And we typically like to see a payback over a Tier 2 or 3-year period from a cash flow point of view. That does not necessarily mirror the accounting view, simply because accounting often is done differently than what you'd see coming through in the cash. But again, and we've said that a number of times publicly, we try to hope to get to the dilution impact of no more than 2 years. And so you should be seeing these acquisitions coming to fruition, the 2014 acquisition sometime later in 2016, as well as the 2015 acquisitions that we're doing, which APT is the big one at this point in time. You would be seeing that coming through later in 2017. So that's how we think about acquisitions. From a rebates and incentive point of view, I just have to remind you every deal is different, right? We have 1,000 of deals, every deal is different. Every year, we're writing hundreds of deals. When you look at some deals, you can get actually a relatively quick payback. It could be in the 6-, 7-, 9-month period, but it also depends when you have cards converting or whether you have that portfolio already and you're just making out of the portfolio, i.e. you're encouraging more volume and transactions coming on. Some of the bigger deals might have a longer payback because you have to do certain investments in order to encourage that portfolio to behave the way that you would like it to behave.

The deals we did before that, Access Prepaid Worldwide, which was taken from Travelex, or DataCash that we bought, or others of that type, are all in our base. And frankly, without Access Prepaid Worldwide, I doubt we would have achieved the kind of success we've achieved on our prepaid business over the last 5 years as we've gone from a small market share to one of the largest players in the business around the world today.

It's not just large commercial. Inside our commercial business, it certainly is some of the large commercial businesses, but also there's all the small business, and there's portions of business we're doing where we use MasterCard's virtual card number capability to intervene in the flow between businesses. So there's a number of things inside the commercial business. And maybe over the -- one of the things we could do at Investor Day is to give you guys a little more insight into the different things we're doing around the commercial business. And we probably should do that. But it's got more than just the large commercial insight. I actually continue to believe that we have a real opportunity for growth as a company in that space because we have a series of good assets that we have put together from our virtual card number capability to our ability with our acceptance being superior to that of certain other brands, which will remain unnamed, to our ability to do business across the world with one technology across all the regions. There's a number of advantages there, which I still believe commercial has that we can play with. It's a data capability with smart data. There's a whole series of these. So I still think of that as a big and decent opportunity. On prepaid, yes, prepaid's been growing well over the last 3 to 4 years. I just refer to prepaid when we talked about the acquisitions and the help we got from Access Prepaid Worldwide to help us in the prepaid program management business. I consider that to be an opportunity still for various reasons. One of those is there's an increasing desire across the world to get to the underserved, in financial inclusion terms. Clearly, prepaid is the best product in some form or the other, where they deliver on your card or delivered over the phone or delivered through a fingerprint for that population. It reduces the risk. It's more appropriate for governments to transfer. Benefits, it's better for NGOs. No luck [ph]. So I think you'll see numbers grow there. Those tend to come with lower economics because those people tend to take out cash first and use it at a point of sale later in their development cycle. But this lull part of where this growth is headed. So yes, we're getting a mix of growth from commercial and prepaid. And I think commercial will keep growing, and I think prepaid will but with different economics from commercial."

Great. Well, thank you, all, for your questions and we'll leave you with a couple of closing thoughts. We just talked about this in the Q&A, but the world economy continues to be complicated and things aren't completely clear yet. But the U.S. looks to be in better shape and people aren't yet spending all their savings from lower gas prices as I was explaining in response to Sanjay's question, but it's there. They're spending excess gas, and I believe you will see improvements in there. I think Europe is slowly improving, but the Russian economy remains challenged. And that's a fairly large economy around the world to have that challenging. In Asia and Latin America markets, with economics problems as well. Currency moves have added to the challenges. I think we're managing our way through it with tight cost controls. The strong underlying dynamics of our business remain unchanged. Our momentum continues. We're launching new products. We're working with the digital giants. We're working with banks, getting new deals from them. We're building new relationships with merchants that are acquiring things to help us cement those relationships. That's all good stuff. We're very focused on all the right things.

Our business continues to perform well with good volume and good transaction growth as well as the signing of a number of new deals. And as you all know, that's despite the mixed global economic environment we're all navigating through. After we adjust for currency headwinds, our net revenue grew 7%, which is exactly in line with our expectations. And as you know, executing on our strategy over the last few years has included our acquiring a number of businesses and in fact, have accelerated over the past year or so, and there having a slight drag on our bottom line until we get them fully integrated. As we do this, we are very closely monitoring our organic expense growth to help fund these integrations, and that post care has delivered EPS growth of 15%. And that, of course, excludes the impact of currency translation and a special item related to litigation that we will touch on later during the call. 
I'm going to just briefly touch on global economics this quarter and overall the environments for the U.S. and Europe have continued to improve as key economic indicators remain healthy. But the U.S. consumer is clearly still not spending all of their gas savings. Latin America and Asia-Pacific remains challenged, most notably in Brazil and in China. And our business continues to be impacted by the strong U.S. dollar, but our fundamentals remain strong with double-digit volume and transaction growth in spite of these economic situations.
So before we go to our business highlights, let me quickly update you on China. 2 weeks ago, the Chinese regulator issued a draft version of the guidelines for review and for comment. They're going to be further clarity on some of the details there that are connected to domestic switching operations, and I'm assuming that will probably happen when the final regulations are issued likely later this year. In the meanwhile, what we are doing is working on all fronts: issuing, acquiring and on soil processing we can try and take advantage of this opportunity as we get further clarity. Based on everything we know today, we continue to believe what we told you earlier that we would be technically ready to process domestic Chinese transactions by the end of 2016.
So let's move on to our recent business activity. And during the quarter, we signed a number of new agreements and renewals around the world, and I'm going to pick 3 or 4 examples. So in the U.K. we signed a new agreement with Virgin Money to convert that debit card portfolio to contactless-enabled debit. MasterCards, and that deal now gives us 100% of Virgin Money's existing proprietary debit and credit book. In the U.S, we continue to grow our debit businesses by signing now, for example, a new agreement with TD Bank to convert their PIN debit card portfolio to have preferred MasterCard routing. In the U.S. as well, we have 7 co-brand credit renewals and Spirit Airlines. 
And so moving beyond all these customer agreements, I will talk about a couple of topics, and the first one is we are significantly investing in cybersecurity-related technology to offer much greater protection to our cardholders, to merchants, to issuing banks. And there is no silver bullet that completely eliminate fraud. But if you apply a sensible multilayered approach that has some coordination across the industry we're all convinced we can help significantly reduce that risk. And protecting card credentials through EMV, through secure cord and now through tokenization are only a few examples of our efforts in this area. We've actually recently announced the expansion of our tokenization services to private label card issuers, and we're the first payment network to do show, and JCPenney will be among the first retailers to use these services later this year.
We also partnered with financial and Citi detailed services, and these are 2 of the largest private label issuers in the U.S. to enable the use of their private label cards in part of the mobile payment and digital wallet services.
Another area of focus in this space is safety, has been using biometrics to further protect the consumers' identity, and you will see new stories and pilots we are doing where consumers use an Apple smartphone to verify their identity for online transactions by taking a selfie. and for those of you who are attending our Investor Day in September, you can take 100 selfies each and see this to technology in person. Another example is safety net, which many of you saw demonstrated last year's Investor Day. We're working closely with many providers, including people like and FireEye, to share broader cyber threat information. But the thing is safety net is not just about sharing the information. We don't just detect threat, but we act upon them in realtime by providing an independent layer of security on behalf of our issuers globally. 
In 2014, for example, safety net detected and stopped several confirmed fraud events, including 2 where determined that the issue exposure could have been roughly $80 million. So safety net's unique solution is now being deployed globally across all products, all channels. And over the past 2 [ph] years since launch, more than 80% of our issuers are now using this service. Remember, not just to share the information but to act upon that in realtime. 
Another topic of interest is how acquisitions fit into our overall strategy. So as a reminder, our M&A focus areas include loyalty, data analytics, processing and safety and security. Now because these areas are all of strategic importance to us, our belief is that any transaction we do there has to stand on its own in terms of contribution, but it also most importantly, got to provide ways for us to cross-sell their capabilities in a bundled way with existing MasterCard products and services, what we talk about as the multiplier effect. So today I'm going to talk a little bit about what these acquisitions are doing. Some of them, at least, in combination with the rest of MasterCard. 
First of all, anything we acquired before 2014, so that's DataCash and Access Prepaid, is now already embedded in our base numbers. These acquisitions have been extremely helpful in expanding our business and revenue growth. And as I mentioned as both on their own but also as combined with our existing products. And let me give you one example for me to give the cash and access. By combining our acquisition of DataCash with our previously existing gateway services in Asia Pacific and then our recent acquisition of have been one of the global e-commerce gateway solutions available. And that combined solution is enabling us to get closer acquirers, closer to merchants, more easily deploy our innovation and protect that digital transactions with what I think are extremely robust fraud and risk management solutions. 
So for example, we now have over 120 relationships with acquirers around the world, and we are providing integrated product offerings directly to merchants such as an omni-channel solution for H&M in the U.K. DataCash is enabling us to more easily deploy innovations like MasterPass. We've added MasterPass to the Boot's drugstore chain website in the U.K. We just quickly connected over 2,000 merchants in just a few days for the communal Bank of Australia, all these enabled through DataCash. Another example, HII, that's Japan's leading travel company, is using DataCash fraud management solution to enable safe online sales in Malaysia and in Indonesia.
Access. In 2013, Access Prepaid helped upgrade its frequent flyer program to include the Qantas cash multicurrency prepaid card. And just recently, that Qantas cash AUD 1 billion [ph] in sales, it's added almost 10 million transactions processed by MasterCard since launch. And that, by the way, is just one of many currency prepaid cards in a number of verticals that we have launched around the world using the program management capabilities of Access Prepaid combined with our prepaid product capacity and our selling skills in the regions.
So let's get to talk about acquisitions we've done over the past 18 months, and those, by the way, are the ones we include when we call out acquisitions in our numbers. Remember we only exclude acquisitions from our base for up to 2 calendar years, and that means that by the end of this year, of the acquisitions made recently, only Applied Predictive Technologies, APT, will continue to be excluded in 2016. 
So a few examples of how some of these newer acquisitions are supporting our strategy. In February 2014, we added substantial software engineering capacity and capabilities in the digital and mobile payments area with the acquisition of C-SAM. That's allowing us to accelerate the development and the expansion of MasterPass and other mobile payment solutions. And just this morning we've announced the launch of MasterPass in India, bringing the total number of live markets to 24. 
Now on the merchant side, we've added Alitalia, South African Airways, Carnival Cruise Line, Western Canada and a host of others. In mid-2014, the acquisition of card services, ACS, expanded our development capabilities, and that enabled us to provide lower-cost authorization and clearing services as well as a suite of platforms that enable local issuer processing or local acquirer processing services. As 1 example, ACS' technology was what we used to open our processing center in Dubai last year. 
So C-SAM, in combination with ECS, now provides the backbone of our technology hub in India. It's got a large team of talented technologies. It's got a wealth of our creative ideas. That hub is playing a very important role in creating and supporting innovative digital payment technologies that we are now using around the world. 
On the loyalty front, we acquired last year. That's the premier loyalty provided in Australia. We're now expanding that across Asia Pacific.  enables us to offer value-added solutions to issuers, to merchants and to consumers, and an example is a recent agreement in Australia who will not only be converting their consumer credit business to MasterCard, but while doing so are adding Pinpoint's loyalty solutions. 
Another example, this one is the merchant space, is that recently won a deal with Electronics in Australia. And this deal combines the Pinpoint redemption network for their gift cards. We add MasterPass to their website, we provide advice is analytics to support that business, and yet another example using loyalty to address merchant needs and then including additional MasterCard services to help them in other ways. 
And finally, our most recent acquisition is APT, Applied Predictive Technologies. That's a leading cloud-based analytics company in the information services area. platform, combined with our anonymized transaction data and advisers analytics capabilities, is what enables us to advance our ability to deliver differentiated products to issuers as well as to merchants and to expand our reach beyond our traditional client base. And in fact, just a few weeks after the acquisition, APT's access to our expanded client base has already resulted in a number of wins, and I'm going to call out 2 of them. The first is in Italy where APT's platform will be used to test the promotional effectiveness of their loyalty scheme. The second one is a leading Canadian retailer to help them address some of their key business challenges. 
So why am I saying all this to you about acquisition? Because we recognized that for each acquisition, there's a certain amount of effort, a certain amount of investment. We are clearly seeing the benefits that come from them in our engagement with clients, particularly when you look at adding their capacity to the services and capability that MasterCard already provides.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for going into our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,305398852,840946,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. So let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and FX-adjusted growth rates for this quarter. The differential continues to be primarily driven by the euro, U.S.",1913,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. So let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and FX-adjusted growth rates for this quarter. The differential continues to be primarily driven by the euro, U.S. dollar exchange rate, and these figures also exclude the impact of a special item taken this quarter related to a settlement we made with Tesco, the largest, largest merchant involved in the U.K. merchant litigation case. 
You can see EPS growth was 6% or 15% after adjusting for currency. Continued revenue momentum, good cost control and executing on our tax strategies and current share repurchase program are contributed to that performance. I'd like to point out a few items here and then I'll talk about the major P&L line items in subsequent slides. 
First, as expected, acquisitions that we made in 2014 and 2015 drove $0.03 of dilution. Second, the tax rate was favorable at 25.8% in the quarter, primarily due to our continued focus on better aligning our tax structure with our business footprint. Third, share repurchases contributed $0.02 per share to our second quarter results. As of July 22, we have 2 billion remaining under our current authorization. Lastly, cash flow from operations was $821 million. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and other liquid investments of about $5.1 billion.
So let me turn to Page 4 where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, was up 13% on a local currency basis, up from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 7% made up of credit and debit growth of 7% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV was up 1 ppt versus last quarter, primarily due to our consumer credit programs and partially offset by the continued 2 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. Outside of the U.S, volume growth was 16% on a local currency, up from last quarter and primarily driven by Europe. Cross-border volume grew 17% on a local currency basis, lower than the 19% we saw in the first quarter, down slightly in all regions, except the U.S. Of particular note, growth in Europe remains strong in the low 20s with the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and Sweden as key contributors.
Turning to Page 5. You can see here processed transactions grew 13% globally to 12 billion. We continued to see double-digit growth in most regions. Growth increased from the 12% we saw in the first quarter, primarily due to the U.S. and Europe. And globally, the number of cards grew 8% with 2.2 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 1% as reported or 7% FX-adjusted given currency headwinds and in line with our overall expectations. Looking at the components of net revenue. Gross revenue increased 12% FX-adjusted, but we saw 28% growth in rebates and incentives, primarily due to the expected higher upfront incentive amortization from recently renewed contracts that we told you about. And additionally, the impact of local currency exchange rates was a 2 ppt headwind. Acquisitions contributed a little bit more than 2 ppt to net revenue growth. 
Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items on an FX-adjusted basis. First of all, domestic assessments grew 9% while worldwide GDV grew 13%. This 4 ppt gap is primarily due to the impact of local current somewhat offset by pricing. Cross-border volume fees grew 9% while cross-border volume grew 17%. Of the 8 ppt gap, the majority is due to a higher mix of inter-Europe activity as well as some local currency impact. Transaction processing fees grew 12%, primarily driven by the 13% growth in processed transactions. 
Finally, other revenues grew 29%. While primarily driven this quarter by our Pinpoint acquisition, our adviser business and our safety and security products and services continue to contribute to the growth of other revenue.
Moving on to Page 7. Here you can see total operating expenses after excluding the special item increased 9% in the quarter or 14% on an FX-adjusted basis. Of this, M&A activities contributed 10 ppt to total FX-adjusted expense growth, which is in line with what we have been expecting. The remaining 4 ppt was due to organic growth. We've modified the line at the bottom of our standard presentation chart to make it easier for you to compare the growth rates including and excluding M&A activities. As a reminder, the only acquisitions that we call out here are the ones that we did in 2014 and 2015. 
Most of our expense growth is in G&A. While the savings from our restructuring efforts essentially offset much of our reinvestment activities, the remaining growth is primarily due to the continued increase in our transaction processing activities driving higher data processing expenses. Data processing is also the line item in G&A where we are beginning to see the impact of paying the new local Russian processor or for processing domestic transactions. You can also see that most of our D&A expense growth is related to acquisitions, in particular the amortization of intangibles.
Turning to Slide 8. Let's discuss what we've seen in July through the 21st. Most of our business drivers are showing a higher growth rate compared to what we saw in the second quarter. The numbers through July 21 are as follows: Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 13%, up from the 11% in the second quarter. In the U.S. our processed volume grew 7%, up 2 ppt from what we saw last quarter even after a continued 2 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. And we saw an increase in both our credit and debit programs. Processed volume outside the U.S. grew 20%, also up about 2 ppt from the second quarter with higher growth in every region. Globally, processed transaction growth was 14%, up 1 ppt from what we saw in the second quarter with double-digit growth in all regions, except the U.S. which grew in the high single digits. And with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew at 19% globally, up 2 ppt from our second quarter growth. All regions were up in July, except for the U.S. which was essentially flat. However, we did see a continued uptick in volume from the U.S. to Europe that began during the second quarter.
Looking ahead, here is some commentary about full year 2015. Let me start by summarizing our thoughts about FX, and remember, the currency impacts us in 2 ways: So first of all, we have the impact of our functional currencies, euro and the Brazilian real relative to the U.S. dollar, and this is what we referred to as FX adjusted. While the real has continued to depreciate versus the U.S. dollar since our last earnings call -- commentary, the euro decline has somewhat stabilized. Second, we have the impact of local currency rates relative to the functional currencies, and the impact of this is already included in our FX-adjusted guidance. 
Our view for both of these factors hasn't changed since our last earnings call despite movements in several individual FX rates. Let me summarize. For the currency translation impact, the first FX factor I just mentioned, we continue to expect the net impact of the euro and the real would be a 6 to 8 ppt headwind to our as-reported results for the full year, depending on what line items we are talking about, so revenue, net income or EPS. And this assumes the euro continues trading at the 110 [ph] level and the Brazilian real at the 3 35 [ph] level for the rest of the year. And for the local to functional currency impact, so this is the second FX factor that I mentioned, we continue to expect an net headwind in the 2 ppt range throughout the year, both to revenue and the bottom line based on current rates.
Now let's move onto some of the individual P&L line items. And as you can see from our volume and transaction metrics, our underlying business remains strong and a little has changed in our 2015 outlook versus what we said back in April. On an FX-adjusted basis, we continue to expect high single-digit net revenue growth for 2015, including roughly 2 ppt from acquisitions, and on an as-reported basis, the net revenue growth rate would still likely be in the low single-digit range as a result of roughly 6 ppt FX headwind, primarily from the euro functional translation, and that's based on current rates.
Moving to rebates and incentives. We continue to expect the full year 2015 growth rates to be similar to the growth rate that we saw in Q1. The higher growth rate that we saw in Q2 will continue into Q3 before coming down in Q4, and that's due to the expected timing of some deals. 
When looking at total operating expense, we are now contemplating what investments we will need to make in China as the domestic market opens. while these over the next couple of years, we will start investing in the next few months. And we have not previously factored that into our thinking around 2015 operating expense. So we are now projecting the growth rate for total operating expense for full year 2015 to be in the high single digits on an FX-adjusted basis, up just slightly from our earlier view. Our full year continues to include roughly 7 ppt impact from acquisitions and as-reported growth will now likely be mid-single-digit range after continuing to expect a roughly 4 ppt tailwind from the euro and the real translation. 
We continue to project total EPS dilution will be about $0.11 to $0.13 for the full year 2015 from our recent acquisitions, including APT, which closed back in May, and less than half of the expected dilution is due to the amortization of acquired intangibles. You should now assume a full year 2015 tax rate of about 27% due to the continued benefits we have seen so far this year.
So to summarize, fundamentals continue to drive our underlying business in 2015 despite the mixed economic environment. Our expectations for headwinds from FX have not changed from what we said back in April, and we are still winning new business and managing our overall expenses prudently. 
Finally, let me move onto our long-term performance objectives. First, I know many of you continue to ask when we will be rolling our performance objective forward. We will provide you with our new long-term objectives at our Investor Day in September. So for the 2013 to 2015 period, our performance objectives remain unchanged from what I have said on our last earnings call. Given our expectations for 2015 revenue growth, we expect to deliver at the low end of our 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR. We continue to expect at least 20% EPS CAGR for the 3-year period due to the continued expense management as well as benefits from our lower tax rate and share repurchases. And we remain committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%. Remember these objectives are on a constant currency basis and exclude the M&A activity that we just talked about as well as any new ones that may occur this year.

And if they do, there are implications on pricing and yield. So the question they're getting and there are implications of how long it will take for them to put the companies together. We've done the Europe acquisition quite some years ago, and integrating that into MasterCard did posed some amount of challenges in terms of the cultures of the 2 companies. You also got the technologies we brought together. Remember that simple things like and Visa checkout are 2 different things, and that goes into the credit and debit technologies. And there's going to be a lot of stuff to be done, but we'll go past all that and assume all that gets done over a period of time. Back to your yield question, MasterCard Europe's yield is higher than the Visa Europe yield, but it is lower than our MasterCard global yield. Now there are 2 or 3 caveats I'd like to put into your mind around that before you conclude that means our yields will go up if Visa were to be in Europe in more rational pricing comparator. The first caveat is yields in Europe generally tend to be lower. Why is that? That's because it's a heavier mix of debit other than maybe in the U.K. and Spain, but most of Continental Europe is heavier weighted to debit. We also process and Visa fewer transactions as a percentage because of all the competition from the old legacy domestic processors, particularly in debit, across the European countries. You know there are breakthroughs happening in that space to increase the ratio of transactions we process, and today, we are processing just a little under 40%. Now that's higher than we used to, but it's still only 40%. So when you process less and then more debit, you kind of get a naturally lower yield in the system. The second little caveat, which is an important one as well, 1 is that MasterCard Europe, when I said our yield is higher than Visa Europe but lower the MasterCard as a whole, MasterCard Europe includes Eastern Europe and Russia. Visa Europe does not do that. And so you've got to be a little careful about assuming the numbers across MasterCard Europe and Visa Europe. You may be comparing chalk and cheese a little bit there. And the third part is you know the regulatory changes happening in Europe and interchange, and interchange doesn't directly impact network revenues. we've shown that time over time in every region around the world. But the fact is try to go back to an issuer during a time that their own P&L is being compressed by lower interchange -- dramatically lower interchange. That's going to be a little more challenging for pricing. So even today, our pricing Visa Europe that's why our yield is higher. They're gaining share even in that period of time. I'm not quite sure that if they do get in, they do buy at, what their pricing logic would be. If they're pricing logic is to be more rational and little bit to come closer to us, that may give us a little more flexibility. But I'm going to wait and watch before I conclude anything. Meanwhile, for us, it's business as usual in Europe. We're pumping and going Martina talk about our volume and our trends in Europe we're actually that missed this growing the way it should. We still think it's a very attractive growth business for our company in the years to come."

The co-brand businesses is becoming where everybody suddenly got focused on, and it's always been a relatively competitive space. And some parts of it have got more competitive, others less so. my general opinion has been most co-brands are decided relatively rationally. There is a great discussion on pricing. That's normally the starting point, as you would expect. But I do find that there is an intelligent about the value you bring to the merchant and the issuer and the consumer of that co-brand in the process of being the network on that co-brand. So if the merchant issuer feels that -- or the bank issuer feels that this is going to be an opportunity for them to build a stronger, closer relationship with some aspect of the consumer book, you tend to benefit from that, whether it be through analytics, through things like our advisors book or be through safety and security or be through loyalty and rewards. All those tend to patch together. And in fact, just the pricing of -- pricing and settlement, as literally is an entry point. And a lot of what you're seeing us do in our acquisitions is to build out the capacity of the company's existing assets to connect into some of these network assets and become more than just what we used to be 10 years ago. That's what we're trying to do, and I think that will help us over time with co-brands not just to the U.S. but also with books and also enable us to build more stable revenue streams even as competition keeps coming into different parts of our existing revenue stream. That's kind of a longer-term picture. It's not 3, 4 quarters. I'm really talking out 3, 4, 5, 6 years of how to think about the company for its future. Specific deals in the U.S. and elsewhere, there are some of them that keep coming up. I mean, every quarter, there are co-brands up. There are some small ones, some big ones. We are playing for all of them. And some of them continue to make sense to us and some of them are at a point of time when they don't make sense, then Martina and I kind of go and hide in the room and run away from the numbers.

I mean, at the end of the day, I came in 6 years ago, we started this work around that time. And it happened for the first 3, 4 years we only found a couple of deals that fitted into what we were trying to do. And at that time, what we were trying to do was what led to DataCash and Access Prepaid. Why was that? DataCash was like the e-Commerce gateway. Remember e-Commerce 6 years ago was the thing that everybody was talking about growing into -- we wanted to make sure we had great connectivity with acquirers and merchants by building that in. We had our own gateway in Asia. We folded this with that, added the gateway and now we've got a pretty decent-sized global gateway business. It has strengths and weaknesses. It's not strong enough in the U.S. It's stronger in Europe and Asia. We try to build it out, all that going on. Access Prepaid was because we were the minority players in prepaid, we wanted to grow in prepaid, we saw it as a growth opportunity. One of the things we saw in there was if you own the prepaid program manager, it connected well with your prepaid business and allowed you to grow your footprint. And lo and behold, 5 years later, we've done very well in prepaid. We are one of the leading brands, if not the leading brand, by the end of this year in prepaid. And that's been helped partly by prepaid -- by Access Prepaid. As we moved along and became clearer about where the future revenue streams would come from for continued growth, that's when we said let's focus on these bundled services: loyalty, safety, security, processing to see the data, connected to advisors and analytics. And as we built our confidence, we've kept looking at the deals. We looked at a ton of current deals and shut them out the door because it didn't fit one of those 3 criteria that Martina talked about: cultural fit, connectivity to our existing products and services, financial sense. But then along came and timing wise, a bunch of deals that just enabled us to do the last year. Now it's been 5 months since we've done APT basically, and one of the smaller ones. But it just depends on the year. So to give you a forward-looking idea about what this could look like. I just don't think I could predict that to you. But you should know that we will be acquisitive if it fits the 3 ideas and if we feel we can absorb it, and that's what we're trying to do."

And we're kind of working with all that, and we feel that we've got the good handle on all of those. The statement of objections, this covers 2 issues. And we were kind of aware of this for a while. We've been engaged in the dialogue with the commission, and we remain so in an effort to seek a constructive kind of resolution. For the first issue we're tackling is the idea of interregional transaction and the interchange rate that are charged on inbound consumer transactions in that from outside cards coming in. Now in our total numbers, that's less than 1% of our total volume, but it's an important issue. And Visa received a similar statement of objection from that ECI, I don't know, 3, 4 years ago, 3 years ago. And it's still sitting out there. So I don't even know how long this will take to come through to any sensible resolution, but it's a discussion that's happening should the ECD getting involvement with the interchange rate, Singaporean, Indian, Australian, American bank makes when a consumer from there e transacts in the EU with very different ticket sizes and implication than a European consumer transacting in the EU. So I mean, we'll see where that goes. That's what's going on there. So there's a second aspect of the statement of objections from and that has to do with cross-border or rather than acquiring rules for the European merchants. And that's we're talking to them about because how will that be constructed? Work, for example, if you were to allow that to happen, would acquirers move to 1 low-cost location and from that price down to a lower level, what will that mean for the banks that are the acquirers in other European countries. And so I don't know that one, where it's going to go. In the actual putting out of the rule, a couple of these proposals got dropped because different European countries found them less than palatable. So we'll see. It's early days. We'll see. But we have in our disclosure, as Martina about to tell you because I think see she's dying to say something. So I'm going to put it to Martina."

PayPal is much more than a gateway. And the different people use gateway very loosely. So in that whole space of digital transaction, whether they be through e-Commerce channel or in-app or browser-based or whether they be through physical contactless, there's going to be a lot of players playing in this space to connect to the merchant, to connect to the acquirer and to connect to the issuer and the digital vehicle that's being used. We are just a regular player playing with all of them. You have many earnings calls and investor meetings, we're not going to pick winners and losers in this because this thing is evolving at the rate that's very fast and people look like this 3, 4 years ago are no longer players there. So rather, they're placing bets with relatively agnostic and all the space is whether it be condensation was secure a lament versus the HCN we said we're not going to pick, we're going to do both. That's what we're doing. It's the same with all of these things. So my view, generally, is there's going to be a ton of players playing there. We are actively involved with many different aspects of what they do. We will be doing other things with them. You don't have to invest with them to be able to do good commercial deals with them, although it may make strategic sense sometimes to invest. And so I don't rule out any of these. I just have a view. Keep yourself open, play with all of them, find your company's best interest and remain relevant in the value chain. That's what we're trying to do. PayPal,as well, not just as you heard from many others. More than half of their comes from the use of traditional cards of all our networks. But in addition, their corporate card, some of their small business card is all of those as well. So I do see the fact that they do get around the networks around the issuers' compensation in that sense. That part, I don't like. If you remember that's why we put out of the digital wallet operator rules, which, by the way, the other networks have not yet clarified on. And so we put that out for a reason because we wanted the rules to be clear, and the rules are going to be that the brand of the issuer or the brand the network has to flow right through I believe that product and transaction but it's flow through. That's what Apple has done. That's a lot of what your other digital giants are doing. PayPal does it differently. Yes, PayPal is a client as well, and I think the digital world is a complicated one where you got to find your way to thread your needle through it. That's what we're trying to do."

Part of the way China tends to open up its businesses. Many years of working with China, including my years in my previous job in Asia, they've always done this in a very measured, thoughtful way that allows local industry to both benefit from the influx of foreign money and technology but to also actually protect itself in a way from that influx. And it's been done very carefully over the years. I see no reason why they wouldn't be which is a very important industry to them. So we will have restrictions. We will have encumbrances. Already in the preliminary guidelines they've issued, which I referred to when I was speaking get more by the end of the year, they've got ideas around what qualifies for domestic processing and what kind of data can and cannot leave their shores and how you would operate for clearing out sizing and settlement and they got ideas but they're still at the stage where I don't know the detail. And finally, in all of these, the devil is in the details. We, because of our distributed operating structure different from other networks, may qualify for some aspects of our technology to be seen as more local than some of the others. But I don't know yet. It's all work in progress. And -- but rest assured, there will be encumbrances and there will be some restrictions, but it's an interesting market place still. It will be a marketplace that will evolve over a few years. Not only is it a question of getting processing setup on the ground in China, which you hope to be able to do by the end of next year for sure, technically, but it's more than that. It's what kind of acceptance do you have outside of what used to be the high-traffic tourist destinations in the big cities, which is where traditional foreign network acceptance was housed. How do you get to more issuers to be issuing these cards over the next period of time is going to be a lot of work on issuing on acceptance in addition to the processing. And part of what Martina talked about when she said we're going to start spending money this year is we see a 2, 3-year pattern of investing there I'll we're trying to do is start getting ahead of that curve and start putting ourselves in a better position so over the course of 3, 4, 5 years, we see we feel good today. Today, as I've said last time and I call, about half of the cards should bear with us but about half are with our largest competitor. It wasn't that way 5 years ago. We've got a decent position. But you know what, compared to China, branded cars were all tiny, and there's a huge opportunity in that system over a few years to come."

Our business continues to perform well with good volume and good transaction growth as well as the signing of a number of new deals. And as you all know, that's despite the mixed global economic environment we're all navigating through. After we adjust for currency headwinds, our net revenue grew 7%, which is exactly in line with our expectations. And as you know, executing on our strategy over the last few years has included our acquiring a number of businesses, and in fact, that accelerated over the past year or so and they are having a slight drag on our bottom line until we get them fully integrated. As we do this, we're all very closely monitoring our organic expense growth to help fund these integrations and that close care has delivered EPS growth of 15%. And that, of course, excludes the impact of currency translation and a special item related to litigation that we will touch on later during the call. 
I'm going to just briefly touch on global economics this quarter. And overall, the environments in the U.S. and Europe have continued to improve as key economic indicators remain healthy. But the U.S. consumer is clearly still not spending all of their gas savings. Latin America and Asia Pacific remain challenged, most notably in Brazil and in China, and our business continues to be impacted by the strong U.S. dollar. But our fundamentals remain strong with double-digit volume and transaction growth in spite of these economic situations.
So before we go to our business highlights, let me quickly update you on China. 2 weeks ago, the Chinese regulator issued a draft version of the guidelines for review and for comment. They're going to need further clarity on some of the details there that are connected to domestic switching operations and I'm assuming that will probably happen when the final regulations are issued likely later this year. In the meanwhile, what we are doing is working on all fronts, issuing, acquiring and on-soil processing, so we can try and take advantage of this opportunity as we get further clarity. Now based on everything we know today, we continue to believe what we told you earlier that we would be technically ready to process domestic Chinese transactions by the end of 2016.
So let's move on to some of our recent business activity. And during the quarter, we signed a number of new agreements and renewals around the world and I'm going to pick 3 or 4 examples. So in the U.K., we signed a new agreement with Virgin Money to convert their debit card portfolio to contactless-enabled debit MasterCards. And that deal now gives us 100% of Virgin Money's existing proprietary debit and credit book. In the U.S, we continue to grow our debit businesses by signing now, for example, a new agreement with TD Bank to convert their PIN debit card portfolio to have preferred MasterCard routing. In the U.S. as well, we have several co-brand credit renewals: Ann Taylor, Barnes & Noble, Brooks Brothers, Meijer and Spirit Airlines. 
And so moving beyond all these specific customer agreements, I will talk about a couple of topics, and the first one is we are significantly investing in cybersecurity-related technology to offer much greater protection to our cardholders, to merchants, to issuing banks and there is no silver bullet to completely eliminate fraud. But if you apply a sensible multilayered approach that has some coordination across the industry, we're all convinced we can help to significantly reduce that risk. And protecting card credentials through EMV, through SecureCode and now through tokenization are only a few examples of our efforts in this area. We've actually recently announced the expansion of our tokenization services to private label card issuers, and we're the first payment network to do so with BJ's Wholesale Clubs, Kohl's and J.C. Penney will be among the first retailers to use these services later this year.
We also partnered with Synchrony Financial and Citi Retail Services and these are 2 of the largest private label issuers in the U.S. to enable the use of their private label cards in participating the mobile payment and digital wallet services.
Another area of focus in this space of safety has been on using biometrics to further protect the consumer's identity and you will all see new stories and pilots we are doing where consumers use an app on their smartphone to verify their identity for online transactions by taking a selfie. And for those of you who are attending our Investor Day in September, you can take 100 selfies each and see this technology in person. 
Another example is Safety Net, which many of you saw demonstrated at last year's Investor Day. We are working actually closely with many providers including people like Dovestrike [ph] and FireEye to share broader cyber threat information. But the thing is with SafetyNet, it's not just about sharing the information. We don't just detect threat, but we act upon them in real-time by providing an independent layer of security on behalf of our issuers globally. 
In 2014, for example, SafetyNet detected and stopped several confirmed fraud events including two where forensics determined that the issue exposure could have been roughly $80 million. So SafetyNet's unique solution is now being deployed globally across all products, all channels, and over the past 2 years since launch, more than 80% of our issuers are now using this service. Remember, not just to share the information but to act upon that in real-time. 
Another topic of interest is how acquisitions fit into our overall strategy. So as a reminder, our M&A focus areas include loyalty, data analytics, processing and safety and security. Now because these areas are all of strategic importance to us, our belief is that any transaction we do there has to stand on its own in terms of contribution, but it's also, most importantly, got to provide ways for us to cross-sell their capabilities in a bundled way with existing MasterCard products and services or what we talk about as the multiplier effect. 
So today I'm going to talk a little bit about what these acquisitions are doing, some of them at least, in combination with the rest of MasterCard. First of all, anything we acquired before 2014, so that's DataCash and Access Prepaid, is now already embedded in our base numbers. These acquisitions have been extremely helpful in expanding our business and revenue growth, and as I mentioned just now, both on their own but also as combined with our existing products. And let me give you one example from me for DataCash and Access. By combining our acquisition of DataCash with our previously existing gateway services in Asia Pacific and then our recent acquisition of TNS, we have built one of the few global e-commerce gateway solutions available. And that combined solution is enabling us to get closer to acquirers, closer to merchants, more easily deploy our innovations with them and protect their digital transactions with what I think are extremely robust fraud and risk management solutions. So for example, we now have over 120 relationships with acquirers around the world and we are providing integrated product offerings directly to merchants such as an omni-channel solution for H&M in the U.K. 
DataCash is enabling us to more easily deploy innovations like MasterPass. We've added MasterPass to the Boot's drugstore chain website in the U.K. We just quickly connected over 2,000 merchants in just a few days for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, all these enabled through DataCash. Another example, H.I.S., that's Japan's leading travel company, is using DataCash fraud management solution to enable safe online sales in Malaysia and in Indonesia.
Access. In 2013, Access Prepaid helped Qantas upgrade its Frequent Flyer program to include the Qantas Cash multicurrency prepaid card. And just recently, that Qantas Cash surpassed AUD 1 billion in sales. It's added almost 10 million transactions processed by MasterCard since launch. And that, by the way, is just one of many currency prepaid cards in a number of verticals that we've launched around the world using the program management capabilities of Access Prepaid combined with our prepaid product capacity and our selling skills in the regions.
So let's get to talk about acquisitions we've done over the past 18 months and those, by the way, are the ones we include when we call out acquisitions in our numbers. Remember we only exclude acquisitions from our base for up to 2 calendar years. And that means by the end of this year, of the acquisitions made recently, only Applied Predictive Technologies, APT, will continue to be excluded in 2016. 
So a few examples on how some of these newer acquisitions are supporting our strategy. In February 2014, we added substantial software engineering capacity and capabilities in the digital and mobile payments area with the acquisition of C-SAM. That's allowing us to accelerate the development and the expansion of MasterPass and other mobile payment solutions. And just this morning, we've announced the launch of MasterPass in India bringing the total number of live markets to 24. And on the merchant side, we've added Alitalia, South African Airways, Carnival Cruise Lines, Best Western Canada and a host of others. 
In mid-2014, the acquisition of ElectraCard Services, ECS, expanded our development capabilities and that enabled us to provide lower cost authorization and clearing services as well as a suite of platforms that enable local issuer processing or local acquirer processing services. As one example, ECS' technology was what we used to open our processing center in Dubai last year. 
So C-SAM, in combination with ECS, now provides the backbone of our technology hub in India. It's got a large team of talented technologies. It's got a wealth of our creative ideas. That tech hub is playing a very important role in creating and supporting innovative digital payment technologies that we are now using around the world. 
On the loyalty front, we acquired Pinpoint last year. That's the premier loyalty provider in Australia. We're now expanding that across Asia Pacific.  Pinpoint enables us to offer value-added solutions to issuers, to merchants and to consumers, and an example is a recent agreement with Coles Card Australia who will not only be converting their consumer credit business to MasterCard, but while doing so, are adding Pinpoint's loyalty solutions. 
Another example, this one in the merchant space, is that we recently won a deal with Dick Smith Electronics in Australia, and this deal combines the Pinpoint redemption network for their gift cards. We add MasterPass to their website, we provide advisers analytics to support their business. And yes, another example of using loyalty to address merchant needs and then including additional MasterCard services to help them in other ways. 
And finally, our most recent acquisition is APT, Applied Predictive Technologies. That's a leading cloud-based analytics company in the information services area. Their Test & Learn platform, combined with our anonymized transaction data and advisers analytics capabilities, is what enables us to advance our ability to deliver differentiated products to issuers as well as to merchants and to expand our reach beyond our traditional client base. And in fact, just a few weeks after the acquisition, APT's access to our expanded client base has already resulted in a number of wins and I'm going to call out 2 of them. The first is a bank of Positano, Italy where APT's platform will be used to test the promotional effectiveness of their loyalty scheme. A second one is with a leading Canadian retailer to help them address some of their key business challenges. 
So why am I saying all this to you about acquisitions? Because we recognize that for each acquisition, there's a certain amount of effort, a certain amount of investment. But we are clearly seeing the benefits that come from them in our engagement with clients, particularly when you look at adding their capacity to the services and capability that MasterCard already provides.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for going into our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,305398852,841331,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. So let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and FX-adjusted growth rates for this quarter. The differential continues to be primarily driven by the euro-U.S.",1914,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. So let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and FX-adjusted growth rates for this quarter. The differential continues to be primarily driven by the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate and these figures also exclude the impact of a special item taken this quarter related to a settlement we made with Tesco, the largest merchant involved in the U.K. merchant litigation case. 
So you can see EPS growth was 6% or 15% after adjusting for currency. Continued revenue momentum, good cost control and executing on our tax strategies and current share repurchase program all contributed to that performance. 
I'd like to point out a few items here and then I'll talk about the major P&L line items in subsequent slides. First, as expected, acquisitions that we made in 2014 and 2015 drove $0.03 of dilution. Second, the tax rate was favorable at 25.8% in the quarter, primarily due to our continued focus on better aligning our tax structure with our business footprint. Third, share repurchases contributed $0.02 per share to our second quarter results. As of July 22, we have $2 billion remaining under our current authorization. Lastly, cash flow from operations was $821 million. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and other liquid investments of about $5.1 billion.
So let me turn to Page 4 where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV was up 13% on a local currency basis, up from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 7% made up of credit and debit growth of 7% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV was up 1 ppt versus last quarter, primarily due to our consumer credit programs and partially offset by the continued 2 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 16% on a local currency basis, up from last quarter and primarily driven by Europe. Cross-border volume grew 17% on a local currency basis, lower than the 19% we saw in the first quarter, down slightly in all regions except the U.S. Of particular note, growth in Europe remained strong in the low 20s with the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and Sweden as key contributors.
Turning to Page 5. You can see here processed transactions grew 13% globally to $12 billion. We continued to see double-digit growth in most regions. Growth increased from the 12% we saw in the first quarter, primarily due to the U.S. and Europe. And globally, the number of cards grew 8% with 2.2 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 1% as reported or 7% FX-adjusted given currency headwinds and in line with our overall expectations. 
Looking at the components of net revenue. Gross revenue increased 12% FX-adjusted, but we saw 28% growth in rebates and incentives primarily due to the expected higher upfront incentive amortization from recently renewed contracts that we told you about. And additionally, the impact of local currency exchange rates was a 2 ppt headwind. Acquisitions contributed a little bit more than 2 ppt to net revenue growth. 
Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items on an FX-adjusted basis. First of all, domestic assessments grew 9% while worldwide GDV grew 13%. This 4 ppt gap is primarily due to the impact of local currency somewhat offset by pricing. Cross-border volume fees grew 9% while cross-border volume grew 17%. Of the 8 ppt gap, the majority is due to a higher mix of inter-Europe activity as well as some local currency impact. Transaction processing fees grew 12%, primarily driven by the 13% growth in processed transactions. 
Finally, other revenues grew 29%. While primarily driven this quarter by our Pinpoint acquisition, our Advisor business and our safety and security products and services continued to contribute to the growth of other revenue.
Moving on to Page 7. Here you can see total operating expenses after excluding the special item increased 9% in the quarter or 14% on an FX-adjusted basis. Of this, M&A activities contributed 10 ppt to total FX-adjusted expense growth, which is in line with what we have been expecting. The remaining 4 ppt was due to organic growth. We've modified the line at the bottom of our standard presentation chart to make it easier for you to compare the growth rates including and excluding M&A activities. As a reminder, the only acquisitions that we call out here are the ones that we did in 2014 and 2015. 
Most of our expense growth is in G&A. While the savings from our restructuring efforts essentially offset much of our reinvestment activities, the remaining growth is primarily due to the continued increase in our transaction processing activities driving higher data processing expenses. Data processing is also the line item in G&A where we are beginning to see the impact of paying the new local Russian processor or NSPK for processing domestic transactions. You can also see that most of our D&A expense growth is related to acquisitions, in particular the amortization of intangibles.
Turning to Slide 8. Let's discuss what we've seen in July through the 21st. Most of our business drivers are showing a higher growth rate compared to what we saw in the second quarter. The numbers through July 21 are as follows: starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 13%, up from the 11% in the second quarter. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 7%, up 2 ppt from what we saw last quarter even after a continued 2 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. And we saw an increase in both our credit and debit programs. Processed volume outside the U.S. grew 20%, also up about 2 ppt from the second quarter with higher growth in every region. Globally, processed transaction growth was 14%, up 1 ppt from what we saw in the second quarter with double-digit growth in all regions, except the U.S., which grew in the high single digits. And with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew at 19% globally, up 2 ppt from our second quarter growth. All regions were up in July except for the U.S., which was essentially flat. However, we did see a continued uptick in volume from the U.S. to Europe that began during the second quarter.
Looking ahead, here is some commentary about full year 2015. Let me start by summarizing our thoughts about FX, and remember, the currency impacts us in 2 ways: so first of all, we have the impact of our functional currencies, euro and the Brazilian real, relative to the U.S. dollar and this is what we referred to as FX-adjusted. While the real has continued to depreciate versus the U.S. dollar since our last earnings call commentary, the euro decline has somewhat stabilized; second, we have the impact of local currency rates relative to their functional currencies and the impact of this is already included in our FX-adjusted guidance. 
Our view for both of these factors hasn't changed since our last earnings call despite movements in several individual FX rates. Let me summarize. For the functional currency translation impact, the first FX factor I just mentioned, we continue to expect the net impact of the euro and the real would be a 6 to 8 ppt headwind to our as-reported results for the full year, depending on what line items we are talking about so revenue, net income or EPS, and this assumes the euro continues trading at the $1.10 level and the Brazilian real at the  BRL 3.35 level for the rest of the year. And for the local-to-functional currency impact, so this is the second FX factor that I mentioned, we continue to expect a net headwind in the 2 ppt range throughout the year, both to revenue and the bottom line based on current rates.
Now let's move onto some of the individual P&L line items, and as you can see from our volume and transaction metrics, our underlying business remains strong and little has changed in our 2015 outlook versus what we said back in April. On an FX-adjusted basis, we continue to expect high single-digit net revenue growth for 2015 including roughly 2 ppt from acquisitions, and on an as-reported basis, the net revenue growth rate would still likely be in the low single-digit range as a result of roughly 6 ppt FX headwind, primarily from the euro functional translation and that's based on current rate.
Moving to rebates and incentives. We continue to expect the full year 2015 growth rates to be similar to the growth rate that we saw in Q1. The higher growth rate that we saw in Q2 will continue into Q3 before coming down in Q4 and that's due to the expected timing of some deals. 
When looking at total operating expense, we are now contemplating what investments we will need to make in China as the domestic market opens. While these will occur over the next couple of years, we will start investing in the next few months and we have not previously factored that into our thinking around 2015 operating expense. So we are now projecting the growth rate for total operating expense for full year 2015 to be in the high single digits on an FX-adjusted basis, up just slightly from our earlier view. Our full year continues to include a roughly 7 ppt impact from acquisitions, and as-reported growth will now likely to be mid-single-digit range after continuing to expect a roughly 4 ppt tailwind from the euro and the real translation. 
We continue to project total EPS dilution will be about $0.11 to $0.13 for the full year 2015 from our recent acquisitions including APT, which closed back in May, and less than half of the expected dilution is due to the amortization of acquired intangibles. 
You should now assume a full year 2015 tax rate of about 27% due to the continued benefits we have seen so far this year.
So to summarize. Solid fundamentals continue to drive our underlying business in 2015 despite the mixed economic environment. Our expectations for headwinds from FX have not changed from what we said back in April, and we are still winning new business and managing our overall expenses prudently. 
Finally, let me move on to our long-term performance objectives. First, I know many of you continue to ask when we will be rolling our performance objectives forward. We will provide you with our new long-term objectives at our Investor Day in September. So for the 2013 to 2015 period, our performance objectives remain unchanged from what I have said on our last earnings call. Given our expectations for 2015 revenue growth, we expect to deliver at the low end of our 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR. We continue to expect at least 20% EPS CAGR for the 3-year period due to the continued expense management as well as benefits from our lower tax rate and share repurchases. And we remain committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%. Remember these objectives are on a constant currency basis and exclude the M&A activity that we just talked about as well as any new ones that may occur this year.

And if they do, there are implications on pricing and yield, which is the question you're getting at, and there are implications of how long it'll take for",633,"There are a lot of implications of what happens if and when Visa actually completes that activity. And if they do, there are implications on pricing and yield, which is the question you're getting at, and there are implications of how long it'll take for them to put the companies together. We've done the Europay acquisition quite some years ago and integrating that into MasterCard did pose some amount of challenges in terms of the cultures of the 2 companies. You also got the technologies we brought together. Remember that simple things like V.me and Visa Checkout are 2 different things and that goes into their credit and debit technologies and there's going to be a lot of stuff to be done. But let us get past all that and assume all that gets done over a period of time. Back to your yield question, MasterCard Europe's yield is higher than the Visa Europe yield, but it is lower than our MasterCard global yield. Now there are 2 or 3 caveats I'd like to put into your mind around that before you conclude that means our yields will go up if Visa were to be in Europe a more rational pricing comparator. The first caveat is yields in Europe generally tend to be lower. Now why is that? That's because it's a heavier mix of debit other than maybe in the U.K. and Spain, but most of Continental Europe is heavier weighted to debit. We also process, both us and Visa, fewer transactions as a percentage because of all the competition from the old legacy domestic processors, particularly in debit, across the European countries. You know there are breakthroughs happening in that space to increase the ratio of transactions we process and today we are processing just a little under 40%. Now that's higher than we used to, but it's still only 40%. So when you process less and then more debit, you kind of get a naturally lower yield in the system. The second little caveat, which is an important one as well is that MasterCard Europe, when I said our yield is higher than Visa Europe, but lower the MasterCard as a whole, MasterCard Europe includes Eastern Europe and Russia. Visa Europe does not do that. And so you've got to be a little careful about assuming the numbers across MasterCard Europe and Visa Europe. You may be comparing chalk and cheese a little bit there. And the third part is you know the regulatory change that's happening in Europe with what's going on at the interchange and interchange doesn't directly impact network revenues. We've shown that time over time in every region around the world. But the fact is try to go back to an issuer during a time that their own P&L is being compressed by lower interchange -- dramatically lower interchange, and I think that's going to be a little more challenging for pricing. So even today, our pricing is higher than Visa Europe and that's why our yield is higher. They're gaining share even in that period of time. I'm not quite sure that if they do get in, they do buy it, what their pricing logic would be. If they're pricing logic is to be more rational and raise it a little bit to come closer to us, that may give us a little more flexibility. But I'm going to wait and watch before I conclude anything. Meanwhile, for us, it's business as usual in Europe. We're pumping and we are going share. You've heard Martina talk about our volume and our trends in Europe. We're actually trying our best to keep that business growing the way it should. We still think it's a very attractive growth business for our company in the years to come."

And some parts of it have got more competitive, others less so. My general opinion has been most co-brands are decided relatively rationally. There is a great discussion on pricing. That's normally the starting point, as you would expect. But I do find that there is an intelligent conversation about the value you bring to the merchant and the issuer and the consumer of that co-brand in the process of being the network on that co-brand. So if the merchant issuer feels that -- or the bank issuer feels that this is going to be an opportunity for them to build a stronger, closer relationship with some aspect of their consumer book, you tend to benefit from that. Whether it be through analytics, through things like our Advisors book or be it through safety and security or be it through loyalty and rewards, all those tend to patch together, and in fact, just the pricing of clearing, authorizing and settlement as literally as an entry point. And a lot of what you're seeing us do in our acquisitions is to build out the capacity of the company's existing assets to connect into some of these edge-of-the-network assets and become more than just what we used to be 10 years ago. That's what we are trying to do and I think that will help us over time with co-brands not just in the U.S., but also with proprietary books and also enable us to build more stable revenue streams even as competition keeps coming into different parts of our existing revenue stream. That's kind of a longer-term picture. It's not 3, 4 quarters. I'm really talking out 3, 4, 5, 6 years of how to think about the company for its future. Specific deals in the U.S. and elsewhere, there are a ton of them that keep coming up. I mean, every quarter, there are co-brands up. There are some small ones, some big ones. We are playing for all of them. And some of them continue to make sense to us and some of them at a point of time when they don't make sense, then Martina and I kind of go and hide in the room and run away from the numbers. That's what we do."

And then we also looked at what kind of companies and skill sets are out there that we could potentially purchase. And I think you see the culmination over the last 18 months of all of that work, putting it together. We're looking at these acquisitions always, first, strategically, do they fit with MasterCard; will they expand our business; will they be catering to the multiplier effect that Ajay was mentioning, that means not only the putting their skill set into our business, but combining it with what we have and actually getting more out of it. So we looked at all of these. And then, of course, we look at does it culturally make sense, can the companies work together as well as does it make financially sense. All of those 3 criteria we really have not changed. And when you look at our comments about capital deployment, again we haven't changed those at all. We said, first, we would be a investing organically the business. Second, we would be looking in these particular areas that are of strategic importance to us for acquisitions.

At the end of the day, I came in 6 years ago, we started this work around that time. And it happened that for the first 3, 4 years, we only found a couple of deals that fitted into what we were trying to do. And at that time, what we were trying to do was what led to DataCash and Access Prepaid. Why was that? DataCash was like the e-commerce gateway. Remember e-commerce 6 years ago was the thing that everybody was talking about growing into -- we wanted to make sure we have the right connectivity with acquirers and merchants by building that in. We are our own gateway in Asia. We folded this with that, added the DNS gateway and now we've got a pretty decent-sized global gateway business. It has strengths and weaknesses. It's not strong enough in the U.S., it's stronger in Europe and Asia, we're trying to build it out, all that is going on. Access Prepaid was because we were the minority players in prepaid and we wanted to grow in prepaid, we saw it as a growth opportunity. One of the things we saw in there was if you owned a prepaid program manager, it connected well with your prepaid business and allowed you to grow your footprint. And lo and behold, 5 years later, we've done very well in prepaid. We are one of the leading brands, if not the leading brand, by the end of this year in prepaid. And that's been helped partly by prepaid -- by Access Prepaid. As we moved along and it kind of became clearer about where the future revenue streams would come from for continued growth, that's when we said let's focus on these bundled services: loyalty, safety, security, processing to see the data, connected to Advisors and analytics. And as we built our confidence, we've kept looking at the deals. We looked at a ton of deals and chucked them out the door because it didn't fit one of those 3 criteria that Martina talked about: cultural fit, connectivity to our existing products and services, financial sense. But then along came and timing wise, a bunch of deals that just enabled us to do this lot last year. Now it's been 5 months since we've done APT basically and one of the smaller ones, but it just depends on the year. So I'd be loathed to give you a forward-looking idea about what this could look like. I just don't think I could predict that to you. But you should know that we will be acquisitive if it fits those 3 ideas and if we feel we can absorb it and that's what we are trying to do."

And if those allegations are true, clearly these lawyers have kind of displayed conduct that's pretty disappointing. But to be clear, they were not the principals only involved in that whole settlement. There were lots of -- there's many people involved. There was great, close involvement by the judge at that time. I kind of don't think that the behavior of 2 lawyers deserves all that. But you know what, the court will decide that. We are pretty confident that settlement will stand. We'll see how it goes. But we've been aware of this for a little while now. The European part of it, there are 2 or 3 things. One is the actual announcement of the rules that have gone into play. And you know that those are happening, that 2030 will happen, the functional versus legal separation of scheme and processing will happen, the co-badging will happen. And we're kind of working with all that and we feel that we have got a good handle on all of those. The Statement of Objections, this covers 2 issues and we were kind of aware of this for a while. We've been engaged in the dialogue with the commission, and we remain so in an effort to seek a constructive kind of resolution. But the first issue they're tackling is the idea of interregional transaction and the interchange rates that are charged on inbound consumer cross-border transactions in the EEA from outside cards coming in. Now in our total numbers, that's less than 1% of our total volume, but it's an important issue. And Visa Inc. received a similar statement of objection from that EC, I don't know, 3, 4 years ago -- 3 years ago and it's still sitting out there. So I don't even know how long this will take to come through to any sensible resolution, but it's a discussion that's happening should the ECB getting involvement with the interchange rate that a Singaporean, Indian, Australian, American bank makes when a consumer from there transacts in the EU with very different ticket sizes and implication than a European consumer transacting in the EU. So I mean, we'll see where that goes. That's the work that's going on there. So there's a second aspect of the statement of objections from and that has to do with cross-border or rather central acquiring rules for the European merchants. And that's another one we are talking to them about because how will that be constructed? Would, for example, if you were to allow that to happen, would all acquirers move to one low-cost location and from that try and price down to a lower level, what will that mean for the banks that are the acquirers in other European countries. And so I don't know that one where it's going to go. In the actual putting out of the rule, a couple of these proposals got dropped because different European countries found them less than palatable. So we'll see. It's early days. We'll see. But we have in our disclosure, as Martina will about to tell you because I can see she's dying to say something. So I'm going to punt it to Martina."

PayPal is much more than a gateway. And Stripe's a different -- people use gateway very loosely. So in that whole space of digital transactions, whether they be through m- or e-commerce channel or in-app or browser-based or whether they be through physical contactless, there's going to be a lot of players playing in this space to connect to the merchant, to connect to the acquirer and to connect to the issuer and the digital vehicle that's being used. We're just keen to be a regular player playing with all of them. We've had a view through many earnings calls and investor meetings that we're not going to pick winners and losers in this because this thing is evolving at a rate that's very fast and people who look like winners this 3, 4 years ago are no longer relevant players there. So rather, they're placing bets with being relatively agnostic in all these spaces, whether it be -- if you remember, a little while back, the conversation was secure element versus HCE and we said we're not going to pick, we're going to do both. That's what we are doing. It's the same with all of these things. So my view generally is there's going to be a ton of players playing there. We are actively involved with Stripe with many different aspects of what they do. We will be doing other things with them. You don't have to invest with them to be able to do good commercial deals with them, although it may make strategic sense sometimes to invest. And so I don't rule out any of these. I just have a view: keep yourself open, play with all of them, find your company's best interest there and remain relevant in the value chain. That's what we are trying to do. PayPal is a client of ours as well, not just, as you've heard from many others, more than half of their float comes from the use of traditional cards of all our networks. But in addition, their corporate cards, some of their small business card is all with us as well. So I do see the fact that they do with ACH get around the networks and in a way around the issuer's compensation in that sense, that part I don't like. If you remember, that's why we put out the digital wallet operator rules, which, by the way, the other networks have yet not clarified on. And so we put that out for a reason because we wanted the rules to be clear and the rules have got to be that the brand of the issuer, the brand of the network has to flow right through the -- I believe we prefer a transaction that's not staged, but it's flow through. That's what Apple's done, that's what a lot of the other digital giants are doing. PayPal does it differently. Yes, PayPal is a client as well and I think the digital world is a complicated one where you've got to find your way to thread your needle through it. That's what we are trying to do."

Many years of working with China, including my years in my previous job in Asia, th",530,"So I would tell you to expect that you will not have restrictions and encumbrances would be to expect the wrong thing out of the way China tends to open up its businesses. Many years of working with China, including my years in my previous job in Asia, they have always done this in a very measured, thoughtful way that allows local industry to both benefit from the influx of foreign money and technology, but also to actually protect itself in a way from that influx and it's been done very carefully over the years. I see no reason why they wouldn't be as thoughtful in this, which is a very important industry to them. So we will have restrictions. We will have encumbrances. Already in the preliminary guidelines they've issued, which I referred to when I was speaking that they will get more by the end of the year, they've got ideas around what qualifies for domestic processing and what kind of data can and cannot leave their shores and how you would operate for clearing, authorizing and settlement and they've got ideas, but they are still at a stage where I don't know the detail of them. And finally, in all of these, the devil is in the details. We, because of our distributed operating structure a little different from other networks, may qualify for some aspects of our technology to be seen as more local than some of the others. But I don't know yet. It's all work in progress. And -- but rest assured, there will be encumbrances and there will be some restrictions, but it's an interesting market place still. It'll be a marketplace that'll evolve over a few years. And not only is it a question of getting processing set up on the ground in China, which you hope to be able to do by the end of next year for sure, technically, but it's more than that. It's what kind of acceptance do you have outside of what used to be the high-traffic tourist destinations in the big cities, which is where traditional foreign network acceptance was housed. How do you get to get more issuers to be issuing these cards over the next period of time. There is going to be a lot of work on issuing, on acceptance in addition to the processing. And part of what Martina talked about when she said we're going to start spending money this year is we see a 2-, 3-year pattern of investing there and all we are trying to do is to start getting ahead of that curve and start putting ourselves in a better position. So over the course of 3, 4, 5 years, we feel good about where we are in China. We feel good today. Today, as I've said last time in my call, about half of the cards should be with us, about half are with our largest competitor. It wasn't that way 5 years ago. We've got a decent position. But you know what, compared to China, UnionPay's own branded cars, we're all tiny and there's a huge opportunity in that system over a few years to come."

Our business continues to perform well with good volume and good transaction growth as well as the signing of a number of new deals. And as you all know, that's despite the mixed global economic environment we're all navigating through. After we adjust for currency headwinds, our net revenue grew 7%, which is exactly in line with our expectations. And as you know, executing on our strategy over the last few years has included our acquiring a number of businesses, and in fact, that accelerated over the past year or so and they are having a slight drag on our bottom line until we get them fully integrated. As we do this, we're all very closely monitoring our organic expense growth to help fund these integrations and that close care has delivered EPS growth of 15%. And that, of course, excludes the impact of currency translation and a special item related to litigation that we will touch on later during the call. 
I'm going to just briefly touch on global economics this quarter. And overall, the environments in the U.S. and Europe have continued to improve as key economic indicators remain healthy. But the U.S. consumer is clearly still not spending all of their gas savings. Latin America and Asia Pacific remain challenged, most notably in Brazil and in China, and our business continues to be impacted by the strong U.S. dollar. But our fundamentals remain strong with double-digit volume and transaction growth in spite of these economic situations.
So before we go to our business highlights, let me quickly update you on China. Two weeks ago, the Chinese regulator issued a draft version of the guidelines for review and for comment. They're going to need further clarity on some of the details there that are connected to domestic switching operations and I'm assuming that will probably happen when the final regulations are issued likely later this year. In the meanwhile, what we are doing is working on all fronts, issuing, acquiring and on-soil processing, so we can try and take advantage of this opportunity as we get further clarity. Now based on everything we know today, we continue to believe what we told you earlier that we would be technically ready to process domestic Chinese transactions by the end of 2016.
So let's move on to some of our recent business activity. And during the quarter, we signed a number of new agreements and renewals around the world and I'm going to pick 3 or 4 examples. So in the U.K., we signed a new agreement with Virgin Money to convert their debit card portfolio to contactless-enabled debit MasterCards. And that deal now gives us 100% of Virgin Money's existing proprietary debit and credit book. In the U.S, we continue to grow our debit businesses by signing now, for example, a new agreement with TD Bank to convert their PIN debit card portfolio to have preferred MasterCard routing. In the U.S. as well, we have several co-brand credit renewals: Ann Taylor, Barnes & Noble, Brooks Brothers, Meijer and Spirit Airlines. 
And so moving beyond all these specific customer agreements, I will talk about a couple of topics, and the first one is we are significantly investing in cybersecurity-related technology to offer much greater protection to our cardholders, to merchants, to issuing banks and there is no silver bullet to completely eliminate fraud. But if you apply a sensible multilayered approach that has some coordination across the industry, we're all convinced we can help to significantly reduce that risk. And protecting card credentials through EMV, through SecureCode and now through tokenization are only a few examples of our efforts in this area. We've actually recently announced the expansion of our tokenization services to private label card issuers, and we're the first payment network to do so with BJ's Wholesale Clubs, Kohl's and J.C. Penney will be among the first retailers to use these services later this year.
We also partnered with Synchrony Financial and Citi Retail Services and these are 2 of the largest private label issuers in the U.S. to enable the use of their private label cards in participating mobile payment and digital wallet services.
Another area of focus in this space of safety has been on using biometrics to further protect the consumer's identity and you've all seen new stories and pilots we are doing where consumers use an app on their smartphone to verify their identity for online transactions by taking a selfie. And for those of you who are attending our Investor Day in September, you can take 100 selfies each and see this technology in person. 
Another example is Safety Net, which many of you saw demonstrated at last year's Investor Day. We are working actually closely with many providers including people like Dovestrike [ph] and FireEye to share broader cyber threat information. But the thing is with SafetyNet, it's not just about sharing the information. We don't just detect threats, but we act upon them in real-time by providing an independent layer of security on behalf of our issuers globally. 
In 2014, for example, SafetyNet detected and stopped several confirmed fraud events including 2 where forensics determined that the issuer exposure could have been roughly $80 million. So SafetyNet's unique solution is now being deployed globally across all products, all channels, and over the past 2 years since launch, more than 80% of our issuers are now using this service. Remember, not just to share the information, but to act upon that in real-time. 
Another topic of interest is how acquisitions fit into our overall strategy. So as a reminder, our M&A focus areas include loyalty, data analytics, processing and safety and security. Now because these areas are all of strategic importance to us, our belief is that any transaction we do there has to stand on its own in terms of contribution, but it's also, most importantly, got to provide ways for us to cross-sell their capabilities in a bundled way with existing MasterCard products and services or what we talk about as the multiplier effect. 
So today I'm going to talk a little bit about what these acquisitions are doing, some of them at least, in combination with the rest of MasterCard. First of all, anything we acquired before 2014, so that's DataCash and Access Prepaid, is now already embedded in our base numbers. These acquisitions have been extremely helpful in expanding our business and revenue growth, and as I mentioned just now, both on their own but also as combined with our existing products. And let me give you one example from each of DataCash and Access. By combining our acquisition of DataCash with our previously existing gateway services in Asia Pacific and then our recent acquisition of TNS, we have built one of the few global e-commerce gateway solutions available. And that combined solution is enabling us to get closer to acquirers, closer to merchants, more easily deploy our innovations with them and protect their digital transactions with what I think are extremely robust fraud and risk management solutions. So for example, we now have over 120 relationships with acquirers around the world and we are providing integrated product offerings directly to merchants such as an omni-channel solution for H&M in the U.K. 
DataCash is enabling us to more easily deploy innovations like MasterPass. We've added MasterPass to the Boot's drugstore chain website in the U.K. We just quickly connected over 2,000 merchants in just a few days for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, all these enabled through DataCash. Another example, H.I.S., that's Japan's leading travel company, is using DataCash fraud management solution to enable safe online sales in Malaysia and in Indonesia.
Access. In 2013, Access Prepaid helped Qantas upgrade its Frequent Flyer program to include the Qantas Cash multicurrency prepaid card. And just recently, that Qantas Cash surpassed AUD 1 billion in sales. It's added almost 10 million transactions processed by MasterCard since launch. And that, by the way, is just one of many currency prepaid cards in a number of verticals that we've launched around the world using the program management capabilities of Access Prepaid combined with our prepaid product capacity and our selling skills in the regions.
So let's get to talk about acquisitions we've done over the past 18 months and those, by the way, are the ones we include when we call out acquisitions in our numbers. Remember we only exclude acquisitions from our base for up to 2 calendar years. And that means by the end of this year, of the acquisitions made recently, only Applied Predictive Technologies, APT, will continue to be excluded in 2016. 
So a few examples on how some of these newer acquisitions are supporting our strategy. In February 2014, we added substantial software engineering capacity and capabilities in the digital and mobile payments area with the acquisition of C-SAM. That's allowing us to accelerate the development and the expansion of MasterPass and other mobile payment solutions. And just this morning, we've announced the launch of MasterPass in India bringing the total number of live markets to 24. And on the merchant side, we've added Alitalia, South African Airways, Carnival Cruise Lines, Best Western Canada and a host of others. 
In mid-2014, the acquisition of ElectraCard Services, ECS, expanded our development capabilities and that enabled us to provide lower cost authorization and clearing services as well as a suite of platforms that enabled local issuer processing or local acquirer processing services. As one example, ECS' technology was what we used to open our processing center in Dubai last year. 
So C-SAM, in combination with ECS, now provides the backbone of our technology hub in India. It's got a large team of talented technologies. It's got a wealth of our creative ideas. That tech hub is playing a very important role in creating and supporting innovative digital payment technologies that we are now using around the world. 
On the loyalty front, we acquired Pinpoint last year. That's the premier loyalty provider in Australia. We're now expanding that across Asia Pacific. Pinpoint enables us to offer value-added solutions to issuers, to merchants and to consumers, and an example is a recent agreement with Coles Card Australia who will not only be converting their consumer credit business to MasterCard, but while doing so, are adding Pinpoint's loyalty solutions. 
Another example, this one in the merchant space, is that we recently won a deal with Dick Smith Electronics in Australia, and this deal combines the Pinpoint redemption network for their gift cards. We add MasterPass to their website, we provide advisers analytics to support their business. And yet another example of using loyalty to address merchant needs and then including additional MasterCard services to help them in other ways. 
And finally, our most recent acquisition is APT, Applied Predictive Technologies. That's a leading cloud-based analytics company in the information services area. Their Test & Learn platform, combined with our anonymized transaction data and advisers analytics capabilities, is what enables us to advance our ability to deliver differentiated products to issuers as well as to merchants and to expand our reach beyond our traditional client base. And in fact, just a few weeks after the acquisition, APT's access to our expanded client base has already resulted in a number of wins and I'm going to call out 2 of them. The first is a bank of Positano [ph], Italy where APT's platform will be used to test the promotional effectiveness of their loyalty scheme. A second one is with a leading Canadian retailer to help them address some of their key business challenges. 
So why am I saying all this to you about acquisitions? Because we recognize that for each acquisition, there's a certain amount of effort, a certain amount of investment. But we are clearly seeing the benefits that come from them in our engagement with clients, particularly when you look at adding their capacity to the services and capability that MasterCard already provides.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for going into our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,305398852,841623,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. So let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and FX-adjusted growth rates for this quarter. The differential continues to be primarily driven by the euro-U.S.",1916,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. So let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and FX-adjusted growth rates for this quarter. The differential continues to be primarily driven by the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate and these figures also exclude the impact of a special item taken this quarter related to a settlement we made with Tesco, the largest merchant involved in the U.K. merchant litigation case. 
So you can see EPS growth was 6% or 15% after adjusting for currency. Continued revenue momentum, good cost control and executing on our tax strategies and current share repurchase program all contributed to that performance. 
I'd like to point out a few items here and then I'll talk about the major P&L line items in subsequent slides. First, as expected, acquisitions that we made in 2014 and 2015 drove $0.03 of dilution. Second, the tax rate was favorable at 25.8% in the quarter, primarily due to our continued focus on better aligning our tax structure with our business footprint. Third, share repurchases contributed $0.02 per share to our second quarter results. As of July 22, we have $2 billion remaining under our current authorization. Lastly, cash flow from operations was $821 million. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and other liquid investments of about $5.1 billion.
So let me turn to Page 4 where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV was up 13% on a local currency basis, up from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 7% made up of credit and debit growth of 7% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV was up 1 ppt versus last quarter, primarily due to our consumer credit programs and partially offset by the continued 2 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 16% on a local currency basis, up from last quarter and primarily driven by Europe. Cross-border volume grew 17% on a local currency basis, lower than the 19% we saw in the first quarter, down slightly in all regions except the U.S. Of particular note, growth in Europe remained strong in the low 20s with the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and Sweden as key contributors.
Turning to Page 5. You can see here processed transactions grew 13% globally to $12 billion. We continued to see double-digit growth in most regions. Growth increased from the 12% we saw in the first quarter, primarily due to the U.S. and Europe. And globally, the number of cards grew 8% with 2.2 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 1% as reported or 7% FX-adjusted given currency headwinds and in line with our overall expectations. 
Looking at the components of net revenue. Gross revenue increased 12% FX-adjusted, but we saw 28% growth in rebates and incentives primarily due to the expected higher upfront incentive amortization from recently renewed contracts that we told you about. And additionally, the impact of local currency exchange rates was a 2 ppt headwind. Acquisitions contributed a little bit more than 2 ppt to net revenue growth. 
Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items on an FX-adjusted basis. First of all, domestic assessments grew 9% while worldwide GDV grew 13%. This 4 ppt gap is primarily due to the impact of local currency somewhat offset by pricing. Cross-border volume fees grew 9% while cross-border volume grew 17%. Of the 8 ppt gap, the majority is due to a higher mix of intra-Europe activity as well as some local currency impact. Transaction processing fees grew 12%, primarily driven by the 13% growth in processed transactions. 
Finally, other revenues grew 29%. While primarily driven this quarter by our Pinpoint acquisition, our Advisor business and our safety and security products and services continued to contribute to the growth of other revenue.
Moving on to Page 7. Here you can see total operating expenses after excluding the special item increased 9% in the quarter or 14% on an FX-adjusted basis. Of this, M&A activities contributed 10 ppt to total FX-adjusted expense growth, which is in line with what we have been expecting. The remaining 4 ppt was due to organic growth. We've modified the line at the bottom of our standard presentation chart to make it easier for you to compare the growth rates including and excluding M&A activities. As a reminder, the only acquisitions that we call out here are the ones that we did in 2014 and 2015. 
Most of our expense growth is in G&A. While the savings from our restructuring efforts essentially offset much of our reinvestment activities, the remaining growth is primarily due to the continued increase in our transaction processing activities driving higher data processing expenses. Data processing is also the line item in G&A where we are beginning to see the impact of paying the new local Russian processor or NSPK for processing domestic transactions. You can also see that most of our D&A expense growth is related to acquisitions, in particular the amortization of intangibles.
Turning to Slide 8. Let's discuss what we've seen in July through the 21st. Most of our business drivers are showing a higher growth rate compared to what we saw in the second quarter. The numbers through July 21 are as follows: starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 13%, up from the 11% in the second quarter. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 7%, up 2 ppt from what we saw last quarter even after a continued 2 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. And we saw an increase in both our credit and debit programs. Processed volume outside the U.S. grew 20%, also up about 2 ppt from the second quarter with higher growth in every region. Globally, processed transaction growth was 14%, up 1 ppt from what we saw in the second quarter with double-digit growth in all regions, except the U.S., which grew in the high single digits. And with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew at 19% globally, up 2 ppt from our second quarter growth. All regions were up in July except for the U.S., which was essentially flat. However, we did see a continued uptick in volume from the U.S. to Europe that began during the second quarter.
Looking ahead, here is some commentary about full year 2015. Let me start by summarizing our thoughts about FX, and remember, the currency impacts us in 2 ways: so first of all, we have the impact of our functional currencies, the euro and the Brazilian real, relative to the U.S. dollar and this is what we refer to as FX-adjusted. While the real has continued to depreciate versus the U.S. dollar since our last earnings call commentary, the euro decline has somewhat stabilized; second, we have the impact of local currency rates relative to their functional currencies and the impact of this is already included in our FX-adjusted guidance. 
Our view for both of these factors hasn't changed since our last earnings call despite movements in several individual FX rates. Let me summarize. For the functional currency translation impact, the first FX factor I just mentioned, we continue to expect the net impact of the euro and the real would be a 6 to 8 ppt headwind to our as-reported results for the full year, depending on what line item we are talking about -- so revenue, net income or EPS, and this assumes the euro continues trading at the $1.10 level and the Brazilian real at the BRL 3.35 level for the rest of the year. And for the local-to-functional currency impact, so this is the second FX factor that I mentioned, we continue to expect a net headwind in the 2 ppt range throughout the year, both to revenue and the bottom line based on current rates.
Now let's move onto some of the individual P&L line items, and as you can see from our volume and transaction metrics, our underlying business remains strong and little has changed in our 2015 outlook versus what we said back in April. On an FX-adjusted basis, we continue to expect high single-digit net revenue growth for 2015 including roughly 2 ppt from acquisitions, and on an as-reported basis, the net revenue growth rate would still likely be in the low single-digit range as a result of roughly 6 ppt FX headwind, primarily from the euro functional translation and that's based on current rate.
Moving to rebates and incentives. We continue to expect the full year 2015 growth rates to be similar to the growth rate that we saw in Q1. The higher growth rate that we saw in Q2 will continue into Q3 before coming down in Q4 and that's due to the expected timing of some deals. 
When looking at total operating expense, we are now contemplating what investments we will need to make in China as the domestic market opens. While these will occur over the next couple of years, we will start investing in the next few months and we have not previously factored that into our thinking around 2015 operating expense. So we are now projecting the growth rate for total operating expense for full year 2015 to be in the high single digits on an FX-adjusted basis, up just slightly from our earlier view. Our full year continues to include a roughly 7 ppt impact from acquisitions, and as-reported growth will now likely to be mid-single-digit range after continuing to expect a roughly 4 ppt tailwind from the euro and the real translation. 
We continue to project total EPS dilution will be about $0.11 to $0.13 for the full year 2015 from our recent acquisitions including APT, which closed back in May, and less than half of the expected dilution is due to the amortization of acquired intangibles. 
You should now assume a full year 2015 tax rate of about 27% due to the continued benefits we have seen so far this year.
So to summarize. Solid fundamentals continue to drive our underlying business in 2015 despite the mixed economic environment. Our expectations for headwinds from FX have not changed from what we said back in April, and we are still winning new business and managing our overall expenses prudently. 
Finally, let me move on to our long-term performance objectives. First, I know many of you continue to ask when we will be rolling our performance objectives forward. We will provide you with our new long-term objectives at our Investor Day in September. So for the 2013 to 2015 period, our performance objectives remain unchanged from what I have said on our last earnings call. Given our expectations for 2015 revenue growth, we expect to deliver at the low end of our 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR. We continue to expect at least 20% EPS CAGR for the 3-year period due to the continued expense management as well as benefits from our lower tax rate and share repurchases. And we remain committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%. Remember these objectives are on a constant currency basis and exclude the M&A activity that we just talked about as well as any new ones that may occur this year.

And if they do, there are implications on pricing and yield, which is the question you're getting at, and there are implications of how long it'll take for them to put the companies together. We've done the Europay acquisition quite some years ago and integrating that into MasterCard did pose some amount of challenges in terms of the cultures of the 2 companies. You've also got the technology we brought together. Remember that simple things like V.me and Visa Checkout are 2 different things and that goes into their credit and debit technologies and there's going to be a lot of stuff to be done. But let us get past all that and assume all that gets done over a period of time. Back to your yield question, MasterCard Europe's yield is higher than the Visa Europe yield, but it is lower than our MasterCard global yield. Now there are 2 or 3 caveats I'd like to put into your mind around that before you conclude that means our yields will go up if Visa were to be in Europe a more rational pricing competitor. The first caveat is yields in Europe generally tend to be lower. Now why is that? That's because it's a heavier mix of debit other than maybe in the U.K. and Spain, but most of Continental Europe is heavier weighted to debit. We also process, both us and Visa, fewer transactions as a percentage because of all the competition from the old legacy domestic processors, particularly in debit, across the European countries. Now, you know there are breakthroughs happening in that space to increase the ratio of transactions we process and today we are processing just a little under 40%. Now that's higher than we used to, but it's still only 40%. So when you process less and there are more debit, you kind of get a naturally lower yield in the system. The second little caveat, which is an important one as well is that MasterCard Europe, when I said our yield is higher than Visa Europe, but lower the MasterCard as a whole, MasterCard Europe includes Eastern Europe and Russia. Visa Europe does not do that. And so you've got to be a little careful about assuming the numbers across MasterCard Europe and Visa Europe. You may be comparing chalk and cheese a little bit there. And the third part is you know the regulatory change that's happening in Europe with what's going on at the interchange and interchange doesn't directly impact network revenues. We've shown that time over time in every region around the world. But the fact is try to go back to an issuer during a time that their own P&L is being compressed by lower interchange -- dramatically lower interchange, and I think that's going to be a little more challenging for pricing. So even today, our pricing is higher than Visa Europe and that's why our yield is higher. They're gaining share even in that period of time. I'm not quite sure that if they do get in, they do buy it, what their pricing logic would be. If they're pricing logic is to be more rational and raise it a little bit to come closer to us, that may give us a little more flexibility. But I'm going to wait and watch before I conclude anything. Meanwhile, for us, it's business as usual in Europe. We're pumping away growing share. You've heard Martina talk about our volume and our trends in Europe. We're actually trying our best to keep that business growing the way it should. We still think it's a very attractive growth business for our company in the years to come."

And some parts of it have got more competitive, others less so. My general opinion has been most co-brands are decided relatively rationally. There is a great discussion on pricing. That's normally the starting point, as you would expect. But I do find that there is an intelligent conversation about the value you bring to the merchant and the issuer and the consumer of that co-brand in the process of being the network on that co-brand. So if the merchant issuer feels that -- or the bank issuer feels that this is going to be an opportunity for them to build a stronger, closer relationship with some aspect of their consumer book, you tend to benefit from that. Whether it be through analytics, through things like our Advisors book or be it through safety and security or be it through loyalty and rewards, all those tend to patch together, and in fact, just the pricing of clearing, authorizing and settlement as literally as an entry point. And a lot of what you're seeing us do in our acquisitions is to build out the capacity of the company's existing assets to connect into some of these edge-of-the-network assets and become more than just what we used to be 10 years ago. That's what we are trying to do and I think that will help us over time with co-brands not just in the U.S., but also with proprietary books and also enable us to build more stable revenue streams even as competition keeps coming into different parts of our existing revenue stream. That's kind of a longer-term picture. It's not 3, 4 quarters. I'm really talking out 3, 4, 5, 6 years of how to think about the company for its future. Specific deals in the U.S. and elsewhere, there are a ton of them that keep coming up. I mean, every quarter, there are co-brands up. There are some small ones, some big ones. We are playing for all of them. And some of them continue to make sense to us and some of them at a point of time when they don't make sense, then Martina and I kind of go and hide in the room and run away from the numbers. That's what we do."

And then we also looked at what kind of companies and skill sets are out there that we could potentially purchase. And I think you see the culmination over the last 18 months of all of that work, putting it together. We're looking at these acquisitions always, first, strategically, do they fit with MasterCard; will they expand our business; will they be catering to the multiplier effect that Ajay was mentioning, that means not only the putting their skill set into our business, but combining it with what we have and actually getting more out of it. So we looked at all of these. And then, of course, we look at does it culturally make sense, can the companies work together as well as does it make financially sense. All of those 3 criteria we really have not changed. And when you look at our comments about capital deployment, again we haven't changed those at all.

At the end of the day, I came in 6 years ago, we started this work around that time. And it happened that for the first 3 or 4 years, we only found a couple of deals that fitted into what we were trying to do. And at that time, what we were trying to do was what led to DataCash and Access Prepaid. Why was that? DataCash was like the e-commerce gateway. Remember e-commerce 6 years ago was the thing that everybody was talking about growing into -- we wanted to make sure we had the right connectivity with acquirers and merchants by building that in. We are our own gateway in Asia. We folded this with that, added the DNS gateway and now we've got a pretty decent-sized global gateway business. It has strengths and weaknesses. It's not strong enough in the U.S., it's stronger in Europe and Asia, we're trying to build it out, all that is going on. Access Prepaid was because we were the minority players in prepaid and we wanted to grow in prepaid, we saw it as a growth opportunity. One of the things we saw in there was if you owned a prepaid program manager, it connected well with your prepaid business and allowed you to grow your footprint. And lo and behold, 5 years later, we've done very well in prepaid. We are one of the leading brands, if not the leading brand, by the end of this year in prepaid. And that's been helped partly by prepaid -- by Access Prepaid. As we moved along and we kind of became clearer about where the future revenue streams would come from for continued growth, that's when we said let's focus on these bundled services: loyalty, safety, security, processing to see the data, connected to Advisors and analytics. And as we built our confidence, we've kept looking at the deals. We looked at a ton of deals and chucked them out the door because they didn't fit one of those 3 criteria that Martina talked about: cultural fit, connectivity to our existing products and services, financial sense. But then along came and timing wise, a bunch of deals that just enabled us to do this lot last year. Now it's been 5 months since we've done APT basically and one of the smaller ones, but it just depends on the year. So I'd be loath to give you a forward-looking idea about what this could look like. I just don't think I could predict that to you. But you should know that we will be acquisitive if it fits those 3 ideas and if we feel we can absorb it and that's what we are trying to do."

And if those allegations are true, clearly these lawyers have kind of displayed conduct that's pretty disappointing. But to be clear, they were not the principals only involved in that whole settlement. There were lots of -- there's many people involved. There was great, close involvement by the judge at that time. I kind of don't think that the behavior of 2 lawyers disrupts all that. But you know what, the court will decide that. We are pretty confident that settlement will stand. We'll see how it goes. But we've been aware of this for a little while now. The European part of it, there are 2 or 3 things. One is the actual announcement of the rules that have gone into play. And you know that those are happening, that 2030 will happen, the functional versus legal separation of scheme and processing will happen, the co-badging will happen. And we're kind of working with all that and we feel that we have got a good handle on all of those. The Statement of Objections, this covers 2 issues and we were kind of aware of this for a while. We've been engaged in a dialogue with the commission, and we remain so in an effort to seek a constructive kind of resolution. But the first issue they're tackling is the idea of interregional transactions and the interchange rates that are charged on inbound consumer cross-border transactions in the EEA from outside cards coming in. Now in our total numbers, that's less than 1% of our total volume, but it's an important issue. And Visa Inc. received a similar Statement of Objections from the EC, I don't know, 3, 4 years ago -- 3 years ago and it's still sitting out there. So I don't even know how long this will take to come through to any sensible resolution, but it's a discussion that's happening, that should the EC be getting involved with the interchange rates that a Singaporean, Indian, Australian, American bank makes when a consumer from there transacts in the EU with very different ticket sizes and implications than a European consumer transacting in the EU. So I mean, we'll see where that goes. That's the work that's going on there. So there's a second aspect of the Statement of Objections from the EC and that has to do with cross-border or rather central acquiring rules for the European merchants. And that's another one we are talking to them about because how will that be constructed? Would, for example, if you were to allow that to happen, would all acquirers move to one low-cost location and from there try and price down to a lower level, what would that mean for the banks that are the acquirers in other European countries. And so I don't know that one where it's going to go. In the actual putting out of the rule, a couple of these proposals got dropped because different European countries found them less than palatable. So we'll see. It's early days. We'll see. But we have in our disclosure, as Martina was about to tell you because I can see she's dying to say something. So I'm going to punt it to Martina."

PayPal is much more than a gateway. And Stripe's a different -- people use gateway very loosely. So in that whole space of digital transactions, whether they be through m- or e-commerce channel or in-app or browser-based or whether they be through physical contactless, there's going to be a lot of players playing in this space to connect to the merchant, to connect to the acquirer and to connect to the issuer and the digital vehicle that's being used. We're just keen to be a regular player playing with all of them. We've had a view through many earnings calls and investor meetings that we're not going to pick winners and losers in this because this thing is evolving at a rate that's very fast and people who looked like winners 3, 4 years ago are no longer relevant players there. So rather, they're placing bets with being relatively agnostic in all these spaces, whether it be -- you remember, a little while back, the conversation was secure element versus HCE and we said we're not going to pick, we're going to do both. That's what we are doing. It's the same with all of these things. So my view generally is there's going to be a ton of players playing there. We are actively involved with Stripe with many different aspects of what they do. We will be doing other things with them. You don't have to invest with them to be able to do good commercial deals with them, although it may make strategic sense sometimes to invest. And so I don't rule out any of these. I just have a view: keep yourself open, play with all of them, find your company's best interests there and remain relevant in the value chain. That's what we are trying to do. PayPal is a client of ours as well, not just, as you've heard from many others, more than half of their float comes from the use of traditional cards of all our networks. But in addition, their corporate cards, some of their small business card is all with us as well. So I do see the fact that they do with ACH get around the networks and in a way around the issuer's compensation in that sense, that part I don't like. If you remember, that's why we put out the digital wallet operator rules, which, by the way, the other networks have yet not clarified on. And so we put that out for a reason because we wanted the rules to be clear and the rules have got to be that the brand of the issuer, the brand of the network has to flow right through the -- I believe we prefer a transaction that's not staged, but it's flow through. That's what Apple's done, that's what a lot of the other digital giants are doing. PayPal does it differently. Yet, PayPal is a client as well and I think the digital world is a complicated one where you've got to find your way to thread your needle through it. That's what we are trying to do."

Many years of working with China, including my years in my previous job in Asia, they have always done this in a very measured, thoughtful way that allows local industry to both benefit from the influx of foreign money and technology, but also to actually protect itself in a way from that influx and it's been done very carefully over the years. I see no reason why they wouldn't be as thoughtful in this, which is a very important industry to them. So we will have restrictions. We will have encumbrances. Already in the preliminary guidelines they've issued, which I referred to when I was speaking and saying we'll get more by the end of the year, they've got ideas around what qualifies for domestic processing and what kind of data can and cannot leave their shores and how you would operate for clearing, authorizing and settlement and they've got ideas, but they are still at a stage where I don't know the detail of them. And finally, in all of these, the devil is in the details. We, because of our distributed operating structure a little different from other networks, may qualify for some aspects of our technology to be seen as more local than some of the others. But I don't know yet. It's all work in progress. And -- but rest assured, there will be encumbrances and there will be some restrictions, but it's an interesting market place still. It'll be a marketplace that'll evolve over a few years. And not only is it a question of getting processing set up on the ground in China, which you hope to be able to do by the end of next year for sure, technically, but it's more than that. It's what kind of acceptance do you have outside of what used to be the high-traffic tourist destinations in the big cities, which is where traditional foreign network acceptance was housed. How do you get to get more issuers to be issuing these cards over the next period of time. There is going to be a lot of work on issuing, on acceptance in addition to the processing. And part of what Martina talked about when she said we're going to start spending money this year is we see a 2-, 3-year pattern of investing there and all we are trying to do is to start getting ahead of that curve and start putting ourselves in a better position. So over the course of 3, 4, 5 years, we feel good about where we are in China. We feel good today. Today, as I've said last time in my call, about half of the cards issued there with us, while half are with our largest competitor. It wasn't that way 5 years ago. We've got a decent position. But you know what, compared to China UnionPay's own branded cards, we're all tiny and there's a huge opportunity in that system over a few years to come."

With the backdrop of this continuing uncertainty in the global economy, we're actually quite pleased with our results this quarter. After adjusting for currency, we reported net revenue growth of 8%, in line with what we talked we would get and an EPS growth of 11%. And this excludes the impact of a special item, and Martina will touch on that later.
So now let's take a quick look on what's going on in the global economy, and it's been challenged in recent months. And while the U.S. recovery remains among the most solid, job gains has steadily lowered the unemployment rate to just over 5%, but job and wage growth are starting to flow. Consumer confidence is only modestly up. And as you know, we have given yesterday's announcement, uncertainty of our rising interest rates remain.
So moving beyond the U.S. The economic picture is both mixed. Global growth are clearly slowing, particularly in smaller emerging markets, and the sharper then expected turnover in China is affecting many other economies. Exporters to China and those have closed trade links, Russia, Brazil, for example, would probably be the most impacted, adding to the downward pressure on oil and commodity prices.
In Asia, India is less dependent on global demand and should continue to grow. But in Australia, consumer and business sentiment has weakened again as their economic growth has slowed for what is now the fifth consecutive quarter. Growth in Europe, on the other hand, is improving, but not as fast as we have previously expected and the employment rate continue the gradual decline. The U.K. remains steady. Economic growth is expected to continue through the rest of this year and into next year. And Germany is also showing some signs of strengthening.
In Latin America, Brazil continues to be in a recession. Economic conditions continue to worsen in Venezuela. The lone bright spot there appears to be Mexico, where the economic recovery continues, led by relatively strong consumer spending and the lowest levels of inflation in almost 50 years.
So when you put all this together, what we're really talking about is some period of economic uncertainty fueled by the slowdown in China, combined with continued lower oil and commodity prices, as well as this continuing uncertainty of our rising interest rates in the U.S. And so overall, we remain cautious about the outlook for the global economy.
With all of this, our continues to grow. Our fundamentals remains strong. We're seeing double-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets as a result of our efforts to drive the shift from cash electronic payments, but also as well as our continued business growth.
So before we go to our business highlight, I want to say a few words about the opening of the Chinese domestic market. Since the final Chinese regulation has not yet been released, we have no new insights to add beyond what we already told you at our recent Investor Day last month. We continue to execute against our plans to be technically ready to process domestic Chinese transactions by the end of 2016, and we're working on expanding issuance and acceptance lead market while we wait for clarity on the regulations. So now into some of our recent business activity. You only heard a great deal from us at Investor Day. You had an opportunity to see first hand the number of products and service innovations we are rolling out. So let me just mention a couple of items very briefly.
First, we continue to grow in the co-brand space. In the United States, we are pleased to be able to confirm our agreement with Jet Flow to launch a new co-brand credit card and convert their existing credit card portfolio. Barclaycard will be the issuing bank.
We also won several other co-brand deals around the world, including CITS, that's the largest travel company in China; Kohl's, the largest supermarket chain in Australia; and of course, one of the co-brand for Airflow. Airflow have a number of co-brand. We've won one of those. They're the largest Russian airline, so probably no. We also sign as triple punch up with the Citi for an affluent co-brand with a large global airline based in the Middle East.
Moving beyond specific customer agreements, I'd like to talk a few minutes to you about some other developments going on in our space, in the payment space in particular. And let's start with EMV in the United States.
As you know, the liability shift went into effect October 1. We're kind of pleased with the progress we are seeing thus far. We now expect 60% of cards and approximately 40% of terminals in the United States to be chip capable by the end of this year. By the way, this is true for us, but it's true for the industry as a whole. We expect almost all cards in the market to be upgraded to chip by the end of 2017, and we've already seen tens of millions of chip transactions. 
By the way, as a little side benefit of EMV is that it will likely give a boost to the adoption of contactless or NFC payments because the latest generation of EMV enabled terminals also contain contactless capabilities. And that kind of leads me to the next topic I'd like to talk about, which to give you a quick update on the progress we have made in the digital space. 
Over the past year or so, you've heard us make several announcements relates to MasterPass. Just to put it together for you, with our live and 24 markets, we have accepted over 250,000 merchants. Unless which recently added Burger King and firearm subs. In addition, we recently announced massive will be fully tokenized using our MDES platform starting with the United States in 2016. And that will give consumers EMV level security and the ability to shop more securely online all in app from any device across all card types.
So let me give you one example of a breakthrough, which can really drive the growth of MasterPass. And despite the challenges going on recently in the Russian market, we are working hard to extend our capabilities there. And as recently, we just had a partnership and us with index money, one of the largest payment service providers in Russia, that sense of the use of MastePass to their 22 million customers. And talking about scale, the State Bank of India, which is the largest bank in that country, has got more than 15,000 plus branches, have also launched their mobile waller solutions with the help of MasterCard. And that solution enables consumers to load money, perform a B2B transfer, pay bills, think the average consumer in India is very keen to get with and the State Bank of India is the right partner for that.
And as you know, we've been putting a lot of emphasis on tokenizing transactions using MDES. And most recently, you heard about Android Pay and Samsung Pay, who we've added in the list of providers leveraging that service. And as said before, we were the first to extend support for private label cards. In fact, Kohl's and J.C. Penney have now gone live with that service. In addition to small business cards, we were also the first network to announce tokenization for all commercial cards. And all that means is that all of our card products in China can soon be tokenized. So it becomes ubiquitous for us.
We also announced the launch of our Digital Enablement Express program, which basically expedites the process of digitizing and tokenizing accounts using MDES. Any financial institution can gain immediate access to all our latest digital payment services. While our partners, that's digital wallet providers, device manufacturers, other digital payment providers, they can add on a simple on boarding process to engage with all these participating banks. Google, Samsung, Capital One, Fifth Third Bank, Key Bank, among the first companies to announce their participation in the express program.
Now the Internet of things, something everybody has been talking about, continuous the conversion for the physical and digital world that began in mobile devices. That new generation of connected devices, smart watches, wearables, this will collect and transmit vast amount of data. And the idea is we are able to use that to provide new insight, new services. To give you an example, data from a smartphone indicating that a consumer at a retail store location could trigger a discount offer for using their credit card. Now that sounds futuristic, but to help fulfill that feature, we actually just launched a new digital enablement program that return any excess to the available in top payment enabled device. That gives consumers the ability to shop using the thing that is most convenient to them with the highest level of security available.
That program will launch with the support of several marquee partners across multiple industries. Total types from a fashion designer, Adam [indiscernible] automakers, Joe motors, saw been in fashion Ben Wiggly, were all in display using our technology at Money 2020 just earlier this week. And we worked with NXP and Qualcomm to develop the technology, and Capital One is actually the first issuer to embrace it. In addition, Capital One has also announced the availability of contactless mobile payment capability to its wallet app. Had actually become so the first issuer in the United States to do so using our cloud-based payments technology.
And these announcements kind of endorse how we turn advance our digital strategy, eliminate the boundaries of our consumer space by delivering a secured digital payment experience to virtually anything. Every device can be a device of commerce. That's the idea. So mobility, cloud-based payments, the Internet of Things and big data are all coming together.
EMV, contactless and our MDES enabled secure transactions across all channels, all devices. And as new players enter the digital payment landscape, we continue to see our technology as of the foundation for new innovative payment services. 
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina to update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,312541513,885198,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning everyone. So let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck, where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and FX adjusted growth rates for this quarter. The differential continues to be primarily driven by the euro-U.S.",1501,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning everyone. So let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck, where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and FX adjusted growth rates for this quarter. The differential continues to be primarily driven by the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate. Now these figures also excludes the impact of a special item of $70 million on a pretax basis -- $79 million of a pretax basis taken in this quarter related to the termination of our U.S. employee pension plan.
I'd like to point out a few items here, and then I'll talk about the major P&L line items in subsequent slides. First, EPS growth was 5% or 11% after adjusting for currency. Continued revenue momentum, good cost control, executing on our attack strategies and repurchasing shares are contributed to that performance. And as expected, acquisitions that we made in 2014 and 2015 drove $0.03 of EPS dilution in the quarter. Second, the tax rate was 28.2% in the quarter, primarily due to our continued focus on better aligning our tax structure with our business footprint. Third, share repurchases contributed $0.02 per share to our third quarter results. As of October 22, we have $1.2 billion remaining on that one current authorization. And lastly, cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion. And we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $5.1 billion.
Well, let me turn to Page 4. And here, you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, was up 13% on a local currency basis, and that's pretty much the same as the last quarter. Overall, our U.S. dollar GDV grew 8%, made up of credit and debit growth of 9% and 7%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV was up 1 ppt versus last quarter, with stronger growth in our consumer credit programs, offset by slightly lower growth in our debit programs, primarily due to lapping some debit wins and a continued 2 ppt headwind from lower gas prices.
Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 16% on a local currency basis. Again, same as the last quarter with mid to high-teens growth in each region. Cross-border volume grew 16% on a local currency basis, slightly lower than the 17% we saw in the second quarter, primarily driven by Europe.
Turning to Page 5. Here, you can see global processed transaction growth slowed slightly to 12% from the 13% we saw in the second quarter, primarily driven by fewer PIN POS transactions in the U.S. We continue to see double-digit growth in all other regions. And globally, the numbers of cards grew 8% with 2.2 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued.
Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 2%, as reported, or 8% FX adjusted, given currency headwinds. Additionally, the impact of local currency exchange rates was slightly higher than we expected at about 3 ppt, primarily driven by the Russian ruble to the euro and the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar exchange rates. After eliminating all impacts of currency, our underlying net revenue growth was 11%. And acquisitions contributed about 1 ppt to that net revenue growth.
Looking strictly at the individual revenue line items on an FX adjusted basis. So domestic assessments grew 9%, while worldwide GDV grew 13%. This 4 ppt GAAP is primarily due to the impact of local currency somewhat offset by pricing. Cross-border volume fees grew 11%. While cross-border volume growth 16%. Of the site ppt crop, the majority is just a higher mix of intra-Europe activity, some local currency impact, as well as lower inbound U.S. cross-border volume.
Transaction processing fees grew 16%, primarily driven by the 12% growth in process transaction and some pricing. Finally, other revenues grew 15%, driven primarily this quarter by our safety and security products and the APT acquisition.
Moving on to Page 7. Here, you can see the total operating expenses after excluding the special item increased 1% in the quarter or 5% on an FX adjusted basis. Of this, M&A activities contributed almost 4 ppt to total FX-adjusted expense growth. And you can see the impact acquisition had to the individual expense categories in the lower box here on the chart. After excluding the special item, the growth in G&A of 3% or 6% on an FX-adjusted basis is mostly due to the impact of acquisitions. And finally, most of the increase in D&A continues to be also related to acquisitions.
Turning to Slide 8. Let's discuss what we have seen in October through the 21st. Our business drivers are similar or just a bit lower compared to the third quarter. So the numbers through October 21 are as follows. Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 12%, which is unchanged from the third quarter. In the U.S, our processed volume grew 7%, that is also unchanged from what we saw in the last quarter. Processed volume outside the U.S. grew 17%. That's about 1 ppt lower than the third quarter with similar growth in Europe and slightly lower growth in the other regions.
Globally, processed transaction growth was 11%, down 1 ppt from what we saw in the third quarter, with double-digit growth in all regions except the U.S, which grew in the low single-digits. This slower U.S. growth was driven by routing decisions of PIN debit transactions. With respect to cross-border. Our volume grew 14% globally, 2 ppt lower than our third quarter growth with slower growth in all regions except the U.S. Our APMEA region saw the largest slowdown driven by the timing of holidays in the Middle East versus last year.
Moving on, our volume and transactions metrics, as we can see, show that our underlying business remains strong. When looking at our full year 2015 outlook, it's mostly unchanged from my comments last month at our Investor Day. I'll just quickly call out a few items that have changed very slightly or need some clarification.
First, similar to what we saw in Q3, we now expect a slightly higher local currency headwinds of about 3 ppt in Q4, which primarily impacts net revenue. And when you combine you this with the impact from FX translation, the total expected impact of currency on our results continues to be a 8 to 10 ppt headwind for fiscal year 2015, depending whether we're talking about revenue or net income.
Turning to rebates and incentives. We continue to expect the full year 2015 growth rate to be similar to the growth rate we saw in Q1. However, the individual quarterly impact has changed slightly due to the timing of some deals shifting from Q3 into Q4. And when looking at expenses, we haven't changed our expectations for total operating expense growth, but we have had several questions on this topic as some of you work on your models. So when I spoke previously about expecting mid single-digit growth for full year 2015 on a ""as supported basis."" So that excludes any of the special items taken this year, but it does not exclude the impact of last year's Q4 severance charge has that was not a special item.
Finally, let me just made a quick comment on our 2016 to 2018 performance objectives that we announced at Investor Day last month. Based on some conversation that we've had, I'd like to clarify a couple of points around our look at our long-term performance objective to help you with your modeling.
So first, our objective to present a compound growth rate over a 3-year period. So as you know, actual performance could be above or below our stated 3-year objective at any given year. Factors that could impact any individual year include things like the economic environment, the impact of local FX that we don't adjust for or market share changes. In fact, we expect that we will likely see 2015 coming lower than the range of our 2013 to '15 objectives based on the first 2 factors I just mentioned even though we expect to meet our 3-year objective.
Second, I said at Investor Day that our 2016 tax rate will be about 29%, higher than our expected 2015 rate since we don't expect the discrete and one-time items that already have or could occur this year will repeat in 2016. Remember that our practice has been to adjust for one-time tax items in the base year from which the 3-year EPS CAGR is calculated. We will be providing you with a pro forma fiscal year 2015 EPS figure on our year-end earnings call based on a normalized 2015 tax rate. And as you begin to model out future year's performance, you need to factor something about this into your thinking until we have the final numbers to provide you at the end of January.

Building acceptance is relatively long marathon. And we've kind of all forget and that because we've built in the physical space for a paired of time with cards, and that cards become more and more ubiquitous. Acceptance tends to a lot faster. But we know where it's like to build acceptance in emerging markets, for example, where the infrastructure may not be as strong or where the number of cards in people's pockets may be lower. So it's old bit of a chicken and egg. Merchants begin to accept electronic payments when there's enough for consumers of that. Consumers also tend to pick up electronic payments when there's enough acceptance for them. And this symbiotic thing takes a little time to pick up a role amount inside. A bit like a snowball rolling downhill. Think of it that way. And it's pretty much of the same way. Paintball given a very good job of building their acceptance. We've only started a little while ago. And I think, as you make progress on building acceptance on this, you'll get chunks of merchants at sometimes. Another times, it's a one-by-one kind of thing. One of the things we have learned is that it's really important to build acceptance for this on the -- in the day-to-day merchant usage category because that will encourage consumers to use their MasterPass wallet or their bank wallet more often. And the moment you do that, the merchant gets reinforced that this is a good thing to connect up with, and that's what we're trying to do. So you'll see us make a lot of effort on this and you'll see the whole industry making efforts over the last year or so. You'll see us all doing this for the next couple of years. And don't judge MasterPass or the digital payment system as a whole by Sprint. Judge our sound. Otherwise, by that logic, none of the current global payment on digital payment systems have reached a scale. Don't do that because I think it's a cumulative effect over a period of time. That's the way I look at it."

I consider them to all be very large and useful merchants. We're doing many relationships. So we're working with all of them. And we'll see, we'll see when they launch something and what the experience is. Finally, in digital payment, mobile based payments, a lot of this is going to about the consumer experience. Because if it's going to be clunky, then what problem are you trying to solve with that technology that the consumer is feeling today with a card. It's not -- you not solving for that convenience and for the ease-of-use. And so it's all about the consumer experience in addition to all the other elements of the ecosystem. So I'm missing. I'm working with them. We meet them. We talked to them. We'll see. The stage wallet fee is very much something that's a principal policy in our company. We believe that if you were take funding sources from different sources and not provide clarity to the merchant, the consumer and the issuing institution at the end of what funding source are used to what purchase, it kind of mixing up a lot of things. You're mixing up a lot of issues in the market place, including how you provide customer service and the value of different payment systems, both for the merchant and the consumer and the issuing banks.

And I don't know all those numbers you just talked about because some of them are unfamiliar to me and probably know somebody else that may have done deals of that type. But I don't know about those. I do know that at the end of the day, interchange, which was, once upon a time, many years ago, just basically announcement that went out with some kind of level built in for category of spend. Over the years, as you've noticed in many parts of the world, interchange discussions aren't that inflexible. And they do have discussions of merchants. It's not just in the United States. It happens outside as well. If you, for example, were have to look on interchange on a high-value payment for electricity bills or for utilities, it's very different from the interchange in a different kind of store. And so, in a way, in fact, the saving of merchant discount rates and interchange were based on these kinds of conversations between merchants and acquirers, and networks and issuing banks, is part of what the industry is dealing with. And I don't know that that's such a bad thing. I think, in fact, if anything, it makes some of the claims of that being only a one side of perspective of just pricing being one way. A little less sound with. A little less probable because of these infections are being discussed among than at some point in time, that it means relatively open negotiation [indiscernible] and some issuers and some networks and so on. I don't know that all of that is a bad thing. And I think the fact that revolver in some card and some card may go to one merchant, which may have a different interchange flow makes you think that the only revenue stream for a card is some interchange. And I think that's inappropriate, too. There are total revenue streams into a card, multiple revenue streams into an issuer, multiple revenue streams that get used to providing a series of consumer benefit across tens of millions of merchants, not one. So I wouldn't try and equate one merchant with one card. That's not how this business is built."

Than alternatively, a legal settlement process that you have recourse to. I think all that needs to be figure out.

Okay. So thank you all for your question. I'm going to leave you with a very short list of a few closing thoughts. And the first is I continue to think that our business are performing well.

We're seeing that in the base of growth in some regions, in some aspects, as the first question I got about cross-border. We are pleased with the progress with all of our EMV in the U.S., continuing to build with our mountain with MasterPass, and MD-80 and tokenization in the additional payments pace, but it's early days.

6477196,312541513,885646,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Barbara.

With the backdrop of this continuing uncertainty of the global economy, we're actually quite pleased with our results this quarter. After adjusting for currency, we reported net revenue growth of 8%, in line with what we thought we would get, and an EPS growth of 11%. And this excludes the impact of a special item, and Martina will touch on that later.
So now let's take a quick look at what's going on in the global economy, and it's been challenged in recent months. And while the U.S. recovery remains among the most solid, job gains have steadily lowered the unemployment rate to just over 5%, but job and wage growth are starting to slow. Consumer confidence is only modestly up. And as you know, we have given yesterday's announcement, uncertainty of our rising interest rates remain.
So when moving beyond the U.S., the economic picture is well mixed. Global growth is clearly slowing, particularly in smaller emerging markets, and a sharper-than-expected slowdown in China is affecting many other economies. Exporters to China and those with closed trade links, Russia, Brazil, for example, would probably be the most impacted, adding to the downward pressure on oil and commodity prices.
In Asia, India is less dependent on global demand and should continue to grow. But in Australia, consumer and business sentiment has weakened again as their economic growth has slowed for what is now the fifth consecutive quarter. Growth in Europe, on the other hand, is improving but not as fast as previously expected, and the employment rate continues the gradual decline. The U.K. remains steady. Economic growth is expected to continue through the rest of this year and into next year. And Germany is also showing some signs of strengthening. In Latin America, Brazil continues to be in a recession. Economic conditions continue to worsen in Venezuela. The lone bright spot there appears to be Mexico, where the economic recovery continues, led by relatively strong consumer spending and the lowest levels of inflation in almost 50 years.
So when you put all this together, what we're really talking about is some period of economic uncertainty fueled by the slowdown in China, combined with continued lower oil and commodity prices as well as this continuing uncertainty of our rising interest rates in the U.S. And so overall, we remain cautious about the outlook for the global economy.
Having said all of this, our business continues to grow. Our fundamentals remains strong. We are seeing double-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets as a result of our efforts to drive the shift from cash to electronic payments, but also as well as our continued business growth.
So before we go to our business highlights, I want to say a few words about the opening of the Chinese domestic market. Since the final Chinese regulation has not yet been released, we have no new insights to add beyond what we all told you at our recent Investor Day last month. We continue to execute against our plans to be technically ready to process domestic Chinese transactions by the end of 2016, and we're working on expanding issuance and acceptance in that market while we wait for clarity on the regulations.
So now into some of our recent business activity. You've already heard a great deal from us at Investor Day. You had an opportunity to see first hand a number of the product and service innovations we are rolling out. So let me just mention a couple of items very briefly.
First, we continue to grow in the co-brand space. In the United States, we are pleased to be able to confirm our agreement with JetBlue to launch a new co-brand credit card and convert their existing credit card portfolio. Barclaycard will be the issuing bank.
We also won several other co-brand deals around the world, including CITS. That's the largest travel company in China; Kohl's, the largest supermarket chain in Australia; and of course, one of the co-brand for Aeroflot. Aeroflot has a number of co-brands. We've won one of those. They're the largest Russian airline as you probably know. We've also sign as triple punch up with the Citi for an affluent co-brand with a large global airline based in the Middle East.
Moving beyond specific customer agreements, I'd like to talk a few minutes to you about some other developments going on in our space, in the payment space in particular. And let's start with EMV in the United States. As you know, the liability shift went into effect October 1. We're kind of pleased with the progress we are seeing thus far. We now expect 60% of cards and approximately 40% of terminals in the United States to be chip-capable by the end of this year. By the way, this is true for us, but it's true for the industry as a whole. We expect almost all cards in the market to be upgraded to chip by the end of 2017, and we've already seen tens of millions of chip transactions. 
By the way, and as a little side benefit of EMV, is that it will likely give a boost to the adoption of contactless or NFC payments because the latest generation of EMV-enabled terminals also contain contactless capabilities. And that kind of leads me to the next topic I'd like to talk about, which to give you a quick update on the progress we have made in the digital space. 
Now over the past year or so, you've heard us make several announcements related to MasterPass. Just to put it together for you, with our live and 24 markets, we have accepted over 250,000 merchants. Of this, we've recently added Burger King and Firehouse Subs. In addition, we recently announced MasterPass will be fully tokenized, using our MDES platform, that's M-D-E-S, starting with the United States in 2016. And that will give consumers EMV level security and the ability to shop more securely online or in app from any device across all card types.
So let me give you one example of a breakthrough, which can really drive the growth of MasterPass. And despite the challenges going on recently in the Russian market, we're working hard to extend our capabilities there. And of recently, we just had a partnership announced with Yandex.Money, one of the largest payment service providers in Russia. That extends the use of MasterPass to their 22 million customers. And talking about scale, the State Bank of India, which is the largest bank in that country, it's got more than 15,000 plus branches, have also launched their mobile wallet solutions with the help of MasterCard. And that solution enables consumers to load money, perform a B2B transfer, pay bills. I think that the average consumer in India is really keen to get with, and the State Bank of India is the right partner for that.
Now as you know, we've been putting a lot of emphasis on tokenizing transactions using MDES. And most recently, you heard about Android Pay and Samsung Pay, who've been added to the list of providers leveraging that service. And as we've said before, we were the first network to extend support for private label cards. In fact, Kohl's and J.C. Penney have now gone live with that service. In addition to small business cards, we were also the first network to announce tokenization for all commercial cards. And all that means is that all of our card products and channels can soon be tokenized so it becomes ubiquitous for us.
We also announced the launch of our Digital Enablement Express program, which basically expedites the process of digitizing and tokenizing accounts using MDES. Any financial institution can gain immediate access to all our latest digital payment services. While our partners, that's digital wallet providers, device manufacturers, other digital payment providers, they can all have a simple onboarding process to engage with all these participating banks. Google, Samsung, Capital One, Fifth Third Bank, KeyBank are among the first companies to announce their participation in the Express program.
Now the Internet of things, something everybody's been talking about, continuous the convergence for the physical and digital world that began in mobile devices. That new generation of connected devices, smart watches, wearables, this will collect and transmit vast amounts of data, and the idea is to be able to use that to provide new insights, new services. To give you an example, data from a smartphone indicating that a consumer is in a retail store location could trigger a discount offer for using their credit card. Now that would sound futuristic, but to help fulfill that vision, we've actually just launched a new Digital Enablement program that will turn any necessity available into a payment-enabled device. And that gives consumers the ability to shop using the thing that is most convenient to them with the highest level of security available.
That program will launch with the support of several marquee partners across multiple industries. Prototypes types from a fashion designer, Adam Selman; automaker, General Motors; smart plan developer, Nymi; and fashion brand Ringly were all in display using our technology at Money20/20 just earlier this week. And we worked with NXP and Qualcomm to develop the technology, and Capital One is actually the first issuer to embrace it. In addition, Capital One has also announced the availability of contactless mobile payment capability to its wallet app, and actually becomes the first issuer in the United States to do so using our cloud-based payments technology.
And these announcements kind of endorse how we try to advance our digital strategy, eliminate the boundaries that our consumers pay by delivering a secured digital payment experience to virtually anything. Every device can be a device of commerce. That's the idea. So mobility, cloud-based payments, the Internet of Things and big data are all coming together. EMV, contactless and our MDES-enabled secure transactions across all channels, all devices.

The differential continues to be primarily driven by the euro-U.S.",1502,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning everyone.
So let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck, where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and FX-adjusted growth rates for this quarter. The differential continues to be primarily driven by the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate. Now these figures also exclude the impact of a special item of $70 million on a pretax basis -- $79 million on a pretax basis taken in this quarter related to the termination of our U.S. employee pension plan.
I'd like to point out a few items here, and then I'll talk about the major P&L line items in subsequent slides. First, EPS growth was 5% or 11% after adjusting for currency. Continued revenue momentum, good cost control, executing on our attack strategies and repurchasing shares all contributed to that performance. And as expected, acquisitions that we made in 2014 and 2015 drove $0.03 of EPS dilution in the quarter.
Second, the tax rate was 28.2% in the quarter, primarily due to our continued focus on better aligning our tax structure with our business footprint.
Third, share repurchases contributed $0.02 per share to our third quarter results. As of October 22, we have $1.2 billion remaining, and that while current authorization.
And lastly, cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion. And we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $5.1 billion.
Well, let me turn to Page 4. And here, you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, was up 13% on a local currency basis, and that's pretty much the same as the last quarter. Overall, our U.S. dollar GDV grew 8%, made up of credit and debit growth of 9% and 7%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV was up 1 ppt versus last quarter, with stronger growth in our consumer credit programs, offset by slightly lower growth in our debit programs, primarily due to lapping some debit wins and a continued 2 ppt headwind from lower gas prices.
Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 16% on a local currency basis. It's, again, same as the last quarter with mid- to high-teens growth in each region. Cross-border volume grew 16% on a local currency basis, slightly lower than the 17% we saw in the second quarter, primarily driven by Europe.
Turning to Page 5. Here, you can see global processed transaction growth slowed slightly to 12% from the 13% we saw in the second quarter, primarily driven by fewer PIN POS transactions in the U.S. We continued to see double-digit growth in all other regions. And globally, the numbers of cards grew 8% with 2.2 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued.
Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 2% as reported, or 8% FX adjusted, given currency headwinds. Additionally, the impact of local currency exchange rates was slightly higher than we expected at about 3 ppt, primarily driven by the Russian ruble to the euro and the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar exchange rates. After eliminating all impacts of currency, our underlying net revenue growth was 11%, and acquisitions contributed about 1 ppt to that net revenue growth.
Looking specifically at the individual revenue line items on an FX-adjusted basis. So domestic assessments grew 9%, while worldwide GDV grew 13%. This 4 ppt GAAP is primarily due to the impact of local currency somewhat offset by pricing. Cross-border volume fees grew 11%, while cross-border volume grew 16%. Of the 5 ppt GAAP, the majority is due to a higher mix of intra-Europe activity, some local currency impact, as, well as lower inbound U.S. cross-border volume. Transaction processing fees grew 16%, primarily driven by the 12% growth in process transaction and some pricing. Finally, other revenues grew 15%, driven primarily this quarter by our safety and security products and the APT acquisition.
Moving on to Page 7. Here, you can see the total operating expenses, after excluding the special item, increased 1% in the quarter or 5% on an FX-adjusted basis. Of this, M&A activities contributed almost 4 ppt to total FX-adjusted expense growth. And you can see the impact acquisitions had to the individual expense categories in the lower box there on the chart. After excluding the special item, the growth in G&A of 3% or 6% on an FX-adjusted basis is mostly due to the impact of acquisitions. And finally, most of the increase in D&A continues to be also related to acquisitions.
Turning to Slide 8. Let's discuss what we have seen in October through the 21st. Our business drivers are similar or just a bit lower compared to the third quarter. So the numbers through October 21 are as follows. Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 12%, which is unchanged from the third quarter. In the U.S, our processed volume grew 7%. That is also unchanged from what we saw in the last quarter. Processed volume outside the U.S. grew 17%. That's about 1 ppt lower than the third quarter, with similar growth in Europe and slightly lower growth in the other regions.
Globally, processed transaction growth was 11%, down 1 ppt from what we saw in the third quarter with double-digit growth in all regions except the U.S, which grew in the low single-digits. The slower U.S. growth was driven by routing decisions of PIN debit transactions. With respect to cross-border, our volume grew 14% globally, 2 ppt lower than our third quarter growth with slower growth in all regions except the U.S. Our APMEA region saw the largest slowdown, driven by the timing of holidays in the Middle East versus last year.
Moving on, our volume and transactions metrics, as we can see, show that our underlying business remains strong. When looking at our full year 2015 outlook, it's mostly unchanged from my comments last month at our Investor Day. I'll just quickly call out a few items that have changed very slightly or need some clarification.
First, similar to what we saw in Q3, we now expect a slightly higher local currency headwind of about 3 ppt in Q4, which primarily impacts net revenue. And when you combine you this with the impact from FX translation, the total expected impact of currency on our results continues to be a 8 to 10 ppt headwind for fiscal year 2015, depending whether we're talking about revenue or net income.
Turning to rebates and incentives. We continue to expect the full year 2015 growth rate to be similar to the growth rate we saw in Q1. However, the individual quarterly impact has changed slightly due to the timing of some deals shifting from Q3 into Q4. And when looking at expenses, we haven't changed our expectations for total operating expense growth, but we have had several questions on this topic as some of you work on your models. So when I spoke previously about expecting mid-single-digit growth for full year 2015 on a ""as reported basis."" So that excludes any of the special items taken this year, but it does not exclude the impact of last year's Q4 severance charge has as that was not a special item.
Finally, let me just make a quick comment on our 2016 to 2018 performance objectives that we announced at Investor Day last month. Based on some conversation that we've had, I'd like to clarify a couple of points around how we look at our long-term performance objective to help you with your modeling.
So first, our objective to present a compound growth rate over a 3-year period. So as you know, actual performance could be above or below our stated 3-year objective at any given year. Factors that could impact any individual year include things like the economic environment, the impact of local FX that we don't adjust for or market share changes. In fact, we expect that we will likely see 2015 coming lower than the range of our 2013 to '15 objectives based on the first 2 factors I just mentioned, even though we expect to meet our 3-year objectives.
Second, I said at Investor Day that our 2016 tax rate would be about 29%, higher than our expected 2015 rate since we don't expect the discrete and onetime items that already have or could occur this year will repeat in 2016. Remember that our practice has been to adjust for onetime tax items in the base year from which the 3-year EPS CAGR is calculated. We will be providing you with a pro forma fiscal year 2015 EPS figure on our year-end earnings call based on a normalized 2015 tax rate. And as you begin to model out future year's performance, you need to factor something about this into your thinking until we have the final numbers to provide you at the end of January.

That Payment Security Task Force had some assumptions on health cards would get replaced and how terminals would get upgraded. And while the end of 2017 is that all the cards are going to end up replaced. It's actually not a linear line until that. It's pretty high already at 60-odd percent by the end of this year. And I think by the end of next year, mostly done with a few left in 2017. It's a similar trend for terminals. But remember, smaller merchants will take longer because they've got to work through the ISO network. And there's a whole game out there to be played.

And we've kind of all forgotten that because we've built it in the physical space for a period of time with cards. And as cards became more and more ubiquitous, acceptance tends to adopt faster. But we know what it's like to build acceptance in emerging markets, for example, where the infrastructure may not be as strong or where the number of cards in people's pockets may be lower. It's a little bit of a chicken and egg. Merchants begin to accept electronic payments when there's enough pull from consumers for that. Consumers also tend to pick up electronic payments when there's enough acceptance for them. And this symbiotic thing takes a little time to pick up a role in amount and size. A bit like a snowball rolling downhill. Think of it that way. And it's pretty much the same way. PayPal's been around for a long time. They've done a very good job of building their acceptance. They've only started a little while ago. And I think as you make progress on building acceptance on this, you get chunks of merchants at some times. And other times, it's a one-by-one kind of thing. One of the things we have learned is that it's really important to build acceptance for this on the -- in the day-to-day merchant usage category because that will encourage consumers to use their MasterPass wallet or their bank wallet more often. And the moment you do that, the merchant gets reinforced that this is a good thing to connect up with, and that's what we're trying to do. So you'll see us make a lot of effort on this as you'll see the whole industry making efforts over the last year or so. You'll see us all doing this for the next couple of years. And don't judge MasterPass or the digital payment system as a whole by a sprint, judge it as a marathon. Otherwise, by that logic, none of the current mobile payment or digital payment systems have reached any scale. Don't do that because I think it's a cumulative effect over a period of time. That's the way I'd look at it."

We'll see when they launch something, which and what the consumer experience is. Finally, in digital payments are mobile-based payments. A lot of this is going to about the consumer experience. Because if it's going to be clunky, then what problem are you trying to solve with that technology that the consumer's feeling today with a card. It's not -- you're not solving for their convenience and for the ease-of-use. And so it's all about the consumer experience in addition to all the other elements of the ecosystem. So I'm waiting. I'm working with them. We meet them. We talked to them. We'll see. The staged wallet fee is very much something that's a principal policy in our company. We believe that if you were to take funding sources from different sources and not provide clarity to the merchant, the consumer and the issuing institution at the end of what funding source were used to what purchase, you're kind of mixing up a lot of things. You're mixing up a lot of the issues in the marketplace, including how you provide customer service and the value of different payment systems, both for the merchant and the consumer and the issuing banks. So we've got to get a policy around that, and we're sticking to that policy."

So for instance, the product that we call SafetyNet, and some of you saw that of course at our Investor Day, right? On SafetyNet, we basically have, in the network, algorithms that allow us to detect if particular cards or portfolios have been penetrated in such a way that there are red flags coming out, and we have to make sure that the financial institutions or the related party actually knows how to deal with that. And we do that within nanoseconds. Those kind of products, which have been rolled out worldwide. SafetyNet has been now rolled out worldwide, we can absolutely charge. For.

But also, self e-pay and biometrics and heart beat monitors with Nymi, and we've launched that with TD Bank in Canada. This is the whole series of things in this space. I don't think tokenization itself should be counted as a revenue stream per se. Tokenization is probably like table stakes. We don't charge for EMV. A chip manufacturer may be charging some money to provide the chip. We don't charge for them extra. That's table stakes and digital. So that's not what I'm trying to do with tokenization. Trying to make it safer, more secure, EMV-type security in digital for the future of payments that are going to go digital. But there's a lot of other places in safety and security where you can make good money and good revenue for providing a service that people can opt into and use. That's what we're trying to do."

I think we've answered them a few times, Darrin, but I'll go over a couple of thoughts for you. And the first one is that whatever price and whenever the deals happens, there is going to be some period of time during which the integration of these businesses, from a technology, culture, operation point of view, will take some energy, effort and dedication. And we've seen that in our prior transactions in MasterCard, even before I joined, not just with the IPO, but even before the IPO with the purchase of Europay. And there is a fair amount of work and challenge that needs to go into it. That'll happen. When that's done, over a period of some years, there's no doubt that one of the things that we do use today to go talk to global banks or global merchants, some recognize there aren't too many global banks left but there are global merchants. The ability to offer a unified proposition, that's one which was unique to us in some ways, will no longer be unique to us. And that will change the competitive landscape in some ways when this integration is completely done. In the meanwhile, there'll be lots of moving around and lots of opportunities.

And I don't know all those numbers you just talked about because some of them are unfamiliar to me and probably known somebody else that may have done deals of that type. But I don't know about those. I do know that at the end of the day, interchange, which was, once upon a time, many years ago, just basically a announcement that went out with some kind of levels built in for category of spend. Over the years, as you've noticed in many parts of the world, interchange discussions aren't that inflexible. And they do have discussions of merchants. It's not just in the United States. It happens outside as well. If you, for example, were have to look on interchange on a high-value payment for electricity bills or for utilities. It's very different from the interchange in a different kind of store. And so in a way, in fact, the saving of merchant discount rates and interchange that are based on these kinds of conversations between merchants and acquirers and networks and issuing banks. It is part of what the industry is dealing with. And I don't know that, that's such a bad thing. I think, in fact, if anything, it makes some of the claims of there being only a one-sided perspective of just pricing being one way. A bit little less tenuous, a little less probable because if these infections are being discussed, then at that point of time, that means is it relatively open negotiation between some categories of merchants and some acquirers and some issuers and some networks and so on. I don't know that all of that is a bad thing. And I think the fact that revolver and some cards, and some card may go to one merchant, which may have a different interchange flow, makes you think that the only revenue stream for a card is some interchange. And I think that's inappropriate too. There are total revenue streams into a card, multiple revenue streams into an issuer, multiple revenue streams can get used to providing a series of consumer benefits across tens of millions of merchants, not one. So I wouldn't try and equate one merchant with one card. That's kind of not how this business is built."

And you can see the result in their growth rates of card ownership and spend rates. Others had to hold back for a while and allow back in the market. I cannot see things happening. I don't think that card acquisition growth rates are being held back only by rates differential. It's also by their comfort around credit quality. And in fact, that's where it starts from.

That's what APT is into. You tend to start at the part of the decline. If it works well, you'll get a bigger piece of business from them or it'll move into a different space. And that's pretty much what's going on. We are actually very excited about APT. It's got a huge potential for us and merchants. Remember, the best part about APT is that the data doesn't have to leave the merchant shop. It stays in the merchant shop. It's built into the terminals of the merchant shop. It's different tools that the APT team develops with their intellectual property on the test and learn capabilities. So it makes merchant far more comfortable. An anonymized data can be used to make that tool even more predictable, but that data doesn't leave their shops. So it's actually a pretty interesting opportunity. 5one. 5one was a much smaller business when we bought it. But it's completely integrated into what we are doing and giving us a great deal of merchant traction across the world. They were very focused in a few markets.

And that's where we're headed. I'd say, watch this space. It's early days. We're beginning to see good relationships and frequent repurchasing from the merchants of things we're doing with them.

I've said this publicly quite a few times now in different panels and statements that I make. I think the real issue here will be will legal dispute settlement systems accept a distributed ledger as a way of resolving a conflict, if and when it were to arise between a payer and a receiver. Finally, the whole payment system works on 2 or 3 things: trust that the money will get in there; two, that it will be accurate; three, that if it's not accurate, there's a methodology to get your money back. I think that's going to have to be multi-methodology of reaching people, which in this case, if there's a distributed chain and you don't know who the hell they are, that's a little complicated. And then alternatively, a legal settlement process that you have recourse to. I think all that needs to be figured out. In addition to the basics, which is will all this be accepted for in the case of remittances and other things? Will it be accepted for the right kind of level playing field by the regulators on KYC and anti-money laundering and those kinds of things. I believe that over a period of time, either the Blockchain, the way it is today, or some derivative of it, as we all experiment and evolve with it an engage in dialogue with it, I'm sure we'll have a road to play, whether it's in remittance and payments or it's in different kinds of record-keeping or it's in asset transfer or it's a mix of all those, I don't yet know.

We've got experimentations and lab designs in this space. We've got investments with richer, capital firms in this space.

6477196,312541513,885932,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody.With the backdrop of this continuing uncertainty in the global economy, we're actually quite pleased with our results this quarter.

With the backdrop of this continuing uncertainty in the global economy, we're actually quite pleased with our results this quarter. After adjusting for currency, we reported net revenue growth of 8%, in line with what we thought we would get, and an EPS growth of 11%. And this excludes the impact of a special item, and Martina will touch on that later.
So now let's take a quick look at what's going on in the global economy. It's been challenged in recent months. And while the U.S. recovery remains among the most solid, job gains have steadily lowered the unemployment rate to just over 5%, but job and wage growth are starting to slow. Consumer confidence is only moderately up. And as you know, we have given yesterday's announcement, uncertainty about rising interest rates remain.
So moving beyond the U.S., the economic picture is well mixed. Global growth is clearly slowing, particularly in smaller emerging markets, and a sharper-than-expected slowdown in China is affecting many other economies. Exporters to China and those with closed trade links, Russia, Brazil, for example, would probably be the most impacted, adding to the downward pressure on oil and commodity prices.
In Asia, India is less dependent on global demand and should continue to grow. But in Australia, consumer and business sentiment has weakened again as their economic growth has slowed for what is now the fifth consecutive quarter. Growth in Europe, on the other hand, is improving but not as fast as previously expected, and the employment rate continues a gradual decline. The U.K. remains steady. Economic growth is expected to continue through the rest of this year and into next year. And Germany is also showing some signs of strengthening. In Latin America, Brazil continues to be in a recession. Economic conditions continue to worsen in Venezuela. The lone bright spot there appears to be Mexico, where the economic recovery continues, led by relatively strong consumer spending and the lowest levels of inflation in almost 50 years.
So when you put all this together, what we're really talking about is some period of economic uncertainty fueled by the slowdown in China, combined with continued lower oil and commodity prices, as well as this continuing uncertainty about rising interest rates in the U.S. And so overall, we remain cautious about the outlook for the global economy.
Having said all of this, our business continues to grow. Our fundamentals remain strong. We are seeing double-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets as a result of our efforts to drive the shift from cash to electronic payments, but also as well as our continued business growth.
So before we go to our business highlights, I want to say a few words about the opening of the Chinese domestic market. Since the final Chinese regulations have not yet been released, we have no new insights to add beyond what we all told you at our recent Investor Day last month. We continue to execute against our plans to be technically ready to process domestic Chinese transactions by the end of 2016, and we're working on expanding issuance and acceptance in that market while we wait for clarity on the regulations.
So now to some of our recent business activity. You've already heard a great deal from us at Investor Day. You had an opportunity to see first-hand a number of the product and service innovations we are rolling out. So let me just mention a couple of items very briefly.
First, we continue to grow in the co-brand space. In the United States, we are pleased to be able to confirm our agreement with JetBlue to launch a new co-brand credit card and convert their existing credit card portfolio. Barclaycard will be the issuing bank.
We also won several other co-brand deals around the world, including CITS. That's the largest travel company in China. Coles, the largest supermarket chain in Australia; and of course one of the co-brand for Aeroflot. Aeroflot has a number of co-brands. We've won one of those. They're the largest Russian airline, as you probably know. We've also signed a strategic partnership with Citi for an affluent co-brand with a large global airline based in the Middle East.
Moving beyond specific customer agreements, I'd like to talk a few minutes to you about some other developments going on in our space, in the payment space in particular. And let's start with EMV in the United States. As you know, the liability shift went into effect October 1. We're kind of pleased with the progress we are seeing thus far. We now expect 60% of cards and approximately 40% of terminals in the United States to be chip-capable by the end of this year. By the way, this is true for us, but it's true for the industry as a whole. We expect almost all cards in the market to be upgraded to chip by the end of 2017, and we've already seen tens of millions of chip transactions. 
By the way, and as a little side benefit of EMV, is that it will likely give a boost to the adoption of contactless or NFC payments because the latest generation of EMV-enabled terminals also contain contactless capabilities. And that kind of leads me to the next topic I'd like to talk about, which is to give you a quick update on the progress we have made in the digital space. 
Now over the past year or so, you've heard us make several announcements related to MasterPass. Just to put it together for you, we're now live in 24 markets, we have accepted over 250,000 merchants, a list which recently added Burger King and Firehouse Subs. In addition, we recently announced MasterPass will be fully tokenized using our MDES platform, that's M-D-E-S, starting with the United States in 2016. And that will give consumers EMV level security and the ability to shop more securely online or in app from any device across all card types.
So let me give you one example of a breakthrough which can really drive the growth of MasterPass. And despite the challenges going on recently in the Russian market, we're working hard to extend our capabilities there. And recently we just had a partnership announced with Yandex.Money, one of the largest payment service providers in Russia, that extends the use of MasterPass to their 22 million customers. And talking about scale, the State Bank of India, which is the largest bank in that country, it's got more than 15,000 plus branches, have also launched their mobile wallet solution with the help of MasterCard. And that solution enables consumers to load money, perform a P2P transfer, pay bills, things that the average consumer in India is really keen to get with, and the State Bank of India is the right partner for that.
Now as you know, we've been putting a lot of emphasis on tokenizing transactions using MDES. And most recently you've heard about Android Pay and Samsung Pay, who've been added to the list of providers leveraging that service. And as we've said before, we were the first network to extend support for private label cards. In fact, Kohl's and JCPenney have now gone live with that service. In addition to small business cards, we were also the first network to announce tokenization for all commercial cards. And all that means is that all of our card products and channels can soon be tokenized so it becomes ubiquitous for us.
We also announced the launch of our Digital Enablement Express program, which basically expedites the process of digitizing and tokenizing accounts using MDES. Any financial institution can gain immediate access to all our latest digital payment services, while our partners, that's digital wallet providers, device manufacturers, other digital payment providers, they can all have a simple onboarding process to engage with all these participating banks. Google, Samsung, Capital One, Fifth Third Bank, KeyBank are among the first companies to announce their participation in the Express program.
Now the Internet of Things, something everybody's been talking about, continues the convergence of the physical and digital world that began in mobile devices. That new generation of connected devices -- smart watches, wearables -- this will collect and transmit vast amounts of data, and the idea is to be able to use that to provide new insights, new services. To give you an example, data from a smartphone indicating that a consumer is in a retail store location could trigger a discount offer for using their credit card. Now that could sound futuristic, but to help fulfill that vision we've actually just launched a new Digital Enablement program that will turn any accessory or wearable into a payment-enabled device. And that gives consumers the ability to shop using the thing that is most convenient to them with the highest level of security available.
That program will launch with the support of several marquee partners across multiple industries. Prototypes from fashion designer Adam Selman, automaker General Motors, smart plan developer Nymi, and fashion brand Ringly were all on display using our technology at Money20/20 just earlier this week. And we worked with NXP and Qualcomm to develop the technology, and Capital One is actually the first issuer to embrace it. In addition, Capital One has also announced the availability of contactless mobile payment capability to its wallet app, and actually becomes the first issuer in the United States to do so using our cloud-based payments technology.
And these announcements kind of endorse how we try to advance our digital strategy, eliminate the boundaries of how consumers pay by delivering a secure digital payment experience to virtually anything. Every device can be a device of commerce. That's the idea. So mobility, cloud-based payments, the Internet of Things and big data are all coming together. EMV, contactless and our MDES-enabled secure transactions across all channels, all devices. And as new players enter the digital payment landscape, we continue to see our technology as the foundation for new, innovative payment services. 
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina to update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"

So let me begin on Page 3 of our slide deck, where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and FX-adjusted growth rates for this quarter. The differential continues to be primarily driven by the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate. Now these figures also exclude the impact of a special item of $70 million on a pretax basis -- $79 million on a pretax basis taken this quarter related to the termination of our U.S. employee pension plan.
I'd like to point out a few items here, and then I'll talk about the major P&L line items in subsequent slides. First, EPS growth was 5% or 11% after adjusting for currency. Continued revenue momentum, good cost control, executing on our attack strategies and repurchasing shares all contributed to that performance. And as expected, acquisitions that we made in 2014 and 2015 drove $0.03 of EPS dilution in the quarter.
Second, the tax rate was 28.2% in the quarter, primarily due to our continued focus on better aligning our tax structure with our business footprint.
Third, share repurchases contributed $0.02 per share to our third quarter results. As of October 22, we have $1.2 billion remaining on that while current authorization.
And lastly, cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion. And we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $5.1 billion.
So let me turn to Page 4. And here you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, was up 13% on a local currency basis. And that's pretty much the same as the last quarter. Overall, our U.S. dollar GDV grew 8%, made up of credit and debit growth of 9% and 7%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV was up 1 ppt versus last quarter, with stronger growth in our consumer credit programs, offset by slightly lower growth in our debit programs, primarily due to lapping some debit wins and a continued 2 ppt headwind from lower gas prices.
Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 16% on a local currency basis. It's, again, same as the last quarter with mid- to high-teens growth in each region. Cross-border volume grew 16% on a local currency basis, slightly lower than the 17% we saw in the second quarter, primarily driven by Europe.
Turning to Page 5, here you can see global processed transaction growth slowed slightly to 12% from the 13% we saw in the second quarter, primarily driven by fewer PIN POS transactions in the U.S. We continued to see double-digit growth in all other regions. And globally, the numbers of cards grew 8% with 2.2 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued.
Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 2% as reported, or 8% FX adjusted given currency headwinds. Additionally, the impact of local currency exchange rates was slightly higher than we expected at about 3 ppt, primarily driven by the Russian ruble to the euro and the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar exchange rates. After eliminating all impacts of currency, our underlying net revenue growth was 11%, and acquisitions contributed about 1 ppt to that net revenue growth.
Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items on an FX-adjusted basis. So domestic assessments grew 9%, while worldwide GDV grew 13%. This 4 ppt gap is primarily due to the impact of local currency somewhat offset by pricing. Cross-border volume fees grew 11%, while cross-border volume grew 16%. Of the 5 ppt gap, the majority is due to a higher mix of intra-Europe activity, some local currency impact, as well as lower inbound U.S. cross-border volume. Transaction processing fees grew 16%, primarily driven by the 12% growth in process transaction and some pricing. Finally, other revenues grew 15%, driven primarily this quarter by our safety and security products and the APT acquisition.
Moving on to Page 7. Here you can see that total operating expenses, after excluding the special item, increased 1% in the quarter or 5% on an FX-adjusted basis. Of this, M&A activities contributed almost 4 ppt to total FX-adjusted expense growth. And you can see the impact acquisitions had to the individual expense categories in the lower box there on the chart. After excluding the special item, the growth in G&A of 3% or 6% on an FX-adjusted basis is mostly due to the impact of acquisitions. And finally, most of the increase in D&A continues to be also related to acquisitions.
Turning to Slide 8. Let's discuss what we have seen in October through the 21st. Our business drivers are similar or just a bit lower compared to the third quarter. So the numbers through October 21 are as follows. Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 12%, which is unchanged from the third quarter. In the U.S, our processed volume grew 7%. That is also unchanged from what we saw in the last quarter. Processed volume outside the U.S. grew 17%. That's about 1 ppt lower than the third quarter, with similar growth in Europe and slightly lower growth in the other regions.
Globally, processed transaction growth was 11%, down 1 ppt from what we saw in the third quarter with double-digit growth in all regions except the U.S., which grew in the low single-digits. The slower U.S. growth was driven by routing decisions of PIN debit transactions. With respect to cross-border, our volume grew 14% globally, 2 ppt lower than our third quarter growth with slower growth in all regions except the U.S. Our APMEA region saw the largest slowdown, driven by the timing of holidays in the Middle East versus last year.
Moving on, our volume and transactions metrics, as you can see, show that our underlying business remains strong. When looking at our full year 2015 outlook, it's mostly unchanged from my comments last month at our Investor Day. I'll just quickly call out a few items that have changed very slightly or need some clarification.
First, similar to what we saw in Q3, we now expect a slightly higher local currency headwind of about 3 ppt in Q4, which primarily impacts net revenue. And when you combine this with the impact from FX translation, the total expected impact of currency on our results continues to be an 8 to 10 ppt headwind for fiscal year 2015, depending whether we're talking about revenue or net income.
Turning to rebates and incentives. We continue to expect the full year 2015 growth rate to be similar to the growth rate we saw in Q1. However, the individual quarterly impact has changed slightly due to the timing of some deals shifting from Q3 into Q4. And when looking at expenses, we haven't changed our expectations for total operating expense growth, but we have had several questions on this topic as some of you work on your models. So when I spoke previously about expecting mid-single-digit growth for full year 2015 on an ""as reported basis,"" so that excludes any of the special items taken this year, but it does not exclude the impact of last year's Q4 severance charge, as that was not a special item.
Finally, let me just make a quick comment on our 2016 to 2018 performance objectives that we announced at Investor Day last month. Based on some conversation that we've had, I'd like to clarify a couple of points around how we look at our long-term performance objective to help you with your modeling.
So first, our objective to present a compound growth rate over a 3-year period. So as you know, actual performance could be above or below our stated 3-year objective at any given year. Factors that could impact any individual year include things like the economic environment, the impact of local FX that we don't adjust for or market share changes. In fact, we expect that we will likely see 2015 come in lower than the range of our 2013 to '15 objectives based on the first 2 factors I just mentioned, even though we expect to meet our 3-year objectives.
Second, I said at Investor Day that our 2016 tax rate would be about 29%, higher than our expected 2015 rate, since we don't expect the discrete and one-time items that already have or could occur this year will repeat in 2016. Remember that our practice has been to adjust for one-time tax items in the base year from which the 3-year EPS CAGR is calculated. We will be providing you with a pro forma fiscal year 2015 EPS figure on our year-end earnings call based on a normalized 2015 tax rate. And as you begin to model out future years' performance, you need to factor something about this into your thinking until we have the final numbers to provide you at the end of January.

But we've seen tens of millions of EMV transactions already between this last few weeks. So it's picking up. I'm quite hopeful that the way the Payment Security Task Force that was set up between the industry and merchants some time ago, that Payment Security Task Force had some assumptions on how cards would get replaced and how terminals would get upgraded. And while the end of 2017 is when all the cards are going to get replaced, it's actually not a linear line until then. It's pretty high already at 60-odd percent by the end of this year. And I think by the end of next year it's mostly done with a few left in 2017. It's a similar trend for terminals. But remember, smaller merchants will take longer because they've got to work through the ISO network. And there's a whole game out there to be played.

And we've kind of all forgotten that because we've built it in the physical space for a period of time with cards. And as cards became more and more ubiquitous, acceptance tends to go a lot faster. But we know what it's like to build acceptance in emerging markets, for example, where the infrastructure may not be as strong or where the number of cards in people's pockets may be lower. It's a little bit of a chicken and egg. Merchants begin to accept electronic payments when there's enough pull from consumers for that. Consumers also tend to pick up electronic payments when there's enough acceptance for them. And this symbiotic thing takes a little time to pick up a rolling amount and size. A bit like a snowball rolling downhill. Think of it that way. And it's pretty much the same here. PayPal's been around for a long time. They've done a very good job of building their acceptance. We've only started a little while ago. And I think, as you make progress on building acceptance on this, you get chunks of merchants at some times, and other times it's a one-by-one kind of thing. 
One of the things we have learned is that it's really important to build acceptance for this on the -- in the day-to-day merchant usage category because that will encourage consumers to use their MasterPass wallet or their bank wallet more often. And the moment you do that, the merchant gets reinforced that this was a good thing to connect up with. And that's what we're trying to do. So you'll see us make a lot of effort on this as you'll see the whole industry making efforts over the last year or so. You'll see us all doing this for the next couple of years. And don't judge MasterPass or the digital payment system as a whole by a sprint; judge it as a marathon. Otherwise, by that logic, none of the current mobile payment or digital payment systems have reached any scale. Don't do that, because I think it's a cumulative effect over a period of time. That's the way I'd look at it."

I consider them to all be very large and useful merchants with whom we have many relationships. So we're kind of working with all of them. And I -- we'll see. We'll see when they launch something and what the consumer experience is. 
Finally, digital payments or mobile-based payments, a lot of this is going to be about the consumer experience. Because if it's going to be clunky, then what problem are you trying to solve with that technology that the consumer's feeling today with a card? It's not -- you're not solving for their convenience and for the ease-of-use. And so it's all about the consumer experience in addition to all the other elements in the ecosystem. So I'm waiting, I'm working with them, we meet them, we talk to them. We'll see. 
The staged wallet fee is very much something that's a principal policy in our company. We believe that if you were to take funding sources from different sources and not provide clarity to the merchant, the consumer and the issuing institution at the end of what funding source was used for what purchase, you're kind of mixing up a lot of things. You're mixing up a lot of issues in the marketplace, including how you provide customer service and the value of different payment systems, both for the merchant and the consumer and the issuing banks.

We have a ton of unbelievably interesting products that we had built on a very good base over the last couple of years. So I'll give you 1 example. So for instance, the product that we call SafetyNet, and some of you saw that of course at our Investor Day, right? On SafetyNet, we basically have in the network algorithms that allow us to detect if particular cards or portfolios have been penetrated in such a way that there are red flags coming up, and we have to make sure that the financial institutions or the related party actually knows how to deal with that. And we do that within nanoseconds. Those kind of products, which have been rolled out worldwide, SafetyNet has been now rolled out worldwide, we can absolutely charge for.

And we're actually building a strategic thought process in it over the last couple of years, not just selling product, and just seeing the result of some of that beginning to show up in our revenue lines. I'm quite hopeful that safety and security will be a good way for us to grow. We are a natural provider of some of these thinkings for those people in the ecosystem. And it's necessarily a part of what we do for a consumer. We've got ID theft solutions, to we've got authorization HighQ Solutions for merchants, to issuing solutions, to using data, to all that. We've got new technology stuff coming in, where the tokenization comes, but also self e-pay and biometrics and heartbeat monitors with Nymi, and we've launched that with TD Bank in Canada. There's just a whole series of things in this space. 
I don't think tokenization itself should be counted as a revenue stream per se. Tokenization is probably like table stakes. We don't charge for EMV. A chip manufacturer may be charging some money to provide the chip. We don't charge for them extra. That's table stakes and digital. So that's not what I'm trying to do with tokenization. Trying to make it safer, more secure, EMV-type security in digital for the future of payments that are going to go digital. But there's a lot of other places in safety and security where you can make good money and good revenue for providing a service that people can opt into and use. That's what we're trying to do."

I think we've answered them a few times, Darrin, but I'll go over a couple of thoughts for you. And the first one is that whatever price and whenever the deals happens, there is going to be some period of time during which the integration of these businesses from a technology, culture, operation point of view, will take some energy, effort and dedication. And we've seen that in our prior transactions in MasterCard, even before I joined, not just with the IPO, but even before the IPO with the purchase of EuroPay. And there is a fair amount of work and challenge that needs to go into it. That'll happen. When that's done, over a period of some years, there's no doubt that one of the things that we do use today to go talk to global banks or global merchants, and recognize there aren't too many global banks left, but there are global merchants, the ability to offer a unified proposition. That one, which was unique to us in some ways, will no longer be unique to us. And that will change the competitive landscape in some ways when this integration is completely done. 
In the meanwhile, there'll be lots of moving around and lots of opportunities. And you yourself raised some of those around -- maybe it's pricing, maybe it's deal terms, and all those could be interesting ideas for us to explore. We're going to try.

I do know that, at the end of the day interchange, which was, once upon a time many years ago, just basically an announcement that went out with some kind of levels built in for category of spend, over the years, as you've noticed in many parts of the world, interchange discussions aren't that inflexible. And they do have discussions of merchants. It's not just in the United States. It happens outside as well. If you, for example, were to look at the interchange on a high-value payment for electricity bills or for utilities, it's very different from the interchange in a different kind of store. And so in a way, in fact, the setting of merchant discount rates in interchange based on these kinds of conversations between merchants and acquirers and networks and issuing banks is part of what the industry is dealing with. 
And I don't know that, that's such a bad thing. I think, in fact, if anything, it makes some of the claims of there being only a one-sided perspective of just pricing being one way a bit less tenuous, a little less provable, because if these transactions are being discussed, then at that point of time that means it is a relatively open negotiation between some categories of merchants and some acquirers and some issuers and some networks and so on. 
I don't know that all that is a bad thing. And I think the fact that rewards are on some cards and some card may go to one merchant which may have a different interchange flow makes you think that the only revenue stream for a card is from interchange. And I think that's inappropriate, too. There are multiple revenue streams into a card, multiple revenue streams into an issuer, multiple revenue streams that get used for providing a series of consumer benefits across tens of millions of merchants, not one. So I wouldn't try and equate one merchant with one card. That's kind of not how this business is built."

And I'm sure over time you -- when the digital space becomes larger similar logical will prevail. I don't know exactly how it will prevail. I don't know what the nature of it will be so I'm not going to speculate. But one step at a time. This itself, to me, the liability is shifting. Remember when we first announced it a couple of years ago, we were pretty much out there on our own for a while because it's new and it needs to settle in.

Some banks, even during the crisis, were able to sustain their ability to keep acquiring, you know, that they've come out of this with the right vintages. And you can see the result in their growth rates of card ownership and spend rates. Others had to hold back for a while and allow back in the market. I cannot see things happening -- I don't think that card acquisition growth rates are being held back only by a rate differential. It's also by their comfort around credit quality. And in fact, that's where it starts from. And you can see that as credit quality for the banks was improved, delinquencies have come down, write-offs have come down. Their whole approach to being thoughtful about how to acquire consumers is very much back in the space."

So it's very new news. But we're making good traction with APT. We've actually got a number of deals that are in different stages of either being -- having been signed and getting implemented as pilots because that's typically how this -- it's a test and learn thing. That's what APT is into. You tend to start as a pilot of the client. If it works well you'll get a bigger piece of business from them or it'll move into a different space. And that's pretty much what's going on. We are actually very excited about APT. It's got a huge potential for us and merchants. Remember, the best part about APT is that the data doesn't have to leave the merchant shop. It stays in the merchant shop, or it's built into the terminals of the merchant shop, is different tools that the APT team developed with their intellectual property on the test and learn capabilities. So it makes merchants far more comfortable. Hard anonymized data can be used to make that tool even more predictable. But that data doesn't leave their shops. So it's actually a pretty interesting opportunity. 
5one. 5one was a much smaller business when we bought it, but it's completely integrated into what we are doing and giving us a great deal of merchant traction across the world. They were very focused in a few markets. It's moving to other places. And you saw us, when Kevin Stanton was standing up at the Investor Day recently, he talked about examples of what we were doing with merchants. And that's where we're headed. I'd say watch the space. It's early days. We're beginning to see good relationships and frequent repurchasing from the merchants of things we're doing with them. It'll take us 3, 4, 5 years to make this what we want it to be, but we're very focused on it."

I've said this publicly quite a few times now on different panels and statements that I make. I think the real issue here will be, will legal dispute settlement systems accept a distributed ledger as a way of resolving a conflict, if and when it were to arise, between a payer and a receiver. Finally, the whole payment system works on 2 or 3 things: trust that the money will get there; two, that it will be accurate; three, that if it's not accurate there's a methodology to get your money back. 
I think that's going to have to be both a methodology of reaching people, which in this case, if there's a distributed chain and you don't know who the hell they are, that's a little complicated; and then alternatively a legal settlement process that you have recourse to. I think all that needs to be figured out in addition to the basics, which is will all this be accepted for, in the case of remittances and other things, will it be accepted for the right kind of level playing field by the regulators on KYC and anti-money laundering and those kinds of things. 
I believe that over a period of time either the blockchain, the way it is today or some derivative of it, as we all experiment and evolve with it and engage in a dialogue with it, I'm sure it will have a role to play. Whether it's in remittance and payments or it's in different kinds of record-keeping or it's in asset transfer or it's a mix of all those I don't yet know. But I think not engaging with it would be a serious error. And a lot of people in our MasterCard Labs -- Garry Lyons, actually, if you ever run into him, that would be a good guy to talk to about this. He knows more about this than I'll ever learn. And he will tell you that we've been experimenting in this space for a while. We've got patents in this space. We've got experimentations and lab designs in this space. We've got investments with venture capital firms in this space. We've got investments directly in companies in that space to learn and I guess make our mistakes along the way. But that's what we're doing."
