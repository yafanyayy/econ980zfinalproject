Sorry, we had to move the call at the last minute but as you can imagine, things  were a little chaotic yesterday morning in Boston. I think we've optimally positioned between the Blizzard and the discussions that were starting today so you guys have something to fill your -- the void. 
But 2014 I think was a very successful year for Biogen Idec. We brought several new therapies of the market. We had encouraging data from some of the compounds in our pipeline. And importantly, we delivered 40% revenue growth and 54% non-GAAP EPS growth compared to 2013. 
In 2014, we launched 4 new products in 2 distinct therapeutic areas. I think it's a real accomplishment for our company of our size. TECFIDERA is in its second year on the market in the U.S. and 2014. We successfully launched TECFIDERA in the EU and are continuing to expand the presence across the globe. TECFIDERA is now the most prescribed MS therapy in Germany and the most prescribed oral therapy in the U.S. More than 135,000 people have been treated worldwide. As you all know from the IMF data, TECFIDERA did experience moderating growth in Q4, which we believe is due to to a variety of factors that Tony will discuss in more detail. However, we believe that TECFIDERA will continue to grow in the U.S. and will grow substantially in international markets so that we anticipate 2015 will be another year of meaningful growth for TECFIDERA and for our portfolio of MS products in general. PLEGRIDY was approved treatment of relapsing MS and launched in both the U.S. and EU in the second half of 2014. Although we're early in the launch, PLEGRIDY appears to be gaining rapid adoption. PLEGRIDY is an important part of our strategy to maintain our leadership position in the interferon segment of the MS market. We also obtained approval and subsequently launched our hemophilia products in the U.S. in 2014, ALPROLIX for hemophilia B and ELOCTATE for hemophilia A. ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE represent the first meaningful innovations in the treatment of hemophilia in many years and reflect our mission to help bring new therapies to patients who are underserved. 
In our pipeline, we had several potential therapeutic options across a broad set of disease areas. Along with our collaboration partner, Abby, we reported positive results from the Phase III trial of ZINBRYTA for relapsing forms of MS and expect to file marketing authorization in the first half of the year. 
We believe ZINBRYTA has the potential to become another important treatment option to serve the diverse needs of MS patients. Our collaboration partner, Isis, advanced its final muscular atrophy program, SMNRx, to Phase III in both infant and childhood forms of the disease. In December, we announced positive top line results from the Phase 1b trial of the BIIB037 in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These data are early but we believe they're compelling and we're aggressively working to advance this program into Phase III. And early this month, we announced Phase II results for our antilegal antibody in acute optic neuritis. We believe that the data strongly suggest that our antilegal antibody induced remyelination will now focus on the data from the MS trial, which we expect to have an early 2016. Throughout 2014, we also continue to build our research and development capabilities by hiring a number of highly accomplished researchers from both academia and industry and I believe that we now have truly world-class capabilities across the breadth of R&D. That has been our goal for a number for years and it's rewarding to have made such significant progress this year. 
In 2014, we increased the number of promising assets in our pipeline through strategic acquisitions and collaborations with a number of partners, including Sangamo, Eisai and most recently, Convergence and San Raffaele Hospital. We also made significant progress in advancing our internally developed candidates for the clinic, including 61 and oil compound development with the objective and has a remyelination. Additionally, phase 1 studies are ongoing for several novel formulations of dimethyl fumarate, the active ingredient of TECFIDERA, with the goal of achieving once a day dosing and potentially reducing side effects. We've not analyze data from these trails hope is the move 1 or more of these formulations forward towards co-approval. Our by similar joint venture, Samsung Bioepis, continues to make important progress towards our objective of becoming a leader in the development of biosimilar pharmaceuticALS. PMEA recently accepted our application for approval of a biosimilar version of intercept we believe that we're making excellent progress in other biosimilar molecules as well. Thorugh this, we intend then to high-quality biosimilar pharmaceutical by utilizing our world-class protein engineering and biologics manufacturing capabilities. It's our belief that biosimilars will become increasingly important in the world of healthcare and we believe that we're well positioned to contribute to this evolution. So all in all, it was a very busy and a very good year and with that, I'll now turn the call over to Doug."

I'd like to discuss several of our ongoing programs and the progress we're anticipating during the upcoming year. 
Our Phase III study of TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS known as ASCEND is fully enrolled. There's no effective therapies available today for this progressive and debilitating form of MS. ASCEND is a 2-year placebo-controlled study in 890 patients that will determine whether or not TYSABRI has an impact on disability progression as measured by a novel composite endpoint. The study is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment with FDA and we expect the data from ascend IN the second half of 2015. We're also conducting action, which is a Phase II study evaluating TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke. In this study, we're examining if blocking the lymphocytic infiltration known to occur in the brain following stroke can reduce the extent of injury. Action is a placebo-controlled study in 160 patients, where brain imaging is used to measure the change in infarct volume compared to baseline. Action is fully enrolled and we expect data later this year. We previously discussed our positive top line interim Phase 1b results for BIIB037 in Alzheimer's disease. Additional BIIB037 study data will be presented at the upcoming ADPB meeting in March. The Phase 1b BIIB037 study remains ongoing and our current plan is to initiate our Phase III program later this year. We also recently announced Phase II from the anti-LINGO renew study in acute optic neuritis. We hope to present full data from RENEW at the upcoming American Academy of Neurology meeting in April. A second ongoing Phase II study evaluating anti-LINGO in MS patients is fully enrolled, and we anticipate obtaining results in 2016 as previously disclosed. We continue to develop Neublastin as a novel biologic therapy for neuropathic pain. Our Phase II study in patients with painful lumbar will evaluate whether or not Neublastin has an impact on pain intensity scores. The study is now fully enrolled and results are anticipated in the second half of this year. 
Enrollment in our STX-100 Phase IIa study in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis continues. And the study is currently enrolling a fourth potentially final patient cohort. Through our collaboration with Eisai, have obtained codevelopment and Co. commercialization rights to 2 Alzheimer's disease candidates, BAN2401 an anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibody and E2609, a small molecule base inhibitor. BAN2401 is enrolling patients in Phase 2 and Eisai has initiated a Phase II study with E2609 in patients with in mild cognitive impairment due the Alzheimer's disease. We've also made progress in strengthening our pipeline through business development and earlier this month, we announced our agreement to acquire Convergence, a leader in the development of therapeutics for neuropathic pain. Convergence's lead program, CNV1014802 is a small molecule inhibitor of the 1.7 channel that's being developed for trigeminal neuralgia. Following completion of the acquisition, we expect to work expeditiously to advance 802 into registerational clinical programs. This morning, we announced a collaboration with San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy to develop gene therapy for both hemophilia A and B. Our collaborators at San Raffaele are leaders in the use of base gene therapy approaches.
While this technology remains an early research, we believe gene therapy has the potential to provide lifelong benefits to patients with hemophilia. We look forward to continuing to drive our &D progress during the year. I'll now pass the call to Tony."

We launched 4 new products in 2014 and I'm proud that the execution of the commercial organization. 
In 2014, we continue to grow our global MS market share, fueled by the continued rollout of TECFIDERA worldwide, the improving performance from TYSABRI and continued strength from our interferon business, including the recent launch of PLEGRIDY. Over the past 6 months, our data suggests that our portfolio has consistently captured roughly half of all newly diagnoses patients and the switch patients at the U.S. TECFIDERA continued to demonstrate strong performance, which we believe is a testament to its attractive about profile combining strong efficacy, favorable safety and tolerability and the convenience of oral administration. We believe TECFIDERA is on track to become the most prescribed therapy for MS worldwide. 
In the U.S., we saw a continued growth for the fourth quarter with its market share near 20%. As you may have seen through IMS, we observed moderating new starts for TECFIDERA in the fourth quarter. We believe several factors have impacted the recent performance of TECFIDERA, including a decline in the overall markets switch rate, the U.S. label update in December and the recent launch of PLEGRIDY, which is capturing some interferon switches that otherwise may have gone to TECFIDERA. Importantly, we have not noticed a meaningful change in TECFIDERA discontinuation rates. We are actively engaging physicians to ensure proper education on the label update, and we believe in the continued growth potential of the product in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., very continuing to see strong uptake in multiple launch markets, matching or exceeding the pace that we've seen in the U.S. In November, we launched TECFIDERA with full reimbursement in the U.K. and as of January, we secured reimbursement in both Italy and Spain. We continue to expect to achieve full reimbursement across the other major European markets by the end of the year. We believe that PLEGRIDY may become the interferon of choice based on its combination of efficacy, a favorable safety profile and every-2-week dosing with a convenient subcu autoinjector. Today, roughly half of PLEGRIDY prescriptions have come from AVONEX switches. The other half have come from other therapies and from newly diagnosed patients, which we believe is a positive message about the therapy's broad appeal. The rollout of the PLEGRIDY is expected to continue across Europe in 2015, with launches in most of the major markets anticipated by the end of the year. TYSABRI continues to perform well as the therapy enjoyed its third consecutive quarter of positive net new patient ads, even as the oral therapies have continued to gain share. We believe that this performance is due to the high level of efficacy that TYSABRI provides to patients. 
Turning to our hemophilia products. We continue to believe that reduced infusion frequency is the largest unmet need for the hemophilia community and that ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE meaningfully address this burden. We are encouraged by the strong uptake of ALPROLIX in the U.S. We believe its value proposition to patients has been relatively straightforward as the majority of patients starting on ALPROLIX have been choosing that once weekly prophylaxis dosing schedule. ALPROLIX ended the year with its market share in the low teens with over 60% of hemophilia treatment centers prescribing the product. 
The U.S. launch of ELOCTATE has been proceeding to plan and in the year, with share in the mid-single digits with over 60% of hemophilia treatment centers prescribing after 2 quarters on the market. As we expected, the hemophilia A market has been more competitive than hemophilia B. Acquiring additional patients will require sustained educational and promotional efforts but we believe we have the ability to execute on this strategy. 
I will now pass the call to Paul."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.74 in the fourth quarter and $12.37 for the full year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $4.09 and $13.83 for the full year. Total revenue for the fourth quarter grew 3",1150,"Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.74 in the fourth quarter and $12.37 for the full year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $4.09 and $13.83 for the full year. Total revenue for the fourth quarter grew 34% to approximately $2.6 billion and grew 40% for the full year to $9.7 billion. 
Global fourth quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $916 million. We recorded revenues of $743 million in the U.S. and $173 million outside the U.S. 
TECFIDERA U.S. sales included 14 shipping weeks in the fourth quarter. This added approximately $50 million to  U.S. sales. Foreign exchange offset by hedging, weakened TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $7 million for the quarter versus prior quarter. Our estimate is that we ended the quarter with approximately 2.5 weeks of inventory in the U.S. wholesale channel, a similar level to last quarter. For the full year, worldwide TECFIDERA revenues were $2.9 billion, consisting of $2.4 billion in the U.S. and $483 million in sales outside the U.S. Interferon revenues, including both Avonex and PLEGRIDY were $777 million during the fourth quarter, which includes $528 million in the U.S. and $249 million in sales outside the U.S. 
For the full year, worldwide interferon revenue grew 2% to $3.1 billion consisting of $2 billion dollars in the U.S. and $1.1 billion in sales outside the U.S. 
AVONEX U.S. sales included 14 shipping weeks in the fourth quarter, which added approximately $35 million to the U.S. sales. Foreign exchange offset by hedging, weakened Q4 interferon revenue by approximately $9 million versus prior quarter. TYSABRI worldwide revenue was $484 million in the fourth quarter. These results were comprised of $266 million in the U.S. and $218 million internationally. TYSABRI U.S. sales included 13 shipping weeks in the fourth quarter versus 14 in Q3. Foreign exchange offset by hedging weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $9 million for Q4 versus Q3. 
For the full year, worldwide TYSABRI revenue was approximately $2 billion, of which U.S. revenue was $1 billion and $934 million internationally. 
Moving to hemophilia. ALPROLIX revenue in Q4 was $40 million and $76 million since being launched in May. And ELOCTATE revenue in Q4 was $37 million and $58 million since being launched in July. 
Turning to our anti-CD20, on consolidated joint business, which includes RITUXAN and GAZYVA U.S. profit share, as well as the profit share and royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. We recorded $305 million for Q4 and $1.2 billion for the full year. Royalties were $31 million for Q4 compared to $67 million in the prior quarter. Our royalty revenues from ended on December 15 with the patent expiration. For the full year, royalty revenues were $177 million. 
Now turning to the expense lines on non-GAAP P&L. Q4 non-GAAP cost of good sold were $297 million or 11% of revenue. For the full year, non-GAAP COGS were $1.2 billion or 12% of revenues. Q4 non-GAAP R&D expense was $499 million or 19% of revenue, which includes approximately $50 million in milestones and other payments-related primarily to our JV with Samsung Bioepis and our recent collaboration with Google Docs Life Sciences. For the full year, non-GAAP R&D expense was $1.9 billion or 19% of revenue, an increase of 31% over 2013. 
Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $573 million or 22% of revenue. And the full year, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $2.2 billion or 23% of revenue, an increase of 30% over 2013. 
Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% for the fourth quarter as we benefited from the reinstated R&D tax credit. Our full year tax rate was approximately 25%. During the quarter, we made a $200 million CVR payments to the former shareholders of [indiscernible].  And in Q4 part of our ongoing sure stabilization plan, we repurchased 1.7 million shares for a total of approximately $527 million. Our weighted average diluted shares at the end of the year were 237 million and we ended the year with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 50%-50% between the U.S. and ex-U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP dilutive earnings per share, which again were $4.09 for the fourth quarter and $13.83 for the full year, representing a 54% year-over-year increase. 
Let me turn to our full year 2015 guidance. In 2013, we plan to provide annual guidance and 1 update per year during our second quarter earnings. This modest change is intended to synchronize with our internal planning processes and ensure a continued focus in the long-term. 
Now starting with revenues. We expect the revenue growth between 14% and 16%. Before I provide color on the products, I'd like to highlight 3 factors: First, our plan assumes exchange rates at the recent spot rate; second, as a reminder, we expect the year-over-year decrease in royalty revenue of approximately $130 million as the royalties on sales have expired; and third, our plan assumes our 1 year of free pricing in Germany for TECFIDERA will end this March and move to a lower price. 
Now let me characterize how we're thinking about each of our products. Our plan assumes TECFIDERA will represent the largest contributor to our overall revenue growth. In Europe, our plan assumes TECFIDERA will have full reimbursement in the majority of the EU market. For TYSABRI, we believe the therapy will continue on a positive patient growth trajectory. We continue to be in discussions with to resolve the outstanding periods yet a settlement is not included in our 2015 guidance. We believe we're well positioned with PLEGRIDY within the interferon and combined with AVONEX, our plan assumes we'll continue to gain share within this declining segment. 
For our MS therapies, our plan assumes a constant number of shipping weeks of 13 for each of the 4 quarters in 2015. We believe ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE will continue to grow at a strong pace as we continue to focus on expanding the depth and breadth of the therapies. Our 2015 plan assumes revenues related to RITUXAN and GAZYVA will grow modestly. R&D expense is expected to be between 19% and 20% of sales, which includes approximately $250 million earmarked for business development activity, a similar level of spend when compared to  2014. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 20% to 21% of revenue. As we're now through the commercial ramp of both TECFIDERA and hemophilia therapies, we anticipate over 200 basis point improvement in SG&A year-over-year. We anticipate non-GAAP EPS results between $16.60 and $17 and GAAP EPS to be between $15.45 and $15.85. 
From a cash prospective, we expect to pay over $1 billion in CVR payments to Fumapharm related to the sales of TECFIDERA. And we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $400 million to $450 million, an increase over 2014 as we invest in our manufacturing capabilities and IT infrastructure. 
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."

We started out 2015 with the agreement to acquire Convergence and a collaboration with San Raffaele Hospital and we expect to complete additional business development transactions during the year. 
We also expect to see pipeline readouts for several compounds. In addition to the presentations of the data for BIIB037 and the anti-LINGO antibody expected in March and April and the completion of the TYSABRI SPMS trials, we expect to see mid-stage data for Neublastin and neuropathic pain and TYSABRI in stroke. So this will be another busy year with meaningful milestones. We have aggressive goals in all aspects of the business and we'll continue to do our best to achieve them.

As you can imagine, we're in the process of having discussions with regulators in fact, we've been having them for some time as we've been seeing the data emerge from the study. I think it's safe to say that our intent going forward will be to try to design a study that most faithfully reproduces the type of patient that we treated in the Phase 1b study, as well as looking at similar endpoints, as you know, from a cognition perspective, we achieved statistical significance on the CBR boxes, which is our registrational endpoint. The BACE inhibitor for AstraZeneca and Lilly is actually using that as a Phase III endpoint in mild patients. So I think you can anticipate a Phase III program that will have similar patients entering the study, screened in a similar fashion upfront and the final study design we will talk about at the time we start enrolling patients. That's our usual practice. I don't see any reason to break profile for this particular molecule. With respect to the choice of dose, as you know the study is still underway. We still have a couple of courts that remain blinded and until we see that data, we won't be able to finalize the exact dosing regimen except I'll reiterate what said at JPMorgan, which is we believe we have a dosing window that we can work with from both safety perspective but more importantly, from what looks like a treatment effect perspective as well.

That seems to be the pattern that's emerging. If you look at what the primary endpoints for studies in those cohorts of patients actually are using with the Lilly study being just an example of that. The issue of what constitutes clinical significance is 1 that obviously is something that we'll be discussing with regulators. Our view based on our decision to go right from Phase 1b to Phase III is that we believe we've seen a treatment effect that is significant enough and our advisers believe this to be the case to meet the criteria in most people's minds for clinical significance and not just statistical significance."

The MS study as we talked about in the previous earnings call, that study is ongoing. It is fully enrolled now. Our intent is to actually have a small group of us internally see some of that data at the 12-month time point later this year, which we will use as a basis to begin to have some of those discussions with regulators. So I think that what we're able to see in that data will teach us a lot about, which of the various endpoints we're measuring in that study actually show the best correlation with remyelination. As you know, this is the first of its kind study where we are assessing the impact of remyelination on patients with MS. And so we're looking at a variety of endpoints, everything from EDSS to cognition to certain ambulatory parameters. We have a number of imaging endpoints built into the study and from that analysis, we hope to be able to tease out what the most sensitive clinical measures of remyelination are so that we can go to regulators and start discussing what a Phase III endpoint might actually look like. So as we said in the previous call, there'll be a small group of us that they will see that data and that will allow us to determine how to have a conversation with regulators. We plan to keep the study blinded through to the full 18-month time point, which means that full data disclosure won't come until sometime in 2016 for the full data set.

There's still a number of technical hurdles to overcome with this but it does direct expression into the liver and 1 of the advantages with lentiviral vectors is that number one, you some of the issues that you have with AAV vectors that involve re-existing immunity to the vector system itself. And it's also a very long-term expression that you're capable of getting with that vector system. So Luigi is 1 of the pioneers in this area. We think that if we can make this successful approach, that release of transformational transformational approach from a gene therapy perspective given how broadly you could treat patients with both Factor VIII and Factor IX deficiency. So still preclinical, but I think very much a transformational type of therapy if we can bring it forward and make it work."

We thought that, that was an important way of screening patients upfront to confirm that in particular, patients with mild cognitive impairment, there are many reasons why that would happen. Amyloid beta deposition being just 1 of them. So confirming that the patients actually have the target for our drug upfront, we believed was an important way of enriching the population of potential responders. And as we carried out the study, I think that was confirmed because our screen failure rate was probably on the order of 30% to 40%, meaning that even though these patients had cognitive impairment, they didn't actually have beta-amyloid deposition at a level that was detectable with the screening reagent. So the were limited from the study. They could arguably never have responded to our drug anyways. So we needed to actually get them out of the study upfront. How this plays out with respect to the eventual labeling of the drug? My guess is that it will become standard practice to actually screen patients with early stages of Alzheimer's with either AB45, which is available or something akin to that and akin to that I mean their CSF levels a beta can be looked up as well. Some way of screening patients upfront to confirm that their disease, their cognitive impairment is caused by beta-amyloid deposition, I think will become part of the treatment paradigm. So, whether it's a bioassay based on CSF or, whether it's an imaging approach like we've used, I do believe that, that will be an essential part of the treatment paradigm going forward to confirm that these drugs are being used in the right patients."

But 2014 I think was a very successful year for Biogen Idec. We brought several new therapies to the market. We had encouraging data from some of the compounds in our pipeline. And importantly, we delivered 40% revenue growth and 54% non-GAAP EPS growth compared to 2013. 
In 2014, we launched 4 new products in 2 distinct therapeutic areas. I think that's a real accomplishment for our company of our size. TECFIDERA is in its second year on the market in the U.S. and in 2014, we successfully launched TECFIDERA in the EU, and are continuing to expand our presence across the globe. TECFIDERA is now the most prescribed MS therapy in Germany, and the most prescribed oral therapy in the U.S. More than 135,000 people have been treated worldwide. As you all know from the IMS data, TECFIDERA did experience moderating growth in Q4, which we believe is due to a variety of factors that Tony will discuss in more detail. However, we believe that TECFIDERA will continue to grow in the U.S. and will grow substantially in international markets, so that we anticipate that 2015 will be another year of meaningful growth for TECFIDERA and for our portfolio of MS products in general. PLEGRIDY was approved for the treatment of relapsing MS and launched in both the U.S. and the EU in the second half of 2014. Although we're early in the launch, PLEGRIDY appears to be gaining rapid adoption. PLEGRIDY is an important part of our strategy to maintain our leadership position in the interferon segment of the MS market. We also obtained approval and subsequently launched our hemophilia products in the U.S. in 2014, ALPROLIX for hemophilia B and ELOCTATE for hemophilia A. ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE represent the first meaningful innovations in the treatment of hemophilia in many years, and reflect our mission to help bring new therapies to patients who are underserved. 
In our pipeline, we advanced several potential therapeutic options across a broad set of disease areas. Along with our collaboration partner, AbbVie, we reported positive results from the Phase III trial of ZINBRYTA for relapsing forms of MS and expect to file for marketing authorization in the first half of the year. 
We believe ZINBRYTA has the potential to become another important treatment option to serve the diverse needs of MS patients. Our collaboration partner, Isis, advanced its final muscular atrophy program, SMNRx, to Phase III in both infant and childhood forms of the disease. In December, we announced positive top line results from a Phase Ib trial of BIIB037 in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These data are early, but we believe they're compelling and we are aggressively working to advance this program into Phase III. And early this month, we announced Phase II results for our anti-LINGO antibody in acute optic neuritis. We believe that the data strongly suggest that our anti-LINGO antibody induced remyelination, and we're now focused on the data from the MS trial, which we expect to have in early 2016. Throughout 2014, we also continue to build our research and development capabilities by hiring a number of highly accomplished researchers from both academia and industry, and I believe that we now have truly world-class capabilities across the breadth of R&D. That has been a goal for a number for years, and it's rewarding to have made such significant progress this year. 
In 2014, we increased the number of promising assets in our pipeline through strategic acquisitions and collaborations with a number of partners, including Sangamo, Eisai and most recently, Convergence and San Raffaele Hospital. We also made significant progress in advancing our internally developed candidates in -- for the clinic, including BIIB061, an oral compound in Phase I development, with the objective of enhancing remyelination. Additionally, Phase 1 studies are ongoing for several novel formulations of dimethyl fumarate, the active ingredient of TECFIDERA, with the goal of achieving once a day dosing and potentially reducing side effects. We have not yet analyzed the data from these trails, but our hope is to move one or more of these formulations forward towards approval. Our biosimilar joint venture, Samsung Bioepis, continues to make important progress toward our objective of becoming a leader in the development of biosimilar pharmaceuticals. The EMEA recently accepted our application for approval of a biosimilar version of etanercept and we believe that we're making excellent progress on other biosimilar molecules as well. Through this JV, we intend to develop high-quality biosimilar pharmaceuticals by utilizing our world-class protein engineering and biologics manufacturing capabilities. It's our belief that biosimilars will become increasingly important in the role of healthcare, and we believe that we're well positioned to contribute to this evolution. So all in all, it was a very busy and a very good year, and with that, I'll now pass the call along to Doug."

I'd like to discuss several of our ongoing programs and the progress we're anticipating during the upcoming year. 
Our Phase III study of TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS known as ASCEND is fully enrolled. There's no effective therapies available today for this progressive and debilitating form of MS. ASCEND is a 2-year, placebo-controlled study in 890 patients that will determine whether or not TYSABRI has an impact on disability progression as measured by a novel composite endpoint. The study is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment with the FDA, and we expect the data from ASCEND in the second half of 2015. We are also conducting ACTION, which is a Phase II study, evaluating TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke. In this study, we're examining if blocking the lymphocytic infiltration known to occur in the brain following stroke can reduce the extent of injury. ACTION is a placebo-controlled study in 160 patients, where brain imaging is used to measure the change in infarct volume compared to baseline. ACTION is fully enrolled and we expect data later this year. We previously discussed our positive top line interim Phase Ib results for BIIB037 in Alzheimer's disease. Additional BIIB037 study data will be presented at the upcoming ADPD meeting in March. The Phase Ib BIIB037 study remains ongoing, and our current plan is to initiate our Phase III program later this year. We also recently announced Phase II data from the anti-LINGO RENEW study in acute optic neuritis. We hope to present full data from RENEW at the upcoming American Academy of Neurology meeting in April. A second ongoing Phase II study evaluating anti-LINGO in MS patients is fully enrolled, and we anticipate obtaining results in 2016 as previously disclosed. We continue to develop neublastin as a novel biologic therapy for neuropathic pain. Our Phase II study in patients with painful lumbar radiculopathy will evaluate whether or not neublastin has an impact on pain intensity scores. The study is now fully enrolled and results are anticipated in the second half of this year. 
Enrollment in our STX-100 Phase IIa study in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis continues. And the study is currently enrolling a fourth, and potentially final, patient cohort. Through our collaboration with Eisai, we have obtained co-development and co-commercialization rights to 2 Alzheimer's disease candidates, BAN2401, an anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibody, and E2609, a small molecule base inhibitor. BAN2401 is enrolling patients in Phase II and Eisai has initiated a Phase II study with E2609 in patients with prodromal AD in mild cognitive impairment due the Alzheimer's disease. We've also made progress in strengthening our pipeline through business development, and earlier this month, we announced our agreement to acquire Convergence, a leader in the development of therapeutics for neuropathic pain. Convergence's lead program, CNV802 is a small molecule inhibitor of the NAV 1.7 sodium channel that's being developed for trigeminal neuralgia. Following completion of the acquisition, we expect to work expeditiously to advance 802 into registrational clinical programs. This morning, we announced a collaboration with San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy, to develop gene therapy for both hemophilia A and B. Our collaborators at San Raffaele are leaders in the use of lentiviral based gene therapy approaches.
While this technology remains in early research, we believe gene therapy has the potential to provide lifelong benefits to patients with hemophilia. We look forward to continuing to drive R&D progress during the year. I'll now pass the call to Tony."

We launched 4 new products in 2014 and I'm proud of the execution of the commercial organization. 
In 2014, we continue to grow our global MS market share, fueled by the continued rollout of TECFIDERA worldwide, improving performance from TYSABRI and continued strength from our interferon business, including the recent launch of PLEGRIDY. Over the past 6 months, our data suggests that our portfolio has consistently captured roughly half of all newly diagnosis patients and switch patients in the U.S. TECFIDERA continued to demonstrate strong performance, which we believe is a testament to its attractive product profile, combining strong efficacy, favorable safety and tolerability and the convenience of oral administration. We believe TECFIDERA is on track to become the most prescribed therapy for MS worldwide. 
In the U.S., we saw continued growth through the fourth quarter with its market share near 20%. As you may have seen through IMS, we observed moderating new starts for TECFIDERA in the fourth quarter. We believe several factors have impacted the recent performance of TECFIDERA, including a decline in the overall market switch rate, the U.S. label update in December and the recent launch of PLEGRIDY, which is capturing some interferon switches that otherwise may have gone to TECFIDERA. Importantly, we have not noticed a meaningful change in TECFIDERA discontinuation rates. We are actively engaging physicians to ensure proper education on the label update, and we believe in the continued growth potential of the product in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., we're continuing to see strong uptake in multiple launch markets, matching or exceeding the pace that we've seen in the U.S. In November, we launched TECFIDERA with full reimbursement in the U.K. and as of January, we secured reimbursement in both Italy and Spain. We continue to expect to achieve full reimbursement across the other major European markets by the end of the year. We believe that PLEGRIDY may become the interferon of choice, based on its combination of efficacy, a favorable safety profile and every-2-week dosing with a convenient subcu autoinjector. Today, roughly half of PLEGRIDY prescriptions have come from AVONEX switches. The other half have come from other therapies and from newly diagnosed patients, which we believe is a positive message about the therapy's broad appeal. The rollout of PLEGRIDY is expected to continue across Europe in 2015, with launches in most of the major markets anticipated by the end of the year. TYSABRI continues to perform well as the therapy enjoyed its third consecutive quarter of positive net new patient adds, even as the oral therapies have continued to gain share. We believe that this performance is due to the high level of efficacy that TYSABRI provides to patients. 
Turning to our hemophilia products. We continue to believe that reduced infusion frequency is the largest unmet need for the hemophilia community, and that ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE meaningfully address this burden. We are encouraged by the strong uptake of ALPROLIX in the U.S. We believe its value proposition to patients has been relatively straightforward, as the majority of patients starting on ALPROLIX have been choosing the once-weekly prophylaxis dosing schedule. ALPROLIX ended the year with its market share in the low teens, with over 60% of hemophilia treatment centers prescribing the products. 
The U.S. launch of ELOCTATE has been proceeding to plan, and end the year with share in the mid-single digits with over 60% of hemophilia treatment centers prescribing after 2 quarters on the market. As we expected, the hemophilia A market has been more competitive than hemophilia B. Acquiring additional patients will require sustained educational and promotional efforts, but we believe we have the ability to execute on this strategy. 
I will now pass the call to Paul."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.74 in the fourth quarter and $12.37 for the full year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $4.09 and $13.83 for the full year. Total revenue for the fourth quarter grew 3",1155,"Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.74 in the fourth quarter and $12.37 for the full year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $4.09 and $13.83 for the full year. Total revenue for the fourth quarter grew 34% to approximately $2.6 billion and grew 40% for the full year to $9.7 billion. 
Global fourth quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $916 million. We recorded revenues of $743 million in the U.S. and $173 million outside the U.S. 
TECFIDERA U.S. sales included 14 shipping weeks in the fourth quarter. This added approximately $50 million to U.S. sales. Foreign exchange, offset by hedging, weakened TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $7 million for the quarter versus prior quarter. Our estimate is that we ended the quarter with approximately 2.5 weeks of inventory in the U.S. wholesale channel, a similar level to last quarter. For the full year, worldwide TECFIDERA revenues were $2.9 billion, consisting of $2.4 billion in the U.S. and $483 million in sales outside the U.S. Interferon revenues, including both Avonex and PLEGRIDY, were $777 million during the fourth quarter, which includes $528 million in the U.S. and $249 million in sales outside the U.S. 
For the full year, worldwide interferon revenue grew 2% to $3.1 billion consisting of $2 billion dollars in the U.S. and $1.1 billion in sales outside the U.S. 
AVONEX U.S. sales included 14 shipping weeks in the fourth quarter, which added approximately $35 million to U.S. sales. Foreign exchange offset by hedging, weakened Q4 interferon revenue by approximately $9 million versus prior quarter. TYSABRI worldwide revenue was $484 million in the fourth quarter. These results were comprised of $266 million in the U.S. and $218 million internationally. TYSABRI U.S. sales included 13 shipping weeks in the fourth quarter versus 14 in Q3. Foreign exchange offset by hedging weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $9 million for Q4 versus Q3. 
For the full year, worldwide TYSABRI revenue was approximately $2 billion, of which U.S. revenue was $1 billion and $934 million internationally. 
Moving to hemophilia. The ALPROLIX revenue in Q4 was $40 million and $76 million since being launched in May. And ELOCTATE revenue in Q4 was $37 million and $58 million since being launched in July. 
Turning to our anti-CD20, on consolidated joint business, which includes RITUXAN and GAZYVA U.S. profit share, as well as the profit share and royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. We recorded $305 million for Q4 and $1.2 billion for the full year. Royalties were $31 million for Q4 compared to $67 million in the prior quarter. Our royalty revenues from ANGIOMAX ended on December 15 with the patent expiration. For the full year, royalty revenues were $177 million. 
Now turning to the expense lines on non-GAAP P&L. Q4 non-GAAP cost of good sold were $297 million or 11% of revenue. For the full year, non-GAAP COGS were $1.2 billion or 12% of revenues. Q4 non-GAAP R&D expense was $499 million or 19% of revenue, which includes approximately $50 million in milestones and other payments, related primarily to our JV with Samsung Bioepis and our recent collaboration with Google[x] Life Sciences. For the full year, non-GAAP R&D expense was $1.9 billion or 19% of revenue, an increase of 31% over 2013. 
Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $573 million or 22% of revenue. In the full year, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $2.2 billion or 23% of revenue, an increase of 30% over 2013. 
Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% for the fourth quarter as we benefited from the reinstated R&D tax credit. Our full year tax rate was approximately 25%. During the quarter, we made a $200 million CVR payment to the former shareholders of Fumapharm. And in Q4, as part of our ongoing sure stabilization plan, we repurchased 1.7 million shares for a total of approximately $527 million. Our weighted average diluted shares at the end of the year were 237 million and we ended the year with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 50%-50% between the U.S. and ex-U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which again were $4.09 for the fourth quarter and $13.83 for the full year, representing a 54% year-over-year increase. 
Let me turn to our full year 2015 guidance. In 2015, we plan to provide annual guidance and 1 update per year during our second quarter earnings. This modest change is intended to synchronize with our internal planning processes and ensure a continued focus in the long-term. 
Now starting with revenues. We expect revenue growth between 14% and 16%. Before I provide color on the products, I'd like to highlight 3 factors: First, our plan assumes exchange rates at the recent spot rate; second, as a reminder, we expect the year-over-year decrease in royalty revenue of approximately $130 million as the royalties on ANGIOMAX sales have expired; and third, our plan assumes our 1 year of free pricing in Germany for TECFIDERA will end this March and move to a lower price. 
Now let me characterize how we're thinking about each of our products. Our plan assumes TECFIDERA will represent the largest contributor to our overall revenue growth. In Europe, our plan assumes TECFIDERA will have full reimbursement in the majority of the EU market. For TYSABRI, we believe the therapy will continue on a positive patient growth trajectory. We continue to be in discussions with IEFA to resolve the outstanding periods, yet a settlement is not included in our 2015 guidance. We believe we are well positioned with PLEGRIDY within the interferons and combined with AVONEX, our plan assumes we'll continue to gain share within this declining segment. 
For our MS therapies, our plan assumes a constant number of shipping weeks of 13 for each of the 4 quarters in 2015. We believe ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE will continue to grow at a strong pace, as we continue to focus on expanding the depth and breadth of the therapies. Our 2015 plan assumes revenues related to RITUXAN and GAZYVA will grow modestly. R&D expense is expected to be between 19% and 20% of sales, which includes approximately $250 million earmarked for business development activity, a similar level of spend when compared to 2014. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 20% to 21% of revenue. As we're now through the commercial ramp of both TECFIDERA and hemophilia therapies, we anticipate over a 200 basis point improvement in SG&A year-over-year. We anticipate non-GAAP EPS results between $16.60 and $17 and GAAP EPS to be between $15.45 and $15.85. 
From a cash prospective, we expect to pay over $1 billion in CVR payments to Fumapharm, related to the sales of TECFIDERA. And we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $400 million to $450 million, an increase over 2014 as we invest in our manufacturing capabilities and IT infrastructure. 
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."

We launched PLEGRIDY in the U.S. and Europe and ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX in the U.S., as well as some other countries. We had a good year commercially and financially and we received positive results in some of the important compounds in our pipeline. 
We started out 2015 with the agreement to acquire Convergence and a collaboration with San Raffaele Hospital and we expect to complete additional business development transactions during the year. 
We also expect to see pipeline readouts for several compounds. In addition to the presentations of the data for BIIB037 and the anti-LINGO antibody expected in March and April, and the completion of the TYSABRI SPMS trial, we expect to see mid-stage data for neublastin in neuropathic pain and TYSABRI in stroke. So this will be another busy year with meaningful milestones. We have aggressive goals in all aspects of the business and we'll continue to do our best to achieve them. 
So in closing and as always, I'd like to thank our employees who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patients' lives and the patients and physicians who are involved in our clinical development programs. The achievements we have made together could not have been realized without their passion and commitment. 
So thank you, all, for joining us this afternoon. And operator, we'll now open up the call for questions."

As you can imagine, we're in the process of having discussions with regulators. In fact, we've been having them for some time as we've been seeing the data emerge from the study. I think it's safe to say that our intent going forward will be to try to design a study that most faithfully reproduces the type of patient that we treated in the Phase Ib study, as well as looking at similar endpoints, as you know, from a cognition perspective, we achieved statistical significance on the CDR Sum of the Boxes, which is our registrational endpoint. The BACE inhibitor for AstraZeneca and Lilly is actually using that as a Phase III endpoint in prodromal and mild patients. So I think you can anticipate a Phase III program that will have similar patients entering the study, screened in a similar fashion upfront and the final study design, we will talk about at the time we start enrolling patients. That's our usual practice. I don't see any reason to break profile for this particular molecule. With respect to the choice of dose, as you know, the study is still underway. We still have a couple of cohorts that remain blinded, and until we see that data, we won't be able to finalize the exact dosing regimen, except I'll reiterate what Al said at JPMorgan, which is, we believe we have a dosing window that we can work with, from both a safety perspective but more importantly, from what looks like a treatment effect perspective as well. So a lot more information at the ADPD meeting about the results that we've been able to look at, but the study design issues are very much in process right now, and we'll let know what those studies are going to look like at the time we enroll the first patient."

I think, again pretty consistently. When TECFIDERA launched in the U.S., and we're seeing this repeat outside the U.S., it doubled or tripled the switch rate for a period of time, and that's been working its way down over time."

It's likely there'll be some additional data cuts that will sort of trickle out at subsequent medical meetings, but I think to get a clear sense of what we have seen in that data, with acute optic neuritis at AAN. The MS study as we talked about in a previous earnings call, that study is ongoing. It is fully enrolled now. Our intent is to actually have a small group of us internally see some of that data at the 12-month time point later this year, which we will use as a basis to begin to have some of those discussions with regulators. So I think that what we're able to see in that data will teach us a lot about, which of the various endpoints we're measuring in that study actually show the best correlation with remyelination. As you know, this is the first of its kind study where we are assessing the impact of remyelination on patients with MS. And so we're looking at a variety of endpoints, everything from EDSS to cognition to certain ambulatory parameters. We have a number of imaging endpoints built into the study, and from that analysis, we hope to be able to tease out what the most sensitive clinical measures of remyelination are, so that we can go to regulators and start discussing what a Phase III endpoint might actually look like. So as we said in the previous call, there'll be a small group of us that they will see that data and that will allow us to determine how to have a conversation with regulators. We plan to keep the study blinded through to the full 18-month time point, which means that full data disclosure won't come until sometime in 2016 for the full data set. So that's what you can anticipate playing out over the course of the next 12 to 18 months."

So we think we have the right education in place, we have to keep executing and making sure that, that continues to happen. Look, the lack of meaningful change that we see or we believe we're seeing in the discount rate is encouraging, because it doesn't suggest there's such a change in the profile that people are anxious to pull patients of -- on the country. Look, I think naturally in a case like this, is people are processing the new label, you'll see softness in the switch rate for a period of time, that is probably what accounts for it."

There's still a number of technical hurdles to overcome with this, but it does direct expression into the liver and one of the advantages with lentiviral vectors is that #1, you obviate some of the issues that you have with AAV vectors which involve pre-existing immunity to the vector system itself. And it's also a very long-term expression that you're capable of getting with that vector system. So Luigi is one of the pioneers in this area. We think that if we can make this a successful approach, that it really is a transformational approach from a gene therapy perspective, given how broadly you could treat patients with both Factor VIII and Factor IX deficiency.

We thought that, that was an important way of screening patients upfront to confirm that, in particular, patients with mild cognitive impairment, there are many reasons why that could happen. Amyloid beta deposition being just one of them. So confirming that the patients actually have the target for our drug upfront, we believed was an important way of enriching the population of potential responders. And as we carried out the study, I think that was confirmed, because our screen failure rate was probably on the order of 30% to 40%, meaning that even though these patients had cognitive impairment, they didn't actually have beta-amyloid deposition at a level that was detectable with the screening reagent. So they were limited from the study. They could arguably never have responded to our drug anyways. So we needed to actually get them out of the study upfront. How this plays out with respect to the eventual labeling of the drug? My guess is that it will become standard practice to actually screen patients with early stages of Alzheimer's, with either AB45, which is available, or something akin to that, and akin to that, I mean their CSF levels of a beta can be looked at as well. Some way of screening patients upfront to confirm that their disease, their cognitive impairment is caused by beta-amyloid deposition, I think will become part of the treatment paradigm. So, whether it's a bioassay based on CSF, or whether it's an imaging approach like we've used, I do believe that, that will be an essential part of the treatment paradigm going forward, to confirm that these drugs are being used in the right patients."

I think we've optimally positioned it between the blizzard and Deflategate discussions that will start in a couple of days, so you guys have something to fill your -- the void. 
But 2014 I think was a very successful year for Biogen Idec. We brought several new therapies to the market. We had encouraging data from some of the compounds in our pipeline. And importantly, we delivered 40% revenue growth and 54% non-GAAP EPS growth compared to 2013. 
In 2014, we launched 4 new products in 2 distinct therapeutic areas. I think that's a real accomplishment for our company of our size. TECFIDERA is in its second year on the market in the U.S. and in 2014, we successfully launched TECFIDERA in the EU, and are continuing to expand our presence across the globe. TECFIDERA is now the most prescribed MS therapy in Germany, and the most prescribed oral therapy in the U.S. More than 135,000 people have been treated worldwide. As you all know from the IMS data, TECFIDERA did experience moderating growth in Q4, which we believe is due to a variety of factors that Tony will discuss in more detail. However, we believe that TECFIDERA will continue to grow in the U.S. and will grow substantially in international markets, so that we anticipate that 2015 will be another year of meaningful growth for TECFIDERA and for our portfolio of MS products in general. PLEGRIDY was approved for the treatment of relapsing MS and launched in both the U.S. and the EU in the second half of 2014. Although we're early in the launch, PLEGRIDY appears to be gaining rapid adoption. PLEGRIDY is an important part of our strategy to maintain our leadership position in the interferon segment of the MS market. We also obtained approval and subsequently launched our hemophilia products in the U.S. in 2014, ALPROLIX for hemophilia B and ELOCTATE for hemophilia A. ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE represent the first meaningful innovations in the treatment of hemophilia in many years, and reflect our mission to help bring new therapies to patients who are underserved. 
In our pipeline, we advanced several potential therapeutic options across a broad set of disease areas. Along with our collaboration partner, AbbVie, we reported positive results from the Phase III trial of ZINBRYTA for relapsing forms of MS and expect to file for marketing authorization in the first half of the year. 
We believe ZINBRYTA has the potential to become another important treatment option to serve the diverse needs of MS patients. Our collaboration partner, Isis, advanced its final muscular atrophy program, SMNRx, to Phase III in both infant and childhood forms of the disease. In December, we announced positive top line results from a Phase Ib trial of BIIB037 in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These data are early, but we believe they're compelling and we are aggressively working to advance this program into Phase III. And early this month, we announced Phase II results for our anti-LINGO antibody in acute optic neuritis. We believe that the data strongly suggest that our anti-LINGO antibody induced remyelination, and we're now focused on the data from the MS trial, which we expect to have in early 2016. Throughout 2014, we also continued to build our research and development capabilities by hiring a number of highly accomplished researchers from both academia and industry, and I believe that we now have truly world-class capabilities across the breadth of R&D. That has been a goal for a number for years, and it's rewarding to have made such significant progress this year. 
In 2014, we increased the number of promising assets in our pipeline through strategic acquisitions and collaborations with a number of partners, including Sangamo, Eisai and most recently, Convergence and San Raffaele Hospital. We also made significant progress in advancing our internally developed candidates into the clinic, including BIIB061, an oral compound in Phase I development, with the objective of enhancing remyelination. Additionally, Phase I studies are ongoing for several novel formulations of dimethyl fumarate, the active ingredient of TECFIDERA, with the goal of achieving once a day dosing and potentially reducing side effects. We have not yet analyzed the data from these trails, but our hope is to move one or more of these formulations forward towards approval. Our biosimilar joint venture, Samsung Bioepis, continues to make important progress toward our objective of becoming a leader in the development of biosimilar pharmaceuticals. The EMEA recently accepted our application for approval of a biosimilar version of etanercept and we believe that we're making excellent progress on other biosimilar molecules as well. Through this JV, we intend to develop high-quality biosimilar pharmaceuticals by utilizing our world-class protein engineering and biologics manufacturing capabilities. It's our belief that biosimilars will become increasingly important in the role of healthcare, and we believe that we're well positioned to contribute to this evolution. So all in all, it was a very busy and a very good year, and with that, I'll now pass the call along to Doug."

I'd like to discuss several of our ongoing programs and the progress we're anticipating during the upcoming year. 
Our Phase III study of TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS known as ASCEND is fully enrolled. There's no effective therapies available today for this progressive and debilitating form of MS. ASCEND is a 2-year, placebo-controlled study in 890 patients that will determine whether or not TYSABRI has an impact on disability progression as measured by a novel composite endpoint. The study is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment with the FDA, and we expect the data from ASCEND in the second half of 2015. We are also conducting ACTION, which is a Phase II study, evaluating TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke. In this study, we're examining if blocking the lymphocytic infiltration known to occur in the brain following stroke can reduce the extent of injury. ACTION is a placebo-controlled study in 160 patients, where brain imaging is used to measure the change in infarct volume compared to baseline. ACTION is fully enrolled and we expect data later this year. We previously discussed our positive top line interim Phase Ib results for BIIB037 in Alzheimer's disease. Additional BIIB037 study data will be presented at the upcoming ADPD meeting in March. The Phase Ib BIIB037 study remains ongoing, and our current plan is to initiate our Phase III program later this year. We also recently announced Phase II data from the anti-LINGO RENEW study in acute optic neuritis. We hope to present full data from RENEW at the upcoming American Academy of Neurology meeting in April. A second ongoing Phase II study evaluating anti-LINGO in MS patients is fully enrolled, and we anticipate obtaining results in 2016 as previously disclosed. We continue to develop neublastin as a novel biologic therapy for neuropathic pain. Our Phase II study in patients with painful lumbar radiculopathy will evaluate whether or not neublastin has an impact on pain intensity scores. The study is now fully enrolled and results are anticipated in the second half of this year. 
Enrollment in our STX-100 Phase IIa study in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis continues. And the study is currently enrolling a fourth, and potentially final, patient cohort. Through our collaboration with Eisai, we have obtained co-development and co-commercialization rights to 2 Alzheimer's disease candidates, BAN2401, an anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibody, and E2609, a small molecule base inhibitor. BAN2401 is enrolling patients in Phase II and Eisai has initiated a Phase II study with E2609 in patients with prodromal AD and mild cognitive impairment due the Alzheimer's disease. We've also made progress in strengthening our pipeline through business development, and earlier this month, we announced our agreement to acquire Convergence, a leader in the development of therapeutics for neuropathic pain. Convergence's lead program, CNV802, is a small molecule inhibitor of the NAV 1.7 sodium channel that's being developed for trigeminal neuralgia. Following completion of the acquisition, we expect to work expeditiously to advance 802 into registrational clinical programs. This morning, we announced a collaboration with San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy, to develop gene therapy for both hemophilia A and B. Our collaborators at San Raffaele are leaders in the use of lentiviral-based gene therapy approaches.
While this technology remains in early research, we believe gene therapy has the potential to provide lifelong benefits to patients with hemophilia. We look forward to continuing to drive R&D progress during the year. I'll now pass the call to Tony."

We launched 4 new products in 2014 and I'm proud of the execution of the commercial organization. 
In 2014, we continued to grow our global MS market share, fueled by the continued rollout of TECFIDERA worldwide, improving performance from TYSABRI and continued strength from our interferon business, including the recent launch of PLEGRIDY. Over the past 6 months, our data suggests that our portfolio has consistently captured roughly half of all newly diagnosed patients and switch patients in the U.S. TECFIDERA continued to demonstrate strong performance, which we believe is a testament to its attractive product profile, combining strong efficacy, favorable safety and tolerability and the convenience of oral administration. We believe TECFIDERA is on track to become the most prescribed therapy for MS worldwide. 
In the U.S., we saw continued growth through the fourth quarter with its market share near 20%. As you may have seen through IMS, we observed moderating new starts for TECFIDERA in the fourth quarter. We believe several factors have impacted the recent performance of TECFIDERA, including a decline in the overall market switch rate, the U.S. label update in December and the recent launch of PLEGRIDY, which is capturing some interferon switches that otherwise may have gone to TECFIDERA. Importantly, we have not noticed a meaningful change in TECFIDERA discontinuation rates. We are actively engaging physicians to ensure proper education on the label update, and we believe in the continued growth potential of the product in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., we're continuing to see strong uptake in multiple launch markets, matching or exceeding the pace that we've seen in the U.S. In November, we launched TECFIDERA with full reimbursement in the U.K. and as of January, we secured reimbursement in both Italy and Spain. We continue to expect to achieve full reimbursement across the other major European markets by the end of the year. We believe that PLEGRIDY may become the interferon of choice, based on its combination of efficacy, a favorable safety profile and every-2-week dosing with a convenient subcu autoinjector. To date, roughly half of PLEGRIDY prescriptions have come from AVONEX switches. The other half have come from other therapies and from newly diagnosed patients, which we believe is a positive message about the therapy's broad appeal. The rollout of PLEGRIDY is expected to continue across Europe in 2015, with launches in most of the major markets anticipated by the end of the year. TYSABRI continues to perform well as the therapy enjoyed its third consecutive quarter of positive net new patient adds, even as the oral therapies have continued to gain share. We believe that this performance is due to the high level of efficacy that TYSABRI provides to patients. 
Turning to our hemophilia products. We continue to believe that reduced infusion frequency is the largest unmet need for the hemophilia community, and that ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE meaningfully address this burden. We are encouraged by the strong uptake of ALPROLIX in the U.S. We believe its value proposition to patients has been relatively straightforward, as the majority of patients starting on ALPROLIX have been choosing the once-weekly prophylaxis dosing schedule. ALPROLIX ended the year with its market share in the low teens, with over 60% of hemophilia treatment centers prescribing the product.
The U.S. launch of ELOCTATE has been proceeding to plan, ending the year with share in the mid-single digits with over 60% of hemophilia treatment centers prescribing after 2 quarters on the market. As we expected, the hemophilia A market has been more competitive than hemophilia B. Acquiring additional patients will require sustained educational and promotional efforts, but we believe we have the ability to execute on this strategy. 
I will now pass the call to Paul."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.74 in the fourth quarter and $12.37 for the full year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $4.09 and $13.83 for the full year. Total revenue for the fourth quarter grew 3",1153,"Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.74 in the fourth quarter and $12.37 for the full year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $4.09 and $13.83 for the full year. Total revenue for the fourth quarter grew 34% to approximately $2.6 billion and grew 40% for the full year to $9.7 billion. 
Global fourth quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $916 million. We recorded revenues of $743 million in the U.S. and $173 million outside the U.S. 
TECFIDERA U.S. sales included 14 shipping weeks in the fourth quarter. This added approximately $50 million to U.S. sales. Foreign exchange, offset by hedging, weakened TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $7 million for the quarter versus prior quarter. Our estimate is that we ended the quarter with approximately 2.5 weeks of inventory in the U.S. wholesale channel, a similar level to last quarter. For the full year, worldwide TECFIDERA revenues were $2.9 billion, consisting of $2.4 billion in the U.S. and $483 million in sales outside the U.S. Interferon revenues, including both Avonex and PLEGRIDY, were $777 million during the fourth quarter, which includes $528 million in the U.S. and $249 million in sales outside the U.S. 
For the full year, worldwide interferon revenue grew 2% to $3.1 billion consisting of $2 billion dollars in the U.S. and $1.1 billion in sales outside the U.S. 
AVONEX U.S. sales included 14 shipping weeks in the fourth quarter, which added approximately $35 million to U.S. sales. Foreign exchange, offset by hedging, weakened Q4 interferon revenue by approximately $9 million versus prior quarter. TYSABRI worldwide revenue was $484 million in the fourth quarter. These results were comprised of $266 million in the U.S. and $218 million internationally. TYSABRI U.S. sales included 13 shipping weeks in the fourth quarter versus 14 in Q3. Foreign exchange offset by hedging weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $9 million for Q4 versus Q3. 
For the full year, worldwide TYSABRI revenue was approximately $2 billion, of which U.S. revenue was $1 billion and $934 million internationally. 
Moving to hemophilia. ALPROLIX revenue in Q4 was $40 million and $76 million since being launched in May. And ELOCTATE revenue in Q4 was $37 million and $58 million since being launched in July. 
Turning to our anti-CD20 unconsolidated joint business, which includes RITUXAN and GAZYVA U.S. profit share, as well as the profit share and royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. We recorded $305 million for Q4 and $1.2 billion for the full year. Royalties were $31 million for Q4 compared to $67 million in the prior quarter. Our royalty revenues from ANGIOMAX ended on December 15 with the patent expiration. For the full year, royalty revenues were $177 million. 
Now turning to the expense lines on non-GAAP P&L. Q4 non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $297 million or 11% of revenue. For the full year, non-GAAP COGS were $1.2 billion or 12% of revenues. Q4 non-GAAP R&D expense was $499 million or 19% of revenue, which includes approximately $50 million in milestones and other payments, related primarily to our JV with Samsung Bioepis and our recent collaboration with Google[x] Life Sciences. For the full year, non-GAAP R&D expense was $1.9 billion or 19% of revenue, an increase of 31% over 2013. 
Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $573 million or 22% of revenue. In the full year, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $2.2 billion or 23% of revenue, an increase of 30% over 2013. 
Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% for the fourth quarter, as we benefited from the reinstated R&D tax credit. Our full year tax rate was approximately 25%. During the quarter, we made a $200 million CVR payment to the former shareholders of Fumapharm. And in Q4, as part of our ongoing sure stabilization plan, we repurchased 1.7 million shares for a total of approximately $527 million. Our weighted average diluted shares at the end of the year were 237 million and we ended the year with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 50%-50% between the U.S. and ex-U.S. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which again were $4.09 for the fourth quarter and $13.83 for the full year, representing a 54% year-over-year increase. 
Let me turn to our full year 2015 guidance. In 2015, we plan to provide annual guidance and 1 update per year during our second quarter earnings. This modest change is intended to synchronize with our internal planning processes and ensure a continued focus on the long-term. 
Now starting with revenues. We expect revenue growth between 14% and 16%. Before I provide color on the products, I'd like to highlight 3 factors: First, our plan assumes exchange rates at the recent spot rate; second, as a reminder, we expect a year-over-year decrease in royalty revenue of approximately $130 million as the royalties on ANGIOMAX sales have expired; and third, our plan assumes our 1 year of free pricing in Germany for TECFIDERA will end this March and move to a lower price. 
Now let me characterize how we're thinking about each of our products. Our plan assumes TECFIDERA will represent the largest contributor to our overall revenue growth. In Europe, our plan assumes TECFIDERA will have full reimbursement in the majority of the EU market. For TYSABRI, we believe the therapy will continue on a positive patient growth trajectory. We continue to be in discussions with IEFA to resolve the outstanding periods, yet a settlement is not included in our 2015 guidance. We believe we are well positioned with PLEGRIDY within the interferons and combined with AVONEX, our plan assumes we'll continue to gain share within this declining segment. 
For our MS therapies, our plan assumes a constant number of shipping weeks of 13 for each of the 4 quarters in 2015. We believe ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE will continue to grow at a strong pace, as we continue to focus on expanding the depth and breadth of the therapies. Our 2015 plan assumes revenues related to RITUXAN and GAZYVA will grow modestly. R&D expense is expected to be between 19% and 20% of sales, which includes approximately $250 million earmarked for business development activity, a similar level of spend when compared to 2014. SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 20% to 21% of revenue. As we're now through the commercial ramp of both TECFIDERA and hemophilia therapies, we anticipate over a 200 basis point improvement in SG&A year-over-year. We anticipate non-GAAP EPS results between $16.60 and $17 and GAAP EPS to be between $15.45 and $15.85. 
From a cash perspective, we expect to pay over $1 billion in CVR payments to Fumapharm, related to the sales of TECFIDERA. And we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $400 million to $450 million, an increase over 2014 as we invest in our manufacturing capabilities and IT infrastructure. 
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."

As you can imagine, we're in the process of having discussions with regulators. In fact, we've been having them for some time as we've been seeing the data emerge from the study. I think it's safe to say that our intent going forward will be to try to design a study that most faithfully reproduces the type of patient that we treated in the Phase Ib study, as well as looking at similar endpoints. As you know, from a cognition perspective, we achieved statistical significance on the CDR Sum of Boxes, which is our registrational endpoint. The BACE inhibitor for AstraZeneca and Lilly is actually using that as a Phase III endpoint in prodromal and mild patients. So I think you can anticipate a Phase III program that will have similar patients entering the study, screened in a similar fashion upfront and the final study design, we will talk about at the time we start enrolling patients. That's our usual practice. I don't see any reason to break profile for this particular molecule. With respect to the choice of dose, as you know, the study is still underway. We still have a couple of cohorts that remain blinded, and until we see that data, we won't be able to finalize the exact dosing regimen, except I'll reiterate what Al said at JPMorgan, which is, we believe we have a dosing window that we can work with, from both a safety perspective but more importantly, from what looks like a treatment effect perspective as well. So a lot more information at the ADPD meeting about the results that we've been able to look at, but the study design issues are very much in process right now, and we'll let you know what those studies are going to look like at the time we enroll the first patients."

That seems to be the pattern that's emerging. If you look at what the primary endpoints for studies in those cohorts of patients actually are using, with the Lilly study being just an example of that. The issue of what constitutes clinical significance is one that obviously is something that we'll be discussing with regulators. Our view, based on our decision to go right from Phase Ib to Phase III, is that we believe we've seen a treatment effect that is significant enough, and our advisers believe this to be the case, to meet the criteria in most people's minds for clinical significance and not just statistical significance."

As you know, this is the first of its kind study where we are assessing the impact of remyelination on patients with MS. And so we're looking at a variety of endpoints, everything from EDSS to cognition to certain ambulatory parameters. We have a number of imaging endpoints built into the study, and from that analysis, we hope to be able to tease out what the most sensitive clinical measures of remyelination are, so that we can go to regulators and start discussing what a Phase III endpoint might actually look like. So as we said in the previous call, there'll be a small group of us that will see that data and that will allow us to determine how to have a conversation with regulators. We plan to keep the study blinded through to the full 18-month time point, which means that full data disclosure won't come until sometime in 2016 for the full data set.

I think George pointed out the distinction between DMF and MMF, and we think that, that's an important distinction because it's quite clear from a number of studies that we've carried out, that the biologic response at least in preclinical settings to MMF, is distinct from DMF. And so it remains to be proven that the ability to replicate the safety and efficacy profile that we see with TECFIDERA, which is DMF, can in fact be replicated with these MMF prodrugs. So I think that's what the hurdle is for those programs moving forward, and it's still far too early, I think, to assess how successful those are going to be."

You have -- or for patients, you have a pretty prophy-friendly group of patients in the factor 9 market and there was zero competitor response.

So we're continuing to execute on patient education, but a lot of it is calling on the hemophilia treatment centers, explaining the label, explaining the data, talking to both the nurses and physicians. So I think it's pretty consistent with the way we've talked about it historically. It takes a lot of good, hard execution, but we like the product profile, and we think over time, you build that virtuous cycle of patients who have good experience, physicians who have good experience, and you get increased adoption over time.

I think the deal we announced today is in fact using lentiviral in a systemic delivery mode. It's still a very early program, but one that we have looked at and one for which we're excited to be working with Luigi Naldini, who is one of the leaders in this area. It's an early program. He's got intriguing data at the moment, using a vector system that they have designed. There's still a number of technical hurdles to overcome with this, but it does direct expression into the liver and one of the advantages with lentiviral vectors is that #1, you obviate some of the issues that you have with AAV vectors which involve pre-existing immunity to the vector system itself. And it's also a very long-term expression that you're capable of getting with that vector system. So Luigi is one of the pioneers in this area. We think that if we can make this a successful approach, that it really is a transformational approach from a gene therapy perspective, given how broadly you could treat patients with both Factor VIII and Factor IX deficiency. So still preclinical, but I think very much a transformational type of therapy, if we can bring it forward and make it work."

We thought that, that was an important way of screening patients upfront to confirm that, in particular, patients with mild cognitive impairment, there are many reasons why that could happen, amyloid beta deposition being just one of them. So confirming that the patients actually have the target for our drug upfront, we believed was an important way of enriching the population of potential responders. And as we carried out the study, I think that was confirmed, because our screen failure rate was probably on the order of 30% to 40%, meaning that even though these patients had cognitive impairment, they didn't actually have beta-amyloid deposition at a level that was detectable with the screening reagent. So they were eliminated from the study. They could arguably never have responded to our drug anyways, so we needed to actually get them out of the study upfront. How this plays out with respect to the eventual labeling of the drug? My guess is that it will become standard practice to actually screen patients with early stages of Alzheimer's, with either AB45, which is available, or something akin to that -- and akin to that, I mean there are CSF levels of a beta can be looked at as well; some way of screening patients upfront to confirm that their disease, their cognitive impairment is caused by beta-amyloid deposition, I think, will become part of the treatment paradigm. So, whether it's a bioassay based on CSF, or whether it's an imaging approach like we've used, I do believe that, that will be an essential part of the treatment paradigm going forward, to confirm that these drugs are being used in the right patients."

Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. 
Biogen had a mixed start to 2015. We made good progress on our pipeline, but our commercial results were not as strong as we'd hoped. Although we achieved 20% revenue growth and 55% non-GAAP EPS growth compared to the same quarter last year, we'd expected to do even better. 
We saw moderating pace in uptick of our oral MS therapy, TECFIDERA, in the U.S. and Germany, and like other companies, we had foreign exchange headwinds. Our MS franchise continue to gain overall share this quarter but at a moderating pace. Our interferon business continued to perform well, driven by the recent introduction of PLEGRIDY. TYSABRI remain a therapy of choice for patients needing high efficacy. 
TECFIDERA had a more challenging quarter due to a number of issues, including an overall slowing of the MS market, the recent launch of PLEGRIDY, the single PML case reported last year and some first quarter financial dynamics that Paul will discuss. And as Tony will describe a little later, our 2 hemophilia products, ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX, continue to gain patients and market share during the quarter. 
On the research front, we continue to advance our pipeline. We recently presented compelling data for aducanumab, which is the first investigational drug for Alzheimer's disease that has demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of amyloid plaque and a statistically significant slowing of clinical impairment. 
And this week, we're presenting 73 company-sponsored platform and poster presentations at AAN, which highlight our marketed MS therapies, including TECFIDERA's strong efficacy across a broad range of MS patients in addition to its favorable, long-term safety. We also presented new data for anti-LINGO 1 in acute optic neuritis and aducanumab in Alzheimer's disease. 
We made excellent progress toward initiating multiple Phase III trials. We plan to initiate Phase III trials for aducanumab later this year. We also recently initiated a Phase III trial for TECFIDERA in patients with secondary progressive MS, both of which Doug will highlight. 
We believe these important investments have the potential to be significant future growth drivers for Biogen. We continue to make progress in our biosimilar efforts. So far this year, Marketing Authorisation Applications filed by a Samsung Bioepis, our joint venture with Samsung Biologics, for etanercept and infliximab biosimilar candidates have been accepted by the EMA. 
Biogen is preparing to commercialize these therapies across the EU if approved. There is a growing societal need for high-quality biosimilars to help improve patient access to treatments that they need, and we believe that Biogen's world-class development, manufacturing and analytical capabilities position us well to bring these therapies to patients. 
So in conclusion, we have another busy year in which we'll focus on the trajectory of TECFIDERA and of our entire MS franchise in order to achieve our commercial and financial goal and ensure that we execute ongoing and planned clinical trials to move our pipeline forward as quickly as possible. 
So now I'll turn the call over to Doug, who will update you on our progress in R&D."

At last month's ADPD meeting, we presented positive interim data from our Phase Ib study evaluating aducanumab in patients with prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease. And earlier this week at AAN, we presented additional Phase Ib results",596,"Thanks, George. At last month's ADPD meeting, we presented positive interim data from our Phase Ib study evaluating aducanumab in patients with prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease. And earlier this week at AAN, we presented additional Phase Ib results demonstrating that aducanumab treatment had a consistent impact on amyloid levels in ApoE4 carriers versus non-carriers, as well as in prodromal versus mild AD patient subgroups. We plan to present clinical data for these subgroups at subsequent medical meetings. 
We plan to initiate Phase III registrational studies for aducanumab in the second half of this year. We've been in active dialogue with regulators, and we're close to finalizing our Phase III development plan. 
Our expectation is that our registrational program will include 2 identical, 18 month-long placebo-controlled trials, each including 1,350 subjects with early Alzheimer's disease. We intend to use the CDR Sum of Boxes as the primary endpoint. 
In each Phase III study, we plan to evaluate 2 doses of aducanumab in both the ApoE4 carriers and non-carriers with ApoE4 non-carriers receiving higher treatment doses. Estimating enrollment timing is difficult, but we anticipate Phase III enrollment duration will be similar to other large studies in Alzheimer's disease. We hope the substantial interest in the program will catalyze recruitment. However, the studies will include early Alzheimer's patients more often not yet diagnosed. Also we must ensure that clinical sites have access to amyloid PET imaging. 
As we initiate the Phase III program, the Phase Ib study will remain ongoing. We expect to present the 1 year clinical results for the 6 mg per kg study cohort at the AAIC meeting in July. We also continue to evaluate dose titration, and we expect to present those results next year. 
Moving on to our other programs, starting with ZINBRYTA. The EMA has validated the Marketing Authorisation Application for ZINBRYTA. If approved, we believe ZINBRYTA could be an important new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients. 
For TECFIDERA, we recently initiated a new Phase III study, INSPIRE, to evaluate whether TECFIDERA slows the rate of disability progression in patients with secondary-progressive MS. There are no effective treatments available today for SPMS, and developing therapies for this patient population is of great interest to the organization. 
INSPIRE is a 2-year, placebo-controlled study at 1,170 subjects. The primary endpoint is time to confirm disability progression based on a composite endpoint, including EDSS, a timed 25-foot walk test and a 9-hole PEG test. The endpoint utilized is similar to that being used in the ongoing TYSABRI, ASCEND, SPMS study. 
The scientific rationale to develop TECFIDERA and SPMS is based on both biological and clinical evidence. We believe preclinical data demonstrates that TECFIDERA has had protective and anti-inflammatory properties that may address the lymphocytic infiltrates and neurodegeneration known to occur in SPMS patients. 
The clinical data from TECFIDERA Phase III studies also demonstrated reduced disability progression in subjects even when they hadn't experienced recent relapse. 
Turning to anti-LINGO. At this week's AAN meeting, we presented detailed results from the Phase II acute optic neuritis study, which we believe demonstrate that anti-LINGO is able to remyelinate damaged neurons. New data demonstrate statistically significant improvement in recovery of optic nerve conduction latency in subjects treated with anti-LINGO going out to week 32. 
Also results from a sub-study evaluating multifocal VEP, a more sensitive measure of optic nerve conduction, were found to be consistent with the full field VEP findings. Our anti-LINGO Phase II study in MS remains ongoing, and we expect to obtain the final results in mid-2016. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tony."

We continue to believe that our portfolio of products is a source of strength in the marketplace with the leading oral agent, the leading high-efficacy agent and 2 well positioned interferon options.",655,"Thanks, Doug, and let me start with the MS franchise. We continue to believe that our portfolio of products is a source of strength in the marketplace with the leading oral agent, the leading high-efficacy agent and 2 well positioned interferon options. 
In the U.S., we believe we continue to capture roughly half of all newly diagnosed and switch patients within our franchise in Q1. As we've said in prior calls with the launch of TECFIDERA in 2013 in the U.S. and 2014 in Europe, we saw a period where both market growth and switching dynamics were well above historical averages. And TECFIDERA really drove this. And we expected a natural moderation in these rates through 2014 and into 2015. 
We believe this is occurring as expected but also believe that the tech safety event in October further dampened market growth and switch rates in Q1. So in this broader market context, TECFIDERA continued to add patients this quarter but at an overall slower rate. 
In the U.S., our internal market research suggests that physician intent to prescribe may be improving. We believe these data indicate that we are assisting physicians in putting the updated label into context. 
In Europe, we saw a robust uptake in patient capture the quarter in the U.K., as well as in newly launched market such as Italy and Spain. In Germany, the product saw similar headwinds as in the U.S., but for Europe as a whole, we saw nice growth in patients in the quarter. 
Finally, in markets where we have launched PLEGRIDY, we believe the uptake of that product has also dampened TECFIDERA patient growth by taking some interferon switches that could have gone to TECFIDERA. But obviously, for Biogen overall, this is a positive and again speaks to the strength of our franchise position in the market. 
We continue to believe that TECFIDERA remains the preferred oral option in the market, given its strong efficacy, convenience and safety profile. We are leveraging the full capabilities of our commercial organization to communicate these benefits, maintaining significant sales force focus, executing both physician and patient programming with updated messaging and increasing our share of voice across both print and digital media. 
Next and PLEGRIDY combined continue to gain share among interferons this quarter. PLEGRIDY has continued to source patients broadly, which we believe is a positive indicator of the product's appeal. Based on our market research, we believe PLEGRIDY is emerging as the interferon of choice, and we continue to believe that as interferon market declines, Biogen's ability to grow share within it is attractive. 
Finally, in the MS franchise, we're pleased that TYSABRI showed a full year of positive patient growth in the market with an increasing number of alternatives. From Q1 2014 to Q1 2015, global TYSABRI patients increased 5%. We think this performance is a testament to physician and patient belief in the high level of efficacy that TYSABRI provides to patients. 
So in summary, our MS franchise revenue increased 19% year-over-year to approximately $2.1 billion. 
Turning to our emerging hemophilia business. We continue to be pleased with the launch of our long-acting factors. In the U.S. as the first long-acting factors in the market, both ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE continue to gain new patients this quarter, and we continue to see expansion of usage among hemophilia treatment centers. We now have over 70% HTC penetration for each product, and our data show that switching rates in both hemophilia A and B are running well above historical averages. 
We believe we are succeeding in our strategy to capture early adopters and then expand our footprint as both patients and physicians have positive experiences with the products. Outside of the U.S., we also recently launched both ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE in Japan and have seen strong initial interest. We believe that Japan represents an attractive, long-term growth opportunity for our hemophilia business. 
I'll now pass the call to Paul."
29726,290175158,794078,"Biogen Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2015",2015-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.49 in the first quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the first quarter were $3.82. Total revenue for Q1 grew 20% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion though decreased 3% ve",840,"Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.49 in the first quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the first quarter were $3.82. 
Total revenue for Q1 grew 20% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion though decreased 3% versus the prior quarter. The strengthening dollar weakened revenues by approximately $89 million, which was partially offset by hedging for a net unfavorable impact of $49 million. 
Global first quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $825 million, an increase of 63% year-over-year, however, a decrease of 10% versus the fourth quarter of last year. This quarter's TECFIDERA revenues consist of $648 million in the U.S. and $177 million outside the U.S. 
There are a few items that impacted TECFIDERA revenue in Q1. Let we provide the details. U.S. TECFIDERA sales included 13 shipping weeks in Q1 compared to 14 last quarter. We estimate the additional week of TECFIDERA sales in Q4 represented approximately $50 million. 
U.S. gross-to-net adjustments were higher this quarter than prior quarters. Specifically, increased discounts and allowances, in part due to the, were approximately 400 basis points higher than our estimated run rate for the remainder of 2015. This impacted Q1 U.S. revenues by approximately $35 million. 
In the U.S., we estimate we ended the quarter with approximately 2.5 weeks of inventory in the wholesale channel, a similar level to last quarter. However, we believe there was a slight drawdown of inventory in the specialty pharmacy channel. 
Outside the U.S., foreign exchange impacts offset by hedging weakened TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $8 million for Q1 versus the prior quarter. And in Germany, we began recording TECFIDERA sales at a lower price as the free pricing period ended in mid-February. We expect the official price will be made public in May. 
So shipping weeks gross-to-net, foreign exchange and German pricing negatively impacted TECFIDERA this quarter. Nevertheless, as we've noted, we saw moderating patient growth especially in the U.S. and Germany, and we're working diligently to improve TECFIDERA's trajectory. 
Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $755 million during the first quarter, including $518 million in the U.S. and $236 million in sales outside the U.S. 
AVONEX U.S. sales included 13 shipping weeks in Q1 compared to 14 in the prior quarter. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened Q1 interferon revenue by approximately $12 million versus prior quarter and by approximately $25 million year-over-year. 
TYSABRI worldwide revenue was $463 million in Q1. These results were comprised of $273 million in the U.S. and $190 million internationally. 
Foreign exchange impacts, offset by hedging, weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $12 million in Q1 versus Q4 and approximately $20 million year-over-year. 
Moving to hemophilia. ALPROLIX revenues in Q1 was $43 million, and ELOCTATE revenue was $54 million. 
For our anti-CD20 unconsolidated joint business, which includes RITUXAN and GAZYVA, our U.S. profit share as well as the profit share in royalties on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. were $331 million, an increase from prior quarter in part due to an inventory build. 
Royalties were $20 million for Q1 compared to $38 million in the same quarter last year. Our royalty revenues from ANGIOMAX ended on December 15, 2014. 
Now turning to the expense lines in the non-GAAP P&L. Q1 cost of goods sold were $312 million or 12% of revenue. Q1 R&D expense was $461 million or 18% of revenues, which includes no meaningful business development activity during this quarter though we continue to anticipate additional BD activity through the remainder of the year. Q1 SG&A expense was $560 million or 22% of revenue. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 25% for Q1, and our rate benefited by approximately 1.5% related to a discrete item. 
During the quarter, we made $250 million of CVR payments to the former shareholders of Fumapharm. And our weighted diluted shares at the end of the quarter were 236 million. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $3.5 million in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 50-50 between the U.S. and x U.S. 
This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $3.82 for the first quarter. As a reminder, last quarter, we announced our plan to provide annual guidance in one update per year during our second quarter earnings. This change is intended to synchronize with our internal planning processes and ensure a continued focus on the long term. As a result, we won't be updating our formal guidance this quarter. So I'd like to briefly characterize how we're thinking about the remainder of the year. 
There are 2 key items that we're keeping a watchful eye on for the rest of the year: first, while foreign exchange has been a headwind, any additional strengthening of the dollar could exacerbate this impact on revenue; and second, we continue to expect TECFIDERA will represent the largest contributor to our overall revenue growth. If the U.S. trajectory does not improve, we may come in at the lower end of our previously provided revenue growth. 
Now I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."

Obviously, a top priority for us is the growth of our entire MS portfolio, including TECFIDERA. 
We believe that TECFIDERA is a compelling treatment option for MS patients. Our MS portfolio remain strong. We believe that our portfolio provides leading choices for patients among interferon, oral and high-efficacy therapies, and we're working hard to overcome the headwinds that we saw last quarter. 
And of course, we'll continue to focus on increasing the numbers of hemophilia patients who are taking advantage of the benefits of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. 
This year is also an important one in terms of advancing the pipeline. We'll move aducanumab into Phase III as quickly as possible, and we'll focus on execution of our ongoing trials for the other compounds in our pipeline. 
We anticipate data on several pipeline compounds this year, including the Phase III trial of TYSABRI for the treatment of SPMS, a Phase II trial for TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke and Phase II data for neublastin and neuropathic pain. 
And of course, we're looking forward to the data from the Phase II trial of our anti-LINGO antibody in MS next year. We believe that each of these therapies has the potential to be a significant therapeutic event.

It's our view that based on the natural history studies that yes, they did, and remember that this was a slightly different population in that they were all PET amyloid confirmed. So we had a population that was perhaps slightly different than what the sort of full spectrum in the natural history studies would look like, and I think maybe that's where some of the perception issue comes from. But this was an enriched population of patients based on the fact that they were all amyloid imaged prior to entering the study. So that's the first question. The unblinding issue, I'm glad you asked that question because I've heard that several times now. And we feel very confident that, that was not an issue in the study for a variety of reasons. Probably the most important is that we anticipated this in the sense that we were aware of other studies with other antibodies where ARIA had been observed. And so as we design the study, we wanted to be sure that we put the appropriate safeguards in place so that this would not be an issue. So we segregated the raiders. We're looking at the CBR endpoint and the MMSE endpoint, and neither of those raiders were the treating physician. So they were completely separate from -- we anticipated this. We put the safeguards in place upfront, and I think that, that was an important study design aspect. The other piece of information I think is relevant here if you don't buy that argument, then the other piece is that, frankly, the temporal issues I think also support the fact that it's unlikely that there was any unblinding because 92% of the events, the ARIA event that occurred, occurred within the first 5 doses of administration. We didn't actually see a change in cognition until 12 months or 54 weeks, to be precise. So there was a significant gap between any of the observed ARIA in these patients and the treatment benefit that we recorded with CDR Sum of Boxes and the MMSE endpoints. So that gap in time, I think, should also give you some comfort. And then with respect to clinical, is ARIA a clinical observation? It's a really good question, Mark. I think it may actually be an indication of biology in the case of our antibody. I think it's difficult to say. What I think is important, though, is that about 2/3 of the cases of ARIA that we saw had no symptoms associated with them. In those patients, the 30% -- roughly 35% that did show some symptoms, they were primarily mild to moderate, self resolving within 4 to 12 weeks. So I think there's still a lot for us to learn about ARIA and what it means and how we manage patients through that. But it is a question that I think will continue to be explored, and the answers will play out over the course of the next several years."

I think we're not, at the moment, planning to go into acute optic neuritis as an indication per se, but we thought it was an elegant way to assess whether or not we could demonstrate remyelination in man.

So we wanted to make sure we had adequate drug on board to see a treatment effect if there was going to be one, and I think we're encouraged now by the fact that we've seen through 2 different measures, BEP and also looking at the percentage of patients that actually return to a latency level that looks like normal, which is roughly 2x in the treated group versus the placebo group.

What I will say is that irrespective of the cohorts that we looked at, and this is from the most recent AAN poster that was presented, whether you're looking at ApoE4 carriers or non-carriers, whether you're looking at mild or moderate patients, the reduction in amyloid appears to be pretty consistent across the spectrum. So there doesn't appear to be any difference in ApoE4 status influencing amyloid removal nor the stage of disease roughly breaking it down between mild and prodromal patients."

This is Doug. Well, the timing of the data will be the second half of the year, and I think from the standpoint of mechanism, there's actually quite a bit of preclinical data in stroke models either with antibody treatment or knockouts that demonstrate that the size of the infarc is dramatically reduced when you antagonize this pathway. So what we're going to be looking at in this particular study is 2 different measures. The first is a reduction in the infarc size, which we would predict to occur based on the biology. The immediate influx after an infarc tends to be neutrophils followed quickly thereafter within the first 24 hours with a pretty robust lymphocytic infiltrate, and it's lymphocyte infiltrate contributes to cytokine production that causes further damage and loss of function. So by antagonizing that sort of second influx of lymphocytes, we hope to reduce the infarc size, and we'll be looking at that by imaging 5 days out. The perhaps more important endpoint that we're also looking at and obviously it's a relatively small study. So we haven't sized it to see it per se, but there are several measures of stroke. There's a rating scale that is used routinely in these types of studies that we'll be looking at, at day 29 to really assess whether there's any functional benefit in terms of protecting these patients from loss of function as a result of stroke. So it's really a two-pronged study. The first is the imaging endpoint, and that will come fairly quickly, and that's where most of the good biology data is. Secondarily, though, we'll be actually looking at the performance of these patients either with placebo or TYSABRI to ask the question of whether we've actually shown some benefit from a clinical perspective, and that's what we'll drive the decision as to whether we move into Phase III."

Our results, I think, give us more confidence going into the readout from the MS studies. This is, in fact, the first time anyone has reported a treatment effect and the ability to observe remyelination in man. Prior to this study, all we had was some very elegant animal experiments, but we've never really created the linkage of those data to what we can accomplish in man. So I think the exciting part of the data from the optic neuritis study is that we now have evidence in man looking at a couple of different ways of measuring latency on the optic nerve and also the recovery parameters that I mentioned earlier with double the number of patients getting back to a normal level of latency versus the placebo group. I think that consistency of that data across the various ways we've looked at it gives us added confidence going into the MS study that at least we're influencing the biology we hope to influence.

Our interferon business continued to perform well, driven by the recent introduction of PLEGRIDY. TYSABRI remained the therapy of choice for patients needing high efficacy. 
TECFIDERA had a more challenging quarter due to a number of issues, including an overall slowing of the MS market, the recent launch of PLEGRIDY, the single PML case reported last year and some first quarter financial dynamics that Paul will discuss. And as Tony will describe a little later, our 2 hemophilia products, ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX, continued to gain patients and market share during the quarter. 
On the research front, we continue to advance our pipeline. We recently presented compelling data for aducanumab, which is the first investigational drug for Alzheimer's disease that has demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of amyloid plaque and a statistically significant slowing of clinical impairment. 
And this week, we're presenting 73 company-sponsored platform and poster presentations at AAN, which highlight our marketed MS therapies, including TECFIDERA's strong efficacy across a broad range of MS patients in addition to its favorable long-term safety. We also presented new data for anti-LINGO-1 in acute optic neuritis and aducanumab in Alzheimer's disease. 
We made excellent progress toward initiating multiple Phase III trials. We plan to initiate Phase III trials for aducanumab later this year. We also recently initiated a Phase III trial for TECFIDERA in patients with secondary progressive MS, both of which Doug will highlight. And we believe these important investments have the potential to be significant future growth drivers for Biogen. 
We continue to make progress in our biosimilar efforts. So far this year, Marketing Authorisation Applications filed by Samsung Bioepis, our joint venture with Samsung Biologics, for etanercept and infliximab biosimilar candidates have been accepted by the EMA. Biogen is preparing to commercialize these therapies across the EU if approved. 
There is a growing societal need for high-quality biosimilars to help improve patient access to treatments that they need. And we believe that Biogen's world-class development, manufacturing and analytical capabilities position us well to bring these therapies to patients. 
So in conclusion, we have another busy year in which we'll focus on the trajectory of TECFIDERA and of our entire MS franchise in order to achieve our commercial and financial goal and ensure that we execute ongoing and planned clinical trials to move our pipeline forward as quickly as possible. 
So now I'll turn the call over to Doug, who will update you on our progress in R&D."

At last month's AD/PD meeting, we presented positive interim data from our Phase Ib study evaluating aducanumab in patients with prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease. And earlier this week at AAN, we presented additional phase Ib results",595,"Thanks, George. At last month's AD/PD meeting, we presented positive interim data from our Phase Ib study evaluating aducanumab in patients with prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease. And earlier this week at AAN, we presented additional phase Ib results demonstrating that aducanumab treatment had a consistent impact on amyloid levels in ApoE4 carriers versus non-carriers, as well as in prodromal versus mild AD patient subgroups. We plan to present clinical data for these subgroups at subsequent medical meetings. 
We plan to initiate Phase III registrational studies for aducanumab in the second half of this year. We've been in active dialogue with regulators, and we're close to finalizing our Phase III development plan. 
Our expectation is that our registrational program will include 2 identical, 18 month-long placebo-controlled trials, each including 1,350 subjects with early Alzheimer's disease. We intend to use the CDR Sum of Boxes as the primary endpoint. 
In each Phase III study, we plan to evaluate 2 doses of aducanumab in both the ApoE4 carriers and non-carriers, with ApoE4 non-carriers receiving higher treatment doses. Estimating enrollment timing is difficult, but we anticipate Phase III enrollment duration will be similar to other large studies in Alzheimer's disease. We hope the substantial interest in the program will catalyze recruitment. However, the studies will include early Alzheimer's patients who are often not yet diagnosed. Also, we must ensure that clinical sites have access to amyloid PET imaging. 
As we initiate the Phase III program, the Phase Ib study will remain ongoing. We expect to present the 1-year clinical results for the 6 mg per kg study cohort at the AAIC meeting in July. We also continue to evaluate dose titration, and we expect to present those results next year. 
Moving on to our other programs, starting with ZINBRYTA. The EMA has validated the Marketing Authorisation Application for ZINBRYTA. If approved, we believe ZINBRYTA could be an important new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients. 
For TECFIDERA, we recently initiated a new Phase III study, INSPIRE, to evaluate whether TECFIDERA slows the rate of disability progression in patients with secondary progressive MS. There are no effective treatments available today for SPMS, and developing therapies for this patient population is of great interest to the organization. 
INSPIRE is a 2-year, placebo-controlled study in 1,170 subjects. The primary endpoint is time to confirm disability progression based on a composite endpoint, including EDSS, a timed 25-foot walk test and the 9-Hole Peg Test. The endpoint utilized is similar to that being used in the ongoing TYSABRI ASCEND SPMS study. 
The scientific rationale to develop TECFIDERA and SPMS is based on both biological and clinical evidence. We believe preclinical data demonstrate that TECFIDERA has cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties that may address the lymphocytic infiltrates and neurodegeneration known to occur in SPMS patients. 
The clinical data from TECFIDERA Phase III studies also demonstrated reduced disability progression in subjects even when they hadn't experienced recent relapses. 
Turning to anti-LINGO. At this week's AAN meeting, we presented detailed results from the Phase II acute optic neuritis study, which we believe demonstrate that anti-LINGO is able to remyelinate damaged neurons. New data demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in recovery of optic nerve conduction latency in subjects treated with anti-LINGO going out to week 32. 
Also, results from a sub-study evaluating multifocal VEP, a more sensitive measure of optic nerve conduction, were found to be consistent with the full-field VEP findings. Our anti-LINGO Phase II study in MS remains ongoing, and we expect to obtain final results in mid-2016. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tony."

We continue to believe that our portfolio of products is a source of strength in the marketplace, with the leading oral agent, the leading high-efficacy agent and 2 well-positioned interferon options.",658,"Thanks, Doug, and let me start with the MS franchise. We continue to believe that our portfolio of products is a source of strength in the marketplace, with the leading oral agent, the leading high-efficacy agent and 2 well-positioned interferon options. 
In the U.S., we believe we continue to capture roughly half of all newly diagnosed and switch patients within our franchise in Q1. As we've said in prior calls with the launch of TECFIDERA in 2013 in the U.S. and 2014 in Europe, we saw a period where both market growth and switching dynamics were well above historical averages. And TECFIDERA really drove this. And we expected a natural moderation in these rates through 2014 and into 2015. 
We believe this is occurring as expected but also believe that the TEC safety event in October further dampened market growth and switch rates in Q1. So in this broader market context, TECFIDERA continued to add patients this quarter but at an overall slower rate. 
In the U.S., our internal market research suggests that physician intent to prescribe may be improving. We believe these data indicate that we are assisting physicians in putting the updated label into context. 
In Europe, we saw a robust uptake in patient capture in the quarter in the U.K., as well as in newly launched markets such as Italy and Spain. In Germany, the product saw similar headwinds as in the U.S., but for Europe as a whole, we saw nice growth in patients in the quarter. 
Finally, in markets where we have launched PLEGRIDY, we believe the uptake of that product has also dampened TECFIDERA patient growth by taking some interferon switches that could have gone to TECFIDERA. But obviously, for Biogen overall, this is a positive and, again, speaks to the strength of our franchise position in the market. 
We continue to believe that TECFIDERA remains the preferred oral option in the market given its strong efficacy, convenience and safety profile. We are leveraging the full capabilities of our commercial organization to communicate these benefits, maintaining significant sales force focus, executing both physician and patient programming with updated messaging and increasing our share of voice across both print and digital media. 
Next, AVONEX and PLEGRIDY combined continue to gain share among interferons this quarter. PLEGRIDY has continued to source patients broadly, which we believe is a positive indicator of the product's appeal. Based on our market research, we believe PLEGRIDY is emerging as the interferon of choice. And we continue to believe that as the interferon market declines, Biogen's ability to grow share within it is attractive. 
Finally, in the MS franchise, we're pleased that TYSABRI showed a full year of positive patient growth in the market with an increasing number of alternatives. From Q1 2014 to Q1 2015, global TYSABRI patients increased 5%. We think this performance is a testament to physician and patient belief in the high level of efficacy that TYSABRI provides to patients. 
So in summary, our MS franchise revenue increased 19% year-over-year to approximately $2.1 billion. 
Turning to our emerging hemophilia business. We continue to be pleased with the launch of our long-acting factors. In the U.S. as the first long-acting factors in the market, both ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE continue to gain new patients this quarter. And we have continued to see expansion of usage among hemophilia treatment centers. We now have over 70% HTC penetration for each product, and our data show that switching rates in both hemophilia A and B are running well above historical averages. We believe we are succeeding in our strategy to capture early adopters and then expand our footprint as both patients and physicians have positive experiences with the products. 
Outside of the U.S., we also recently launched both ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE in Japan and have seen strong initial interest. We believe that Japan represents an attractive, long-term growth opportunity for our hemophilia business. 
I'll now pass the call to Paul."
29726,290175158,794336,"Biogen Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2015",2015-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.49 in the first quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the first quarter were $3.82.

Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the first quarter were $3.82. 
Total revenue for Q1 grew 20% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion though decreased 3% versus the prior quarter. The strengthening dollar weakened revenues by approximately $89 million, which was partially offset by hedging for a net unfavorable impact of $49 million. 
Global first quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $825 million, an increase of 63% year-over-year; however, a decrease of 10% versus the fourth quarter of last year. This quarter's TECFIDERA revenues consist of $648 million in the U.S. and $177 million outside the U.S. 
There are a few items that impacted TECFIDERA revenue in Q1. Let we provide the details. U.S. TECFIDERA sales included 13 shipping weeks in Q1 compared to 14 last quarter. We estimate the additional week of TECFIDERA sales in Q4 represented approximately $50 million. 
U.S. gross-to-net adjustments were higher this quarter than prior quarters. Specifically, increased discounts and allowances, in part due to the [indiscernible], were approximately 400 basis points higher than our estimated run rate for the remainder of 2015. This impacted Q1 U.S. revenues by approximately $35 million. 
In the U.S., we estimate we ended the quarter with approximately 2.5 weeks of inventory in the wholesale channel, a similar level to last quarter. However, we believe there was a slight drawdown of inventory in the specialty pharmacy channel. 
Outside the U.S., foreign exchange impacts offset by hedging weakened TECFIDERA revenues by approximately $8 million for Q1 versus the prior quarter. And in Germany, we began recording TECFIDERA sales at a lower price as the free pricing period ended in mid-February. We expect the official price will be made public in May. 
So shipping weeks, gross-to-net, foreign exchange and German pricing negatively impacted TECFIDERA this quarter. Nevertheless, as we've noted, we saw moderating patient growth especially in the U.S. and Germany, and we're working diligently to improve TECFIDERA's trajectory. 
Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $755 million during the first quarter, including $518 million in the U.S. and $236 million in sales outside the U.S. 
AVONEX U.S. sales included 13 shipping weeks in Q1 compared to 14 in the prior quarter. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened Q1 interferon revenue by approximately $12 million versus prior quarter and by approximately $25 million year-over-year. 
TYSABRI worldwide revenue was $463 million in Q1. These results were comprised of $273 million in the U.S. and $190 million internationally. 
Foreign exchange impacts, offset by hedging, weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $12 million for Q1 versus Q4 and approximately $20 million year-over-year. 
Moving to hemophilia. ALPROLIX revenues in Q1 was $43 million, and ELOCTATE revenue was $54 million. 
For our anti-CD20 unconsolidated joint business, which includes RITUXAN and GAZYVA, our U.S. profit share as well as the profit share in royalties on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. were $331 million, an increase from prior quarter in part due to an inventory build. 
Royalties were $20 million for Q1 compared to $38 million in the same quarter last year. Our royalty revenues from ANGIOMAX ended on December 15, 2014. 
Now turning to the expense lines in the non-GAAP P&L. Q1 cost of goods sold were $312 million or 12% of revenue. Q1 R&D expense was $461 million or 18% of revenues, which includes no meaningful business development activity during this quarter though we continue to anticipate additional BD activity through the remainder of the year. Q1 SG&A expense was $560 million or 22% of revenue. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 25% for Q1, and our rate benefited by approximately 1.5% related to a discrete item. 
During the quarter, we made $250 million of CVR payments to the former shareholders of Fumapharm. And our weighted diluted shares at the end of the quarter were 236 million. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $3.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 50-50 between the U.S. and x U.S. 
This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $3.82 for the first quarter. As a reminder, last quarter, we announced our plan to provide annual guidance in one update per year during our second quarter earnings. This change is intended to synchronize with our internal planning processes and ensure a continued focus on the long term. As a result, we won't be updating our formal guidance this quarter though I'd like to briefly characterize how we're thinking about the remainder of the year. 
There are 2 key items we're keeping a watchful eye on for the rest of the year. First, while foreign exchange has been a headwind, any additional strengthening of the dollar could exacerbate this impact on revenue. And second, we continue to expect TECFIDERA will represent the largest contributor to our overall revenue growth. If the U.S. trajectory does not improve, we may come in at the lower end of our previously provided revenue growth. 
Now I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."

We believe that TECFIDERA is a compelling treatment option for MS patients. And our long-term outlook for TECFIDERA and for our entire MS portfolio remains strong. We believe that our portfolio provides leading choices for patients among interferon, oral and high-efficacy therapies, and we're working hard to overcome the headwinds that we saw last quarter. 
And of course, we'll continue to focus on increasing the numbers of hemophilia patients who are taking advantage of the benefits of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. 
This year is also an important one in terms of advancing the pipeline. We'll move aducanumab into Phase III as quickly as possible, and we'll focus on execution of our ongoing trials for the other compounds in our pipeline. 
We anticipate data on several pipeline compounds this year, including the Phase III trial of TYSABRI for the treatment of SPMS, a Phase II trial for TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke and Phase II data for neublastin and neuropathic pain. 
And of course, we're looking forward to the data from the Phase II trial of our anti-LINGO antibody in MS next year. We believe that each of these therapies has the potential to be a significant therapeutic advance.

It's our view that based on the natural history studies that yes, they did. And remember that this was a slightly different population in that they were all PET amyloid confirmed. So we had a population that was perhaps slightly different than what the sort of full spectrum in the natural history studies would look like. And I think maybe that's where some of the perception issue comes from. But this was an enriched population of patients based on the fact that they were all amyloid imaged prior to entering the study. So that's the first question. The unblinding issue, yes, I'm glad you asked that question because I've heard that several times now. And we feel very confident that, that was not an issue in the study for a variety of reasons. Probably the most important is that we anticipated this in the sense that we were aware of other studies with other antibodies where ARIA had been observed. And so as we design the study, we wanted to be sure that we put the appropriate safeguards in place so that this would not be an issue. So we segregated the raiders who were looking at the CDR endpoint and the MMSE endpoint, and neither of those raiders were the treating physician. So they were completely separate from the assessors of clinical results, including ARIA. So we anticipated this. We put the safeguards in place upfront, and I think that, that was an important study design aspect. The other piece of information, I think, is relevant here. If you don't buy that argument, then the other piece is that, frankly, the temporal issues, I think, also support the fact that it's unlikely that there was any unblinding because 92% of the events, the ARIA events that occurred, occurred within the first 5 doses of administration. We didn't actually see a change in cognition until 12 months or 54 weeks, to be precise. So there was a significant gap between any of the observed ARIA in these patients and the treatment benefit that we recorded with CDR Sum of Boxes and the MMSE endpoint. So that gap in time, I think, should also give you some comfort. And then with respect to clinical, is ARIA a clinical observation? It's a really good question, Mark. I think it may actually be an indication of biology in the case of our antibody. I think it's difficult to say. What I think is important, though, is that about 2/3 of the cases of ARIA that we saw had no symptoms associated with them. In those patients, the 30% -- roughly 35% that did show some symptoms, they were primarily mild to moderate, self-resolving within 4 to 12 weeks. So I think there's still a lot for us to learn about ARIA and what it means and how we manage patients through that. But it is a question that I think will continue to be explored, and the answers will play out over the course of the next several years."

I think we're not, at the moment, planning to go into acute optic neuritis as an indication per se, but we thought it was an elegant way to assess whether or not we could demonstrate remyelination in man. The 100 mg per kg dose was simply chosen because we were only planning to do a single-dose cohort, and we chose the top dose that we had looked at in the single ascending dose safety study. So we wanted to make sure we had adequate drug onboard to see a treatment effect if there was going to be one. And I think we're encouraged now by the fact that we've seen through 2 different measures, VEP and also looking at the percentage of patients that actually return to a latency level that looks like normal, which is roughly 2x in the treated group versus the placebo group, that, in fact, we're convinced that there's remyelination that translates to a benefit in terms of improved latency. So 100 mgs per kg was chosen just as a dose that we could give to make sure we had adequate drug onboard, but we don't believe that, that will be the dose.

But I think this study is relatively small to be able to draw those sorts of strong correlations. What I will say is that irrespective of the cohorts that we looked at, and this is from the most recent AAN poster that was presented, whether you're looking at ApoE4 carriers or non-carriers, whether you're looking at mild or moderate patients, the reduction in amyloid appears to be pretty consistent across the spectrum.

Well, the timing of the data would be the second half of the year. And I think from the standpoint of mechanism, there's actually quite a bit of preclinical data in stroke models either with antibody treatment or knockouts that demonstrate that the size of the infarct is dramatically reduced when you antagonize this pathway. So what we're going to be looking at in this particular study is 2 different measures. The first is a reduction in the infarct size, which we would predict to occur based on the biology. The immediate influx after an infarct tends to be neutrophils followed quickly thereafter within the first 24 hours with a pretty robust lymphocyte infiltrate. And it's a fact that the lymphocyte infiltrate contributes to cytokine production that causes further damage and loss of function. So by antagonizing that sort of second influx of lymphocytes, we hope to reduce the infarct size, and we'll be looking at that by imaging 5 days out. The perhaps more important endpoint that we're also looking at, and obviously it's a relatively small study, so we haven't sized it to see it per se, but there are several measures of stroke. There's a rating scale that is used routinely in these types of studies that we'll be looking at, at day 29 to really assess whether there's any functional benefit in terms of protecting these patients from loss of function as a result of stroke. So it's really a two-pronged study. The first is the imaging endpoint, and that will come fairly quickly, and that's where most of the good biology data is. Secondarily, though, we'll be actually looking at the performance of these patients, either with placebo or TYSABRI, to ask the question of whether we've actually shown some benefit from a clinical perspective.

This is, in fact, the first time anyone has reported a treatment effect and the ability to observe remyelination in man. Prior to this study, all we had was some very elegant animal experiments, but we've never really created the linkage of those data to what we can accomplish in man. So I think the exciting part of the data from the optic neuritis study is that we now have evidence in man looking at a couple of different ways of measuring latency on the optic nerve and also the recovery parameters that I mentioned earlier with double the number of patients getting back to a normal level of latency versus the placebo group. I think that consistency of that data across the various ways we've looked at it gives us added confidence going into the MS study that at least we're influencing the biology we hope to influence. So we'll just have to wait and see what that data shows us. And as I mentioned in the call, that will -- the final data will be available in 2016 in the MS study and tell us a lot more than what we know now about how or if to go forward in MS."

Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. 
Biogen had a mixed start to 2015. We made good progress on our pipeline, but our commercial results were not as strong as we'd hoped. Although we achieved 20% revenue growth and 55% non-GAAP EPS growth compared to the same quarter last year, we'd expected to do even better. 
We saw moderating patient uptake of our oral MS therapy, TECFIDERA, in the U.S. and Germany. And like other companies, we had foreign exchange headwinds. Our MS franchise continued to gain overall share this quarter but at a moderating pace. 
Our interferon business continued to perform well, driven by the recent introduction of PLEGRIDY. TYSABRI remained the therapy of choice for patients needing high efficacy. 
TECFIDERA had a more challenging quarter due to a number of issues, including an overall slowing of the MS market, the recent launch of PLEGRIDY, the single PML case reported last year and some first quarter financial dynamics that Paul will discuss. And as Tony will describe a little later, our 2 hemophilia products, ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX, continued to gain patients and market share during the quarter. 
On the research front, we continue to advance our pipeline. We recently presented compelling data for aducanumab, which is the first investigational drug for Alzheimer's disease that has demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of amyloid plaque and a statistically significant slowing of clinical impairment. 
And this week, we're presenting 73 company-sponsored platform and poster presentations at AAN, which highlight our marketed MS therapies, including TECFIDERA's strong efficacy across a broad range of MS patients in addition to its favorable long-term safety. We also presented new data for anti-LINGO-1 in acute optic neuritis and aducanumab in Alzheimer's disease. 
We made excellent progress toward initiating multiple Phase III trials. We plan to initiate Phase III trials for aducanumab later this year. We also recently initiated a Phase III trial for TECFIDERA in patients with secondary progressive MS, both of which Doug will highlight. And we believe these important investments have the potential to be significant future growth drivers for Biogen. 
We continue to make progress in our biosimilar effort. So far this year, Marketing Authorisation Applications filed by Samsung Bioepis, our joint venture with Samsung Biologics, for etanercept and infliximab biosimilar candidates have been accepted by the EMA. Biogen is preparing to commercialize these therapies across the EU if approved. 
There is a growing societal need for high-quality biosimilars to help improve patient access to treatments that they need. And we believe that Biogen's world-class development, manufacturing and analytical capabilities position us well to bring these therapies to patients. 
So in conclusion, we have another busy year in which we'll focus on the trajectory of TECFIDERA and of our entire MS franchise in order to achieve our commercial and financial goal and ensure that we execute ongoing and planned clinical trials to move our pipeline forward as quickly as possible. 
So now I'll turn the call over to Doug, who will update you on our progress in R&D."
29726,290175158,794552,"Biogen Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2015",2015-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, George. At last month's AD/PD meeting, we presented positive interim data from our Phase Ib study evaluating aducanumab in patients with prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease. And earlier this week at AAN, we presented additional phase Ib results",595,"Thanks, George. At last month's AD/PD meeting, we presented positive interim data from our Phase Ib study evaluating aducanumab in patients with prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease. And earlier this week at AAN, we presented additional phase Ib results demonstrating that aducanumab treatment had a consistent impact on amyloid levels in ApoE4 carriers versus non-carriers, as well as in prodromal versus mild AD patient subgroups. We plan to present clinical data for these subgroups at subsequent medical meetings. 
We plan to initiate Phase III registrational studies for aducanumab in the second half of this year. We've been in active dialogue with regulators, and we're close to finalizing our Phase III development plan. 
Our expectation is that our registrational program will include 2 identical, 18-month-long placebo-controlled trials, each including 1,350 subjects with early Alzheimer's disease. We intend to use the CDR Sum of Boxes as the primary endpoint. 
In each Phase III study, we plan to evaluate 2 doses of aducanumab in both the ApoE4 carriers and non-carriers, with ApoE4 non-carriers receiving higher treatment doses. Estimating enrollment timing is difficult, but we anticipate Phase III enrollment duration will be similar to other large studies in Alzheimer's disease. We hope the substantial interest in the program will catalyze recruitment. However, the studies will include early Alzheimer's patients who are often not yet diagnosed. Also, we must ensure that clinical sites have access to amyloid PET imaging. 
As we initiate the Phase III program, the Phase Ib study will remain ongoing. We expect to present the 1-year clinical results for the 6 mg per kg study cohort at the AAIC meeting in July. We also continue to evaluate dose titration, and we expect to present those results next year. 
Moving on to our other programs, starting with ZINBRYTA. The EMA has validated the Marketing Authorisation Application for ZINBRYTA. If approved, we believe ZINBRYTA could be an important new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients. 
For TECFIDERA, we recently initiated a new Phase III study, INSPIRE, to evaluate whether TECFIDERA slows the rate of disability progression in patients with secondary progressive MS. There are no effective treatments available today for SPMS, and developing therapies for this patient population is of great interest to the organization. 
INSPIRE is a 2-year, placebo-controlled study in 1,170 subjects. The primary endpoint is time to confirm disability progression based on a composite endpoint, and including EDSS, a timed 25-foot walk test and the 9-Hole Peg Test. The endpoint utilized is similar to that being used in the ongoing TYSABRI ASCEND SPMS study. 
The scientific rationale to develop TECFIDERA and SPMS is based on both biological and clinical evidence. We believe preclinical data demonstrate that TECFIDERA has cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties that may address the lymphocytic infiltrates and neurodegeneration known to occur in SPMS patients. 
The clinical data from TECFIDERA Phase III studies also demonstrated reduced disability progression in subjects even when they hadn't experienced recent relapses. 
Turning to anti-LINGO. At this week's AAN meeting, we presented detailed results from a Phase II acute optic neuritis study, which we believe demonstrate that anti-LINGO is able to remyelinate damaged neurons. New data demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in recovery of optic nerve conduction latency in subjects treated with anti-LINGO going out to week 32. 
Also, results from a sub-study evaluating multifocal VEP, a more sensitive measure of optic nerve conduction, were found to be consistent with the full-field VEP findings. Our anti-LINGO Phase II study in MS remains ongoing, and we expect to obtain final results in mid-2016. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tony."

We continue to believe that our portfolio of products is a source of strength in the marketplace, with the leading oral agent, the leading high-efficacy agent and 2 well-positioned interferon options.",658,"Thanks, Doug, and let me start with the MS franchise. We continue to believe that our portfolio of products is a source of strength in the marketplace, with the leading oral agent, the leading high-efficacy agent and 2 well-positioned interferon options. 
In the U.S., we believe we continued to capture roughly half of all newly diagnosed and switch patients within our franchise in Q1. As we've said in prior calls, with the launch of TECFIDERA in 2013 in the U.S. and 2014 in Europe, we saw a period where both market growth and switching dynamics were well above historical averages. And TECFIDERA really drove this. And we expected a natural moderation in these rates through 2014 and into 2015. 
We believe this is occurring as expected but also believe that the TEC safety event in October further dampened market growth and switch rates in Q1. So in this broader market context, TECFIDERA continued to add patients this quarter but at an overall slower rate. 
In the U.S., our internal market research suggests that physician intent to prescribe may be improving. We believe these data indicate that we are assisting physicians in putting the updated label into context. 
In Europe, we saw a robust uptake in patient capture in the quarter in the U.K., as well as in newly launched markets such as Italy and Spain. In Germany, the product saw similar headwinds as in the U.S., but for Europe as a whole, we saw nice growth in patients in the quarter. 
Finally, in markets where we have launched PLEGRIDY, we believe the uptake of that product has also dampened TECFIDERA patient growth by taking some interferon switches that could have gone to TECFIDERA. But obviously, for Biogen overall, this is a positive and, again, speaks to the strength of our franchise position in the market. 
We continue to believe that TECFIDERA remains the preferred oral option in the market given its strong efficacy, convenience and safety profile. We are leveraging the full capabilities of our commercial organization to communicate these benefits, maintaining significant sales force focus, executing both physician and patient programming with updated messaging and increasing our share of voice across both print and digital media. 
Next, AVONEX and PLEGRIDY combined continued to gain share among interferons this quarter. PLEGRIDY has continued to source patients broadly, which we believe is a positive indicator of the product's appeal. Based on our market research, we believe PLEGRIDY is emerging as the interferon of choice. And we continue to believe that as the interferon market declines, Biogen's ability to grow share within it is attractive. 
Finally, in the MS franchise, we're pleased that TYSABRI showed a full year of positive patient growth in the market with an increasing number of alternatives. From Q1 2014 to Q1 2015, global TYSABRI patients increased 5%. We think this performance is a testament to physician and patient belief in the high level of efficacy that TYSABRI provides to patients. 
So in summary, our MS franchise revenue increased 19% year-over-year to approximately $2.1 billion. 
Turning to our emerging hemophilia business. We continue to be pleased with the launch of our long-acting factors. In the U.S., as the first long-acting factors in the market, both ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE continue to gain new patients this quarter. And we have continued to see expansion of usage among hemophilia treatment centers. We now have over 70% HTC penetration for each product, and our data show that switching rates in both hemophilia A and B are running well above historical averages. We believe we are succeeding in our strategy to capture early adopters and then expand our footprint as both patients and physicians have positive experiences with the products. 
Outside of the U.S., we also recently launched both ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE in Japan and have seen strong initial interest. We believe that Japan represents an attractive, long-term growth opportunity for our hemophilia business. 
I'll now pass the call to Paul."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.49 in the first quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the first quarter were $3.82. Total revenue for Q1 grew 20% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion, though it decreased 3",842,"Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.49 in the first quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the first quarter were $3.82. 
Total revenue for Q1 grew 20% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion, though it decreased 3% versus the prior quarter. The strengthening dollar weakened revenues by approximately $89 million, which was partially offset by hedging for a net unfavorable impact of $49 million. 
Global first quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $825 million, an increase of 63% year-over-year, however, a decrease of 10% versus the fourth quarter of last year. This quarter's TECFIDERA revenues consist of $648 million in the U.S. and $177 million outside the U.S. 
There are a few items that impacted TECFIDERA revenue in Q1. Let we provide the details. U.S. TECFIDERA sales included 13 shipping weeks in Q1 compared to 14 last quarter. We estimate the additional week of TECFIDERA sales in Q4 represented approximately $50 million. 
U.S. gross-to-net adjustments were higher this quarter than prior quarters. Specifically, increased discounts and allowances, in part due to the doughnut hole, were approximately 400 basis points higher than our estimated run rate for the remainder of 2015. This impacted Q1 U.S. revenues by approximately $35 million. 
In the U.S., we estimate we ended the quarter with approximately 2.5 weeks of inventory in the wholesale channel, a similar level to last quarter. However, we believe there was a slight drawdown of inventory in the specialty pharmacy channel. 
Outside the U.S., foreign exchange impacts offset by hedging weakened TECFIDERA revenues by approximately $8 million for Q1 versus the prior quarter. And in Germany, we began recording TECFIDERA sales at a lower price as the free pricing period ended in mid-February. We expect the official price will be made public in May. 
So shipping weeks, gross-to-net, foreign exchange and German pricing negatively impacted TECFIDERA this quarter. Nevertheless, as we've noted, we saw moderating patient growth especially in the U.S. and Germany, and we're working diligently to improve TECFIDERA's trajectory. 
Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $755 million during the first quarter, including $518 million in the U.S. and $236 million in sales outside the U.S. 
AVONEX U.S. sales included 13 shipping weeks in Q1 compared to 14 in the prior quarter. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened Q1 interferon revenue by approximately $12 million versus prior quarter and by approximately $25 million year-over-year. 
TYSABRI worldwide revenue was $463 million in Q1. These results were comprised of $273 million in the U.S. and $190 million internationally. 
Foreign exchange impacts, offset by hedging, weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $12 million for Q1 versus Q4 and approximately $20 million year-over-year. 
Moving to hemophilia. ALPROLIX revenues in Q1 was $43 million, and ELOCTATE revenue was $54 million. 
For our anti-CD20 unconsolidated joint business, which includes RITUXAN and GAZYVA, our U.S. profit share as well as the profit share in royalties on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. were $331 million, an increase from prior quarter in part due to an inventory build. 
Royalties were $20 million for Q1 compared to $38 million in the same quarter last year. Our royalty revenues from ANGIOMAX ended on December 15, 2014. 
Now turning to the expense lines in the non-GAAP P&L. Q1 cost of goods sold were $312 million or 12% of revenue. Q1 R&D expense was $461 million or 18% of revenues, which includes no meaningful business development activity during this quarter though we continue to anticipate additional BD activity through the remainder of the year. Q1 SG&A expense was $560 million or 22% of revenue. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 25% for Q1, and our rate benefited by approximately 1.5% related to a discrete item. 
During the quarter, we made $250 million of CVR payments to the former shareholders of Fumapharm. And our weighted diluted shares at the end of the quarter were 236 million. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $3.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 50-50 between the U.S. and x U.S. 
This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $3.82 for the first quarter. As a reminder, last quarter we announced our plan to provide annual guidance in one update per year during our second quarter earnings. This change is intended to synchronize with our internal planning processes and ensure a continued focus on the long term. As a result, we won't be updating our formal guidance this quarter though I'd like to briefly characterize how we're thinking about the remainder of the year. 
There are 2 key items we're keeping a watchful eye on for the rest of the year. First, while foreign exchange has been a headwind, any additional strengthening of the dollar could exacerbate this impact on revenue. And second, we continue to expect TECFIDERA will represent the largest contributor to our overall revenue growth. If the U.S. trajectory does not improve, we may come in at the lower end of our previously provided revenue growth. 
Now I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."

We believe that our portfolio provides leading choices for patients among interferon, oral and high-efficacy therapies, and we're working hard to overcome the headwinds that we saw last quarter. 
And of course, we'll continue to focus on increasing the numbers of hemophilia patients who are taking advantage of the benefits of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. 
This year is also an important one in terms of advancing the pipeline. We'll move aducanumab into Phase III as quickly as possible, and we'll focus on execution of our ongoing trials for the other compounds in our pipeline. 
We anticipate data on several pipeline compounds this year, including the Phase III trial of TYSABRI for the treatment of SPMS, a Phase II trial for TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke and Phase II data for neublastin and neuropathic pain. 
And of course, we're looking forward to the data from the Phase II trial of our anti-LINGO antibody in MS next year. We believe that each of these therapies has the potential to be a significant therapeutic advance.

It's our view that based on the natural history studies that yes, they did. And remember that this was a slightly different population in that they were all PET amyloid confirmed. So we had a population that was perhaps slightly different than what the sort of full spectrum in the natural history studies would look like. And I think maybe that's where some of the perception issue comes from. But this was an enriched population of patients based on the fact that they were all amyloid imaged prior to entering the study. So that's the first question. The unblinding issue, I'm glad you asked that question because I've heard that several times now. And we feel very confident that, that was not an issue in the study for a variety of reasons. Probably the most important is that we anticipated this in the sense that we were aware of other studies with other antibodies where ARIA had been observed. And so as we designed the study, we wanted to be sure that we put the appropriate safeguards in place so that this would not be an issue. So we segregated the raiders who were looking at the CDR endpoint and the MMSE endpoint, and neither of those raiders were the treating physician. So they were completely separate from the assessors of clinical results, including ARIA. So we anticipated this. We put the safeguards in place upfront, and I think that, that was an important study design aspect. The other piece of information, I think, is relevant here. If you don't buy that argument, then the other piece is that, frankly, the temporal issues, I think, also support the fact that it's unlikely that there was any unblinding. Because 92% of the events, the ARIA events that occurred, occurred within the first 5 doses of administration. We didn't actually see a change in cognition until 12 months or 54 weeks, to be precise. So there was a significant gap between any of the observed ARIA in these patients and the treatment benefit that we recorded with CDR Sum of Boxes and the MMSE endpoint. So that gap in time, I think, should also give you some comfort. And then with respect to clinical, is ARIA a clinical observation? It's a really good question, Mark. I think it may actually be an indication of biology in the case of our antibody. I think it's difficult to say. What I think is important, though, is that about 2/3 of the cases of ARIA that we saw had no symptoms associated with them. In those patients, the 30% -- roughly 35% that did show some symptoms, they were primarily mild to moderate, self-resolving within 4 to 12 weeks. So I think there's still a lot for us to learn about ARIA and what it means and how we manage patients through that. But it is a question that I think will continue to be explored, and the answers will play out over the course of the next several years."

So we wanted to make sure we had adequate drug onboard to see a treatment effect if there was going to be one. And I think we're encouraged now by the fact that we've seen, through 2 different measures of VEP and also looking at the percentage of patients that actually return to a latency level that looks like normal, which is roughly 2x in the treated group versus the placebo group, that, in fact, we're convinced that there's remyelination that translates to a benefit in terms of improved latency.

What I will say is that irrespective of the cohorts that we looked at, and this is from the most recent AAN poster that was presented, whether you're looking at ApoE4 carriers or non-carriers, whether you're looking at mild or moderate patients, the reduction in amyloid appears to be pretty consistent across the spectrum.

Well, the timing of the data would be the second half of the year. And I think from the standpoint of mechanism, there's actually quite a bit of preclinical data in stroke models either with antibody treatment or knockouts that demonstrate that the size of the infarct is dramatically reduced when you antagonize this pathway. So what we're going to be looking at in this particular study is 2 different measures. The first is a reduction in the infarct size, which we would predict to occur based on the biology. The immediate influx after an infarct tends to be neutrophils followed quickly thereafter within the first 24 hours with a pretty robust lymphocyte infiltrate. And it's thought that, that the lymphocyte infiltrate contributes to cytokine production that causes further damage and loss of function. So by antagonizing that sort of second influx of lymphocytes, we hope to reduce the infarct size, and we'll be looking at that by imaging 5 days out. The perhaps more important endpoint that we're also looking at, and obviously it's a relatively small study, so we haven't sized it to see it per se, but there are several measures of stroke. There's a rating scale that is used routinely in these types of studies that we'll be looking at, at day 29 to really assess whether there's any functional benefit in terms of protecting these patients from loss of function as a result of stroke. So it's really a two-pronged study. The first is the imaging endpoint, and that will come fairly quickly, and that's where most of the good biology data is. Secondarily, though, we'll be actually looking at the performance of these patients, either with placebo or TYSABRI, to ask the question of whether we've actually shown some benefit from a clinical perspective. And that's what will drive the decision as to whether we move into Phase III."

So I think we relied on functional measures of remyelination as opposed to imaging measures just because that was more appropriate in the optic neuritis setting. Yes, our results, I think, give us more confidence going into the readout from the MS studies. This is, in fact, the first time anyone has reported a treatment effect and the ability to observe remyelination in man. Prior to this study, all we had was some very elegant animal experiments, but we've never really created the linkage of those data to what we can accomplish in man. So I think the exciting part of the data from the optic neuritis study is that we now have evidence in man looking at a couple of different ways of measuring latency on the optic nerve and also the recovery parameters that I mentioned earlier with double the number of patients getting back to a normal level of latency versus the placebo group. I think that consistency of that data across the various ways we've looked at it gives us added confidence going into the MS study that at least we're influencing the biology we hope to influence. So we'll just have to wait and see what that data shows us. And as I mentioned in the call, that will -- the final data will be available in 2016 in the MS study and tell us a lot more than what we know now about how or if to go forward in MS."

Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. 
Biogen had a mixed start to 2015. We made good progress on our pipeline, but our commercial results were not as strong as we'd hoped. Although we achieved 20% revenue growth and 55% non-GAAP EPS growth compared to the same quarter last year, we'd expected to do even better. 
We saw moderating patient uptake of our oral MS therapy, TECFIDERA, in the U.S. and Germany. And like other companies, we had foreign exchange headwinds. Our MS franchise continued to gain overall share this quarter but at a moderating pace. 
Our interferon business continued to perform well, driven by the recent introduction of PLEGRIDY. TYSABRI remained the therapy of choice for patients needing high efficacy. 
TECFIDERA had a more challenging quarter due to a number of issues, including an overall slowing of the MS market, the recent launch of PLEGRIDY, the single PML case reported last year and some first quarter financial dynamics that Paul will discuss. And as Tony will describe a little later, our 2 hemophilia products, ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX, continued to gain patients and market share during the quarter. 
On the research front, we continue to advance our pipeline. We recently presented compelling data for aducanumab, which is the first investigational drug for Alzheimer's disease that has demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of amyloid plaque and a statistically significant slowing of clinical impairment. 
And this week, we're presenting 73 company-sponsored platform and poster presentations at AAN, which highlight our marketed MS therapies, including TECFIDERA's strong efficacy across a broad range of MS patients in addition to its favorable long-term safety. We also presented new data for anti-LINGO-1 in acute optic neuritis and aducanumab in Alzheimer's disease. 
We made excellent progress toward initiating multiple Phase III trials. We plan to initiate Phase III trials for aducanumab later this year. We also recently initiated a Phase III trial for TECFIDERA in patients with secondary progressive MS, both of which Doug will highlight. And we believe these important investments have the potential to be significant future growth drivers for Biogen. 
We continue to make progress in our biosimilar effort. So far this year, Marketing Authorisation Applications filed by Samsung Bioepis, our joint venture with Samsung Biologics, for etanercept and infliximab biosimilar candidates have been accepted by the EMA. Biogen is preparing to commercialize these therapies across the EU if approved. 
There is a growing societal need for high-quality biosimilars to help improve patient access to treatments that they need. And we believe that Biogen's world-class development, manufacturing and analytical capabilities position us well to bring these therapies to patients. 
So in conclusion, we have another busy year in which we'll focus on the trajectory of TECFIDERA and of our entire MS franchise in order to achieve our commercial and financial goal and ensure that we execute ongoing and planned clinical trials to move our pipeline forward as quickly as possible. 
So now I'll turn the call over to Doug, who will update you on our progress in R&D."
29726,290175158,795202,"Biogen Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2015",2015-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, George. At last month's AD/PD meeting, we presented positive interim data from our Phase Ib study evaluating aducanumab in patients with prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease. And earlier this week at AAN, we presented additional phase Ib results",595,"Thanks, George. At last month's AD/PD meeting, we presented positive interim data from our Phase Ib study evaluating aducanumab in patients with prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease. And earlier this week at AAN, we presented additional phase Ib results demonstrating that aducanumab treatment had a consistent impact on amyloid levels in ApoE4 carriers versus non-carriers, as well as in prodromal versus mild AD patient subgroups. We plan to present clinical data for these subgroups at subsequent medical meetings. 
We plan to initiate Phase III registrational studies for aducanumab in the second half of this year. We've been in active dialogue with regulators, and we're close to finalizing our Phase III development plan. 
Our expectation is that our registrational program will include 2 identical, 18-month-long placebo-controlled trials, each including 1,350 subjects with early Alzheimer's disease. We intend to use the CDR Sum of Boxes as the primary endpoint. 
In each Phase III study, we plan to evaluate 2 doses of aducanumab in both the ApoE4 carriers and non-carriers, with ApoE4 non-carriers receiving higher treatment doses. Estimating enrollment timing is difficult, but we anticipate Phase III enrollment duration will be similar to other large studies in Alzheimer's disease. We hope the substantial interest in the program will catalyze recruitment. However, the studies will include early Alzheimer's patients who are often not yet diagnosed. Also, we must ensure that clinical sites have access to amyloid PET imaging. 
As we initiate the Phase III program, the Phase Ib study will remain ongoing. We expect to present the 1-year clinical results for the 6 mg per kg study cohort at the AAIC meeting in July. We also continue to evaluate dose titration, and we expect to present those results next year. 
Moving on to our other programs, starting with ZINBRYTA. The EMA has validated the Marketing Authorisation Application for ZINBRYTA. If approved, we believe ZINBRYTA could be an important new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients. 
For TECFIDERA, we recently initiated a new Phase III study, INSPIRE, to evaluate whether TECFIDERA slows the rate of disability progression in patients with secondary progressive MS. There are no effective treatments available today for SPMS, and developing therapies for this patient population is of great interest to the organization. 
INSPIRE is a 2-year, placebo-controlled study in 1,170 subjects. The primary endpoint is time to confirm disability progression based on a composite endpoint, and including EDSS, a timed 25-foot walk test and the 9-Hole Peg Test. The endpoint utilized is similar to that being used in the ongoing TYSABRI ASCEND SPMS study. 
The scientific rationale to develop TECFIDERA and SPMS is based on both biological and clinical evidence. We believe preclinical data demonstrate that TECFIDERA has cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties that may address the lymphocytic infiltrates and neurodegeneration known to occur in SPMS patients. 
The clinical data from TECFIDERA Phase III studies also demonstrated reduced disability progression in subjects even when they hadn't experienced recent relapses. 
Turning to anti-LINGO. At this week's AAN meeting, we presented detailed results from a Phase II acute optic neuritis study, which we believe demonstrate that anti-LINGO is able to remyelinate damaged neurons. New data demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in recovery of optic nerve conduction latency in subjects treated with anti-LINGO going out to week 32. 
Also, results from a sub-study evaluating multifocal VEP, a more sensitive measure of optic nerve conduction, were found to be consistent with the full-field VEP findings. Our anti-LINGO Phase II study in MS remains ongoing, and we expect to obtain final results in mid-2016. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tony."

We continue to believe that our portfolio of products is a source of strength in the marketplace, with the leading oral agent, the leading high-efficacy agent and 2 well-positioned interferon options.",658,"Thanks, Doug, and let me start with the MS franchise. We continue to believe that our portfolio of products is a source of strength in the marketplace, with the leading oral agent, the leading high-efficacy agent and 2 well-positioned interferon options. 
In the U.S., we believe we continued to capture roughly half of all newly diagnosed and switch patients within our franchise in Q1. As we've said in prior calls, with the launch of TECFIDERA in 2013 in the U.S. and 2014 in Europe, we saw a period where both market growth and switching dynamics were well above historical averages. And TECFIDERA really drove this. And we expected a natural moderation in these rates through 2014 and into 2015. 
We believe this is occurring as expected but also believe that the TEC safety event in October further dampened market growth and switch rates in Q1. So in this broader market context, TECFIDERA continued to add patients this quarter but at an overall slower rate. 
In the U.S., our internal market research suggests that physician intent to prescribe may be improving. We believe these data indicate that we are assisting physicians in putting the updated label into context. 
In Europe, we saw a robust uptake in patient capture in the quarter in the U.K., as well as in newly launched markets such as Italy and Spain. In Germany, the product saw similar headwinds as in the U.S., but for Europe as a whole, we saw nice growth in patients in the quarter. 
Finally, in markets where we have launched PLEGRIDY, we believe the uptake of that product has also dampened TECFIDERA patient growth by taking some interferon switches that could have gone to TECFIDERA. But obviously, for Biogen overall, this is a positive and, again, speaks to the strength of our franchise position in the market. 
We continue to believe that TECFIDERA remains the preferred oral option in the market given its strong efficacy, convenience and safety profile. We are leveraging the full capabilities of our commercial organization to communicate these benefits, maintaining significant sales force focus, executing both physician and patient programming with updated messaging and increasing our share of voice across both print and digital media. 
Next, AVONEX and PLEGRIDY combined continued to gain share among interferons this quarter. PLEGRIDY has continued to source patients broadly, which we believe is a positive indicator of the product's appeal. Based on our market research, we believe PLEGRIDY is emerging as the interferon of choice. And we continue to believe that as the interferon market declines, Biogen's ability to grow share within it is attractive. 
Finally, in the MS franchise, we're pleased that TYSABRI showed a full year of positive patient growth in the market with an increasing number of alternatives. From Q1 2014 to Q1 2015, global TYSABRI patients increased 5%. We think this performance is a testament to physician and patient belief in the high level of efficacy that TYSABRI provides to patients. 
So in summary, our MS franchise revenue increased 19% year-over-year to approximately $2.1 billion. 
Turning to our emerging hemophilia business. We continue to be pleased with the launch of our long-acting factors. In the U.S., as the first long-acting factors in the market, both ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE continue to gain new patients this quarter. And we have continued to see expansion of usage among hemophilia treatment centers. We now have over 70% HTC penetration for each product, and our data show that switching rates in both hemophilia A and B are running well above historical averages. We believe we are succeeding in our strategy to capture early adopters and then expand our footprint as both patients and physicians have positive experiences with the products. 
Outside of the U.S., we also recently launched both ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE in Japan and have seen strong initial interest. We believe that Japan represents an attractive, long-term growth opportunity for our hemophilia business. 
I'll now pass the call to Paul."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.49 in the first quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the first quarter were $3.82. Total revenue for Q1 grew 20% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion, though it decreased 3",842,"Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.49 in the first quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the first quarter were $3.82. 
Total revenue for Q1 grew 20% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion, though it decreased 3% versus the prior quarter. The strengthening dollar weakened revenues by approximately $89 million, which was partially offset by hedging for a net unfavorable impact of $49 million. 
Global first quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $825 million, an increase of 63% year-over-year, however, a decrease of 10% versus the fourth quarter of last year. This quarter's TECFIDERA revenues consist of $648 million in the U.S. and $177 million outside the U.S. 
There are a few items that impacted TECFIDERA revenue in Q1. Let we provide the details. U.S. TECFIDERA sales included 13 shipping weeks in Q1 compared to 14 last quarter. We estimate the additional week of TECFIDERA sales in Q4 represented approximately $50 million. 
U.S. gross-to-net adjustments were higher this quarter than prior quarters. Specifically, increased discounts and allowances, in part due to the doughnut hole, were approximately 400 basis points higher than our estimated run rate for the remainder of 2015. This impacted Q1 U.S. revenues by approximately $35 million. 
In the U.S., we estimate we ended the quarter with approximately 2.5 weeks of inventory in the wholesale channel, a similar level to last quarter. However, we believe there was a slight drawdown of inventory in the specialty pharmacy channel. 
Outside the U.S., foreign exchange impacts offset by hedging weakened TECFIDERA revenues by approximately $8 million for Q1 versus the prior quarter. And in Germany, we began recording TECFIDERA sales at a lower price as the free pricing period ended in mid-February. We expect the official price will be made public in May. 
So shipping weeks, gross-to-net, foreign exchange and German pricing negatively impacted TECFIDERA this quarter. Nevertheless, as we've noted, we saw moderating patient growth especially in the U.S. and Germany, and we're working diligently to improve TECFIDERA's trajectory. 
Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $755 million during the first quarter, including $518 million in the U.S. and $236 million in sales outside the U.S. 
AVONEX U.S. sales included 13 shipping weeks in Q1 compared to 14 in the prior quarter. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened Q1 interferon revenue by approximately $12 million versus prior quarter and by approximately $25 million year-over-year. 
TYSABRI worldwide revenue was $463 million in Q1. These results were comprised of $273 million in the U.S. and $190 million internationally. 
Foreign exchange impacts, offset by hedging, weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $12 million for Q1 versus Q4 and approximately $20 million year-over-year. 
Moving to hemophilia. ALPROLIX revenues in Q1 was $43 million, and ELOCTATE revenue was $54 million. 
For our anti-CD20 unconsolidated joint business, which includes RITUXAN and GAZYVA, our U.S. profit share as well as the profit share in royalties on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. were $331 million, an increase from prior quarter in part due to an inventory build. 
Royalties were $20 million for Q1 compared to $38 million in the same quarter last year. Our royalty revenues from ANGIOMAX ended on December 15, 2014. 
Now turning to the expense lines in the non-GAAP P&L. Q1 cost of goods sold were $312 million or 12% of revenue. Q1 R&D expense was $461 million or 18% of revenues, which includes no meaningful business development activity during this quarter though we continue to anticipate additional BD activity through the remainder of the year. Q1 SG&A expense was $560 million or 22% of revenue. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 25% for Q1, and our rate benefited by approximately 1.5% related to a discrete item. 
During the quarter, we made $250 million of CVR payments to the former shareholders of Fumapharm. And our weighted diluted shares at the end of the quarter were 236 million. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $3.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 50-50 between the U.S. and x U.S. 
This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $3.82 for the first quarter. As a reminder, last quarter we announced our plan to provide annual guidance in one update per year during our second quarter earnings. This change is intended to synchronize with our internal planning processes and ensure a continued focus on the long term. As a result, we won't be updating our formal guidance this quarter though I'd like to briefly characterize how we're thinking about the remainder of the year. 
There are 2 key items we're keeping a watchful eye on for the rest of the year. First, while foreign exchange has been a headwind, any additional strengthening of the dollar could exacerbate this impact on revenue. And second, we continue to expect TECFIDERA will represent the largest contributor to our overall revenue growth. If the U.S. trajectory does not improve, we may come in at the lower end of our previously provided revenue growth. 
Now I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."

We believe that our portfolio provides leading choices for patients among interferon, oral and high-efficacy therapies, and we're working hard to overcome the headwinds that we saw last quarter. 
And of course, we'll continue to focus on increasing the numbers of hemophilia patients who are taking advantage of the benefits of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. 
This year is also an important one in terms of advancing the pipeline. We'll move aducanumab into Phase III as quickly as possible, and we'll focus on execution of our ongoing trials for the other compounds in our pipeline. 
We anticipate data on several pipeline compounds this year, including the Phase III trial of TYSABRI for the treatment of SPMS, a Phase II trial for TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke and Phase II data for neublastin and neuropathic pain. 
And of course, we're looking forward to the data from the Phase II trial of our anti-LINGO antibody in MS next year. We believe that each of these therapies has the potential to be a significant therapeutic advance.

We talked about market growth as one of the issues in switch rates. Not clear that the physicians, at least that I talked to, which was anecdotal, had a dramatically different perspective themselves. But they see some hesitance in the conversations that they're having with patients. I think it's a little early to tell what the kind of the impression result or perception result from the recent New England Journal articles will be. But Doug, maybe you want to comment on..."

It's our view that based on the natural history studies that yes, they did. And remember that this was a slightly different population in that they were all PET amyloid confirmed. So we had a population that was perhaps slightly different than what the sort of full spectrum in the natural history studies would look like. And I think maybe that's where some of the perception issue comes from. But this was an enriched population of patients based on the fact that they were all amyloid imaged prior to entering the study. So that's the first question. The unblinding issue, I'm glad you asked that question because I've heard that several times now. And we feel very confident that, that was not an issue in the study for a variety of reasons. Probably the most important is that we anticipated this in the sense that we were aware of other studies with other antibodies where ARIA had been observed. And so as we designed the study, we wanted to be sure that we put the appropriate safeguards in place so that this would not be an issue. So we segregated the raiders who were looking at the CDR endpoint and the MMSE endpoint, and neither of those raiders were the treating physician. So they were completely separate from the assessors of clinical results, including ARIA. So we anticipated this. We put the safeguards in place upfront, and I think that, that was an important study design aspect. The other piece of information, I think, is relevant here. If you don't buy that argument, then the other piece is that, frankly, the temporal issues, I think, also support the fact that it's unlikely that there was any unblinding. Because 92% of the events, the ARIA events that occurred, occurred within the first 5 doses of administration. We didn't actually see a change in cognition until 12 months or 54 weeks, to be precise. So there was a significant gap between any of the observed ARIA in these patients and the treatment benefit that we recorded with CDR Sum of Boxes and the MMSE endpoint. So that gap in time, I think, should also give you some comfort. And then with respect to clinical, is ARIA a clinical observation? It's a really good question, Mark. I think it may actually be an indication of biology in the case of our antibody. I think it's difficult to say. What I think is important, though, is that about 2/3 of the cases of ARIA that we saw had no symptoms associated with them. In those patients, the 30% -- roughly 35% that did show some symptoms, they were primarily mild to moderate, self-resolving within 4 to 12 weeks. So I think there's still a lot for us to learn about ARIA and what it means and how we manage patients through that. But it is a question that I think will continue to be explored, and the answers will play out over the course of the next several years."

So we wanted to make sure we had adequate drug onboard to see a treatment effect if there was going to be one. And I think we're encouraged now by the fact that we've seen, through 2 different measures of VEP and also looking at the percentage of patients that actually return to a latency level that looks like normal, which is roughly 2x in the treated group versus the placebo group, that, in fact, we're convinced that there's remyelination that translates to a benefit in terms of improved latency.

Well, the timing of the data would be the second half of the year. And I think from the standpoint of mechanism, there's actually quite a bit of preclinical data in stroke models either with antibody treatment or knockouts that demonstrate that the size of the infarct is dramatically reduced when you antagonize this pathway. So what we're going to be looking at in this particular study is 2 different measures. The first is a reduction in the infarct size, which we would predict to occur based on the biology. The immediate influx after an infarct tends to be neutrophils followed quickly thereafter within the first 24 hours with a pretty robust lymphocyte infiltrate. And it's thought that, that the lymphocyte infiltrate contributes to cytokine production that causes further damage and loss of function. So by antagonizing that sort of second influx of lymphocytes, we hope to reduce the infarct size, and we'll be looking at that by imaging 5 days out. The perhaps more important endpoint that we're also looking at, and obviously it's a relatively small study, so we haven't sized it to see it per se, but there are several measures of stroke. There's a rating scale that is used routinely in these types of studies that we'll be looking at, at day 29 to really assess whether there's any functional benefit in terms of protecting these patients from loss of function as a result of stroke. So it's really a two-pronged study. The first is the imaging endpoint, and that will come fairly quickly, and that's where most of the good biology data is. Secondarily, though, we'll be actually looking at the performance of these patients, either with placebo or TYSABRI, to ask the question of whether we've actually shown some benefit from a clinical perspective. And that's what will drive the decision as to whether we move into Phase III."

So I think we relied on functional measures of remyelination as opposed to imaging measures just because that was more appropriate in the optic neuritis setting. Yes, our results, I think, give us more confidence going into the readout from the MS studies. This is, in fact, the first time anyone has reported a treatment effect and the ability to observe remyelination in man. Prior to this study, all we had was some very elegant animal experiments, but we've never really created the linkage of those data to what we can accomplish in man. So I think the exciting part of the data from the optic neuritis study is that we now have evidence in man looking at a couple of different ways of measuring latency on the optic nerve and also the recovery parameters that I mentioned earlier with double the number of patients getting back to a normal level of latency versus the placebo group. I think that consistency of that data across the various ways we've looked at it gives us added confidence going into the MS study that at least we're influencing the biology we hope to influence. So we'll just have to wait and see what that data shows us. And as I mentioned in the call, that will -- the final data will be available in 2016 in the MS study and tell us a lot more than what we know now about how or if to go forward in MS."

Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. 
Biogen had a mixed start to 2015. We made good progress on our pipeline, but our commercial results were not as strong as we'd hoped. Although we achieved 20% revenue growth and 55% non-GAAP EPS growth compared to the same quarter last year, we'd expected to do even better. 
We saw moderating patient uptake of our oral MS therapy, TECFIDERA, in the U.S. and Germany. And like other companies, we had foreign exchange headwinds. Our MS franchise continued to gain overall share this quarter but at a moderating pace. 
Our interferon business continued to perform well, driven by the recent introduction of PLEGRIDY. TYSABRI remained the therapy of choice for patients needing high efficacy. 
TECFIDERA had a more challenging quarter due to a number of issues, including an overall slowing of the MS market, the recent launch of PLEGRIDY, the single PML case reported last year and some first quarter financial dynamics that Paul will discuss. And as Tony will describe a little later, our 2 hemophilia products, ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX, continued to gain patients and market share during the quarter. 
On the research front, we continue to advance our pipeline. We recently presented compelling data for aducanumab, which is the first investigational drug for Alzheimer's disease that has demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of amyloid plaque and a statistically significant slowing of clinical impairment. 
And this week, we're presenting 73 company-sponsored platform and poster presentations at AAN, which highlight our marketed MS therapies, including TECFIDERA's strong efficacy across a broad range of MS patients in addition to its favorable long-term safety. We also presented new data for anti-LINGO-1 in acute optic neuritis and aducanumab in Alzheimer's disease. 
We made excellent progress toward initiating multiple Phase III trials. We plan to initiate Phase III trials for aducanumab later this year. We also recently initiated a Phase III trial for TECFIDERA in patients with secondary progressive MS, both of which Doug will highlight. And we believe these important investments have the potential to be significant future growth drivers for Biogen. 
We continue to make progress in our biosimilar effort. So far this year, Marketing Authorisation Applications filed by Samsung Bioepis, our joint venture with Samsung Biologics, for etanercept and infliximab biosimilar candidates have been accepted by the EMA. Biogen is preparing to commercialize these therapies across the EU if approved. 
There is a growing societal need for high-quality biosimilars to help improve patient access to treatments that they need. And we believe that Biogen's world-class development, manufacturing and analytical capabilities position us well to bring these therapies to patients. 
So in conclusion, we have another busy year in which we'll focus on the trajectory of TECFIDERA and of our entire MS franchise in order to achieve our commercial and financial goal and ensure that we execute ongoing and planned clinical trials to move our pipeline forward as quickly as possible. 
So now I'll turn the call over to Doug, who will update you on our progress in R&D."

At last month's AD/PD meeting, we presented positive interim data from our Phase Ib study evaluating aducanumab in patients with prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease. And earlier this week at AAN, we presented additional phase Ib results demonstrating that aducanumab treatment had a consistent impact on amyloid levels in ApoE4 carriers versus non-carriers, as well as in prodromal versus mild AD patient subgroups. We plan to present clinical data for these subgroups at subsequent medical meetings. 
We plan to initiate Phase III registrational studies for aducanumab in the second half of this year. We've been in active dialogue with regulators, and we're close to finalizing our Phase III development plan. 
Our expectation is that our registrational program will include 2 identical, 18-month-long placebo-controlled trials, each including 1,350 subjects with early Alzheimer's disease. We intend to use the CDR Sum of Boxes as the primary endpoint. 
In each Phase III study, we plan to evaluate 2 doses of aducanumab in both the ApoE4 carriers and non-carriers, with ApoE4 non-carriers receiving higher treatment doses. Estimating enrollment timing is difficult, but we anticipate Phase III enrollment duration will be similar to other large studies in Alzheimer's disease. We hope the substantial interest in the program will catalyze recruitment. However, the studies will include early Alzheimer's patients who are often not yet diagnosed. Also, we must ensure that clinical sites have access to amyloid PET imaging. 
As we initiate the Phase III program, the Phase Ib study will remain ongoing. We expect to present the 1-year clinical results for the 6 mg per kg study cohort at the AAIC meeting in July. We also continue to evaluate dose titration, and we expect to present those results next year. 
Moving on to our other programs, starting with ZINBRYTA. The EMA has validated the Marketing Authorisation Application for ZINBRYTA. If approved, we believe ZINBRYTA could be an important new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients. 
For TECFIDERA, we recently initiated a new Phase III study, INSPIRE, to evaluate whether TECFIDERA slows the rate of disability progression in patients with secondary progressive MS. There are no effective treatments available today for SPMS, and developing therapies for this patient population is of great interest to the organization. 
INSPIRE is a 2-year, placebo-controlled study in 1,170 subjects. The primary endpoint is time to confirm disability progression based on a composite endpoint, and including EDSS, a timed 25-foot walk test and the 9-Hole Peg Test. The endpoint utilized is similar to that being used in the ongoing TYSABRI ASCEND SPMS study. 
The scientific rationale to develop TECFIDERA and SPMS is based on both biological and clinical evidence. We believe preclinical data demonstrate that TECFIDERA has cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties that may address the lymphocytic infiltrates and neurodegeneration known to occur in SPMS patients. 
The clinical data from TECFIDERA Phase III studies also demonstrated reduced disability progression in subjects even when they hadn't experienced recent relapses. 
Turning to anti-LINGO. At this week's AAN meeting, we presented detailed results from a Phase II acute optic neuritis study, which we believe demonstrate that anti-LINGO is able to remyelinate damaged neurons. New data demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in recovery of optic nerve conduction latency in subjects treated with anti-LINGO going out to week 32. 
Also, results from a sub-study evaluating multifocal VEP, a more sensitive measure of optic nerve conduction, were found to be consistent with the full-field VEP findings. Our anti-LINGO Phase II study in MS remains ongoing, and we expect to obtain final results in mid-2016.

We continue to believe that our portfolio of products is a source of strength in the marketplace, with the leading oral agent, the leading high-efficacy agent and 2 well-positioned interferon options. 
In the U.S., we believe we continued to capture roughly half of all newly diagnosed and switch patients within our franchise in Q1. As we've said in prior calls, with the launch of TECFIDERA in 2013 in the U.S. and 2014 in Europe, we saw a period where both market growth and switching dynamics were well above historical averages. And TECFIDERA really drove this. And we expected a natural moderation in these rates through 2014 and into 2015. 
We believe this is occurring as expected but also believe that the TEC safety event in October further dampened market growth and switch rates in Q1. So in this broader market context, TECFIDERA continued to add patients this quarter but at an overall slower rate. 
In the U.S., our internal market research suggests that physician intent to prescribe may be improving. We believe these data indicate that we are assisting physicians in putting the updated label into context. 
In Europe, we saw a robust uptake in patient capture in the quarter in the U.K., as well as in newly launched markets such as Italy and Spain. In Germany, the product saw similar headwinds as in the U.S., but for Europe as a whole, we saw nice growth in patients in the quarter. 
Finally, in markets where we have launched PLEGRIDY, we believe the uptake of that product has also dampened TECFIDERA patient growth by taking some interferon switches that could have gone to TECFIDERA. But obviously, for Biogen overall, this is a positive and, again, speaks to the strength of our franchise position in the market. 
We continue to believe that TECFIDERA remains the preferred oral option in the market given its strong efficacy, convenience and safety profile. We are leveraging the full capabilities of our commercial organization to communicate these benefits, maintaining significant sales force focus, executing both physician and patient programming with updated messaging and increasing our share of voice across both print and digital media. 
Next, AVONEX and PLEGRIDY combined continued to gain share among interferons this quarter. PLEGRIDY has continued to source patients broadly, which we believe is a positive indicator of the product's appeal. Based on our market research, we believe PLEGRIDY is emerging as the interferon of choice. And we continue to believe that as the interferon market declines, Biogen's ability to grow share within it is attractive. 
Finally, in the MS franchise, we're pleased that TYSABRI showed a full year of positive patient growth in the market with an increasing number of alternatives. From Q1 2014 to Q1 2015, global TYSABRI patients increased 5%. We think this performance is a testament to physician and patient belief in the high level of efficacy that TYSABRI provides to patients. 
So in summary, our MS franchise revenue increased 19% year-over-year to approximately $2.1 billion. 
Turning to our emerging hemophilia business. We continue to be pleased with the launch of our long-acting factors. In the U.S., as the first long-acting factors in the market, both ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE continue to gain new patients this quarter. And we have continued to see expansion of usage among hemophilia treatment centers. We now have over 70% HTC penetration for each product, and our data show that switching rates in both hemophilia A and B are running well above historical averages. We believe we are succeeding in our strategy to capture early adopters and then expand our footprint as both patients and physicians have positive experiences with the products. 
Outside of the U.S., we also recently launched both ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE in Japan and have seen strong initial interest. We believe that Japan represents an attractive, long-term growth opportunity for our hemophilia business. 
I'll now pass the call to Paul."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.49 in the first quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the first quarter were $3.82. Total revenue for Q1 grew 20% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion, though it decreased 3",842,"Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.49 in the first quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the first quarter were $3.82. 
Total revenue for Q1 grew 20% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion, though it decreased 3% versus the prior quarter. The strengthening dollar weakened revenues by approximately $89 million, which was partially offset by hedging for a net unfavorable impact of $49 million. 
Global first quarter TECFIDERA revenues were $825 million, an increase of 63% year-over-year, however, a decrease of 10% versus the fourth quarter of last year. This quarter's TECFIDERA revenues consist of $648 million in the U.S. and $177 million outside the U.S. 
There are a few items that impacted TECFIDERA revenue in Q1. Let we provide the details. U.S. TECFIDERA sales included 13 shipping weeks in Q1 compared to 14 last quarter. We estimate the additional week of TECFIDERA sales in Q4 represented approximately $50 million. 
U.S. gross-to-net adjustments were higher this quarter than prior quarters. Specifically, increased discounts and allowances, in part due to the doughnut hole, were approximately 400 basis points higher than our estimated run rate for the remainder of 2015. This impacted Q1 U.S. revenues by approximately $35 million. 
In the U.S., we estimate we ended the quarter with approximately 2.5 weeks of inventory in the wholesale channel, a similar level to last quarter. However, we believe there was a slight drawdown of inventory in the specialty pharmacy channel. 
Outside the U.S., foreign exchange impacts offset by hedging weakened TECFIDERA revenues by approximately $8 million for Q1 versus the prior quarter. And in Germany, we began recording TECFIDERA sales at a lower price as the free pricing period ended in mid-February. We expect the official price will be made public in May. 
So shipping weeks, gross-to-net, foreign exchange and German pricing negatively impacted TECFIDERA this quarter. Nevertheless, as we've noted, we saw moderating patient growth especially in the U.S. and Germany, and we're working diligently to improve TECFIDERA's trajectory. 
Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $755 million during the first quarter, including $518 million in the U.S. and $236 million in sales outside the U.S. 
AVONEX U.S. sales included 13 shipping weeks in Q1 compared to 14 in the prior quarter. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened Q1 interferon revenue by approximately $12 million versus prior quarter and by approximately $25 million year-over-year. 
TYSABRI worldwide revenue was $463 million in Q1. These results were comprised of $273 million in the U.S. and $190 million internationally. 
Foreign exchange impacts, offset by hedging, weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $12 million for Q1 versus Q4 and approximately $20 million year-over-year. 
Moving to hemophilia. ALPROLIX revenues in Q1 was $43 million, and ELOCTATE revenue was $54 million. 
For our anti-CD20 unconsolidated joint business, which includes RITUXAN and GAZYVA, our U.S. profit share as well as the profit share in royalties on sales of Rituximab outside the U.S. were $331 million, an increase from prior quarter in part due to an inventory build. 
Royalties were $20 million for Q1 compared to $38 million in the same quarter last year. Our royalty revenues from ANGIOMAX ended on December 15, 2014. 
Now turning to the expense lines in the non-GAAP P&L. Q1 cost of goods sold were $312 million or 12% of revenue. Q1 R&D expense was $461 million or 18% of revenues, which includes no meaningful business development activity during this quarter though we continue to anticipate additional BD activity through the remainder of the year. Q1 SG&A expense was $560 million or 22% of revenue. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 25% for Q1, and our rate benefited by approximately 1.5% related to a discrete item. 
During the quarter, we made $250 million of CVR payments to the former shareholders of Fumapharm. And our weighted diluted shares at the end of the quarter were 236 million. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $3.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 50-50 between the U.S. and x U.S. 
This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $3.82 for the first quarter. As a reminder, last quarter we announced our plan to provide annual guidance in one update per year during our second quarter earnings. This change is intended to synchronize with our internal planning processes and ensure a continued focus on the long term. As a result, we won't be updating our formal guidance this quarter though I'd like to briefly characterize how we're thinking about the remainder of the year. 
There are 2 key items we're keeping a watchful eye on for the rest of the year. First, while foreign exchange has been a headwind, any additional strengthening of the dollar could exacerbate this impact on revenue. And second, we continue to expect TECFIDERA will represent the largest contributor to our overall revenue growth. If the U.S. trajectory does not improve, we may come in at the lower end of our previously provided revenue growth. 
Now I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."

Obviously, a top priority for us is the growth of our entire MS portfolio, including TECFIDERA. 
We believe that TECFIDERA is a compelling treatment option for MS patients. And our long-term outlook for TECFIDERA and for our entire MS portfolio remains strong. We believe that our portfolio provides leading choices for patients among interferon, oral and high-efficacy therapies, and we're working hard to overcome the headwinds that we saw last quarter. 
And of course, we'll continue to focus on increasing the numbers of hemophilia patients who are taking advantage of the benefits of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. 
This year is also an important one in terms of advancing the pipeline. We'll move aducanumab into Phase III as quickly as possible, and we'll focus on execution of our ongoing trials for the other compounds in our pipeline. 
We anticipate data on several pipeline compounds this year, including the Phase III trial of TYSABRI for the treatment of SPMS, a Phase II trial for TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke and Phase II data for neublastin and neuropathic pain. 
And of course, we're looking forward to the data from the Phase II trial of our anti-LINGO antibody in MS next year. We believe that each of these therapies has the potential to be a significant therapeutic advance.
And so with that, we'll close our remarks. And operator, you can now open up the call for questions."

It's our view that based on the natural history studies that yes, they did. And remember that this was a slightly different population in that they were all PET amyloid confirmed. So we had a population that was perhaps slightly different than what the sort of full spectrum in the natural history studies would look like. And I think maybe that's where some of the perception issue comes from. But this was an enriched population of patients based on the fact that they were all amyloid imaged prior to entering the study. So that's the first question. The unblinding issue, I'm glad you asked that question because I've heard that several times now. And we feel very confident that, that was not an issue in the study for a variety of reasons. Probably the most important is that we anticipated this in the sense that we were aware of other studies with other antibodies where ARIA had been observed. And so as we designed the study, we wanted to be sure that we put the appropriate safeguards in place so that this would not be an issue. So we segregated the raiders who were looking at the CDR endpoint and the MMSE endpoint, and neither of those raiders were the treating physician. So they were completely separate from the assessors of clinical results, including ARIA. So we anticipated this. We put the safeguards in place upfront, and I think that, that was an important study design aspect. The other piece of information, I think, is relevant here. If you don't buy that argument, then the other piece is that, frankly, the temporal issues, I think, also support the fact that it's unlikely that there was any unblinding. Because 92% of the events, the ARIA events that occurred, occurred within the first 5 doses of administration. We didn't actually see a change in cognition until 12 months or 54 weeks, to be precise. So there was a significant gap between any of the observed ARIA in these patients and the treatment benefit that we recorded with CDR Sum of Boxes and the MMSE endpoint. So that gap in time, I think, should also give you some comfort. And then with respect to clinical, is ARIA a clinical observation? It's a really good question, Mark. I think it may actually be an indication of biology in the case of our antibody. I think it's difficult to say. What I think is important, though, is that about 2/3 of the cases of ARIA that we saw had no symptoms associated with them. In those patients, the 30% -- roughly 35% that did show some symptoms, they were primarily mild to moderate, self-resolving within 4 to 12 weeks. So I think there's still a lot for us to learn about ARIA and what it means and how we manage patients through that. But it is a question that I think will continue to be explored, and the answers will play out over the course of the next several years."

So we wanted to make sure we had adequate drug onboard to see a treatment effect if there was going to be one. And I think we're encouraged now by the fact that we've seen, through 2 different measures of VEP and also looking at the percentage of patients that actually return to a latency level that looks like normal, which is roughly 2x in the treated group versus the placebo group, that, in fact, we're convinced that there's remyelination that translates to a benefit in terms of improved latency.

What I will say is that irrespective of the cohorts that we looked at, and this is from the most recent AAN poster that was presented, whether you're looking at ApoE4 carriers or non-carriers, whether you're looking at mild or moderate patients, the reduction in amyloid appears to be pretty consistent across the spectrum.

Well, the timing of the data would be the second half of the year. And I think from the standpoint of mechanism, there's actually quite a bit of preclinical data in stroke models either with antibody treatment or knockouts that demonstrate that the size of the infarct is dramatically reduced when you antagonize this pathway. So what we're going to be looking at in this particular study is 2 different measures. The first is a reduction in the infarct size, which we would predict to occur based on the biology. The immediate influx after an infarct tends to be neutrophils followed quickly thereafter within the first 24 hours with a pretty robust lymphocyte infiltrate. And it's thought that, that the lymphocyte infiltrate contributes to cytokine production that causes further damage and loss of function. So by antagonizing that sort of second influx of lymphocytes, we hope to reduce the infarct size, and we'll be looking at that by imaging 5 days out. The perhaps more important endpoint that we're also looking at, and obviously it's a relatively small study, so we haven't sized it to see it per se, but there are several measures of stroke. There's a rating scale that is used routinely in these types of studies that we'll be looking at, at day 29 to really assess whether there's any functional benefit in terms of protecting these patients from loss of function as a result of stroke. So it's really a two-pronged study. The first is the imaging endpoint, and that will come fairly quickly, and that's where most of the good biology data is. Secondarily, though, we'll be actually looking at the performance of these patients, either with placebo or TYSABRI, to ask the question of whether we've actually shown some benefit from a clinical perspective. And that's what will drive the decision as to whether we move into Phase III."

Yes, our results, I think, give us more confidence going into the readout from the MS studies. This is, in fact, the first time anyone has reported a treatment effect and the ability to observe remyelination in man. Prior to this study, all we had was some very elegant animal experiments, but we've never really created the linkage of those data to what we can accomplish in man. So I think the exciting part of the data from the optic neuritis study is that we now have evidence in man looking at a couple of different ways of measuring latency on the optic nerve and also the recovery parameters that I mentioned earlier with double the number of patients getting back to a normal level of latency versus the placebo group.

So let me lead with those issues. 
First is a commercial trajectory. So versus prior year, we achieved 7% revenue growth and 21% non-GAAP EPS growth. Good numbers but certainly lower than we anticipated a few months ago. We'd expected to see a reacceleration of TECFIDERA this quarter, but that did not happen to any appreciable extent. Rather, TECFIDERA experienced modest sequential patient growth as we continue to work through the same commercial challenges experienced in the first quarter of the year. We continue to believe that TECFIDERA remains the preferred oral option in the MS market based on its strong efficacy and favorable safety profile, and we're working hard across organization to improve TECFIDERA's trajectory. 
With that said, our multiple sclerosis portfolio continues to add patients globally. TECFIDERA is the most prescribed oral MS therapy globally and is now being used to treat over 155,000 patients. We believe that PLEGRIDY as on its way to becoming an the interferon of choice as we continue to make it available in new markets around the world. And TYSABRI, which we believe is viewed as the preferred high-efficacy therapy, continued to add patients this quarter. 
Second development with the recent announcement of a new data from aducanumab Phase Ib study at AAIC. By now you've all seen the data, which we take to be positive, in line with in support of the data that we reported earlier. Doug will provide some additional details on this analysis later in the call. 
We've initiated sites for two pivotal Phase III trials for aducanumab in early Alzheimer’s disease  and are screening patients for enrollment. Millions of people worldwide living Alzheimer's disease and no disease modifying treatment options, we believe that this important investment has the potential to be a significant future growth driver for Biogen. 
Moving on to other areas. Our joint venture with Samsung Bioepis, we announced positive results across our anti-TNF biosimilar portfolio at the EULAR conference in June. With these results, we believe that we're well positioned to bring this widely used anti-TNF therapy to physicians, payers and ultimately, the patients who need the most next year. 
Just this month, we announced our intent to build a new next-generation manufacturing facility in Solothurn, Switzerland to support our emerging pipeline, a significant step towards ensuring a long-term global supply of new world-class therapies for patients. We expect to be granted on the facility early next year and start manufacturing activities in 2019. 
So we had a busy second quarter, with an important second half of the year ahead of us and which we'll focus on improving the trajectory of TECFIDERA and ensuring that we execute importing clinical trials to move our pipeline forward as quickly as possible. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to do, we'll update you on our progress and R&D."

Earlier this week, at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference, we presented additional interim results from the aducanumab Phase Ib study with prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease. To remind you, we previously presented results for the 1-, 3- and 10 MG per KG patient cohorts at 6 months and 1 year and for the 6 MG per KG cohort at 6 months. The new results now include 1-year data for 30 subjects treated with 6 MG per KG for aducanumab and additional 10 subjects randomized to placebo. 
The 6 MG per KG 1-year results demonstrated the statistically significant reduction on brain beta-amyloid versus placebo as assessed by PET damaging. The results at 6 months and 1 year showed very strong dose and time-dependent reduction of brain beta-amyloid and extend our previously reported observations. We observed a numeric an improvement on the MMSE and CDR Sum of Box clinical measures compared to placebo, though the results did not achieve statistical significance. The 6 MG per KG dose at 1 year was intermediate an effective vaccine with the 3 and 10 MG KG does is on the CVR score, which will be the primary endpoint for the Phase III program. The safety results for consistent with previously reported results. 
Overall analysis of the 1, 3, 6 and 10 MG per KG clinical results at 1 year demonstrated the statistically significant dose-dependent impact on MMSE and CDR Sum of Boxes compared to placebo. Additional analyses demonstrated strong, positive correlations between reduction in beta-amyloid levels in both CDR and MMSC scores. We believe that the totality of the aducanumab Phase Ib study results strongly support development and registrational studies. 
Based on feedback from regulatory agencies, we recently finalized the aducanumab Phase III study design. Phase III program includes two identically designed placebo-controlled studies referred to as ENGAGE and EMERGE. Each study is expected to include 1,350 subjects with early Alzheimer's disease. Study subjects will be screened by pet amyloid imaging to confirm elevated beta-amyloid plaque levels in the brain. The primary endpoint will be CDR Sum of Boxes, a clinical measure including both cognitive and functional components measured at 18 months. 
In each Phase III study, ApoE4 noncarriers will be randomized to receive 6 MG per KG, 10 MG per KG or placebo, while ApoE4 carriers will receive 3 MG per KG, 6 MG per KG or placebo. Study dosing will include an up titration period in an effort to reduce our maximize aducanumab's benefit/risk profile. 
The Phase III program will be conducted globally and is planned to include more than 300 sites. Good progress has been made in operationalizing the studies, and initial investigation clinical sites for ENGAGE and EMERGE are now active and screening patients. 
Moving on to our other programs. I'm pleased to mention that they European Medicines Agency has accepted the marketing application of ALPROLIX for the treatment of hemophilia B, signifying the initiation of the review process. Last week, our partner, Sobi, exercised its opt-in right for ALPROLIX to assume final development and commercialization in certain territories, including Europe. 
Our collaborator, Isis Pharmaceuticals, recently presented additional results from the ongoing Phase II studies evaluating SMNrx in infants and children with spinal muscular atrophy. We believe the available data are increasingly supportive of SMNRx having a therapeutic effect. Two Phase III studies for SMNRx are active with enrollment currently ongoing. 
We recently obtained Phase II study results for Neublastin in moderate-to-severe sciatica. The clinical results observed did not achieve our target product profile, and while we've made the decision to terminate this program, developing these areas for pain remains an area of focus for Biogen. We've made good progress advancing development plans of our NAB 1.7 inhibitor acquired from Convergence, and we expect to begin enrolling patients into a Phase III study in neuralgia next year. 
We've also obtained Phase II study results for TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke. Study results did not demonstrate an impact on the change in infarct volume, the primary endpoint of the study. However, secondary and exploratory and points, including the modified Rankin scale evaluating stroke recoveries suggested TYSABRI may have had a beneficial impact on the functional deficits experienced by stroke patients. We believe that the benefit observed, if confirmed, would be clinically meaningful. We're evaluating additional study designs to pursue development of TYSABRI in stroke. 
Earlier this month, we announced a collaboration with AGTC to develop gene therapies in ophthalmology. The collaboration is focused on [indiscernible] associated virus gene therapy, with a goal of developing onetime transformative treatments for XLRS and XLRP. The expansion of our pipeline into these orphan opthalmic indication represents a natural extension of Biogen's focus in neurology. 
Furthermore, through this collaboration, we further bolster Biogen's capability to utilize gene therapy as a therapeutic approach. 
Before I turn the call over to Tony, I want to say that as many of you know, this will be my last earnings call for Biogen. I'll be leaving the company at the end of next week to take on the role of CEO of a new startup company. During the last 4.5 years at Biogen, I've had the opportunity to work with many extraordinary people, and the company has been transformed in many ways. We strengthened the pipeline and put a strong emphasis on discovery science excellence, which will pay off over the coming years. The R&D team is in very capable hands with Al and Spyros, and the company has performed extraordinary science in the labs and in the clinic under their guidance.

Our basic strategy in MS remains the same, to position TECFIDERA as the standard of care in the marketplace, to establish PLEGRIDY as the interferon of choice and to leverage TYSABRI as the leading high-efficacy agent. In light of continued headwinds affecting TECFIDERA, we saw moderated patient growth for MS portfolio as a whole this quarter. 
Our 2015 business plan for TECFIDERA made two important assumptions: first that TECFIDERA would continue to stimulate higher than historical record growth and switch rates as it drives the market from injectables to orals; and second that TECFIDERA with what we believe is a strong all-in profile, would continue to capture high rate of both new starts and switches. Through the second quarter, both of these were weaker than planned, particularly in the more mature and larger markets in the U.S. and Germany. 
In the U.S., total market growth in switch rates remained lower than our original expectations and appeared to have returned to historical averages typically seen in the market before the launch of TECFIDERA. We believe the safety event reported in late 2014 has crated greater caution on the part of both physicians and patients about switching to orals. Our U.S. market research indicates a moderation in physician intent to prescribe, though in Q2, TECFIDERA continued to gain patients in the U.S. We believe our promotional and educational efforts are strong and well-resourced. In the U.S., we remain focused emphasizing T-max strong efficacy profile while ensuring physicians and patients are educated on proper monitoring requirements for leukopenia. And we believe we are making progress. We have recently increased our share of voice across Britain digital media to increase patient awareness and have also ramped up TECFIDERA sales calls by our field teams. 
In more mature markets in Europe such as Germany, TECFIDERA has faced similar dynamics as in the U.S. On a patient basis, this has been offset by robust uptake in newly launched markets such as the U.K., Italy and Spain, where the launch curves to date have mimicked prior experience of very rapid uptake. For example, in the U.K., where a full reimbursement funding really came into place around the turn of the year, we believe the uptake curve through June has actually exceeded what we saw in the U.S. and Germany. While patient growth for Europe as a whole was robust, total European TECFIDERA revenue was dampened both by the change of price and softer demand in Germany. 
In Europe, our promotional strategy is similar to what I described in the U.S., maintaining high region frequency and emphasizing the strong value proposition of the product. However, in Europe, we have been more limited in our ability to educate any new monitoring requirements as we are still waiting for an updated European label. We continue to believe TECFIDERA's competitive profile and believe the product can drive the future patient growth, although at a more moderate rate. Establishing TECFIDERA as the standard of care in MS remains a primary focus, and we will be tireless in those efforts. 
We believe that AVONEX and PLEGRIDY will continue to play an important role and that we are gaining share among interferons. PLEGRIDY has seen steady, early uptake and has continued to source patients broadly. 
TYSABRI continues to set itself apart in the market with an increasing number of alternatives. TYSABRI demonstrated positive patient growth again this quarter, and we believe the strong performance is a testament to the high level of efficacy that TYSABRI provides to patients. 
Finally, in MS, we are gearing up for the potential launch of ZINBRYTA with our collaboration partner, AbbVie. If approved, we believe ZINBRYTA could be an important new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients. 
Turning to our hemophilia business. ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE  continued to grow market share this quarter in the U.S. We continue to broaden both depth of prescribing among physicians and educate the community about the importance of maintaining protection from bleeding with less frequent infusions. Recent market research suggests that the product awareness continues to increase and that the convenience of our products dosing schedules is well appreciated by patients. Outside of the U.S., we have also seen strong initial uptake of ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE in Japan, which we believe is an attractive long-term growth opportunity. 
I'll now pass the call to Paul."

Total revenue for Q2 grew 7% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion. 
Foreign exchange, offset by hedging, [indiscernible] total revenue by approximately $79 million year-over-year. 
Global second quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $883 million, an increase of 26% versus second quarter of last year and an increase of 7% versus the prior quarter. This quarter's TECFIDERA revenues consisted of $721 million in the United States and $163 million outside the U.S. 
U.S. gross-to-net adjustments were lower this quarter than Q1 by approximately 400 basis points. We estimate we ended the quarter with approximately 2.5 weeks of inventory in the U.S. wholesale channel for TECFIDERA at similar level to last quarter. 
In Germany, TECFIDERA sales are being recorded at EUR 12,800, as the prepricing period ended in mid-February. Largely driven by this, ex U.S. TECFIDERA sales decreased 8% versus prior quarter despite unit growth of 14%. 
Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $10 million year-over-year. 
Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $690 million during the second quarter, including $455 million in the U.S. and $235 million in sales outside the U.S. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, U.S. interferon revenues decreased 12%. We estimate that approximately $50 million of the decrease is due to an inventory drawdown in the U.S. wholesale channel. We believe this was the result of rebalancing of inventory subsequent to the launch of PLEGRIDY. 
Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened Q2 interferon revenue by approximately $27 million year-over-year. TYSABRI worldwide revenue was $463 million in Q2. These results were comprised of $269 million in the U.S. and $195 million internationally. 
As a reminder, TYSABRI sales outside the U.S. in the second quarter of 2014 included $54 million of previously deferred revenue related to our AIFA agreement. 
Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $35 million year-over-year. 
Moving to hemophilia. ALPROLIX revenue in Q2 was $54 million, and ELOCTATE revenue was $74 million. Our U.S. profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA as well as our profit share in royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. were $338 million. 
Turning to the expense line on the non-GAAP P&L. Q2 cost of goods sold were $286 million or 11% of revenue. Q2 R&D expense was $491 million or 19% of revenue. 
In Q2, SG&A expense was $492 million or 19% of revenues. Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% for Q2, which benefited by approximately 50 basis points related to a discrete item. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 50-50 between the U.S. and ex-U.S. 
Our weighted average diluted shares at the end of the quarter were 236 million. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $4.22 for the second quarter. 
Let me turn to our updated full year 2015 guidance. We now expect revenue growth between 6% and 8%. This substantial decrease from our prior guidance is primarily driven by a change in our estimate for TECFIDERA's trajectory. Our balance-of-year forecast assumes limited patient growth for TECFIDERA in the United States. 
Additionally, in Europe, overall reimbursement is below our original plan. Our revenue estimates for the rest of our MS portfolio remains largely unchanged. 
Moving to operating expenses. As a percentage of sales, OpEx is unchanged as we work to contain costs for the balance of the year. R&D expense is expected to be between 19% and 20% of revenue, unchanged from prior guidance. Assuming deal closure, we'll book in approximately $40 million expense to R&D in the third quarter related to our collaboration with AGTC. 
SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 20% to 21% of revenue, unchanged from prior guidance you're 
I'd like to point out that we'll -- [indiscernible], a $60 million milestone payment upon dosing of the first patient in the Phase III trials for aducanumab. This payment will be an expense and presented within the noncontrolling interest line in the P&L. We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between $15.50 and $15.95 and GAAP EPS to be between $14.25 and $14.70. 
From a cash perspective, we now expect to pay approximately $850 million in CVR payments in 2015 related to the sales of TECFIDERA, a reduction from prior guidance. 
We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $650 million to $700 million, an increase over 2014 as we continue to expand our manufacturing footprints. 
Included in this forecast is the recently announced agreement related to Eisai's Research Triangle Park campus. 
Overall, we're very disappointed in the change of outlook for the year. Nevertheless, we remain committed to working tirelessly to turn around the commercial performance, and we'll aggressively look for opportunities to reduce expenses while simultaneously ensuring we invest in the pipeline. 
I'll turn the call over to George."

We, obviously, have a lot of work ahead of us as we strive to maximize the success of our commercial business and execute on our Opal goals. 
Over the long term, we expect that the primary source of value creation will be from the introduction of new therapies. So in closing, I'd like to highlight several pipeline programs that may be future value drivers for the company. 
ZINBRYTA is currently under regulatory review as a potential new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients. If approved, we believe that ZINBRYTA could be an interesting addition to our MS portfolio and provide Biogen with an additional treatment option for patients. 
Later this year, we anticipate Phase III results for TYSABRI and secondary progressive MS, disease impacting approximately 30% of MS patients and for which there are no proven effective therapies today. 
We also recently obtained Phase II results suggesting that TYSABRI may improve clinical outcomes in stroke patients and rapidly moving forward to better understand TYSABRI's potential as a poststroke therapy with hopes to offer new potential therapeutic option for the millions of patients experiencing this debilitating condition. The Phase III SMNRx program developed with our partners at Isis Pharmaceuticals represents another important opportunity for Biogen. SMNRx is being developed with the goal of improving and expanding the lives of patients with spinal muscular atrophy. The available clinical results increasingly suggest that SMNRx may indeed be having this effect. We look forward to obtaining Phase III data late next year or in early 2017. 
We're eagerly awaiting the anti-LINGO Phase II MS results next year and expect to provide an update on that AON data at [indiscernible] in the fall. While available MS therapies slow the course of the disease, anti-LINGO as a potential to work with a fundamentally differently by acting as a restorative therapy. And of course, Alzheimer's disease is an area of intense focus for Biogen, with several active clinical programs. In addition to aducanumab, our lead program, we're working with our partner, Eisai, to develop 2401 and E2609 potential disease modifying therapies in Phase II. 
Ban 2401 what is an anti-beta-amyloid antibody, while E2609 is an oral base inhibitor that seeks the block production of amyloid. 
Clinical results are expected for both product candidates next year. And we look forward to providing updates on the progress of our R&D efforts as we continue to advance the pipeline. 
Before I end the call, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Doug Williams' contribution to Biogen. He joined Biogen over 4 years ago and since then has been a great friend and colleague and has done an amazing job helping to invigorate Biogen's R&D. I think the progress that we have made should be obvious to everyone. So as that prepares to leave the company, I'm sad to see him go, but I'm happy for him that he has the opportunity to move to a new role that truly excites him. I want to publicly thank them for all the things he done and wish you all the best in this endeavor. 
Fortunately for us, Doug has helped build a deep team, including physicians and scientists who continue to advance Biogen's R&D efforts. Leadership for the research and development organization will be assumed by Al Sandrock, our Chief Medical Officer; Spyros Artavanis, our Chief Scientific Officer. Both Spyros and Al are talented and accomplished and are confident in the continued success of our R&D organization. 
Finally, as always, I wanted in the mining Biogen employees who contributed to our success. Through good and challenging times, I'm always gratified to see the consistent dedication to patient and shareholders exhibited by our employees might've confident that we'll all continue to work hard to accomplish our ambitious goals.

And related to that, you have a very strong balance sheet. You mentioned the $4.5 billion in cash and marketable securities next to no debt.

On the margin front, I mean, certainly at a point to what the guidance now assumes. I think, from a multi-year perspective, we certainly would still continue to still want to kind of drive towards margin improvement. The dynamics of our margin improvements, obviously, over the next couple of years are going to be a little bit different. As revenue growth has attenuated, we're going to have to work harder to control costs. And I think that we came into this year starting to do that with our SG&A. We are certainly doing that with the balance-of-year forecast, maintaining kind of the OpEx targets as a percentage of sales that effectively assumes not an insignificant pullback in our spending. We're coming off a period that we purposely and, as I've articulated, that we did not want to be penny wise and pound foolish. We have unprecedented number of product launches for our company our size. I think that was the appropriate. And I think we now need to pivot towards making sure any, and always, gets out of the organization. There'll be a very fine, delicate balance because we want to continue to invest in the pipeline. And we will absolutely make that an incredible priority. So we'll navigate through that. It will be a little bit of a challenge, but there's no doubt that we're up to it. With respect to capital allocation, the balance sheet leverage, I think George and I will tagteam on this one now. Certainly, we have a pristine leverage profile and a pristine capital structure. I don't -- as I said before, don't think that should be measured on a quarter in or quarter out basis. But I think this company can, and we would love to have a capital structure that has more debt on it. But if that will be driven by the opportunity to be able to do that as opposed to falsely trying to do that. As people noted, we have authorization from the Board for a $5 billion share repurchase program. We had cautiously communicated that, that would be done within 5 years time. If the stock is under pressure as it was in premarket today, I suspect that we will look for opportunities to lower the share base. And capital allocation is much broader than that, obviously. We'll look -- we continue look for M&A opportunities. They got to be the right thing. They got to be the right value, and I'll let George kind of pick up on that as well."

That is, as I mentioned in the call earlier, that's a primary endpoint for the Phase III study. So I think we're increasingly confident that the data is continuing to be very, very consistent across multiple parameters. We believe that this data is increasingly strong. And we're very confident setting up and starting the Phase III study based on the results we've seen. I mean, I will sort of go back in history and say that the last time that I personally was associated with a study at this stage where the results were this consistent across multiple parameters was back in my ENBREL days. So again, I believe that we have a really firm basis on which to go forward into Phase III. The MMSE data, a little bit of wobble in that. That's the only data point that I can think of across the entire spectrum that didn't just line up almost perfectly.

I guess, it's still early days, but it's certainly been several weeks and the information is out in the market. So we think the market had some chance to absorb it. Look, the first PML case was a pretty significant change statement for the profile of TECFIDERA, given its very kind of pristine safety profile at that time. Our sense is that the second one is a much less significant change statement. The case is within the expected profile, still exceptionally rare. So in discussions that we've had with physicians, with thought leaders, they seem to be -- the appearances is that they're processing that much more straightforwardly. We've also monitored media pickup, social media pickup and things like that and data you've seen, very significantly less reaction on that front. So this feels like a significantly different and more muted reaction to date than the first case. [indiscernible], look, I think consistent with what we've said before, we have seen increasing excitement in the market about ocrelizumab, particularly on special. We don't know the full data. Looks like a product that will play in the high-efficacy space. It's likely to appeal to the kind of specialist, particularly, the TYSABRI user, the RITUXAN user. That, we think, is more of an issue frankly for TYSABRI as it completes in the high efficacy space and probably in a narrower customer, more specialized customer base over time. So we think of that as probably the less relevant to TECFIDERA.

Physicians state that they intend to use more for market research, and they see it as appropriate for broad set of patient types. So in the current environment, that's essentially being why we're doubling down in what's being a small market. The market has been more cautious, and we think a lot of it is on the margin more cautious. But perfect brand like TECFIDERA on the margin matters.

And it's a very small sample size coming out of the current Phase Ib study. What we've seen in terms of the consistency of the response across the doses, I think, has allowed us to do some very nice statistical modeling and make some assumptions about sample size that, obviously, we think will allow us to achieve statistical significance with the sample size, with the increased the duration of dosing because as you recall, from the previous look at the data, the longer your dose, the more amyloid you remove. And what we've shown in the most recent presentation is that there is a very nice correlation between amyloid removal and improvement in cognition. So I think all of these factors have come into play to both size the study and to pick the dose. And I would say that what we're trying to do is to actually push the dose and to push it as high and asked her does we can to remove as much amyloid as possible because we know that, that seems to be an important parameter for efficacy with our drugs. So all of this has been factored into the sample size. And I think we've designed the study now that allows us to take into account the fact that increasing doses work better, increasing duration seems to work better. And stratifying based on ApoE4 status is an important parameter for allowing us to both push those but, at the same time, try to minimize [indiscernible]. I think the up titration is another element to this study that will improve our chances of maximizing the benefit/risk."

In terms of how we view this drug to be used once it's approved, I do think that people will get genotype, and the dose will be based on genotype on whether or not they're ApoE4 carriers. And we'll have to look at the data to see which dose is superior in each of the subgroups, the carriers and noncarriers. And that will probably be the recommended dose. And then the other complication is that there's some aria, whether or not people would dose-reduce because that's what was typically done in the Phase Ib trial. People dose-reduce, most people were able to continue dosing with the dose reduction. So that's sort of how we see it playing out."

On Europe, short answer is basically, mathematically impossible for Europe to be as big as the U.S., given the differential in pricing and, therefore, net revenue for per patient across. You have a big patient population in Europe. As I said, more mature markets like Germany, we believe we've seen dynamics that are a little bit more like the U.S., but launch markets, we're seeing really nice uptick and we believe it's very consistent with what we saw in other launches. So the total dynamic is we have seen that they had good patient growth in Europe. We have had both net price and also FX working against us this year. We are basically through all the major reimbursement decisions at this point, and when all the dust has settled, the net prices we were able to achieve or certainty lower than our aspiration and, I think, what our plan was. We always caution that given how broadly TECFIDERA would be used, you'd have a gravitational pulldown to the platform therapies. And for us, with the pricing and authorities, obviously, was superior efficacy, better profile in the platform that's been a very tough road, though. It was made tougher by Baggio, which was ahead of us and took what was a pretty low-priced strategy that increased the pressure over there. So I think Paul referenced it, and I talked about it in my comments, the net revenue per patient in Europe is just structurally substantially lower than the U.S. and for TECFIDERA specifically, has come out lower than we would certainly have aspired to, given those market dynamics."

There are 2 sets of data, on which most of you have been focused. So let me lead with those issues. 
The first is the commercial trajectory. So versus prior year, we achieved 7% revenue growth and 21% non-GAAP EPS growth, good numbers, but certainly lower than we anticipated a few months ago. We'd expected to see a reacceleration of TECFIDERA this quarter, but that did not happen to any appreciable extent. Rather, TECFIDERA experienced modest sequential patient growth, as we continue to work through the same commercial challenges experienced in the first quarter of the year. We continue to believe that TECFIDERA remains the preferred oral option in the MS market based on its strong efficacy and favorable safety profile, and we're working hard across the organization to improve TECFIDERA's trajectory. 
With that said, our multiple sclerosis portfolio continues to add patients globally. TECFIDERA is the most prescribed oral MS therapy globally and is now being used to treat over 155,000 patients. We believe that PLEGRIDY is on its way to becoming the interferon of choice, as we continue to make it available in new markets around the world. And TYSABRI, which we believe is viewed as the preferred high-efficacy therapy, continue to add patients this quarter.

By now you've all seen the data, which we take to be positive, in line with, in support of the data that we reported earlier. Doug will provide some additional details on this analysis later in the call. 
We've initiated sites for  2 pivotal Phase III trials for aducanumab in early Alzheimer’s disease, and are screening patients for enrollment. Millions of people worldwide living with Alzheimer's disease and no disease modifying treatment options, we believe that this important investment has the potential to be a significant future growth driver for Biogen. 
Moving on to other areas. Our joint venture with Samsung Bioepis, we announced positive results across our anti-TNF biosimilar portfolio at the EULAR conference in June. With these results, we believe that we're well-positioned to bring this widely used anti-TNF therapy to physicians, payers and, ultimately, the patients who need them most next year. 
Just this month, we announced our intent to build a new next-generation manufacturing facility in Solothurn, Switzerland to support our emerging pipeline, a significant step towards ensuring a long-term global supply of new world-class therapies for patients. We expect to break ground on the facility early next year and start manufacturing activities in 2019. 
So we had a busy second quarter, with an important second half of the year ahead of us, and which we'll focus on improving the trajectory of TECFIDERA and ensuring that we execute importing clinical trials to move our pipeline forward as quickly as possible. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Doug, who'll update you all on our progress and R&D."

Earlier this week, at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference, we presented additional interim results from the aducanumab Phase Ib study and subjects with prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease. To remind you, we previously presented results for the 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg patient cohorts at 6 months and 1 year, and for the 6 mg/kg cohort at 6 months. The new results now include 1-year data for 30 subjects treated with 6 mg/kg with aducanumab and for an additional 10 subjects randomized to placebo. 
The 6 mg/kg 1-year results demonstrated the statistically significant reduction on brain beta-amyloid versus placebo, as assessed by PET imaging. The results at 6 months and 1 year show a very strong dose and time-dependent reduction of brain beta-amyloid, and extend our previously reported observations. We observed a numeric improvement on the MMSE and CDR sum of box clinical measures compared to placebo, though the results did not achieve statistical significance. The 6 mg/kg dose at 1 year was intermediate in effect to that scene, with the 3 and 10 mg/kg doses on the CDR score, which will be the primary endpoint for the Phase III program. The safety results were consistent with previously reported results. 
Overall analysis of the 1, 3, 6 and 10 mg/kg clinical results at 1 year demonstrated the statistically significant dose-dependent impact on MMSE and CDR sum of boxes compared to placebo. Additional analysis demonstrated strong, positive correlations between reduction in beta-amyloid levels in both CDR and MMSE scores. We believe that the totality of the aducanumab Phase Ib study results strongly support development and registrational studies. 
Based on feedback from regulatory agencies, we recently finalized the aducanumab Phase III study design. Phase III program includes 2 identically designed placebo-controlled studies referred to as ENGAGE and EMERGE. Each study is expected to include 1,350 subjects with early Alzheimer's disease. Study subjects will be screened by PET amyloid imaging to confirm elevated beta-amyloid plaque levels in the brain. The primary endpoint will be CDR sum of boxes, a clinical measure including both cognitive and functional components measured at 18 months. 
In each Phase III study, ApoE4 noncarriers will be randomized to receive 6 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or placebo, while ApoE4 carriers will receive 3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg or placebo. Study dosing will include an up-titration period in an effort to reduce ARIA and maximize aducanumab's benefit/risk profile. 
The Phase III program will be conducted globally and is planned to include more than 300 sites. Good progress has been made in operationalizing the studies, and initial investigational clinical sites for ENGAGE and EMERGE are now active and screening patients. 
Moving on to our other programs. I'm pleased to mention that the European Medicines Agency has accepted the marketing application of ALPROLIX for the treatment of hemophilia B, signifying the initiation of the review process. Last week, our partner, Sobi, exercised its opt-in right for ALPROLIX to assume final development and commercialization in certain territories, including Europe. 
Our collaborator, Isis Pharmaceuticals, recently presented additional results from the ongoing Phase II studies, evaluating SMNrx in infants and children with spinal muscular atrophy. We believe the available data are increasingly supportive of SMNRx having a therapeutic effect. Two Phase III studies for SMNRx are active, with enrollment currently ongoing. 
We recently obtained Phase II study results for neublastin in moderate-to-severe sciatica. The clinical results observed did not achieve our target product profile. And while we've made the decision to terminate this program, developing these areas for pain remains an area of focus for Biogen. We've made good progress advancing development plans of our Nav 1.7 inhibitor acquired from Convergence, and we expect to begin enrolling patients into a Phase III study in trigeminal neuralgia next year. 
We've also obtained Phase II study results for TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke. Study results did not demonstrate an impact on the change in infarct volume, the primary endpoint of the study. However, secondary and exploratory end points, including the Modified Rankin Scale evaluating stroke recoveries, suggested TYSABRI may have had a beneficial impact on the functional deficits experienced by stroke patients. We believe that the benefit observed, if confirmed, would be clinically meaningful. We're evaluating additional study designs to pursue development of TYSABRI in stroke. 
Earlier this month, we announced a collaboration with AGTC to develop gene therapies in ophthalmology. The collaboration is focused on adeno-associated virus-based gene therapy, with the goal of developing one-time transformative treatments for XLRS and XLRP. The expansion of our pipeline into these orphan opthalmic indication represents a natural extension of Biogen's focus in neurology. 
Furthermore, through this collaboration, we further bolster Biogen's capability to utilize gene therapy as a therapeutic approach. 
Before I turn the call over to Tony, I want to say that, as many of you know, this will be my last earnings call for Biogen. I'll be leaving the company at the end of next week to take on the role of CEO of a new startup company. During the last 4.5 years at Biogen, I've had the opportunity to work with many extraordinary people, and the company has been transformed in many ways. We strengthened the pipeline and put a strong emphasis on discovery science excellence, which will pay off over the coming years. The R&D team is in very capable hands with Al and Spyros, and the company is performing extraordinary science in the labs and in the clinic under their guidance. 
I'd like to think George and my colleagues at Biogen for giving me such a great opportunity, and I look forward to many more successes for the company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony."
29726,306094734,838486,"Biogen Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2015",2015-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Doug. Our basic strategy in MS remains the same, to position TECFIDERA as the standard of care in the marketplace, to establish PLEGRIDY as the interferon of choice and to leverage TYSABRI as the leading high-efficacy agent. In light of continued",724,"Thanks, Doug. Our basic strategy in MS remains the same, to position TECFIDERA as the standard of care in the marketplace, to establish PLEGRIDY as the interferon of choice and to leverage TYSABRI as the leading high-efficacy agent. In light of continued headwinds affecting TECFIDERA, we saw moderated patient growth for MS portfolio as a whole this quarter. 
Our 2015 business plan for TECFIDERA made 2 important assumptions: first, that TECFIDERA would continue to stimulate higher-than-historical market growth and switch rates, as it drives the market from injectables to orals; and second, that TECFIDERA, with what we believe is a strong all-in profile, would continue to capture a high rate of both new starts and switches. Through the second quarter, both of these were weaker than planned, particularly in the more mature and larger markets in the U.S. and Germany. 
In the U.S., total market growth in switch rates remain lower than our original expectations, and appear to have returned to historical averages typically seen in the market before the launch of TECFIDERA. We believe the safety event reported in late 2014 has created greater caution on the part of both physicians and patients about switching to orals. Our U.S. market research indicates a moderation in physician intent to prescribe, though, in Q2, TECFIDERA continued to gain patients in the U.S. We believe our promotional and educational efforts are strong and well-resourced. In the U.S., we remain focused on emphasizing TECFIDERA's strong efficacy profile, while ensuring physicians and patients are educated on proper monitoring requirements for lymphopenia. And we believe we are making progress. We've recently increased our share of voice across print and digital media to increase patient awareness, and have also ramped up TECFIDERA sales calls by our field teams. 
In more mature markets in Europe such as Germany, TECFIDERA has faced similar dynamics, as in the U.S. On a patient basis, this has been offset by robust uptake in newly launched markets such as the U.K., Italy and Spain, where the launch curves to date have mimicked prior experience of very rapid uptake. For example, in the U.K., where a full reimbursement funding really came into place around the turn of the year, we believe the uptake curve through June has actually exceeded what we saw in the U.S. and Germany. While patient growth for Europe as a whole was robust, total European TECFIDERA revenue was dampened both by the change of price and softer demand in Germany. 
In Europe, our promotional strategy is similar to what I described in the U.S., maintaining high region frequency and emphasizing the strong value proposition of the product. However, in Europe, we have been more limited in our ability to educate physicians about any new monitoring requirements, as we are still waiting for an updated European label. We continue to believe TECFIDERA's competitive profile, and believe the product can drive future patient growth, although at a more moderated rate. Establishing TECFIDERA as the standard of care in MS remains a primary focus, and we will be tireless in those efforts. 
We believe that AVONEX and PLEGRIDY will continue to play an important role, and that we are gaining share among interferons. PLEGRIDY has seen steady, early uptake and has continued to source patients broadly. 
TYSABRI continues to set itself apart in the market with an increasing number of alternatives. TYSABRI demonstrated positive patient growth again this quarter, and we believe this strong performance is a testament to the high level of efficacy that TYSABRI provides to patients. 
Finally, in MS, we are gearing up for the potential launch of ZINBRYTA with our collaboration partner, AbbVie. If approved, we believe ZINBRYTA could be an important new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients. 
Turning to our hemophilia business. ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE continue to grow market share this quarter in the U.S. We continue to broaden both breadth and depth of prescribing amongst physicians and educate the community about the importance of maintaining protection from bleeding with less frequent infusions. Recent market research suggests that the product awareness continues to increase, and that the convenience of our products dosing schedules is well-appreciated by patients. Outside of the U.S., we have also seen strong initial uptake of ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE in Japan, which we believe is an attractive long-term growth opportunity. 
I'll now pass the call to Paul."
29726,306094734,838486,"Biogen Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2015",2015-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.93 in the second quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.22. Total revenue for Q2 grew 7% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion. Foreign exchange, offset by hedging, weake",819,"Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.93 in the second quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.22. Total revenue for Q2 grew 7% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion. 
Foreign exchange, offset by hedging, weakened total revenue by approximately $79 million year-over-year. 
Global second quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $883 million, an increase of 26% versus second quarter of last year and an increase of 7% versus the prior quarter. This quarter's TECFIDERA revenues consisted of $721 million in the United States and $163 million outside the U.S. 
U.S. gross-to-net adjustments were lower this quarter than Q1 by approximately 400 basis points. We estimate we ended the quarter with approximately 2.5 weeks of inventory in the U.S. wholesale channel for TECFIDERA at similar level to last quarter. 
In Germany, TECFIDERA sales are being recorded at EUR 12,800, as the prepricing period ended in mid-February. Largely driven by this, ex-U.S. TECFIDERA sales decreased 8% versus prior quarter despite unit growth of 14%. 
Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $10 million year-over-year. 
Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $690 million during the second quarter, including $455 million in the U.S. and $235 million in sales outside the U.S. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, U.S. interferon revenues decreased 12%. We estimate that approximately $50 million of the decrease is due to an inventory drawdown in the U.S. wholesale channel. We believe this was the result of rebalancing of inventory subsequent to the launch of PLEGRIDY. 
Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened Q2 interferon revenue by approximately $27 million year-over-year. TYSABRI worldwide revenue was $463 million in Q2. These results were comprised of $269 million in the U.S. and $195 million internationally. 
As a reminder, TYSABRI sales outside the U.S. in the second quarter of 2014 included $54 million of previously deferred revenue related to our AIFA agreement. 
Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $35 million year-over-year. 
Moving to hemophilia. ALPROLIX revenue in Q2 was $54 million, and ELOCTATE revenue was $74 million. Our U.S. profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA as well as our profit share in royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. were $338 million. 
Turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q2 cost of goods sold were $286 million or 11% of revenue. Q2 R&D expense was $491 million or 19% of revenue. 
In Q2, SG&A expense was $492 million or 19% of revenues. Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% for Q2, which benefited by approximately 50 basis points related to a discrete item. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 50-50 between the U.S. and ex-U.S. 
Our weighted average diluted shares at the end of the quarter were 236 million. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $4.22 for the second quarter. 
Let me turn to our updated full year 2015 guidance. We now expect revenue growth between 6% and 8%. This substantial decrease from our prior guidance is primarily driven by a change in our estimate for TECFIDERA's trajectory. Our balance-of-year forecast assumes limited patient growth for TECFIDERA in the United States. 
Additionally, in Europe, overall reimbursement is below our original plan. Our revenue estimates for the rest of our MS portfolio remain largely unchanged. 
Moving to operating expenses. As a percentage of sales, OpEx is unchanged as we work to contain costs for the balance of the year. R&D expense is expected to be between 19% and 20% of revenue, unchanged from prior guidance. Assuming deal closure, we'll book in approximately $40 million expense to R&D in the third quarter related to our collaboration with AGTC. 
SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 20% to 21% of revenue, unchanged from prior guidance. 
I'd like to point out that we'll own Neurimmune, a $60 million milestone payment upon dosing of the first patient in the Phase III trials for aducanumab. This payment will be an expense and presented within the noncontrolling interest line in the P&L. We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between $15.50 and $15.95 and GAAP EPS to be between $14.25 and $14.70. 
From a cash perspective, we now expect to pay approximately $850 million in CVR payments in 2015 related to the sales of TECFIDERA, a reduction from prior guidance. 
We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $650 million to $700 million, an increase over 2014, as we continue to expand our manufacturing footprints. 
Included in this forecast is the recently announced agreement related to Eisai's Research Triangle Park campus. 
Overall, we're very disappointed in the change of outlook for the year. Nevertheless, we remain committed to working tirelessly to turn around the commercial performance. And we'll aggressively look for opportunities to reduce expenses while simultaneously ensuring we invest in the pipeline. 
I'll turn the call over to George."

Look, we obviously have a lot of work ahead of us, as we strive to maximize the success of our commercial business and execute on our operational goals. 
Over the long term, we expect that the primary source of value creation will be from the introduction of new therapies. So in closing, I'd like to highlight several pipeline programs that may be future value drivers for the company. 
ZINBRYTA is currently under regulatory review as a potential new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients. If approved, we believe that ZINBRYTA could be an interesting addition to our MS portfolio and provide Biogen with an additional treatment option for patients. 
Later this year, we anticipate Phase III results for TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS, a form of the disease impacting approximately 30% of MS patients, and for which there are no proven effective therapies today. 
We also recently obtained Phase II results suggesting that TYSABRI may improve clinical outcomes in stroke patients. And we're rapidly moving forward to better understand TYSABRI's potential as a post-stroke therapy, with hopes to offer new potential therapeutic option for the millions of patients experiencing this debilitating condition. The Phase III SMNRx program developed with our partners at Isis Pharmaceuticals represents another important opportunity for Biogen. SMNRx is being developed with the goal of improving and extending the lives of patients with spinal muscular atrophy. The available clinical results increasingly suggest that SMNRx may indeed be having this effect. We look forward to obtaining Phase III data late next year or in early 2017. 
We're eagerly awaiting the anti-LINGO Phase II MS results next year, and expect to provide an update on the AON data at ACTRIMS in the fall. While available MS therapies slow the course of the disease, anti-LINGO has the potential to work in a fundamentally differently way by acting as a restorative therapy. And of course, Alzheimer's disease is an area of intense focus for Biogen with several active clinical programs. In addition to aducanumab, our lead program, we're working with our partner, Eisai, to develop BAN2401 and E2609 potential disease-modifying therapies in Phase II. 
BAN2401 is an anti-beta-amyloid antibody, while E2609 is an oral BACE inhibitor that seeks to block the production of amyloid plaque.
Clinical results are expected for both product candidates next year. And we look forward to providing updates on the progress of our R&D efforts as we continue to advance the pipeline. 
Before I end the call, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Doug Williams' contribution to Biogen. Doug joined Biogen over 4 years ago and, since then, has been a great friend and colleague, and has done an amazing job helping to invigorate Biogen's R&D. I think the progress that we've made should be obvious to everyone. So as Doug prepares to leave the company, I'm sad to see him go, but I'm happy for him that he has the opportunity to move to a new role that truly excites him. I want to publicly thank Doug for all that he's done, and wish him all the best in his next endeavor. 
Fortunately, for us, Doug has helped build a deep team, including lots of physicians and scientists, who continue to advance Biogen's R&D efforts. Leadership for the research and development organization will be assumed by Al Sandrock, our Chief Medical Officer; Spyros Artavanis, our Chief Scientific Officer. Both Spyros and Al are extremely talented and accomplished, and I'm confident in the continued success of our R&D organization. 
Finally, as always, I want to thank the many Biogen employees who contributed to our success. Through good and challenging times, I'm always gratified to see the consistent dedication to patients and shareholders exhibited by our employees. And I'm confident that we'll all continue to work hard to accomplish our ambitious goals. 
So with that, we'll end the call and open it up for questions."

On the margin front, I mean, certainly, I'd point to what the guidance now assumes. I think from a multi-year perspective, we certainly would still -- continue to still want to kind of drive towards margin improvement. The dynamics of our margin improvements, obviously, over the next couple of years are going to be a little bit different. As the revenue growth has attenuated, we're going to have to work harder to control costs. And I think that we came into this year starting to do that with our SG&A. We are certainly doing that with the balance-of-year forecast, maintaining kind of the OpEx targets as a percentage of sales that effectively assumes not an insignificant pullback in our spending. We're coming off a period that we purposely and, as I've articulated, that we did not want to be penny-wise and pound-foolish. We had unprecedented number of product launches for a company our size. I think that was the appropriate. And I think we now need to pivot towards making sure any -- and always gets out of the organization. There'll be a very fine, delicate balance because we want to continue to invest in the pipeline. And we will absolutely make that an incredible priority. So we'll navigate through that. It will be a little bit of a challenge, but there's no doubt that we're up to it. With respect to capital allocation, the balance sheet leverage, I think George and I will tag-team this one now. Certainly, we have a pristine leverage profile and a pristine capital structure. I don't -- as I said before, don't think that should be measured on a quarter-in or quarter-out basis. But I think this company can, and we would love to have a capital structure that has more debt on it, but if that will be driven by the opportunity to be able to do that as opposed to falsely trying to do that. As people noted, we have authorization from the board for a $5 billion share repurchase program. We had cautiously communicated that, that would be done within 5 years time. If the stock is under pressure, as it was in premarket today, I suspect that we will look for opportunities to lower the share base. And capital allocation is much broader than that, obviously. We'll look -- we continue look for M&A opportunities. They have to be the right thing. They have to be the right value. And I'll let George kind of pick up on that as well."

That is -- as I mentioned in the call earlier, that's a primary endpoint for the Phase III study. So I think we're increasingly confident that the data is continuing to be very, very consistent across multiple parameters. We believe that this data is increasingly strong. And we're very confident setting up and starting the Phase III study based on the results we've seen. I mean, I will sort of go back in history and say that the last time that I personally was associated with a study at this stage, where the results were this consistent across multiple parameters, was back in my ENBREL days. So again, I believe that we have a really firm basis on which to go forward into Phase III. The MMSE data, a little bit of wobble in that. That's the only data point that I can think of across the entire spectrum that didn't just line up almost perfectly.

I guess, it's still early days, but it's certainly been several weeks, and the information is out in the market. So we think the markets had some chance to absorb it. Look, the first PML case was a pretty significant change statement for the profile of TECFIDERA, given its very kind of pristine safety profile at the time. Our sense is that the second one is a much less significant change statement. The case is within the expected profile, still exceptionally rare. So in discussions that we've had with physicians, with thought leaders, they seem to be -- the appearance is that they are processing that much more straightforwardly. We've also monitored media pickup, social media pickup, other things like that, and to date have seen very significantly less reaction on that front. So this feels like a significantly different and more muted reaction to date than the first case. Ocrelizumab, look, I think consistent with what we've said before, we have seen increasing excitement in the market about ocrelizumab, particularly on specialists. We don't know the full data. It looks like a product that will play in the high-efficacy space. It's likely to appeal to the kind of specialists, particularly, the TYSABRI user, the RITUXAN user. That, we think, is more of an issue, frankly, for TYSABRI as it completes in the high-efficacy space and probably in a narrower customer, more specialized customer base over time. So we think of that as probably the less relevant to TECFIDERA. Look, in terms of TECFIDERA's long-term profile, which is where you'd ask that, I'll say, to date, when we look at our market research, the indicators and the leading indicators of brain health, we believe, continue to be pretty favorable, right? Our market research says the benefit/risk profile has changed, but we believe it's still overall very positive. It's the most requested product by patients based on our research. Physicians state that they intend to use more, again, ultra-market research, and they see it as appropriate for a broad set of patient types. So in the current environment, that's essentially why we're doubling down in what's been a small market. The market has been more cautious, and we think a lot of it is on the margin, more cautious, but for a big brand like TECFIDERA on the margin matters. So reach and frequency, patient outreach and emphasizing the benefits of the product continue to be where we'll put our efforts."

I'm still blushing from Mark's comments, but I'll try to answer the question on SPMS. As you pointed out, it was kind of important to get SPA approval prior to starting because this is the first time the drug would be approved using a new composite measure of disability progression. And so that's why it was important to get a SPA agreement. And this composite measure, I think whether or not the drug gets approved, it's going to rest almost entirely on whether or not the drug is statistically significant on this measure, which -- by the way this measure has the EDSS standard, EDSS 1-point change that we've been using for a long time in relapsing MS, but also in addition has 2 other pieces, the 9-Hole Peg Test, a certain percentage change in the 9-Hole Peg Test as well as the Timed 25-Foot Walk. So we believe that increases the sensitivity to change. So we will see disability progression better, and therefore increased chances that TYSABRI will show a treatment effect."

And it's a very small sample size coming out of the current Phase Ib study. But what we've seen in terms of consistency of response across the doses, I think, has allowed us to do some very nice statistical modeling and make some assumptions about sample size that obviously we think will allow us to achieve statistical significance with the sample size, with the increased duration of dosing because as you recall, from the previous look at the data, the longer you dose, the more amyloid you remove. And what we've shown in the most recent presentation is that there is a very nice correlation between amyloid removal and improvement in cognition. So I think all of these factors have come into play to both size the study and to pick the dose. And I would say that what we're trying to do is to actually push the dose and to push it as high and as hard as we can to remove as much amyloid as possible because we know that, that seems to be an important parameter for efficacy with our drugs. So all of this has been factored into the sample size. And I think we've designed the study now that allows us to take into account the fact that increasing doses work better, increasing durations seem to work better. And stratifying based on ApoE4 status is an important parameter for allowing us to both push the does, but at the same time try to minimize ARIA. And I think the up-titration is another element to this study that will improve our chances of maximizing the benefit/risk."

And so I think we're pretty confident, using this sample size, that we will achieve a statistical significance. In terms of how we view this drug to be used once it's approved, I do think that people will get genotype, and the dose will be based on genotype on whether or not they're ApoE4 carriers. And then we'll have to look at the data to see which dose is superior in each of the subgroups, the carriers and noncarriers. And that will probably be the recommended dose. And then the other complication is if there's some ARIA, whether or not people would dose-reduce, because that's what was typically done in the Phase Ib trial. People dose-reduced, then most people were able to continue dosing with the dose reduction. So that's sort of how I see it playing out."

On Europe, the short answer is basically mathematically impossible for Europe to be as big as the U.S., given the differential in pricing, and therefore net revenue per patient across. You have a big patient population in Europe. As I said, more mature markets like Germany, we believe we've seen dynamics that are a little bit more like the U.S. But launch markets, we're seeing really nice uptake, and we believe it's very consistent with what we saw in the other launches. So the total dynamic is we have seen that they have good patient growth in Europe. We have had both net price and also FX working against us this year. We are basically through all the major reimbursement decisions at this point. And when all the dust has settled, the net prices we were able to achieve or they were certainty lower than our aspiration and, I think, what our plan was. We always caution that given how broadly TECFIDERA would be used, you'd have a gravitational pull-down to the platform therapies. So then, for us, with the pricing authorities, obviously with superior efficacy, better profiles, better platforms, that's been a very tough row to hoe. It was made tougher by AUBAGIO, which went ahead of us and took what was a pretty low-priced strategy that increased the pressure over there. So I think Paul referenced it, and I talked about in my comments, the net revenue per patient in Europe is just structurally substantially lower than the U.S. And for TECFIDERA specifically, it has come out lower than we would certainly have aspired to, given those market dynamics."

Your question goes to another thing, which is are we going to be sort of using this as a biomarker in the clinic when it's approved? And will there be some sort of threshold effect being used in the clinic? And I think it's far too early to speculate on that. I think it might go to that part, but I would not say that this one standard deviation unit that we chose to look at would be that threshold.

Again, I think we'll have more clarity on that once we actually begin enrolling patients. But for the moment, I think we'll simply say that, that is based on a variety of parameters, primarily that there are 2 things we know correlate with the incidence of ARIA. One is obviously dose, so a lower dose as a lower incidence of ARIA. And the second is time. Most of the ARIA occurs during the first 5 doses of administration. So the hypothesis that is being tested right now with this cohort you mentioned is whether or not at a lower dose for a period of time, you can get through this period of risk, I'll call it, for developing ARIA and end up with a lower overall incident on your way up to the final dose.

There are 2 sets of data, on which most of you have been focused. So let me lead with those issues. 
The first is the commercial trajectory. So versus prior year, we achieved 7% revenue growth and 21% non-GAAP EPS growth, good numbers, but certainly lower than we had anticipated a few months ago. We'd expected to see a reacceleration of TECFIDERA this quarter, but that did not happen to any appreciable extent. Rather, TECFIDERA experienced modest sequential patient growth, as we continued to work through the same commercial challenges experienced in the first quarter of the year. We continue to believe that TECFIDERA remains the preferred oral option in the MS market based on its strong efficacy and favorable safety profile, and we're working hard across the organization to improve TECFIDERA's trajectory. 
With that said, our multiple sclerosis portfolio continues to add patients globally. TECFIDERA is the most prescribed oral MS therapy globally and has now been used to treat over 155,000 patients. We believe that PLEGRIDY is on its way to becoming the interferon of choice, as we continue to make it available in new markets around the world. And TYSABRI, which we believe is viewed as the preferred high-efficacy therapy, continued to add patients this quarter. 
Second development was the recent announcement of a new data from aducanumab Phase Ib study at AAIC. By now you've all seen the data, which we take to be positive, in line with, and supportive of the data that we reported earlier. Doug will provide some additional details on this analysis later in the call. 
We've initiated sites for  2 pivotal Phase III trials for aducanumab in early Alzheimer’s disease, and are screening patients for enrollment. Millions of people worldwide living with Alzheimer's disease and no disease modifying treatment options, we believe that this important investment has the potential to be a significant future growth driver for Biogen. 
Moving on to other areas. Through our joint venture with Samsung Bioepis, we announced positive results across our anti-TNF biosimilar portfolio at the EULAR conference in June. With these results, we believe that we're well-positioned to bring these widely used anti-TNF therapies to physicians, payers and, ultimately, to the patients who need them most next year. 
Just this month, we announced our intent to build a new next-generation manufacturing facility in Solothurn, Switzerland to support our emerging pipeline, a significant step towards ensuring a long-term global supply of new world-class therapies for patients. We expect to break ground on the facility early next year and start manufacturing activities in 2019. 
So we had a busy second quarter, with an important second half of the year ahead of us, in which we'll focus on improving the trajectory of TECFIDERA and ensuring that we execute importing clinical trials to move our pipeline forward as quickly as possible. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Doug, who'll update you all on our progress on R&D."

Earlier this week, at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference, we presented additional interim results from the aducanumab Phase Ib study in subjects with prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease. To remind you, we previously",947,"Thanks, George. Earlier this week, at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference, we presented additional interim results from the aducanumab Phase Ib study in subjects with prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease. To remind you, we previously presented results for the 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg patient cohorts at 6 months and 1 year, and for the 6 mg/kg cohort at 6 months. The new results now include 1-year data for 30 subjects treated with 6 mg/kg of aducanumab and for an additional 10 subjects randomized to placebo. 
The 6 mg/kg 1-year results demonstrated a statistically significant reduction on brain beta-amyloid levels versus placebo, as assessed by PET imaging. The results at 6 months and 1 year show a very strong dose and time-dependent reduction of brain beta-amyloid, and extend our previously reported observations. We observed a numeric improvement on the MMSE and CDR sum of box clinical measures compared to placebo, though the results did not achieve statistical significance. The 6 mg/kg dose at 1 year was intermediate in effect to that seen with the 3 and 10 mg/kg doses on the CDR score, which will be the primary endpoint for the Phase III program. The safety results were consistent with previously reported results. 
Overall analysis of the 1, 3, 6 and 10 mg/kg clinical results at 1 year demonstrated a statistically significant dose-dependent impact on MMSE and CDR sum of boxes compared to placebo. Additional analysis demonstrated strong, positive correlations between reduction in beta-amyloid levels in both CDR and MMSE scores. We believe that the totality of the aducanumab Phase Ib study results strongly support development and registrational studies. 
Based on feedback from regulatory agencies, we've recently finalized the aducanumab Phase III study design. The Phase III program includes 2 identically designed placebo-controlled studies referred to as ENGAGE and EMERGE. Each study is expected to include 1,350 subjects with early Alzheimer's disease. Study subjects will be screened by PET amyloid imaging to confirm elevated beta-amyloid plaque levels in the brain. The primary endpoint will be CDR sum of boxes, a clinical measure including both cognitive and functional components measured at 18 months. 
In each Phase III study, ApoE4 noncarriers will be randomized to receive 6 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or placebo, while ApoE4 carriers will receive 3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg or placebo. Study dosing will include an up-titration period in an effort to reduce ARIA and maximize aducanumab's benefit/risk profile. 
The Phase III program will be conducted globally and is planned to include more than 300 sites. Good progress has been made in operationalizing the studies, and initial investigational clinical sites for ENGAGE and EMERGE are now active and screening patients. 
Moving on to our other programs. I'm pleased to mention that the European Medicines Agency has accepted the marketing application of ALPROLIX for the treatment of hemophilia B, signifying the initiation of the review process. Last week, our partner, Sobi, exercised its opt-in right for ALPROLIX to assume final development and commercialization in certain territories, including Europe. 
Our collaborator, Isis Pharmaceuticals, recently presented additional results from the ongoing Phase II studies, evaluating SMNrx in infants and children with spinal muscular atrophy. We believe the available data are increasingly supportive of SMNRx having a therapeutic effect. Two Phase III studies for SMNRx are active, with enrollment currently ongoing. 
We recently obtained Phase II study results for neublastin in moderate-to-severe sciatica. The clinical results observed did not achieve our target product profile. And while we've made the decision to terminate this program, developing new therapies [ph] for pain remains an area of focus for Biogen. We've made good progress advancing development plans of our Nav 1.7 inhibitor acquired from Convergence, and we expect to begin enrolling patients into a Phase III study in trigeminal neuralgia next year. 
We've also obtained Phase II study results for TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke. Study results did not demonstrate an impact on the change in infarct volume, the primary endpoint of the study. However, secondary and exploratory end points, including the Modified Rankin Scale evaluating stroke recoveries, suggest that TYSABRI may have had a beneficial impact on the functional deficits experienced by stroke patients. We believe that the benefit observed, if confirmed, would be clinically meaningful. We're evaluating additional study designs to pursue development of TYSABRI in stroke. 
Earlier this month, we announced a collaboration with AGTC to develop gene therapies in ophthalmology. The collaboration is focused on adeno-associated virus-based gene therapy, with the goal of developing one-time transformative treatments for XLRS and XLRP. The expansion of our pipeline into these orphan opthalmic indications represents a natural extension of Biogen's focus in neurology. 
Furthermore, through this collaboration, we further bolstered Biogen's capability to utilize gene therapy as a therapeutic approach. 
Before I turn the call over to Tony, I want to say that, as many of you know, this will be my last earnings call for Biogen. I'll be leaving the company at the end of next week to take on the role of CEO of a new startup company. During the last 4.5 years at Biogen, I've had the opportunity to work with many extraordinary people, and the company has been transformed in many ways. We've strengthened the pipeline and put a strong emphasis on discovery science excellence, which will pay off over the coming years. The R&D team is in very capable hands with Al and Spyros, and the company is performing extraordinary science in the labs and in the clinic under their guidance. 
I'd like to thank George and my colleagues at Biogen for giving me such a great opportunity, and I look forward to many more successes for the company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony."
29726,306094734,838586,"Biogen Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2015",2015-07-24,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Doug. Our basic strategy in MS remains the same, to position TECFIDERA as the standard of care in the marketplace, to establish PLEGRIDY as the interferon of choice and to leverage TYSABRI as the leading high-efficacy agent. In light of continued",724,"Thanks, Doug. Our basic strategy in MS remains the same, to position TECFIDERA as the standard of care in the marketplace, to establish PLEGRIDY as the interferon of choice and to leverage TYSABRI as the leading high-efficacy agent. In light of continued headwinds affecting TECFIDERA, we saw moderated patient growth for our MS portfolio as a whole this quarter. 
Our 2015 business plan for TECFIDERA made 2 important assumptions: first, that TECFIDERA would continue to stimulate higher-than-historical market growth and switch rates as it drives the market from injectables to orals; and second, that TECFIDERA, with what we believe is a strong all-in profile, would continue to capture a high rate of both new starts and switches. Through the second quarter, both of these were weaker than planned, particularly in the more mature and larger markets in the U.S. and Germany. 
In the U.S., total market growth and switch rates remain lower than our original expectations, and appear to have returned to historical averages typically seen in the market before the launch of TECFIDERA. We believe the safety event reported in late 2014 has created greater caution on the part of both physicians and patients about switching to orals. Our U.S. market research indicates a moderation in physician intent to prescribe, though, in Q2, TECFIDERA continued to gain patients in the U.S. We believe our promotional and educational efforts are strong and well-resourced. In the U.S., we remain focused on emphasizing TECFIDERA's strong efficacy profile, while ensuring physicians and patients are educated on proper monitoring requirements for lymphopenia. And we believe we are making progress. We've recently increased our share of voice across print and digital media to increase patient awareness, and have also ramped up TECFIDERA sales calls by our field teams. 
In more mature markets in Europe such as Germany, TECFIDERA has faced similar dynamics, as in the U.S. On a patient basis, this has been offset by robust uptake in newly launched markets such as the U.K., Italy and Spain, where the launch curves to date have mimicked prior experience of very rapid uptake. For example, in the U.K., where full reimbursement funding really came into place around the turn of the year, we believe the uptake curve through June has actually exceeded what we saw in the U.S. and Germany. While patient growth for Europe as a whole was robust, total European TECFIDERA revenue was dampened both by the change of price and softer demand in Germany. 
In Europe, our promotional strategy is similar to what I described in the U.S., maintaining high region frequency and emphasizing the strong value proposition of the product. However, in Europe, we have been more limited in our ability to educate physicians about any new monitoring requirements, as we are still waiting for an updated European label. We continue to believe TECFIDERA's competitive profile, and believe the product can drive future patient growth, although at a more moderated rate. Establishing TECFIDERA as the standard of care in MS remains a primary focus, and we will be tireless in those efforts. 
We believe that AVONEX and PLEGRIDY will continue to play an important role, and that we are gaining share among interferons. PLEGRIDY has seen steady, early uptake and has continued to source patients broadly. 
TYSABRI continues to set itself apart in the market with an increasing number of alternatives. TYSABRI demonstrated positive patient growth again this quarter, and we believe this strong performance is a testament to the high level of efficacy that TYSABRI provides to patients. 
Finally, in MS, we are gearing up for the potential launch of ZINBRYTA with our collaboration partner, AbbVie. If approved, we believe ZINBRYTA could be an important new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients. 
Turning to our hemophilia business. ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE continued to grow market share this quarter in the U.S. We continue to broaden both breadth and depth of prescribing amongst physicians and educate the community about the importance of maintaining protection from bleeding with less frequent infusions. Recent market research suggests that the product awareness continues to increase, and that the convenience of our product's dosing schedules is well-appreciated by patients. Outside of the U.S., we have also seen strong initial uptake of ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE in Japan, which we believe is an attractive long-term growth opportunity. 
I'll now pass the call to Paul."

Total revenue for Q2 grew 7% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion. 
Foreign exchange, offset by hedging, weakened total revenue by approximately $79 million year-over-year. 
Global second quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $883 million, an increase of 26% versus second quarter of last year and an increase of 7% versus the prior quarter. This quarter's TECFIDERA revenues consisted of $721 million in the United States and $163 million outside the U.S. 
U.S. gross-to-net adjustments were lower this quarter than Q1 by approximately 400 basis points. We estimate we ended the quarter with approximately 2.5 weeks of inventory in the U.S. wholesale channel for TECFIDERA, a similar level to last quarter. 
In Germany, TECFIDERA sales are being recorded at EUR 12,800, as the free pricing period ended in mid-February. Largely driven by this, ex-U.S. TECFIDERA sales decreased 8% versus prior quarter despite unit growth of 14%. 
Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $10 million year-over-year. 
Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $690 million during the second quarter, including $455 million in the U.S. and $235 million in sales outside the U.S. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, U.S. interferon revenues decreased 12%. We estimate that approximately $50 million of the decrease is due to an inventory drawdown in the U.S. wholesale channel. We believe this was the result of rebalancing of inventory subsequent to the launch of PLEGRIDY. 
Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened Q2 interferon revenue by approximately $27 million year-over-year. TYSABRI worldwide revenue was $463 million in Q2. These results were comprised of $269 million in the U.S. and $195 million internationally. 
As a reminder, TYSABRI sales outside the U.S. in the second quarter of 2014 included $54 million of previously deferred revenue related to our AIFA agreement. 
Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $35 million year-over-year. 
Moving to hemophilia. ALPROLIX revenue in Q2 was $54 million, and ELOCTATE revenue was $74 million. Our U.S. profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA as well as our profit share and royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. were $338 million. 
Turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q2 cost of goods sold were $286 million or 11% of revenue. Q2 R&D expense was $491 million or 19% of revenue. 
In Q2, SG&A expense was $492 million or 19% of revenues. Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% for Q2, which benefited by approximately 50 basis points related to a discrete item. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 50-50 between the U.S. and ex-U.S. 
Our weighted average diluted shares at the end of the quarter were 236 million. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $4.22 for the second quarter. 
Let me turn to our updated full year 2015 guidance. We now expect revenue growth between 6% and 8%. This substantial decrease from our prior guidance is primarily driven by a change in our estimate for TECFIDERA's trajectory. Our balance-of-year forecast assumes limited patient growth for TECFIDERA in the United States. 
Additionally, in Europe, overall reimbursement is below our original plan. Our revenue estimates for the rest of our MS portfolio remain largely unchanged. 
Moving to operating expenses. As a percentage of sales, OpEx is unchanged as we work to contain costs for the balance of the year. R&D expense is expected to be between 19% and 20% of revenue, unchanged from prior guidance. Assuming deal closure, we'll book an approximately $40 million expense to R&D in the third quarter related to our collaboration with AGTC. 
SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 20% to 21% of revenue, unchanged from prior guidance. 
I'd like to point out that we'll owe Neurimmune, a $60 million milestone payment upon dosing of the first patient in the Phase III trials for aducanumab. This payment will be an expense and presented within the noncontrolling interest line in the P&L. We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between $15.50 and $15.95 and GAAP EPS to be between $14.25 and $14.70. 
From a cash perspective, we now expect to pay approximately $850 million in CVR payments in 2015 related to the sales of TECFIDERA, a reduction from prior guidance. 
We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $650 million to $700 million, an increase over 2014, as we continue to expand our manufacturing footprints. 
Included in this forecast is the recently announced agreement related to Eisai's Research Triangle Park campus. 
Overall, we're very disappointed in the change of outlook for the year. Nevertheless, we remain committed to working tirelessly to turn around the commercial performance. And we'll aggressively look for opportunities to reduce expenses while simultaneously ensuring we invest in the pipeline. 
I'll turn the call over to George."

Look, we obviously have a lot of work ahead of us, as we strive to maximize the success of our commercial business and execute on our operational goals. 
Over the long term, we expect that the primary source of value creation will be from the introduction of new therapies. So in closing, I'd like to highlight several pipeline programs that may be future value drivers for the company. 
ZINBRYTA is currently under regulatory review as a potential new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients. If approved, we believe that ZINBRYTA could be an interesting addition to our MS portfolio and provide Biogen with an additional treatment option for patients. 
Later this year, we anticipate Phase III results for TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS, a form of the disease impacting approximately 30% of MS patients, and for which there are no proven effective therapies today. 
We also recently obtained Phase II results suggesting that TYSABRI may improve clinical outcomes in stroke patients. And we're rapidly moving forward to better understand TYSABRI's potential as a post-stroke therapy with hopes to offer new potential therapeutic option for the millions of patients experiencing this debilitating condition. The Phase III SMNRx program developed with our partners at Isis Pharmaceuticals represents another important opportunity for Biogen. SMNRx is being developed with the goal of improving and extending the lives of patients with spinal muscular atrophy. The available clinical results increasingly suggest that SMNRx may indeed be having this effect. We look forward to obtaining Phase III data late next year or in early 2017. 
We're eagerly awaiting the anti-LINGO Phase II MS results next year, and expect to provide an update on the AON data at ACTRIMS in the fall. While available MS therapies slow the course of the disease, anti-LINGO has the potential to work in a fundamentally differently way by acting as a restorative therapy. And of course, Alzheimer's disease is an area of intense focus for Biogen with several active clinical programs. In addition to aducanumab, our lead program, we're working with our partner, Eisai, to develop BAN2401 and E2609 potential disease-modifying therapies in Phase II. 
BAN2401 is an anti-beta-amyloid antibody, while E2609 is an oral BACE inhibitor that seeks to block the production of amyloid plaque.
Clinical results are expected for both product candidates next year. And we look forward to providing updates on the progress of our R&D efforts as we continue to advance the pipeline. 
Before I end the call, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Doug Williams' contributions to Biogen. Doug joined Biogen over 4 years ago and, since then, has been a great friend and colleague, and has done an amazing job helping to invigorate Biogen's R&D. I think that the progress that we've made should be obvious to everyone. So as Doug prepares to leave the company, I'm sad to see him go, but I'm happy for him that he has the opportunity to move to a new role that truly excites him. I want to publicly thank Doug for all that he's done, and wish him all the best in his next endeavor. 
Fortunately, for us, Doug has helped build a deep team, including [indiscernible] physicians and scientists, who will continue to advance Biogen's R&D efforts. Leadership for the research and development organization will be assumed by Al Sandrock, our Chief Medical Officer; Spyros Artavanis, our Chief Scientific Officer. Both Spyros and Al are extremely talented and accomplished, and I'm confident in the continued success of our R&D organization. 
Finally, as always, I want to thank the many Biogen employees who've contributed to our success. Through good and challenging times, I'm always gratified to see the consistent dedication to patients and shareholders exhibited by our employees. And I'm confident that we'll all continue to work hard to accomplish our ambitious goals. 
So with that, we'll end the call and open it up for questions."

Paul, I wanted to ask you a question, first about margins and on a related basis about capital allocation. As you've had the chance now to look at this revised guidance and the outlook for the core business and then the various clinical trials that you're planning, what confidence do you have that 48% to 49% operating margin that you have today can be maintained over the next 2 to 3 years? And related to that, you have a very strong balance sheet. You mentioned the $4.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, next to no debt. Some of your competitors have used their balance sheet quite effectively, and we're wondering are you contemplating that? Would you take on leverage? If so, how much? And what are your capital allocation priorities now?"

On the margin front, I mean, certainly, I'd point to what the guidance now assumes. I think from a multi-year perspective, we certainly would still -- continue to still want to kind of drive towards margin improvement. The dynamics of our margin improvements, obviously, over the next couple of years are going to be a little bit different. As the revenue growth has attenuated, we're going to have to work harder to control costs. And I think that we came into this year starting to do that with our SG&A. We are certainly doing that with the balance-of-year forecast, maintaining kind of the OpEx targets as a percentage of sales that effectively assumes not an insignificant pullback in our spending. We're coming off a period that we purposely and, as I've articulated, that we did not want to be penny-wise and pound-foolish. We had an unprecedented number of product launches for a company our size. I think that was the appropriate. And I think we now need to pivot towards making sure any and all waste gets out of the organization. There'll be a very fine, delicate balance because we want to continue to invest in the pipeline. And we will absolutely make that an incredible priority. So we'll navigate through that. It will be a little bit of a challenge, but there's no doubt that we're up to it. With respect to capital allocation, the balance sheet leverage, I think George and I will tag-team this one now. Certainly, we have a pristine leverage profile and a pristine capital structure. I don't -- as I said before, don't think that should be measured on a quarter-in or quarter-out basis. But I think this company can, and we would love to have a capital structure that has more debt on it, but that will be driven by the opportunity to be able to do that as opposed to falsely trying to do that. As people noted, we have authorization from the board for a $5 billion share repurchase program. We have cautiously communicated that, that would be done within 5 years time. If the stock is under pressure, as it was in premarket today, I suspect that we will look for opportunities to lower the share base. And capital allocation is much broader than that, obviously. We'll look -- we continue look for M&A opportunities. They've got to be the right thing. They've got to be the right value. And I'll let George kind of pick up on that as well."

That is -- as I mentioned in the call earlier, that's the primary endpoint for the Phase III study. So I think we're increasingly confident that the data is continuing to be very, very consistent across multiple parameters. We believe that this data is increasingly strong. And we're very confident setting up and starting the Phase III study based on the results we've seen. I mean, I will sort of go back in history and say that the last time that I personally was associated with a study at this stage, where the results were this consistent across multiple parameters, was back in my ENBREL days. So again, I believe that we have a really firm basis on which to go forward into Phase III. The MMSE data, a little bit of wobble in that. That's the only data point that I can think of across the entire spectrum that didn't just line up almost perfectly. So we're strong believers in this product and feel very confident moving it forward."

I guess, it's still early days, but it's certainly been several weeks, and the information is out in the market. So we think the market's had some chance to absorb it. Look, the first PML case was a pretty significant change statement for the profile of TECFIDERA, given its very kind of pristine safety profile at the time. Our sense is that the second one is a much less significant change statement. The case is within the expected profile, still exceptionally rare. So in discussions that we've had with physicians, with thought leaders, they seem to be -- the appearance is that they are processing that much more straightforwardly. We've also monitored media pickup, social media pickup, other things like that, and to date have seen very significantly less reaction on that front. So this feels like a significantly different and more muted reaction to date than the first case. Ocrelizumab, look, I think consistent with what we've said before, we have seen increasing excitement in the market about ocrelizumab, particularly among specialists. We don't know the full data. It looks like a product that will play in the high-efficacy space. It's likely to appeal to the kind of specialists, particularly, the TYSABRI user, the RITUXAN user. That, we think, is more of an issue, frankly, for TYSABRI as it completes in the high-efficacy space and probably in a narrower customer, more specialized customer base over time. So we think of that as probably less relevant to TECFIDERA. Look, in terms of TECFIDERA's long-term profile, which is where you'd ask that, I'll say, to date, when we look at our market research, the indicators and the leading indicators of brain health, we believe, continue to be pretty favorable, right? Our market research says the benefit/risk profile has changed, but we believe it's still overall very positive. It's the most requested product by patients based on our research. Physicians state that they intend to use more, again, ultra-market research, and they see it as appropriate for a broad set of patient types. So in the current environment, that's essentially why we're doubling down in what's been a slow market. The market has been more cautious, and we think a lot of it is on the margin, more cautious, but for a big brand like TECFIDERA on the margin matters. So reach and frequency, patient outreach and emphasizing the benefits of the product continue to be where we'll put our efforts."

I'm still blushing from Mark's comments, but I'll try to answer the question on SPMS. As you pointed out, it was kind of important to get a SPA approval prior to starting because this is the first time the drug would be approved using a new composite measure of disability progression. And so that's why it was important to get a SPA agreement. And this composite measure, I think whether or not the drug gets approved, it's going to rest almost entirely on whether or not the drug is statistically significant on this measure, which -- by the way this measure has the EDSS standard, EDSS 1-point change that we've been using for a long time in relapsing MS, but also in addition has 2 other pieces, the 9-Hole Peg Test, a certain percentage change in the 9-Hole Peg Test as well as the Timed 25-Foot Walk. So we believe that increases the sensitivity to change. So we will see disability progression better, and therefore increased chances that TYSABRI will show a treatment effect."

And it's a very small sample size coming out of the current Phase Ib study. But what we've seen in terms of consistency of response across the doses, I think, has allowed us to do some very nice statistical modeling and make some assumptions about sample size that obviously we think will allow us to achieve statistical significance with the sample size, with the increased duration of dosing because as you recall, from the previous look at the data, the longer you dose, the more amyloid you remove. And what we've shown in the most recent presentation is that there is a very nice correlation between amyloid removal and improvement in cognition. So I think all of these factors have come into play to both size the study and to pick the dose. And I would say that what we're trying to do is to actually push the dose and to push it as high and as hard as we can to remove as much amyloid as possible because we know that, that seems to be an important parameter for efficacy with our drugs. So all of this has been factored into the sample size. And I think we've designed a study now that allows us to take into account the fact that increasing doses work better, increasing durations seem to work better. And stratifying based on ApoE4 status is an important parameter for allowing us to both push the does, but at the same time try to minimize ARIA. And I think the up-titration is another element to this study that will improve our chances of maximizing the benefit/risk."

And so I think we're pretty confident, using this sample size, that we will achieve a statistical significance. In terms of how we view this drug to be used once it's approved, I do think that people will get genotyped, and the dose will be based on genotype on whether or not they're ApoE4 carriers. And then we'll have to look at the data to see which dose is superior in each of the subgroups, the carriers and noncarriers. And that will probably be the recommended dose. And then the other complication is if there's some ARIA, whether or not people would dose-reduce, because that's what was typically done in the Phase Ib trial. People dose-reduced, and most people were able to continue dosing with the dose reduction. So that's sort of how I see it playing out."

BAN is a humanized mouse antibody, whereas BIIB037 is a fully human antibody derived from human B cells. And also, BAN tends to bind to protofibrils. And so exactly which species of a beta in terms of the aggregation status and fibrillar status, there are probably going to be some differences. Although I would say that BIIB037 also binds to oligomers as well as a fibrillar beta. So those are the differences."

What was surprising to us is that when we looked at the other clinical outcome measures at day 30 and day 90, we saw some interesting trends and, in some cases at certain times with certain measures, there were statistical significance. And the other measures that were looked at were the Modified Rankin Scale, the Barthel Index and the NIH Stroke Scale. Those are the typical stroke scales. And in fact, people often combine them into the global scale. When we look at those, we see some interesting trends, as I said. With odds ratios -- so then the other way to look at it is odds ratios of reaching a favorable outcome on these endpoints individually and as a composite sort of a global score. And when you look at that, it's actually in the range of what was seen with tPA, which makes us kind of interested in what we saw. And so you mentioned going to Phase III.

On Europe, the short answer is basically mathematically impossible for Europe to be as big as the U.S., given the differential in pricing and therefore net revenue per patient across. You have a big patient population in Europe. As I said, more mature markets like Germany, we believe we've seen dynamics that are a little bit more like the U.S. But launch markets, we're seeing really nice uptake, and we believe it's very consistent with what we saw in the other launches. So the total dynamic is we have seen, to date, good patient growth in Europe. We have had both net price and also FX working against us this year. We are basically through all the major reimbursement decisions at this point. And when all the dust has settled, the net prices we were able to achieve or they were certainty lower than our aspiration and, I think, what our plan was. We always caution that given how broadly TECFIDERA would be used, you'd have a gravitational pull-down to the platform therapies. The argument for us with the pricing authorities, obviously, was superior efficacy, better profiles than the platforms. That's been a very tough row to hoe. It was made tougher by AUBAGIO, which went ahead of us and took what was a pretty low-price strategy that increased the pressure over there. So I think Paul referenced it, and I talked a little in my comments, the net revenue per patient in Europe is just structurally substantially lower than the U.S. And for TECFIDERA specifically, has come out lower than we would certainly have aspired to, given those market dynamics."

One is obviously dose, so a lower dose has a lower incidence of ARIA. And the second is time. Most of the ARIA occurs during the first 5 doses of administration. So the hypothesis that is being tested right now with this cohort you mentioned is whether or not at a lower dose for a period of time, you can get through this period of risk, I'll call it, for developing ARIA and end up with a lower overall incident on your way up to the final dose.

There are 2 sets of data, on which most of you have been focused. So let me lead with those issues.
The first is the commercial trajectory. So versus prior year, we achieved 7% revenue growth and 21% non-GAAP EPS growth, good numbers, but certainly lower than we had anticipated a few months ago. We'd expected to see a reacceleration of TECFIDERA this quarter, but that did not happen to any appreciable extent. Rather, TECFIDERA experienced modest sequential patient growth, as we continued to work through the same commercial challenges experienced in the first quarter of the year. We continue to believe that TECFIDERA remains the preferred oral option in the MS market based on its strong efficacy and favorable safety profile, and we're working hard across the organization to improve TECFIDERA's trajectory.
With that said, our multiple sclerosis portfolio continues to add patients globally. TECFIDERA is the most prescribed oral MS therapy globally and has now been used to treat over 155,000 patients. We believe that PLEGRIDY is on its way to becoming the interferon of choice, as we continue to make it available in new markets around the world. And TYSABRI, which we believe is viewed as the preferred high-efficacy therapy, continued to add patients this quarter.
Second development was the recent announcement of a new data from aducanumab Phase Ib study at AAIC. By now you've all seen the data, which we take to be positive, in line with, and supportive of the data that we reported earlier. Doug will provide some additional details on this analysis later in the call.
We've initiated sites for  2 pivotal Phase III trials for aducanumab in early Alzheimer’s disease, and are screening patients for enrollment. Millions of people worldwide living with Alzheimer's disease and no disease modifying treatment options, we believe that this important investment has the potential to be a significant future growth driver for Biogen.
Moving on to other areas. Through our joint venture with Samsung Bioepis, we announced positive results across our anti-TNF biosimilar portfolio at the EULAR conference in June. With these results, we believe that we're well-positioned to bring these widely used anti-TNF therapies to physicians, payers and, ultimately, to the patients who need them most next year.
Just this month, we announced our intent to build a new next-generation manufacturing facility in Solothurn, Switzerland to support our emerging pipeline, a significant step towards ensuring a long-term global supply of new world-class therapies for patients. We expect to break ground on the facility early next year and start manufacturing activities in 2019.
So we had a busy second quarter, with an important second half of the year ahead of us, in which we'll focus on improving the trajectory of TECFIDERA and ensuring that we execute importing clinical trials to move our pipeline forward as quickly as possible.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Doug, who'll update you all on our progress on R&D."

Earlier this week, at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference, we presented additional interim results from the aducanumab Phase Ib study in subjects with prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease. To remind you, we previously",947,"Thanks, George. Earlier this week, at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference, we presented additional interim results from the aducanumab Phase Ib study in subjects with prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease. To remind you, we previously presented results for the 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg patient cohorts at 6 months and 1 year, and for the 6 mg/kg cohort at 6 months. The new results now include 1-year data for 30 subjects treated with 6 mg/kg of aducanumab and for an additional 10 subjects randomized to placebo.
The 6 mg/kg 1-year results demonstrated a statistically significant reduction on brain beta-amyloid levels versus placebo, as assessed by PET imaging. The results at 6 months and 1 year show a very strong dose and time-dependent reduction of brain beta-amyloid, and extend our previously reported observations. We observed a numeric improvement on the MMSE and CDR sum of box clinical measures compared to placebo, though the results did not achieve statistical significance. The 6 mg/kg dose at 1 year was intermediate in effect to that seen with the 3 and 10 mg/kg doses on the CDR score, which will be the primary endpoint for the Phase III program. The safety results were consistent with previously reported results.
Overall analysis of the 1, 3, 6 and 10 mg/kg clinical results at 1 year demonstrated a statistically significant dose-dependent impact on MMSE and CDR sum of boxes compared to placebo. Additional analysis demonstrated strong, positive correlations between reduction in beta-amyloid levels in both CDR and MMSE scores. We believe that the totality of the aducanumab Phase Ib study results strongly support development and registrational studies.
Based on feedback from regulatory agencies, we've recently finalized the aducanumab Phase III study design. The Phase III program includes 2 identically designed placebo-controlled studies referred to as ENGAGE and EMERGE. Each study is expected to include 1,350 subjects with early Alzheimer's disease. Study subjects will be screened by PET amyloid imaging to confirm elevated beta-amyloid plaque levels in the brain. The primary endpoint will be CDR sum of boxes, a clinical measure including both cognitive and functional components measured at 18 months.
In each Phase III study, ApoE4 noncarriers will be randomized to receive 6 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or placebo, while ApoE4 carriers will receive 3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg or placebo. Study dosing will include an up-titration period in an effort to reduce ARIA and maximize aducanumab's benefit/risk profile.
The Phase III program will be conducted globally and is planned to include more than 300 sites. Good progress has been made in operationalizing the studies, and initial investigational clinical sites for ENGAGE and EMERGE are now active and screening patients.
Moving on to our other programs. I'm pleased to mention that the European Medicines Agency has accepted the marketing application of ALPROLIX for the treatment of hemophilia B, signifying the initiation of the review process. Last week, our partner, Sobi, exercised its opt-in right for ALPROLIX to assume final development and commercialization in certain territories, including Europe.
Our collaborator, Isis Pharmaceuticals, recently presented additional results from the ongoing Phase II studies, evaluating SMNrx in infants and children with spinal muscular atrophy. We believe the available data are increasingly supportive of SMNRx having a therapeutic effect. Two Phase III studies for SMNRx are active, with enrollment currently ongoing.
We recently obtained Phase II study results for neublastin in moderate-to-severe sciatica. The clinical results observed did not achieve our target product profile. And while we've made the decision to terminate this program, developing new therapies [ph] for pain remains an area of focus for Biogen. We've made good progress advancing development plans of our Nav 1.7 inhibitor acquired from Convergence, and we expect to begin enrolling patients into a Phase III study in trigeminal neuralgia next year.
We've also obtained Phase II study results for TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke. Study results did not demonstrate an impact on the change in infarct volume, the primary endpoint of the study. However, secondary and exploratory end points, including the Modified Rankin Scale evaluating stroke recoveries, suggest that TYSABRI may have had a beneficial impact on the functional deficits experienced by stroke patients. We believe that the benefit observed, if confirmed, would be clinically meaningful. We're evaluating additional study designs to pursue development of TYSABRI in stroke.
Earlier this month, we announced a collaboration with AGTC to develop gene therapies in ophthalmology. The collaboration is focused on adeno-associated virus-based gene therapy, with the goal of developing one-time transformative treatments for XLRS and XLRP. The expansion of our pipeline into these orphan opthalmic indications represents a natural extension of Biogen's focus in neurology.
Furthermore, through this collaboration, we further bolstered Biogen's capability to utilize gene therapy as a therapeutic approach.
Before I turn the call over to Tony, I want to say that, as many of you know, this will be my last earnings call for Biogen. I'll be leaving the company at the end of next week to take on the role of CEO of a new startup company. During the last 4.5 years at Biogen, I've had the opportunity to work with many extraordinary people, and the company has been transformed in many ways. We've strengthened the pipeline and put a strong emphasis on discovery science excellence, which will pay off over the coming years. The R&D team is in very capable hands with Al and Spyros, and the company is performing extraordinary science in the labs and in the clinic under their guidance.

Our 2015 business plan for TECFIDERA made 2 important assumptions: first, that TECFIDERA would continue to stimulate higher-than-historical market growth and switch rates as it drives the market from injectables to orals; and second, that TECFIDERA, with what we believe is a strong all-in profile, would continue to capture a high rate of both new starts and switches. Through the second quarter, both of these were weaker than planned, particularly in the more mature and larger markets in the U.S. and Germany.
In the U.S., total market growth and switch rates remain lower than our original expectations, and appear to have returned to historical averages typically seen in the market before the launch of TECFIDERA. We believe the safety event reported in late 2014 has created greater caution on the part of both physicians and patients about switching to orals. Our U.S. market research indicates a moderation in physician intent to prescribe, though, in Q2, TECFIDERA continued to gain patients in the U.S. We believe our promotional and educational efforts are strong and well-resourced. In the U.S., we remain focused on emphasizing TECFIDERA's strong efficacy profile, while ensuring physicians and patients are educated on proper monitoring requirements for lymphopenia. And we believe we are making progress. We've recently increased our share of voice across print and digital media to increase patient awareness, and have also ramped up TECFIDERA sales calls by our field teams.
In more mature markets in Europe such as Germany, TECFIDERA has faced similar dynamics, as in the U.S. On a patient basis, this has been offset by robust uptake in newly launched markets such as the U.K., Italy and Spain, where the launch curves to date have mimicked prior experience of very rapid uptake. For example, in the U.K., where full reimbursement funding really came into place around the turn of the year, we believe the uptake curve through June has actually exceeded what we saw in the U.S. and Germany. While patient growth for Europe as a whole was robust, total European TECFIDERA revenue was dampened both by the change of price and softer demand in Germany.
In Europe, our promotional strategy is similar to what I described in the U.S., maintaining high region frequency and emphasizing the strong value proposition of the product. However, in Europe, we have been more limited in our ability to educate physicians about any new monitoring requirements, as we are still waiting for an updated European label. We continue to believe TECFIDERA's competitive profile, and believe the product can drive future patient growth, although at a more moderated rate. Establishing TECFIDERA as the standard of care in MS remains a primary focus, and we will be tireless in those efforts.
We believe that AVONEX and PLEGRIDY will continue to play an important role, and that we are gaining share among interferons. PLEGRIDY has seen steady, early uptake and has continued to source patients broadly.
TYSABRI continues to set itself apart in the market with an increasing number of alternatives. TYSABRI demonstrated positive patient growth again this quarter, and we believe this strong performance is a testament to the high level of efficacy that TYSABRI provides to patients.
Finally, in MS, we are gearing up for the potential launch of ZINBRYTA with our collaboration partner, AbbVie. If approved, we believe ZINBRYTA could be an important new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients.
Turning to our hemophilia business. ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE continued to grow market share this quarter in the U.S. We continue to broaden both breadth and depth of prescribing amongst physicians and educate the community about the importance of maintaining protection from bleeding with less frequent infusions. Recent market research suggests that the product awareness continues to increase, and that the convenience of our product's dosing schedules is well-appreciated by patients. Outside of the U.S., we have also seen strong initial uptake of ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE in Japan, which we believe is an attractive long-term growth opportunity.
I'll now pass the call to Paul."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.93 in the second quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.22. Total revenue for Q2 grew 7% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion.
Foreign exchange, offset by hedging, weakened total revenue by approximately $79 million year-over-year.
Global second quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $883 million, an increase of 26% versus second quarter of last year and an increase of 7% versus the prior quarter. This quarter's TECFIDERA revenues consisted of $721 million in the United States and $163 million outside the U.S.
U.S. gross-to-net adjustments were lower this quarter than Q1 by approximately 400 basis points. We estimate we ended the quarter with approximately 2.5 weeks of inventory in the U.S. wholesale channel for TECFIDERA, a similar level to last quarter.
In Germany, TECFIDERA sales are being recorded at EUR 12,800, as the free pricing period ended in mid-February. Largely driven by this, ex-U.S. TECFIDERA sales decreased 8% versus prior quarter despite unit growth of 14%.
Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $10 million year-over-year.
Interferon revenues, including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY, were $690 million during the second quarter, including $455 million in the U.S. and $235 million in sales outside the U.S. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, U.S. interferon revenues decreased 12%. We estimate that approximately $50 million of the decrease is due to an inventory drawdown in the U.S. wholesale channel. We believe this was the result of rebalancing of inventory subsequent to the launch of PLEGRIDY.
Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened Q2 interferon revenue by approximately $27 million year-over-year. TYSABRI worldwide revenue was $463 million in Q2. These results were comprised of $269 million in the U.S. and $195 million internationally.
As a reminder, TYSABRI sales outside the U.S. in the second quarter of 2014 included $54 million of previously deferred revenue related to our AIFA agreement.
Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $35 million year-over-year.
Moving to hemophilia. ALPROLIX revenue in Q2 was $54 million, and ELOCTATE revenue was $74 million. Our U.S. profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA as well as our profit share and royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. were $338 million.
Turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q2 cost of goods sold were $286 million or 11% of revenue. Q2 R&D expense was $491 million or 19% of revenue.
In Q2, SG&A expense was $492 million or 19% of revenues. Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% for Q2, which benefited by approximately 50 basis points related to a discrete item. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 50-50 between the U.S. and ex-U.S.
Our weighted average diluted shares at the end of the quarter were 236 million. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $4.22 for the second quarter.
Let me turn to our updated full year 2015 guidance. We now expect revenue growth between 6% and 8%. This substantial decrease from our prior guidance is primarily driven by a change in our estimate for TECFIDERA's trajectory. Our balance-of-year forecast assumes limited patient growth for TECFIDERA in the United States.
Additionally, in Europe, overall reimbursement is below our original plan. Our revenue estimates for the rest of our MS portfolio remain largely unchanged.
Moving to operating expenses. As a percentage of sales, OpEx is unchanged as we work to contain costs for the balance of the year. R&D expense is expected to be between 19% and 20% of revenue, unchanged from prior guidance. Assuming deal closure, we'll book an approximately $40 million expense to R&D in the third quarter related to our collaboration with AGTC.
SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 20% to 21% of revenue, unchanged from prior guidance.
I'd like to point out that we'll owe Neurimmune, a $60 million milestone payment upon dosing of the first patient in the Phase III trials for aducanumab. This payment will be an expense and presented within the noncontrolling interest line in the P&L. We anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between $15.50 and $15.95 and GAAP EPS to be between $14.25 and $14.70.
From a cash perspective, we now expect to pay approximately $850 million in CVR payments in 2015 related to the sales of TECFIDERA, a reduction from prior guidance.
We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $650 million to $700 million, an increase over 2014, as we continue to expand our manufacturing footprints.
Included in this forecast is the recently announced agreement related to Eisai's Research Triangle Park campus.
Overall, we're very disappointed in the change of outlook for the year. Nevertheless, we remain committed to working tirelessly to turn around the commercial performance. And we'll aggressively look for opportunities to reduce expenses while simultaneously ensuring we invest in the pipeline.
I'll turn the call over to George."

Thanks, Paul. Look, we obviously have a lot of work ahead of us, as we strive to maximize the success of our commercial business and execute on our operational goals.
Over the long term, we expect that the primary source of value creation will be from the introduction of new therapies. So in closing, I'd like to highlight several pipeline programs that may be future value drivers for the company.
ZINBRYTA is currently under regulatory review as a potential new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients. If approved, we believe that ZINBRYTA could be an interesting addition to our MS portfolio and provide Biogen with an additional treatment option for patients.
Later this year, we anticipate Phase III results for TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS, a form of the disease impacting approximately 30% of MS patients, and for which there are no proven effective therapies today.
We also recently obtained Phase II results suggesting that TYSABRI may improve clinical outcomes in stroke patients. And we're rapidly moving forward to better understand TYSABRI's potential as a post-stroke therapy with hopes to offer new potential therapeutic option for the millions of patients experiencing this debilitating condition. The Phase III SMNRx program developed with our partners at Isis Pharmaceuticals represents another important opportunity for Biogen. SMNRx is being developed with the goal of improving and extending the lives of patients with spinal muscular atrophy. The available clinical results increasingly suggest that SMNRx may indeed be having this effect. We look forward to obtaining Phase III data late next year or in early 2017.
We're eagerly awaiting the anti-LINGO Phase II MS results next year, and expect to provide an update on the AON data at ACTRIMS in the fall. While available MS therapies slow the course of the disease, anti-LINGO has the potential to work in a fundamentally differently way by acting as a restorative therapy. And of course, Alzheimer's disease is an area of intense focus for Biogen with several active clinical programs. In addition to aducanumab, our lead program, we're working with our partner, Eisai, to develop BAN2401 and E2609 potential disease-modifying therapies in Phase II.
BAN2401 is an anti-beta-amyloid antibody, while E2609 is an oral BACE inhibitor that seeks to block the production of amyloid plaque.
Clinical results are expected for both product candidates next year. And we look forward to providing updates on the progress of our R&D efforts as we continue to advance the pipeline.
Before I end the call, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Doug Williams' contributions to Biogen. Doug joined Biogen over 4 years ago and, since then, has been a great friend and colleague, and has done an amazing job helping to invigorate Biogen's R&D. I think that the progress that we've made should be obvious to everyone. So as Doug prepares to leave the company, I'm sad to see him go, but I'm happy for him that he has the opportunity to move to a new role that truly excites him. I want to publicly thank Doug for all that he's done, and wish him all the best in his next endeavor.
Fortunately, for us, Doug has helped build a deep team, including [indiscernible] physicians and scientists, who will continue to advance Biogen's R&D efforts. Leadership for the research and development organization will be assumed by Al Sandrock, our Chief Medical Officer; Spyros Artavanis, our Chief Scientific Officer. Both Spyros and Al are extremely talented and accomplished, and I'm confident in the continued success of our R&D organization.
Finally, as always, I want to thank the many Biogen employees who've contributed to our success. Through good and challenging times, I'm always gratified to see the consistent dedication to patients and shareholders exhibited by our employees. And I'm confident that we'll all continue to work hard to accomplish our ambitious goals.
So with that, we'll end the call and open it up for questions."

And related to that, you have a very strong balance sheet. You mentioned the $4.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, next to no debt.

On the margin front, I mean, certainly, I'd point to what the guidance now assumes. I think from a multi-year perspective, we certainly would still -- continue to still want to kind of drive towards margin improvement. The dynamics of our margin improvements, obviously, over the next couple of years are going to be a little bit different. As the revenue growth has attenuated, we're going to have to work harder to control costs. And I think that we came into this year starting to do that with our SG&A. We are certainly doing that with the balance-of-year forecast, maintaining kind of the OpEx targets as a percentage of sales that effectively assumes not an insignificant pullback in our spending. We're coming off a period that we purposely and, as I've articulated, that we did not want to be penny-wise and pound-foolish. We had an unprecedented number of product launches for a company our size. I think that was the appropriate. And I think we now need to pivot towards making sure any and all waste gets out of the organization. There'll be a very fine, delicate balance because we want to continue to invest in the pipeline. And we will absolutely make that an incredible priority. So we'll navigate through that. It will be a little bit of a challenge, but there's no doubt that we're up to it. With respect to capital allocation, the balance sheet leverage, I think George and I will tag-team this one now. Certainly, we have a pristine leverage profile and a pristine capital structure. I don't -- as I said before, don't think that should be measured on a quarter-in or quarter-out basis. But I think this company can, and we would love to have a capital structure that has more debt on it, but that will be driven by the opportunity to be able to do that as opposed to falsely trying to do that. As people noted, we have authorization from the board for a $5 billion share repurchase program. We have cautiously communicated that, that would be done within 5 years time. If the stock is under pressure, as it was in premarket today, I suspect that we will look for opportunities to lower the share base. And capital allocation is much broader than that, obviously. We'll look -- we continue look for M&A opportunities. They've got to be the right thing. They've got to be the right value. And I'll let George kind of pick up on that as well."

That is -- as I mentioned in the call earlier, that's the primary endpoint for the Phase III study. So I think we're increasingly confident that the data is continuing to be very, very consistent across multiple parameters. We believe that this data is increasingly strong. And we're very confident setting up and starting the Phase III study based on the results we've seen. I mean, I will sort of go back in history and say that the last time that I personally was associated with a study at this stage, where the results were this consistent across multiple parameters, was back in my ENBREL days. So again, I believe that we have a really firm basis on which to go forward into Phase III. The MMSE data, a little bit of wobble in that. That's the only data point that I can think of across the entire spectrum that didn't just line up almost perfectly.

I guess, it's still early days, but it's certainly been several weeks, and the information is out in the market. So we think the market's had some chance to absorb it. Look, the first PML case was a pretty significant change statement for the profile of TECFIDERA, given its very kind of pristine safety profile at the time. Our sense is that the second one is a much less significant change statement. The case is within the expected profile, still exceptionally rare. So in discussions that we've had with physicians, with thought leaders, they seem to be -- the appearance is that they are processing that much more straightforwardly. We've also monitored media pickup, social media pickup, other things like that, and to date have seen very significantly less reaction on that front. So this feels like a significantly different and more muted reaction to date than the first case. Ocrelizumab, look, I think consistent with what we've said before, we have seen increasing excitement in the market about ocrelizumab, particularly among specialists. We don't know the full data. It looks like a product that will play in the high-efficacy space. It's likely to appeal to the kind of specialists, particularly, the TYSABRI user, the RITUXAN user. That, we think, is more of an issue, frankly, for TYSABRI as it completes in the high-efficacy space and probably in a narrower customer, more specialized customer base over time. So we think of that as probably less relevant to TECFIDERA. Look, in terms of TECFIDERA's long-term profile, which is where you'd ask that, I'll say, to date, when we look at our market research, the indicators and the leading indicators of brain health, we believe, continue to be pretty favorable, right? Our market research says the benefit/risk profile has changed, but we believe it's still overall very positive. It's the most requested product by patients based on our research. Physicians state that they intend to use more, again, ultra-market research, and they see it as appropriate for a broad set of patient types. So in the current environment, that's essentially why we're doubling down in what's been a slow market. The market has been more cautious, and we think a lot of it is on the margin, more cautious, but for a big brand like TECFIDERA on the margin matters. So reach and frequency, patient outreach and emphasizing the benefits of the product continue to be where we'll put our efforts."

I'm still blushing from Mark's comments, but I'll try to answer the question on SPMS. As you pointed out, it was kind of important to get a SPA approval prior to starting because this is the first time the drug would be approved using a new composite measure of disability progression. And so that's why it was important to get a SPA agreement. And this composite measure, I think whether or not the drug gets approved, it's going to rest almost entirely on whether or not the drug is statistically significant on this measure, which -- by the way this measure has the EDSS standard, EDSS 1-point change that we've been using for a long time in relapsing MS, but also in addition has 2 other pieces, the 9-Hole Peg Test, a certain percentage change in the 9-Hole Peg Test as well as the Timed 25-Foot Walk. So we believe that increases the sensitivity to change. So we will see disability progression better, and therefore increased chances that TYSABRI will show a treatment effect."

And it's a very small sample size coming out of the current Phase Ib study. But what we've seen in terms of consistency of response across the doses, I think, has allowed us to do some very nice statistical modeling and make some assumptions about sample size that obviously we think will allow us to achieve statistical significance with the sample size, with the increased duration of dosing because as you recall, from the previous look at the data, the longer you dose, the more amyloid you remove. And what we've shown in the most recent presentation is that there is a very nice correlation between amyloid removal and improvement in cognition. So I think all of these factors have come into play to both size the study and to pick the dose. And I would say that what we're trying to do is to actually push the dose and to push it as high and as hard as we can to remove as much amyloid as possible because we know that, that seems to be an important parameter for efficacy with our drugs. So all of this has been factored into the sample size. And I think we've designed a study now that allows us to take into account the fact that increasing doses work better, increasing durations seem to work better. And stratifying based on ApoE4 status is an important parameter for allowing us to both push the does, but at the same time try to minimize ARIA. And I think the up-titration is another element to this study that will improve our chances of maximizing the benefit/risk."

And so I think we're pretty confident, using this sample size, that we will achieve a statistical significance. In terms of how we view this drug to be used once it's approved, I do think that people will get genotyped, and the dose will be based on genotype on whether or not they're ApoE4 carriers. And then we'll have to look at the data to see which dose is superior in each of the subgroups, the carriers and noncarriers. And that will probably be the recommended dose. And then the other complication is if there's some ARIA, whether or not people would dose-reduce, because that's what was typically done in the Phase Ib trial. People dose-reduced, and most people were able to continue dosing with the dose reduction. So that's sort of how I see it playing out."

So the total dynamic is we have seen, to date, good patient growth in Europe. We have had both net price and also FX working against us this year. We are basically through all the major reimbursement decisions at this point. And when all the dust has settled, the net prices we were able to achieve or they were certainty lower than our aspiration and, I think, what our plan was. We always caution that given how broadly TECFIDERA would be used, you'd have a gravitational pull-down to the platform therapies. The argument for us with the pricing authorities, obviously, was superior efficacy, better profiles than the platforms. That's been a very tough row to hoe. It was made tougher by AUBAGIO, which went ahead of us and took what was a pretty low-price strategy that increased the pressure over there. So I think Paul referenced it, and I talked a little in my comments, the net revenue per patient in Europe is just structurally substantially lower than the U.S. And for TECFIDERA specifically, has come out lower than we would certainly have aspired to, given those market dynamics."

Third quarter was marked by significant progress across several key areas. We delivered 11% revenue growth and 18% non-GAAP EPS growth as we continue to see modest patient growth across the portfolio. We have several important developments in our pipeline. We initiated enrollment for our Phase III clinical program for Aducanumab in Alzheimer's disease, we announced Phase III results for TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS, which Al will cover in more detail later in the call, and we continue to strengthen our pipeline by announcing an agreement to exclusively license MT-1303 from Mitsubishi Tanabe. 
On a commercial front, we remain committed to improving our commercial trajectory with a particular emphasis on TECFIDERA. Our market research continues indicate that prescribers believe that TECFIDERA has a very strong benefit risk profile. However, patient growth in the U.S. and Germany remains challenging and we're actively working to improve this dynamic. We've increased sales cost for TECFIDERA as we continue to educate physicians on TECFIDERA's strong efficacy and favorable safety profile and its label and monitoring requirements. We also increased our direct-to-consumer marketing in the U.S., including the recently launched television campaign that some of you may have seen. We also made significant progress on capital allocation. Through yesterday, we returned approximately $3.9 billion to our shareholders for the repurchase of our common stock. Importantly, Biogen still retains strategic flexibility to support both continued business development and potentially larger-scale acquisitions. We remain focused on strengthening and expanding our early-stage pipeline through tuck-in acquisitions and collaborations, a strategy that has produced assets such as TECFIDERA, ELOCTATE, ALPROLIX, aducanumab, ISIS-SMNRx and requisite. We're actively looking for late-stage and commercial assets which have the potential to add both strategic value and near-term revenue growth while maintaining financial discipline. 
Today, we also announced the corporate restructuring that we believe will best position the company to achieve our strategic priorities. This decision to reduce our workforce was extremely difficult and we're very thankful for the hard work and contributions of our talented colleagues and friends. As part of our efforts to focus on key commercial initiatives and high potential pipeline candidate, we've also made a decision to discontinue several pipeline programs that include TECFIDERA in secondary progressive MS as well as certain programs in immunology and fibrosis research, including anti-TWEAK. 
Importantly, we plan to reinvest the savings from this restructuring into key commercial initiatives and a number of prioritize programs across our emerging, mid- and late-stage pipeline, including commercial initiatives aimed at increasing sales of marketing therapies, including new direct-to-consumer marketing programs for TECFIDERA, the advancement of aducanumab, BAN2401 and E2609 for Alzheimer's disease and anti-LINGO for multiple sclerosis, ISIS-SMNRxfor spinal mascular atrophy, our recently acquired track from Convergence for revenue for trigeminal neuralgia and other pain indications and MT-1303 for inflammatory bowel disease, and other autoimmune diseases. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Al for an update on R&D."

We have important clinical study readouts and good progress advancing the new generation of mid- and late-stage clinical trial programs. This morning, we reported top line results from the Phase III study for TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS. The objective of ASCEND was to determine whether TYSABRI had an impact on slowing disability progression unrelated to relapses in patients with SPMS. Most patients that enrolled in ASCEND had nonrelapsing SPMS and had EDSS scores of 6.0 to 6.5. ASCEND did not achieve its primary or secondary endpoints and we do not intend to file for label expansion. We are disappointed in these results as SPMS is a serious condition with no effective therapies. 
ASCEND study results did demonstrate that TYSABRI had a robust impact on relapses and MRI measures of disease consistent with its nonclinical profile in relapsing MS. Study results also indicated that TYSABRI had a statistically significant effect on upper limb function measured by the 9 hole peg test, which was a component of the composite primary endpoint. Full study results would be reported at the future medical meeting. 
Moving on to our other MS development programs, at the ECTRIMS meeting earlier this month, we presented an additional analysis from RENEW, a Phase II study that was evaluated anti-LINGO in patients with acute optic neuritis. The top line results of which we reported earlier this year. About half the patients in RENEW underwent multifocal visually both potential testing. MS allows us to record electrical responses produced in the occipital cortex upon stimulation of small segments within the retina. 
First, we found that Anti-LINGO had an effect on the recovery of the multifocal BP aptitude recorded by stimulating the eye that was affected by the optic neuritis. Interestingly, we also found that Anti-LINGO treatment preserve the multifocal amplitude recorded by stimulating the opposite eye, which seem to be deteriorating in the placebo group likely due to lesions developing in the visual system as a result of some of these patients being in the early stages of MS. We believe that these results further support our previously reported findings and provide evidence that Anti-LINGO may have neuroprotective properties. 
We continue to expect top line results from the Phase II synergy study in MS in mid-2016. Turning to that, the New England Journal Medicine just published the results of the ZINBRYTA Phase III study. In DECIDE, ZINBRYTA demonstrated a compelling 45% improvement in annualized relapse rate compared to interferon therapy. If approved, we believe ZINBRYTA could be an important new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients. 
At ECTRIMS, Roche presented positive Phase III results in both relapsing and primary progressive MS for ocrelizumab, a product in which we have a business interest. Results from 2 Phase III studies in relapsing MS showed a 46% and 47% reduction in annualized relapse rate compared to interferon therapy. 
Upgrowth also demonstrated a significant role in treatment of primary progressive MS, a serious neurodegenerative condition for which there are no approved therapies. If approved, it will be wonderful to be able to offer these patients a meaningful new therapy. 
Turning to our hemophilia therapies. ELOCTA, which is the approved European trade name for ELOCTATE, obtained a positive recommendation from the CHMP as a therapy for hemophilia A. If approved in the EU, ELOCTA would be commercialized there by our collaborator, Sobi. At the 2015 National hemophilia Foundation Meeting, new ALPROLIX data showed a beneficial long-term safety and efficacy profile in patients with hemophilia B. Favorable long-term clinical results for ELOCTATE treatment of patients with hemophilia A were also recently published. 
Moving to the aducanumab Phase III program for patients with early Alzheimer's disease, we have initiative clinical sites in both the EMERGE and ENGAGE studies and the first study subjects has now been enrolled. We are pleased to have received FDA agreement on a Special Protocol Assessment on the aducanumab Phase III study protocols. 
We have reduced the reported that ARIA or amyloid-related imaging abnormalities was the most significant adverse events observed in the aducanumab Phase 1b study. All patients currently enrolling in the Phase III studies of aducanumab are undergoing dose titration in an effort to mitigate the risk of ARIA. Preliminary data from the Phase 1b study suggest that dose titration does seem to reduce the incidence of ARIA although these findings way to be confirmed with further study. We continue to obtain additional clinical data from the Phase 1b study, and we anticipate discussing these results at a scientific meeting in the second half of next year. 
We have made progress in expanding our development pipeline by acquiring rights to MT-1303, a Phase III ready program with potential in multiple autoimmune diseases. At the recent ECTRIMS meeting, Mitsubishi Tanabe presented compelling results from a 415 patients Phase II study in MS. Results demonstrated that MT-1303 did not cause a decrease in heart rate with administration of the first dose even without dose titration. This characteristic of the molecule may serve to eventually differentiate it from other S1P modulators. We anticipate deal completion in the fourth quarter, and we intend to initiate Phase III studies and inflammatory bowel disease as soon as possible next year. We continue to evaluate potential further development in MS. 
Progress has also been made with several early-stage programs. BIIB61 [ph] an oral treatment being developed as potential therapy for MS has successfully completed Phase I studies. We recently initiated Phase I study for BIIB54, a monoclonal antibody targeting stipulated, which is being developed as a potential disease-modifying therapy for Parkinson's disease. The target of BIIB54 before, is a major component of Liberty's, a pathological hallmark Parkinson's disease. 
R&D continues to make good progress advancing the next wave of therapies and development candidates. Next year, we anticipate the improve all of ZINBRYTA for relapsing MS. We also intend to initiate a number of clinical studies, including a Phase III study of MT-1303 in IBD, a Phase III study for trigeminal neuralgia as well as Phase II study of BIIB061 in MS. We're also looking forward to several upcoming clinical readouts, including Phase III results for SMN-Rx and Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Phase II results for anti-LINGO in MS and interim Phase II results for BAN2401 and E2609, both for Alzheimer's disease. We look forward to a deeper discussion of these pipeline programs and other initiatives at our upcoming R&D Investor Day on November 3. 
I'll now pass the call to Paul."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.15 in the third quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.48. Total revenue for Q3 grew 11% year-over-year to approximately $2.8 billion. Foreign exchange offset by hedging weakened to",1414,"Thanks, Al. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.15 in the third quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.48. Total revenue for Q3 grew 11% year-over-year to approximately $2.8 billion. Foreign exchange offset by hedging weakened total revenue by approximately $63 million year-over-year. Global third quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $937 million, an increase of 19% versus Q3 of last year and an increase of 6% versus the prior year quarter. Foreign exchange impact offset by hedging weakened TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $12 million year-over-year. This quarter's TECFIDERA revenues consisted of $754 million in the U.S. and $183 million outside the U.S. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, U.S. TECFIDERA revenue increased 5% partially due to an increase in inventory of specialty pharmacies. While U.S. revenue also benefited from up price increase in the quarter, this was partially offset by an increase in managed care and government rebates. 
In Europe, TECFIDERA had strong sequential patient growth this quarter, driven by newly launched markets, including the U.K, Italy and Spain. Interferon revenues, including both Avonex and PLEGRIDY, increased 5% year-over-year to $785 million in the third quarter. Foreign exchange impact offset by hedging weakened interferon revenue by approximately $23 million year-over-year. 
Interferon revenues were comprised of $538 million in the U.S. and $247 million in sales outside the U.S. On a sequential basis, we believe the 18% increase in the U.S. interferon revenue benefited from a wholesale inventory rebalancing coming of the inventory drawdown in Q2, which contributed approximately $40 million. Outside the U.S., Avonex revenue benefited by approximately $16 million from the timing of shipments in Brazil and a clinical trial order in our rest of world business. 
TYSABRI continue to add patients this quarter with worldwide revenues of $480 million. These results were comprised of $284 million in the U.S. and the $196 million internationally. Foreign exchange impacts offset by hedging weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $23 million year-over-year. 
Turning to our hemophilia business. ALPROLIX revenue in Q3 was $66 million and ELOCTATE was $91 million. In the U.S., after a period of rapid uptake for Biogen's with elevated switching in the market, we saw the switch rate start to moderate as roughly half of the moderate and severe hemophilia B patients treated prophylactically has switched to ALPROLIX. 
ELOCTATE has continue to grow in the U.S. and we saw increased breadth and depth of prescribing. Approximately 20% of moderate and severe prophylactic patients with hemophilia A have switched to ELOCTATE. Our U.S. profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA as well as our profit share and royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. were $337 million. 
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q3 cost of goods sold were $310 million or 11% of revenue. Q3 R&D expense was $520 million or 19% of revenues. This includes $48 million in upfront in milestone expense related to our recently closed collaboration with EGTC. We made a $60 million milestone payment to this quarter, triggered to dosing of the first patient in, in the Phase III trials for aducanumab. This payment was an expense and presented within the noncontrolling interest line in the P&L. Q3 SG&A expense was $478 million or 17% of revenue as we continue to make steps in containing SG&A expenses. Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% for Q3. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were 4 48 for the third quarter, an increase of 18% over Q3 2014. While there are a number of puts and takes in the quarter, we delivered a very solid quarter with solid results from the United States interferon business, continued European rollout of TECFIDERA, continued progress in the hemophilia franchise and meaningful cost control absorbing the EGTC in Neurimmune payments. 
Let me turn to discuss our progress on returning capital to shareholders. Recall, our board had authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program in May of this year. Due to lower share price, we put in place a more robust share purchase plan in late July, effectively expediting the program. Through September 3rd -- 30, we've repurchased approximately 9.7 million shares of our common stock for a cost of approximately $3 billion. And since the end of the quarter, we have purchased an additional 3.2 million shares for approximately $900 million. Our current expectation is to complete the $5 billion share repurchase plan by the end of the year. In conjunction with funding our share repurchase program, we borrowed $6 billion of senior unsecured notes in mid-September. This included maturities of 5, 7, 10 and 30 years. We ended the quarter with approximately $7.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 60, 40 between the U.S. and ex-U.S. 
Let me now provide additional detail on the corporate restructuring. The restructuring includes the termination of a number of pipeline programs and an 11% reduction in workforce. The reduction was the result of a number of actions, including the consolidation and elimination of certain overlapping groups across the organization and analytical and operational support in the marketing. Resizing portions of the company where we felt there was excess capacity, including in our manufacturing operation, resizing our ex-U.S. Commercial operation and reductions driven by our the emphasis of certain activities in immunology and fibrosis research and the termination of certain developing programs. We plan to complete the majority of the reduction of the global workforce by the end of 2015. The restructuring is expected to reduce the current annual run rate of operating expenses by approximately $250 million. We expect to incur charge in the range of approximately $85 million to $95 million primarily the fourth quarter related to the restructuring. Additionally, we are currently in the middle of our financial planning for 2016 and aim toward additional savings in nonlabor expenses with the objective of reducing lower priority fees and services expense. Conversely on the investment side, as we move into 2016, we're excited and plan to invest behind an emerging, mid- and late-stage pipeline, invest in TECFIDERA TCN and will potentially invest at risk behind prelaunch activities related to the potential commercialization of SMN-Rx.
While we'll outline our specific 2016 financial guidance in late January, we currently expect upward pressure in R&D and aimed for leverage in SG&A. We aim to achieve lower overall expense growth in the top line for 2016. The restructuring will yield real savings to enhance our operating results for 2016 and beyond, while also providing financial flexibility as we embark on a number of meaningful pipeline opportunities. Given the restructuring, change in capital structure and share capital structure and sure purchase activity this quarter, we're updating our full year 2015 guidance. Let me start with revenues. We now expect revenue growth between 8% and 9%, a modest increase versus prior guidance, reflecting the revenue strength seen this quarter. This guidance assumes modest patient growth in the U.S. for our MS products as a whole for the balance of the year. The revenue outlook also assumes a sequential decrease in Q4 due to the assumption of stable U.S. channel inventory levels for the balance of the year in MS and a reduction in the U.S. wholesale inventory levels for RITUXAN. Non-GAAP full year R&D expense is expected to be between 19% and 20% of revenue, unchanged from prior guidance. Assuming deal closure, we'll book an approximately $60 million expense through R&D in the fourth quarter relating to our agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe. 
Non-GAAP full year SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 19% to 20% of revenue, a decrease from prior guidance. We do expect to invest in TECFIDERA TV in Q4. We anticipate booking a GAAP charge of approximately $85 million to $95 million primarily in Q4 related to the restructuring. 
In conjunction with our recently completed bond offering, we now anticipate additional interest expense of approximately $60 million per quarter. We expect to end the year with approximately 219 million fully diluted shares and have a full year weighted average diluted share count of approximately 231 million shares. We anticipate non-GAAP full year earnings per share results between $16.20 and $16.50. This represents an increase of 17% to 19% year-over-year. And GAAP earnings per share, we expect to be between $14.65 and $14.95. The increase versus prior guidance is due to stronger-than-anticipated revenues in Q3, taking costs out of the business and the share repurchase activity. 
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."

This year has been a challenging month for us here at Biogen, but I do believe that we have a solid business and R&D pipeline with exceptional potential, a thoughtful capital allocation strategy, a well-controlled expense base and capable group of people who can execute against our goals. If we put aside quarterly revenue variations due to fluctuations in inventory levels, FX or other factors, on a unit basis, we've seen moderate but steady growth in the underlying business. Our pipeline has matured and I believe the pipeline is more exciting and more promising than it was a year ago. Additional data for aducanumab and anti-LINGO increase our optimism about with of those compounds. We believe that MT-1303 has a real potential and in ulcerative colitis and disease. Raxatrigine had promising data in a controlled Phase II trial and will move to a Phase III trial in lumbar radiculopathy and a Phase IIb trial in it. SMN-Rx data from the open label Phase II trial are encouraging and we're looking forward to the Phase III data late next year or early 2017.
Additionally, our research has become truly world-class and we're looking forward to giving you a deeper view of what we're doing at R&D day on November 3. In Q3, we began the execution of a thoughtful capital allocation strategy, we issued 6 billion of senior unsecured notes, which allowed us to take advantage of our lowered stock price to return approximately $4 billion to investors through stock buybacks with an additional $1 billion to go. We've been able to reduce our share count substantially while we've been adequate financial flexibility for strategic acquisitions compounds in our companies. We continue to consider opportunities within our core areas of expertise, both large and small and as always, we'll do so while being financially disciplined. The restructuring that we announced today was an extremely difficult decision and all of us feel deeply for the affected employees. These people are our friends in college and they have a big role in the successes that Biogen has had up until now. They're good people, good employees and truly saddens us to have to take this action. On behalf of the senior leadership team, I want to express our sincere appreciation for the work that everyone at Biogen has done. 
Although this action is extremely difficult, it's a necessary step in order for us to fulfill our goals as a company. I believe that our mid and late-stage pipeline is larger and higher quality than it has ever been. Aducanumab, SMN-Rx, Raxatrigine and MT-1303 either are or soon will be in the Phase III and we're hopeful that LINGO will join them next year. These programs will require substantial investments and we believe a restructuring will allow us to aggressively conduct these programs while maintaining housing earnings growth. Next year, we expect to have meaningful clinical data from SMN-Rx, anti-LINGO, BAN2401, our base inhibitor E2609 and we hope to get approval for ZINBRYTA and for 2 of our biosimilar molecules. 
So our pipeline has both near-term and longer-term potential to add value to patients and the company, and we need to be able today to adequately fund these exciting programs spurred to restructuring helps us to do so. Before I could include, want to take a moment to acknowledge Tony Kingsley contributions to Biogen. Tony joined Biogen over 5 years ago and was instrumental in leading the successful introduction of several important new therapies that help serve patients around the world. I want to publicly thank Tony, for all that he has done and wish him all the best in his next endeavor. Tony built an extremely capable team and I believe that we have the people and programs in place to maximize the potential of our commercial portfolio. In the interim, leadership of this group will be assumed by John Cox, EVP of Pharmaceutical Operations and Technology. John has been with Biogen for over 12 years, has a good understanding of all aspects of our business and I believe that he will effectively lead this group. 
So as we move forward, we're starting from a good base and we'll focus on 5 key goals: 1, maximize the potential of our commercial portfolio; 2, aggressively advance our made in late-stage clinical programs to get them done on or ahead of schedule; 3, continue our emphasis on world-class science and magazine; 4, carefully control our costs; and 5, pursuing on organic growth opportunities. 
We're energized by the potential that we have to transform the lives of patients around the world and by doing so, to do right in our shareholders. I can't promise you success in everything that we do, but I can promise you our commitment and dedication. 
And with that said, we'll now open up the call for questions."

And so we were disappointed in the fact that we didn't see a step on ambulation, and so I think that's the reason why the primary endpoint was negative. I would say that upper extremity function is important in patients particularly if their angulation is starting to get lost their so that's why we're going to present these results next year at the scientific meeting."

And our planning that we're doing now is effectively have it going throughout the majority of 2016. I think the overall objective isn't that similar to what we saw earlier on in the launch is that TECFIDERA, when it came early on in the launch, expanded the market, activated new patients, many of them that had gotten injections fatigue the on the sidelines. And I think the thinking here is to activate those patients, activating a whole set of patients who patient awareness, which we do have some data that actually suggests that it's a relatively low level of patient awareness or said another way, at least that there's a big opportunity in driving patient awareness. And we also have data that suggests that when a patient comes to a doctor particularly in the United States with a preferred therapy, that is often the therapy that the patient goes on. So that's kind of a bit of opportunities thesis and we look forward to kind of moving forward with it."

It's actually a helpful point of clarification. So we actually are, to a large extent, what we outlined in the middle of the year is that we're aspiring for much more but we outlined on relatively flat patient demand in the United States, that is actually what we witnessed in Q3.

Third quarter was marked by significant progress across several key areas. We delivered 11% revenue growth and 18% non-GAAP EPS growth as we continued to see modest patient growth across the portfolio. We have several important developments in our pipeline. We initiated enrollment for our Phase III clinical program for aducanumab in Alzheimer's disease. We announced Phase III results for TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS, which Al will cover in more detail later in the call, and we continue to strengthen our pipeline by announcing an agreement to exclusively license MT-1303 from Mitsubishi Tanabe. 
On the commercial front, we remained committed to improving our commercial trajectory with a particular emphasis on TECFIDERA. Our market research continues to indicate that prescribers believe TECFIDERA has a very strong benefit risk profile. However, patient growth in the U.S. and Germany remains challenging, and we're actively working to improve this dynamic. We've increased sales cost for TECFIDERA as we continue to educate physicians on TECFIDERA's strong efficacy and favorable safety profile and its label and monitoring requirements. We've also increased our direct-to-consumer marketing in the U.S., including the recently launched television campaign that some of you may have seen. We also made significant progress on capital allocation. Through yesterday, we've returned approximately $3.9 billion to our shareholders through the repurchase of our common stock. Importantly, Biogen still retains strategic flexibility to support both continued business development and potentially larger-scale acquisitions. We remain focused on strengthening and expanding our early-stage pipeline through tuck-in acquisitions and collaborations, a strategy that has produced assets such as TECFIDERA, ELOCTATE, ALPROLIX, aducanumab, ISIS-SMNRx and Raxatrigine. We're actively looking for late-stage and commercial assets which have the potential to add both strategic value and near-term revenue growth, while maintaining financial discipline. 
Today, we also announced the corporate restructuring that we believe will best position the company to achieve our strategic priorities. This decision to reduce our workforce was extremely difficult, and we're very thankful for the hard work and contributions of our talented colleagues and friends. As part of our efforts to focus on key commercial initiatives and high potential pipeline candidate, we've also made a decision to discontinue several pipeline programs that include TECFIDERA in secondary progressive MS as well as certain programs in immunology and fibrosis research, including anti-TWEAK. 
Importantly, we plan to reinvest the savings from this restructuring into key commercial initiatives and a number of prioritized programs across our emerging, mid- and late-stage pipeline, including commercial initiatives aimed at increasing sales of marketing therapies, including new direct-to-consumer marketing programs for TECFIDERA, the advancement of aducanumab, BAN2401 and E2609 for Alzheimer's disease, anti-LINGO for multiple sclerosis, ISIS-SMNRx for spinal muscular atrophy, our recently acquired asset from Convergence, Raxatrigine for trigeminal neuralgia and other pain indications, and MT-1303 for inflammatory bowel disease, and other autoimmune diseases. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Al for an update on R&D."

We have important clinical study readouts and good progress, advancing the new generation of mid- and late-stage clinical programs. This morning, we reported top line results from the Phase III ASCEND study for TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS. The objective of ASCEND was to determine whether TYSABRI had an impact on slowing disability progression unrelated to relapses in patients with SPMS. Most patients that enrolled in ASCEND had nonrelapsing SPMS and had EDSS scores of 6.0 to 6.5. ASCEND did not achieve its primary or secondary endpoints, and we do not intend to file for label expansion. We are disappointed in these results as SPMS is a serious condition with no effective therapies. 
ASCEND study results did demonstrate that TYSABRI had a robust impact on relapses and MRI measures of disease consistent with its nonclinical profile in relapsing MS. Study results also indicated that TYSABRI had a statistically significant effect on upper limb function measured by the 9-Hole Peg Test, which was a component of the composite primary endpoint. Full study results would be reported at a future medical meeting. 
Moving on to our other MS development programs, at the ECTRIMS meeting earlier this month, we presented an additional analysis from RENEW, a Phase II study that evaluated anti-LINGO in patients with acute optic neuritis. The top line results of which we reported earlier this year. About half the patients in RENEW underwent multifocal visually, both potential testing. A method that allows us to record electrical responses produced in the occipital cortex upon stimulation of small segments within the retina. 
First, we found an anti-LINGO had an effect on the recovery of the multifocal VEP amplitude recorded by stimulating the eye that was affected by the optic neuritis. Interestingly, we also found that anti-LINGO treatment preserved the multifocal VEP amplitude recorded by stimulating the opposite eye, which was -- seemed to be deteriorating in the placebo group, likely due to lesions developing in the visual system as a result of some of these patients being in the early stages of MS. We believe that these results further support our previously reported findings and provide evidence that anti-LINGO may have neuroprotective properties. 
We continue to expect top line results from the Phase II synergy study in MS in mid-2016. Turning to ZINBRYTA, the New England Journal Medicine has just published the results of the ZINBRYTA Phase III DECIDE study. In DECIDE, ZINBRYTA demonstrated a compelling 45% improvement in annualized relapse rate compared to interferon therapy. If approved, we believe ZINBRYTA could be an important new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients. 
At ECTRIMS, Roche presented positive Phase III results in both relapsing and primary progressive MS for ocrelizumab, a product in which we have a business interest. Results from 2 Phase III studies in relapsing MS showed a 46% and 47% reduction in annualized relapse rate compared to interferon therapy. 
Ocrelizumab also demonstrated a significant role in the treatment of primary progressive MS, a serious neurodegenerative condition for which there are no approved therapies. If approved, it will be wonderful to be able to offer these patients a meaningful new therapy. 
Turning to our hemophilia therapies. ELOCTA, which is the approved European trade name for ELOCTATE, obtained a positive recommendation from the CHMP as a therapy for hemophilia A. If approved in the EU, ELOCTA would be commercialized there by our collaborator, Sobi. At the 2015 National Hemophilia Foundation Meeting, new ALPROLIX data showed a beneficial long-term safety and efficacy profile in patients with hemophilia B. Favorable long-term clinical results for ELOCTATE treatment of patients with hemophilia A were also recently published. 
Moving to the aducanumab Phase III program for patients with early Alzheimer's disease, we have initiated clinical sites in both the EMERGE and ENGAGE studies, and the first study subjects have now been enrolled. We are pleased to have received FDA agreement on a Special Protocol Assessment on the aducanumab Phase III study protocols. 
We have previously reported that ARIA or amyloid-related imaging abnormality was the most significant adverse event observed in the aducanumab Phase Ib study. All patients currently enrolling in the Phase III studies of aducanumab are undergoing dose titration in an effort to mitigate the risk of ARIA. Preliminary data from the Phase Ib study suggests that dose titration does seem to reduce the incidence of ARIA although these findings will need to be confirmed with further study. We continue to obtain additional clinical data from the Phase Ib study, and we anticipate discussing these results at a scientific meeting in the second half of next year. 
We have made progress in expanding our development pipeline by acquiring rights to MT-1303, a Phase III ready program with potential in multiple autoimmune diseases. At the recent ECTRIMS meeting, Mitsubishi Tanabe presented compelling results from a 415 patients Phase II study in MS. Results demonstrated that MT-1303 did not cause a decrease in heart rate with administration of the first dose, even without dose titration. This characteristic of the molecule may serve to eventually differentiate it from other S1P modulators. We anticipate deal completion in the fourth quarter, and we intend to initiate Phase III studies and inflammatory bowel disease as soon as possible next year. We continue to evaluate potential further development in MS. 
Progress has also been made with several early-stage programs. BIIB061, an oral treatment being developed as a potential reparative therapy for MS has successfully completed Phase I studies. We recently initiated a Phase I study for BIIB054, a monoclonal antibody targeting alpha-synuclein, which is being developed as a potential disease-modifying therapy for Parkinson's disease. The target of BIIB054 before, is a major component of Lewy Bodies, a pathologic hallmark of Parkinson's disease. 
R&D continues to make good progress, advancing the next wave of therapies and development candidates. Next year, we anticipate the approval of ZINBRYTA for relapsing MS. We also intend to initiate a number of clinical studies, including a Phase III study of MT-1303 in IBD, a Phase III study for Raxatrigine for trigeminal neuralgia as well as a Phase II study of BIIB061 in MS. We're also looking forward to several upcoming clinical readouts, including Phase III results for SMN-Rx and spinal muscular atrophy, Phase II results for anti-LINGO in MS and interim Phase II results for BAN2401 and E2609, both for Alzheimer's disease. We look forward to a deeper discussion of these pipeline programs and other initiatives at our upcoming R&D Investor Day on November 3. 
I'll now pass the call to Paul."

Foreign exchange, offset by hedging, weakened",1405,"Thanks, Al. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.15 in the third quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.48. Total revenue for Q3 grew 11% year-over-year to approximately $2.8 billion. Foreign exchange, offset by hedging, weakened total revenue by approximately $63 million year-over-year. Global third quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $937 million, an increase of 19% versus Q3 of last year and an increase of 6% versus the prior quarter. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $12 million year-over-year. This quarter's TECFIDERA revenues consisted of $754 million in the U.S. and $183 million outside the U.S. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, U.S. TECFIDERA revenue increased 5% partially due to an increase in inventory of specialty pharmacies. While U.S. revenue also benefited from a price increase in the quarter, this was partially offset by an increase in managed care and government rebates. 
In Europe, TECFIDERA had strong sequential patient growth this quarter, driven by newly launched markets, including the U.K., Italy and Spain. Interferon revenues, including both Avonex and PLEGRIDY, increased 5% year-over-year to $785 million in the third quarter. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened interferon revenue by approximately $23 million year-over-year. 
Interferon revenues were comprised of $538 million in the U.S. and $247 million in sales outside the U.S. On a sequential basis, we believe the 18% increase in U.S. interferon revenue benefited from a wholesaler inventory rebalancing coming of the inventory drawdown in Q2, which contributed approximately $40 million. Outside the U.S., Avonex revenue benefited by approximately $16 million from the timing of shipments in Brazil and a clinical trial order in our rest of world business. 
TYSABRI continued to add patients this quarter with worldwide revenues of $480 million. These results were comprised of $284 million in the U.S. and $196 million internationally. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $23 million year-over-year. 
Turning to our hemophilia business. ALPROLIX revenue in Q3 was $66 million, and ELOCTATE was $91 million. In the U.S., after a period of rapid uptake for ALPROLIX with elevated switching in the market, we saw the switch rate start to moderate as roughly half of the moderate and severe hemophilia B patients treated prophylactically have switched to ALPROLIX. 
ELOCTATE has continued to grow in the U.S., and we saw increased breadth and depth of prescribing. Approximately 20% of moderate and severe prophylactic patients with hemophilia A have switched to ELOCTATE. Our U.S. profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA as well as our profit share and royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. were $337 million. 
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q3 cost of goods sold were $310 million or 11% of revenue. Q3 R&D expense was $520 million or 19% of revenues. This includes $48 million in upfront, in milestone expense related to our recently closed collaboration with EGTC. We made a $60 million milestone payment to Neurimmune this quarter, triggered by dosing of the first patient in, in the Phase III trials for aducanumab. This payment was an expense and presented within the noncontrolling interest line in the P&L. Q3 SG&A expense was $478 million or 17% of revenue as we continued to make steps in containing SG&A expenses. Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% for Q3. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $4.48 for the third quarter, an increase of 18% over Q3 2014. While there are a number of puts and takes in the quarter, we delivered a very solid quarter with solid results from the United States interferon business, continued European rollout of TECFIDERA, continued progress in the hemophilia franchise and meaningful cost control, absorbing the EGTC in Neurimmune payments. 
Let me turn to discuss our progress on returning capital to shareholders. Recall, our board had authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program in May of this year. Due to lower share price, we put in place a more robust share purchase plan in late July, effectively expediting the program. Through September 3rd -- 30, we've repurchased approximately 9.7 million shares of our common stock for a cost of approximately $3 billion. And since the end of the quarter, we have purchased an additional 3.2 million shares for approximately $900 million. Our current expectation is to complete the $5 billion share repurchase plan by the end of the year. In conjunction with funding our share repurchase program, we borrowed $6 billion of senior unsecured notes in mid-September. This included maturities of 5, 7, 10 and 30 years. We ended the quarter with approximately $7.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 60-40 between the U.S. and ex-U.S. 
Let me now provide additional detail on the corporate restructuring. The restructuring includes the termination of a number of pipeline programs and an 11% reduction in workforce. The reduction was the result of a number of actions, including the consolidation and elimination of certain overlapping groups across the organization and analytical and operational support in the marketing. Resizing portions of the company, where we felt there was excess capacity, including in our manufacturing operation, resizing our ex-U.S. Commercial operation and reductions driven by our de-emphasis of certain activities in immunology and fibrosis research and the termination of certain developing programs. We plan to complete the majority of the reduction of the global workforce by the end of 2015. The restructuring is expected to reduce the current annual run rate of operating expenses by approximately $250 million. We expect to incur a charge in the range of approximately $85 million to $95 million, primarily in the fourth quarter related to the restructuring. Additionally, we're currently in the middle of our financial planning for 2016 and aim toward additional savings in nonlabor expenses, with the objective of reducing lower priority fees and services expense. Conversely on the investment side, as we move into 2016, we're excited and plan to invest behind an emerging, mid- and late-stage pipeline, invest in TECFIDERA DTC and will potentially invest at risk behind prelaunch activities related to the potential commercialization of SMN-Rx.
While we'll outline our specific 2016 financial guidance in late January, we currently expect upward pressure in R&D and aimed for leverage in SG&A. We aim to achieve lower overall expense growth in the top line for 2016. The restructuring will yield real savings to enhance our operating results for 2016 and beyond, while also providing financial flexibility as we embark on a number of meaningful pipeline opportunities. Given the restructuring, change in capital structure and share repurchase activity this quarter, we're updating our full year 2015 guidance. Let me start with revenues. We now expect revenue growth between 8% and 9%, a modest increase versus prior guidance, reflecting the revenue strength seen this quarter. This guidance assumes modest patient growth in the U.S. for our MS products as a whole for the balance of the year. The revenue outlook also assumes a sequential decrease in Q4 due to the assumption of stable U.S. channel inventory levels for the balance of year in MS, and then a reduction in U.S. wholesaler inventory levels for RITUXAN. Non-GAAP full year R&D expense is expected to be between 19% and 20% of revenue, unchanged from prior guidance. Assuming deal closure, we'll book an approximately $60 million expense through R&D in the fourth quarter, relating to our agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe. 
Non-GAAP full year SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 19% to 20% of revenue, a decrease from prior guidance. We do expect to invest in TECFIDERA TV in Q4. We anticipate booking a GAAP charge of approximately $85 million to $95 million primarily in Q4 related to the restructuring. 
In conjunction with our recently completed bond offering, we now anticipate additional interest expense of approximately $60 million per quarter. We expect to end the year with approximately 219 million fully diluted shares, and have a full year weighted average diluted share count of approximately 231 million shares. We anticipate non-GAAP full year earnings per share results between $16.20 and $16.50. This represents an increase of 17% to 19% year-over-year. And GAAP earnings per share, we expect to be between $14.65 and $14.95. The increase versus prior guidance is due to stronger-than-anticipated revenues in Q3, taking costs out of the business and the share repurchase activity. 
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."

This year has been a challenging month for those of us here at Biogen, but I believe that we have a solid business and R&D pipeline with exceptional potential, a thoughtful capital allocation strategy, a well-controlled expense base",810,"Hey, thank you, Paul. This year has been a challenging month for those of us here at Biogen, but I believe that we have a solid business and R&D pipeline with exceptional potential, a thoughtful capital allocation strategy, a well-controlled expense base and a capable group of people who can execute against our goals. If we put aside quarterly revenue variations due to fluctuations in the inventory levels, FX or other factors, on a unit basis, we've seen moderate but steady growth in the underlying business. Our pipeline has matured, and I believe, the pipeline is more exciting and more promising than it was a year ago. Additional data for aducanumab and anti-LINGO increased our optimism about both of those compounds. We believe that MT-1303 has real potential in ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Raxatrigine had promising data in a controlled Phase II trial and we'll move to a Phase III trial in trigeminal neuralgia and a Phase IIb trial in sciatica. SMN-Rx data from the open label Phase II trial are encouraging, and we're looking forward to the Phase III data late next year or early 2017.
Additionally, our research has become truly world-class, and we're looking forward to giving you a deeper view of what we're doing at R&D day on November 3. In Q3, we began the execution of a thoughtful capital allocation strategy, we issued 6 billion of senior unsecured notes, which allowed us to take advantage of our lowered stock price to return approximately $4 billion to investors through stock buybacks, with an additional $1 billion to go. We have been able to reduce our share count substantially, while leaving adequate financial flexibility for strategic acquisitions compounds in our companies. We continue to consider opportunities within our core areas of expertise, both large and small and as always, we'll do so while being financially disciplined. The restructuring that we announced today was an extremely difficult decision, and all of us feel deeply for the affected employees. These people are our friends and colleagues, and they have played a big role in the successes that Biogen has had up until now. They're good people, good employees and it truly saddens us to have to take this action. On behalf of the senior leadership team, I want to express our sincere appreciation for the work that everyone at Biogen has done. 
Although this action is extremely difficult, it's a necessary step in order for us to fulfill our goals as a company. I believe that our mid- and late-stage pipeline is larger and higher quality than it has ever been. Aducanumab, SMN-Rx, Raxatrigine and MT-1303 either are, or soon will be, in the Phase III, and we're hopeful that LINGO will join them next year. These programs will require substantial investments, and we believe a restructuring will allow us to aggressively conduct these programs, while maintaining healthy earnings growth. Next year, we expect to have meaningful clinical data from SMN-Rx, anti-LINGO, BAN2401, our base inhibitor E2609, and we hope to gain approval for ZINBRYTA and for 2 of our biosimilar molecules. 
So our pipeline has both near-term and longer-term potential to add value to patients and the company, and we need to be able to adequately fund these exciting programs. The restructuring helps us to do so. Before I conclude, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Tony Kingsley's contributions to Biogen. Tony joined Biogen over 5 years ago, and was instrumental in leading the successful introduction of several important new therapies that helped serve patients around the world. I want to publicly thank Tony, for all that he has done and wish him all the best in his next endeavor. Tony built an extremely capable team, and I believe that we have the people and programs in place to maximize the potential of our commercial portfolio. In the interim, leadership of this group will be assumed by John Cox, EVP of Pharmaceutical Operations and Technology. John has been with Biogen for over 12 years, has a good understanding of all aspects of our business and I believe that he will effectively lead this group. 
So as we move forward, we're starting from a good base and we'll focus on 5 key goals: One, maximize the potential of our commercial portfolio; two, aggressively advance our mid- and late-stage clinical programs to get them done on or ahead of schedule; three, continue our emphasis on world-class science and medicine; four, carefully control our costs; and five, pursuing nonorganic growth opportunities. 
We're energized by the potential that we have to transform the lives of patients around the world and by doing so, to do right for our shareholders. I can't promise you success in everything that we do, but I can promise you our commitment and dedication. 
And with that, we'll now open up the call for questions."

On the other hand, we think we have proof of biology based on the optic neuritis study. We believe that the results portend that we're getting the biology we want.

Those are, I would call, active from the inflammatory point of view and there clearly was -- we saw what we had seen in the past in inflammatory disease with TYSABRI. In the noninflammatory group, which was I think the majority of patients, we think we see something in the upper extremity. However, we did not see an effect on the other 2 components of the primary endpoint, which was the EDSS and the Timed 25-Foot Walk. And so we were disappointed in the fact that we didn't see an effect on ambulation, and so I think that's the reason why the primary endpoint was negative. I would say that upper extremity function is important in patients particularly if their ambulation is starting to get lost, so that's why we're going to present these results next year at a scientific meeting."

And our planning that we're doing now is through effectively have it ongoing throughout the majority of 2016. I think the overall objective isn't that similar to what we saw early on in the launch is that TECFIDERA, when it came early on the launch, expanded the market, activated new patients, many of them that had gotten injections, fatigue on the sidelines. And I think the thinking here is to activate those patients, activating a whole set of patients through patient awareness, which we do have some data that actually suggests that it's a relatively low level of patient awareness, or said another way, at least that there's a big opportunity in driving patient awareness. And we also have data that suggests that when a patient comes to a doctor, particularly in the United States with a preferred therapy, that is often the therapy that the patient goes on. So that's kind of a bit of the core thesis, and we look forward to kind of moving forward with it."

It's a question of value of what you get for what you pay. And we've been financially disciplined in the past. I think we've brought in some attractive assets, MT-1303 and Raxatrigine in the past several months. I think those are very interesting compounds. We will continue to look for compounds like that, that we believe are high-quality compounds with reasonable chances of success and making a difference on the market base that we can acquire at a cost that makes sense for us. So we're looking at some small things, we're looking at some large things and it's not so much question of the size but is of making solid, strategic medical and financial decisions."

But there are other characteristics of the molecule that lead it to have a, we think, an interesting effect on the heart rate, which we believe is one of the key issues associated with first dose administration. And so it was -- that was attractive. On TYSABRI, I don't think TYSABRI is used very much in PPMS. In fact, there are no effective therapies for PPMS.

Third quarter was marked by significant progress across several key areas. We delivered 11% revenue growth and 18% non-GAAP EPS growth as we continued to see modest patient growth across the portfolio. We have several important developments in our pipeline. We initiated enrollment for our Phase III clinical program for aducanumab in Alzheimer's disease. We announced Phase III results for TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS, which Al will cover in more detail later in the call, and we continue to strengthen our pipeline by announcing an agreement to exclusively license MT-1303 from Mitsubishi Tanabe. 
On the commercial front, we remained committed to improving our commercial trajectory with a particular emphasis on TECFIDERA. Our market research continues to indicate that prescribers believe TECFIDERA has a very strong benefit risk profile. However, patient growth in the U.S. and Germany remains challenging, and we're actively working to improve this dynamic. We've increased sales cost for TECFIDERA as we continue to educate physicians on TECFIDERA's strong efficacy and favorable safety profile and its label and monitoring requirements. We've also increased our direct-to-consumer marketing in the U.S., including the recently launched television campaign that some of you may have seen. 
We also made significant progress on capital allocation. Through yesterday, we've returned approximately $3.9 billion to our shareholders through the repurchase of our common stock. Importantly, Biogen still retains strategic flexibility to support both continued business development and potentially larger-scale acquisitions. We remain focused on strengthening and expanding our early-stage pipeline through tuck-in acquisitions and collaborations, a strategy that has produced assets such as TECFIDERA, ELOCTATE, ALPROLIX, aducanumab, ISIS-SMNRx and Raxatrigine. We're actively looking for late-stage and commercial assets which have the potential to add both strategic value and near-term revenue growth, while maintaining financial discipline. 
Today, we also announced the corporate restructuring that we believe will best position the company to achieve our strategic priorities. This decision to reduce our workforce was extremely difficult, and we're very thankful for the hard work and contributions of our talented colleagues and friends. As part of our efforts to focus on key commercial initiatives and high potential pipeline candidate, we've also made a decision to discontinue several pipeline programs that include TECFIDERA in secondary progressive MS as well as certain programs in immunology and fibrosis research, including anti-TWEAK. 
Importantly, we plan to reinvest the savings from this restructuring into key commercial initiatives and a number of prioritized programs across our emerging, mid- and late-stage pipeline, including commercial initiatives aimed at increasing sales of marketing therapies, including new direct-to-consumer marketing programs for TECFIDERA, the advancement of aducanumab, BAN2401 and E2609 for Alzheimer's disease, anti-LINGO for multiple sclerosis, ISIS-SMNRx for spinal muscular atrophy, our recently acquired asset from Convergence, Raxatrigine for trigeminal neuralgia and other pain indications, and MT-1303 for inflammatory bowel disease, and other autoimmune diseases. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Al for an update on R&D."

We have important clinical study readouts and good progress, advancing the new generation of mid- and late-stage clinical programs. This morning, we reported top line results from the Phase III ASCEND study for TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS. The objective of ASCEND was to determine whether TYSABRI had an impact on slowing disability progression unrelated to relapses in patients with SPMS. Most patients that enrolled in ASCEND had nonrelapsing SPMS and had EDSS scores of 6.0 to 6.5. ASCEND did not achieve its primary or secondary endpoints, and we do not intend to file for label expansion. We are disappointed in these results as SPMS is a serious condition with no effective therapies. 
ASCEND study results did demonstrate that TYSABRI had a robust impact on relapses and MRI measures of disease consistent with its known clinical profile in relapsing MS. Study results also indicated that TYSABRI had a statistically significant effect on upper limb function measured by the 9-Hole Peg Test, which was a component of the composite primary endpoint. Full study results would be reported at a future medical meeting. 
Moving on to our other MS development programs, at the ECTRIMS meeting earlier this month, we presented an additional analysis from RENEW, a Phase II study that evaluated anti-LINGO in patients with acute optic neuritis, the top line results of which we reported earlier this year. About half the patients in RENEW underwent multifocal visually-evoked potential testing, a method that allows us to record electrical responses produced in the occipital cortex upon stimulation of small segments within the retina. 
First, we found an anti-LINGO had an effect on the recovery of the multifocal VEP amplitude recorded by stimulating the eye that was affected by the optic neuritis. Interestingly, we also found that anti-LINGO treatment preserved the multifocal VEP amplitude recorded by stimulating the opposite eye, which was seen to be deteriorating in the placebo group, likely due to lesions developing in the visual system as a result of some of these patients being in the early stages of MS. We believe that these results further support our previously reported findings and provide evidence that anti-LINGO may have neuroprotective properties. 
We continue to expect top line results from the Phase II synergy study in MS in mid-2016. Turning to ZINBRYTA, The New England Journal Medicine has just published the results of the ZINBRYTA Phase III DECIDE study. In DECIDE, ZINBRYTA demonstrated a compelling 45% improvement in annualized relapse rate compared to interferon therapy. If approved, we believe ZINBRYTA could be an important new therapeutic option for relapsing MS patients. 
At ECTRIMS, Roche presented positive Phase III results in both relapsing and primary progressive MS for ocrelizumab, a product in which we have a business interest. Results from 2 Phase III studies in relapsing MS showed a 46% and 47% reduction in annualized relapse rate compared to interferon therapy. 
Ocrelizumab also demonstrated a significant role in the treatment of primary progressive MS, a serious neurodegenerative condition for which there are no approved therapies. If approved, it will be wonderful to be able to offer these patients a meaningful new therapy. 
Turning to our hemophilia therapies. ELOCTA, which is the approved European trade name for ELOCTATE, obtained a positive recommendation from the CHMP as a therapy for hemophilia A. If approved in the EU, ELOCTA would be commercialized there by our collaborator, Sobi. At the 2015 National Hemophilia Foundation Meeting, new ALPROLIX data showed a beneficial long-term safety and efficacy profile in patients with hemophilia B. Favorable long-term clinical results for ELOCTATE treatment of patients with hemophilia A were also recently published. 
Moving to the aducanumab Phase III program for patients with early Alzheimer's disease, we have initiated clinical sites in both the EMERGE and ENGAGE studies, and the first study subjects have now been enrolled. We are pleased to have received FDA agreement on a Special Protocol Assessment on the aducanumab Phase III study protocols. 
We have previously reported that ARIA or amyloid-related imaging abnormality was the most significant adverse event observed in the aducanumab Phase Ib study. All patients currently enrolling in the Phase III studies of aducanumab are undergoing dose titration in an effort to mitigate the risk of ARIA. Preliminary data from the Phase Ib study suggests that dose titration does seem to reduce the incidence of ARIA although these findings will need to be confirmed with further study. We continue to obtain additional clinical data from the Phase Ib study, and we anticipate discussing these results at a scientific meeting in the second half of next year. 
We have made progress in expanding our development pipeline by acquiring rights to MT-1303, a Phase III ready program with potential in multiple autoimmune diseases. At the recent ECTRIMS meeting, Mitsubishi Tanabe presented compelling results from a 415-patient Phase II study in MS. Results demonstrated that MT-1303 did not cause a decrease in heart rate with administration of the first dose, even without dose titration. This characteristic of the molecule may serve to eventually differentiate it from other S1P modulators. We anticipate deal completion in the fourth quarter, and we intend to initiate Phase III studies and inflammatory bowel disease as soon as possible next year. We continue to evaluate potential further development in MS. 
Progress has also been made with several early-stage programs. BIIB061, an oral treatment being developed as a potential reparative therapy for MS has successfully completed Phase I studies. We recently initiated a Phase I study for BIIB054, a monoclonal antibody targeting alpha-synuclein, which is being developed as a potential disease-modifying therapy for Parkinson's disease. The target of BIIB054, alpha-synuclein, is a major component of Lewy Bodies, a pathologic hallmark of Parkinson's disease. 
R&D continues to make good progress, advancing the next wave of therapies and development candidates. Next year, we anticipate the approval of ZINBRYTA for relapsing MS. We also intend to initiate a number of clinical studies, including a Phase III study of MT-1303 in IBD, a Phase III study for Raxatrigine for trigeminal neuralgia as well as a Phase II study of BIIB061 in MS. We're also looking forward to several upcoming clinical readouts, including Phase III results for SMN-Rx and spinal muscular atrophy, Phase II results for anti-LINGO in MS and interim Phase II results for BAN2401 and E2609, both for Alzheimer's disease. We look forward to a deeper discussion of these pipeline programs and other initiatives at our upcoming R&D Investor Day on November 3. 
I'll now pass the call to Paul."

Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.15 in the third quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.48. Total revenue for Q3 grew 11% year-over-year to approximately $2.8 billion. Foreign exchange, offset by hedging, weakened",1406,"Thanks, Al. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.15 in the third quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $4.48. Total revenue for Q3 grew 11% year-over-year to approximately $2.8 billion. Foreign exchange, offset by hedging, weakened total revenue by approximately $63 million year-over-year. Global third quarter TECFIDERA revenue was $937 million, an increase of 19% versus Q3 of last year and an increase of 6% versus the prior quarter. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened TECFIDERA revenue by approximately $12 million year-over-year. This quarter's TECFIDERA revenues consisted of $754 million in the U.S. and $183 million outside the U.S. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, U.S. TECFIDERA revenue increased 5% partially due to an increase in inventory of specialty pharmacies. While U.S. revenue also benefited from a price increase in the quarter, this was partially offset by an increase in managed care and government rebates. 
In Europe, TECFIDERA had strong sequential patient growth this quarter, driven by newly launched markets, including the U.K., Italy and Spain. Interferon revenues, including both Avonex and PLEGRIDY, increased 5% year-over-year to $785 million in the third quarter. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened interferon revenue by approximately $23 million year-over-year. 
Interferon revenues were comprised of $538 million in the U.S. and $247 million in sales outside the U.S. On a sequential basis, we believe the 18% increase in U.S. interferon revenue benefited from a wholesaler inventory rebalancing coming off the inventory drawdown in Q2, which contributed approximately $40 million. Outside the U.S., Avonex revenue benefited by approximately $16 million from the timing of shipments in Brazil and a clinical trial order in our rest of world business. 
TYSABRI continued to add patients this quarter with worldwide revenues of $480 million. These results were comprised of $284 million in the U.S. and $196 million internationally. Foreign exchange impact, offset by hedging, weakened TYSABRI revenue by approximately $23 million year-over-year. 
Turning to our hemophilia business. ALPROLIX revenue in Q3 was $66 million, and ELOCTATE was $91 million. In the U.S., after a period of rapid uptake for ALPROLIX with elevated switching in the market, we saw the switch rate start to moderate as roughly half of the moderate and severe hemophilia B patients treated prophylactically have switched to ALPROLIX. 
ELOCTATE has continued to grow in the U.S., and we saw increased breadth and depth of prescribing. Approximately 20% of moderate and severe prophylactic patients with hemophilia A have switched to ELOCTATE. Our U.S. profit share for RITUXAN and GAZYVA as well as our profit share and royalties on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. were $337 million. 
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q3 cost of goods sold were $310 million or 11% of revenue. Q3 R&D expense was $520 million or 19% of revenues. This includes $48 million in upfront, in milestone expense related to our recently closed collaboration with EGTC. We made a $60 million milestone payment to Neurimmune this quarter, triggered by dosing of the first patient in, in the Phase III trials for aducanumab. This payment was an expense and presented within the noncontrolling interest line in the P&L. Q3 SG&A expense was $478 million or 17% of revenue as we continued to make steps in containing SG&A expenses. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 24% for Q3. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $4.48 for the third quarter, an increase of 18% over Q3 2014. While there are a number of puts and takes in the quarter, we delivered a very solid quarter with solid results from the United States interferon business, continued European rollout of TECFIDERA, continued progress in the hemophilia franchise and meaningful cost control, absorbing the EGTC in Neurimmune payments. 
Let me turn to discuss our progress on returning capital to shareholders. Recall, our board had authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program in May of this year. Due to lower share price, we put in place a more robust share purchase plan in late July, effectively expediting the program. Through September 3 -- 30, we've repurchased approximately 9.7 million shares of our common stock for a cost of approximately $3 billion. And since the end of the quarter, we have purchased an additional 3.2 million shares for approximately $900 million. Our current expectation is to complete the $5 billion share repurchase plan by the end of the year. In conjunction with funding our share repurchase program, we borrowed $6 billion of senior unsecured notes in mid-September. This included maturities of 5, 7, 10 and 30 years. We ended the quarter with approximately $7.8 billion in cash and marketable securities, split approximately 60-40 between the U.S. and ex-U.S. 
Let me now provide additional detail on the corporate restructuring. The restructuring includes the termination of a number of pipeline programs and an 11% reduction in workforce. The reduction was the result of a number of actions, including the consolidation and elimination of certain overlapping groups across the organization and analytical and operational support in the [ph] marketing. Resizing portions of the company, where we felt there was excess capacity, including in our manufacturing operation, resizing our ex-U.S. Commercial operation and reductions driven by our de-emphasis of certain activities in immunology and fibrosis research and the termination of certain developing programs. We plan to complete the majority of the reduction of the global workforce by the end of 2015. The restructuring is expected to reduce the current annual run rate of operating expenses by approximately $250 million. We expect to incur a charge in the range of approximately $85 million to $95 million, primarily in the fourth quarter related to the restructuring. Additionally, we're currently in the middle of our financial planning for 2016 and aim toward additional savings in nonlabor expenses, with the objective of reducing lower priority fees and services expense. Conversely on the investment side, as we move into 2016, we're excited and plan to invest behind an emerging, mid- and late-stage pipeline, invest in TECFIDERA DTC and will potentially invest at risk behind prelaunch activities related to the potential commercialization of SMN-Rx.
While we'll outline our specific 2016 financial guidance in late January, we currently expect upward pressure in R&D and aimed for leverage in SG&A. We aim to achieve lower overall expense growth in the top line for 2016. The restructuring will yield real savings to enhance our operating results for 2016 and beyond, while also providing financial flexibility as we embark on a number of meaningful pipeline opportunities. 
Given the restructuring, change in capital structure and share repurchase activity this quarter, we're updating our full year 2015 guidance. Let me start with revenues. We now expect revenue growth between 8% and 9%, a modest increase versus prior guidance, reflecting the revenue strength seen this quarter. This guidance assumes modest patient growth in the U.S. for our MS products as a whole for the balance of the year. The revenue outlook also assumes a sequential decrease in Q4 due to the assumption of stable U.S. channel inventory levels for the balance of year in MS, and then a reduction in U.S. wholesaler inventory levels for RITUXAN. Non-GAAP full year R&D expense is expected to be between 19% and 20% of revenue, unchanged from prior guidance. Assuming deal closure, we'll book an approximately $60 million expense through R&D in the fourth quarter, relating to our agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe. 
Non-GAAP full year SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 19% to 20% of revenue, a decrease from prior guidance. We do expect to invest in TECFIDERA TV in Q4. We anticipate booking a GAAP charge of approximately $85 million to $95 million primarily in Q4 related to the restructuring. 
In conjunction with our recently completed bond offering, we now anticipate additional interest expense of approximately $60 million per quarter. We expect to end the year with approximately 219 million fully diluted shares, and have a full year weighted average diluted share count of approximately 231 million shares. We anticipate non-GAAP full year earnings per share results between $16.20 and $16.50. This represents an increase of 17% to 19% year-over-year. And GAAP earnings per share, we expect to be between $14.65 and $14.95. The increase versus prior guidance is due to stronger-than-anticipated revenues in Q3, taking costs out of the business and the share repurchase activity. 
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments."
29726,311922532,879005,"Biogen Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2015",2015-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Biogen Inc.","Executives","Okay, thank you, Paul. This year has been a challenging month for those of us here at Biogen, but I believe that we have a solid business and R&D pipeline with exceptional potential, a thoughtful capital allocation strategy, a well-controlled expense base",810,"Okay, thank you, Paul. This year has been a challenging month for those of us here at Biogen, but I believe that we have a solid business and R&D pipeline with exceptional potential, a thoughtful capital allocation strategy, a well-controlled expense base and a capable group of people who can execute against our goals. If we put aside quarterly revenue variations due to fluctuations in the inventory levels, FX or other factors, on a unit basis, we've seen moderate but steady growth in the underlying business. 
Our pipeline has matured, and I believe, the pipeline is more exciting and more promising than it was a year ago. Additional data for aducanumab and anti-LINGO increased our optimism about both of those compounds. We believe that MT-1303 has real potential in ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Raxatrigine had promising data in a controlled Phase II trial and we'll move to a Phase III trial in trigeminal neuralgia and a Phase IIb trial in sciatica. SMN-Rx data from the open label Phase II trial are encouraging, and we're looking forward to the Phase III data late next year or early 2017.
Additionally, our research has become truly world-class, and we're looking forward to giving you a deeper view of what we're doing at R&D Day on November 3. In Q3, we began the execution of a thoughtful capital allocation strategy, we issued $6 billion of senior unsecured notes, which allowed us to take advantage of our lower stock price to return approximately $4 billion to investors through stock buybacks, with an additional $1 billion to go. We have been able to reduce our share count substantially, while leaving adequate financial flexibility for strategic acquisitions, compounds and our companies. 
We continue to consider opportunities within our core areas of expertise, both large and small and as always, we'll do so while being financially disciplined. The restructuring that we announced today was an extremely difficult decision, and all of us feel deeply for the affected employees. These people are our friends and colleagues, and they have played a big role in the successes that Biogen has had up until now. They're good people, good employees and it truly saddens us to have to take this action. On behalf of the senior leadership team, I want to express our sincere appreciation for the work that everyone at Biogen has done. 
Although this action is extremely difficult, it's a necessary step in order for us to fulfill our goals as a company. I believe that our mid- and late-stage pipeline is larger and higher quality than it has ever been. Aducanumab, SMN-Rx, Raxatrigine and MT-1303 either are, or soon will be, in the Phase III, and we're hopeful that LINGO will join them next year. These programs will require substantial investments, and we believe a restructuring will allow us to aggressively conduct these programs, while maintaining healthy earnings growth. Next year, we expect to have meaningful clinical data from SMN-Rx, anti-LINGO, BAN2401, our base inhibitor E2609, and we hope to gain approval for ZINBRYTA and for 2 of our biosimilar molecules. 
So our pipeline has both near-term and longer-term potential to add value to patients and the company, and we need to be able to adequately fund these exciting programs. The restructuring helps us to do so. Before I conclude, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Tony Kingsley's contributions to Biogen. Tony joined Biogen over 5 years ago, and was instrumental in leading the successful introduction of several important new therapies that helped serve patients around the world. I want to publicly thank Tony, for all that he has done and wish him all the best in his next endeavor. Tony built an extremely capable team, and I believe that we have the people and programs in place to maximize the potential of our commercial portfolio. In the interim, leadership of this group will be assumed by John Cox, EVP of Pharmaceutical Operations and Technology. John has been with Biogen for over 12 years, has a good understanding of all aspects of our business and I believe that he will effectively lead this group. 
So as we move forward, we're starting from a good base and we'll focus on 5 key goals: One, maximize the potential of our commercial portfolio; two, aggressively advance our mid- and late-stage clinical programs to get them done on or ahead of schedule; three, continue our emphasis on world-class science and medicine; four, carefully control our costs and five, pursuing nonorganic growth opportunities. 
We're energized by the potential that we have to transform the lives of patients around the world and by doing so, to do right for our shareholders. I can't promise you success in everything that we do, but I can promise you our commitment and dedication. 
And with that, we'll now open up the call for questions."

In terms of the anti-LINGO, I mean, look, it's high risk. I mean, nobody has ever even attempted really that I know to repair the Central Nervous System and it's a tall order. On the other hand, we think we have proof of biology based on the optic neuritis study. We believe that the results portend that we're getting the biology we want. The key question for me is that biology going to lead to a clinically meaningful effect, and that's what we're hoping to see in the MS trials."

However, we did not see an effect on the other 2 components of the primary endpoint, which was the EDSS and the Timed 25-Foot Walk.

I think the overall objective isn't that dissimilar to what we saw early on in the launch is that TECFIDERA, when it came early on the launch, expanded the market, activated new patients, many of them that had gotten injections, fatigue on the sidelines. And I think the thinking here is to activate those patients, activating a whole set of patients through patient awareness, which we do have some data that actually suggests that it's a relatively low level of patient awareness, or said another way, at least that there's a big opportunity in driving patient awareness. And we also have data that suggests that when a patient comes to a doctor, particularly in the United States with a preferred therapy, that is often the therapy that the patient goes on. So that's kind of a bit of the core thesis, and we look forward to kind of moving forward with it."

My understanding is that sometime next year we'll see some data from the BACE inhibitor.

I'm assuming that tuck-in probably means in line with what you guys have done in the past and want to get that perspective from you? And then maybe how you would you prioritize capital allocation with the stock, where it is now versus buybacks? What the stock rate is today versus deal activity?"

I mean, look, I think we're going to try to have our P&L in a way set up that we can not have internal friction to do the classic tuck-in type deals. That's how we've done it over the last couple of years. And at this point, for the fourth quarter, it's essentially the Mitsubishi Tanabe expense that we expect assuming HSR clearance. We'll try to allow ourselves that -- the normal type as we go into 2016. In terms of capital allocation, we certainly don't want to be opaque but I think this is in the category of it depends. We definitely aimed towards -- all of our decisions on capital allocation is about driving intrinsic value, shareholder value creation. So when we see great opportunities in terms of doing that for returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases, we'll execute against that. We certainly shown that action over the last 60 days. And as George had mentioned, we feel we have an absolute obligation to build the business in a financial disciplined ways with larger deployments if we can achieve that."

And we're hopeful, if LINGO has data next year that justify moving that forward, that will be a fifth and we certainly want to leave capacity to move LINGO forward should that Phase II data justify it doing so. So I think anything that we would look to in-licensed that would go immediately into Phase III would have to cross a pretty high hurdle, right? We will -- we're continuing to look for compounds at all stages. I think, and at this point with particular emphasis on the earlier pipeline."
