315117,282917489,759953,"Wisconsin Energy Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2014 year end results. Let me begin as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President",2823,"Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2014 year end results. Let me begin as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of Wisconsin Energy and CEO of our Generation Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber our Treasurer. Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, and as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $2.65 a share for 2014. This compares with earnings of $2.51 a share for 2013. Our adjusted earnings exclude expenses of $0.06 a share related to our acquisition of the Integrys Energy Group. 
I'm very pleased to report you to you that 2014 was another exceptional year for Wisconsin Energy. We delivered record financial results; we were named the Most Reliable Utility in the Midwest for the fourth year in a row, extending our strong track record of network reliability and customer satisfaction; we invested nearly $740 million in our core business with all major projects on time and on budget; we achieved the safest year of operation in the history of the company, which dates back more than 100 years; and we announced the acquisition of Integrys Energy. We believe the combination of our 2 companies will create the premier regulated utility system in the Midwest, with superior service and competitive pricing for years to come. The benefits to all of our stakeholders are clear, compelling and achievable. 
Turning now to the state of the economy, Wisconsin's unemployment rate declined to 5.2% at the end of 2014, well below the national average and the state's lowest unemployment rate since 2008. As the economy continued to improve over the course of the year, deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers began to strengthen as well. On a weather-normal basis for the year, our large customers, excluding the iron ore mines, consumed approximately 1.3% more electricity than they did in 2013. We also saw steady improvement in several important sectors of the state's economy, including paper manufacturing, food products, primary metals and rubber and plastics production. In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system, particularly in our natural gas distribution business. For example, new electric service connections were up by 5.7% for the year, but new natural gas installations rose by more than 28% during 2014. 
Later in my remarks, I'll update you on several developments in our core business, as well as the important construction projects we have underway. But first, I'd like to discuss our progress in obtaining regulatory approvals for the acquisition of Integrys. Now to refresh your memory, on June 23 of 2014, we announced our plan to acquire Integrys in a cash and stock transaction. Combining the 2 companies to form the WEC Energy Group will create a strong electric and natural gas delivery company with deep operational expertise, scale and the financial resources to meet the region's future energy needs. We'll serve more than 4.3 million customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota. In fact, the combination will create the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in America, and the strong cash flow of the combined company will be invested prudently in new and upgraded energy infrastructure for the region. Now as you're well aware, we have consistently used 3 criteria to evaluate any potential acquisition opportunity. First, we would have to believe that the acquisition would be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing; second, it would need to be largely credit-neutral; and, finally, we would have to believe that the long-term growth rate of any acquisition would be at least equal to Wisconsin Energy's stand-alone growth rate. Our analysis continues to show that the combination meets or exceeds all 3 criteria. We expect the combined company will be able to grow earnings per share at 5% to 7% per year, faster than either one of us is projecting on a stand-alone basis. And importantly, more than 99% of these earnings would come from regulated businesses.  Our customers will clearly benefit from the operational efficiency that comes with increased scale and geographic proximity, and over time, we'll enhance the operations of the 7 utilities that will be part of our energy group by incorporating best practices system-wide. In addition, as many of you know, Integrys today is one of the major owners of American Transmission Company with a 34.1% interest. Wisconsin Energy is the second-largest owner with a 26.2% interest. That means the combined entity will have a 60% stake in one of the largest transmission companies in the country. ATC, of course, has a 10 year capital investment plan to bolster electric reliability in our region. In fact, ATC's capital plan for the years 2014 to 2023 calls for investment of between $3.3 billion and $3.9 billion. We believe it's a solid plan, and we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. 
So where do we stand in gaining the necessary approvals? Again, to refresh your memory, the proposed acquisition was approved by Wisconsin Energy and Integrys shareholders back on November 21, 2014. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice completed its review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act on October 24, 2014, with no further action required by the company. As you know, the transaction also requires the approval of several regulatory agencies, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Wisconsin and Michigan Public Service Commissions, the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. We filed with all 4 state utility commissions in early August and we're currently working through each of the proceedings. Perhaps the most notable regulatory development has occurred in Michigan, where we reached a settlement last month that helps to pave the way for the acquisition while addressing electric reliability concerns in the upper peninsula. I'll talk about the settlement in more detail in just a moment, but it's important to note that the Michigan Governor, the Michigan Attorney General and the iron ore mines all sent letters to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in January stating that they have no objections to our transaction. These parties will not oppose, will not condition or delay the consummation of the transaction in any proceeding of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In addition, the State Attorney General, the Michigan commission staff and the mines will not seek or support any other conditions to the merger and proceedings at the Michigan Public Service Commission. And the Michigan Commission has set a schedule now that calls for a decision by June 15 of this year. In Wisconsin, the commission expects to vote on the acquisition no later than April 16. In Illinois, the Commerce Commission staff has proposed a schedule that calls for a decision 2 days after the fourth on July 6th, 2015. And the Minnesota commission is expected to review our application in early May. Finally, at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the public comment periods in our merger case are now closed and we continue to work diligently to gain FERC approval.  In summary, we're making very good progress on all regulatory fonts and we still anticipate closing the transaction during the second half of 2015. 
Two final items related to our acquisition of Integrys. Back in June, Integrys announced the sale of its unregulated power and natural gas marketing business. That sale was completed on November 3, 2014 to a subsidiary of Exelon. The other item relates to the Michigan settlement that I discussed earlier. That settlement calls for the sale of the electric distribution assets owned by both Wisconsin Energy and Integrys in the Upper Peninsula, as well the ale of our of our Presque Isle power plant to Upper Peninsula power company. Under the terms of that agreement, Wisconsin energy's distribution assets will be sold for an amount slightly higher than book value. Subject to state regulatory approval, we intend to return that premium over book value to our customers. The Presque Isle plant will be sold for $1, reflecting the current market value of the facility. As you may recall, we attempt to sell Presque Isle last year, but we did not receive any valid offers. We expect to treat the plant sale as an asset retirement, and we seek recovery of the approximately $200 million of net undercovered plant balance consistent with prior regulatory practice. Customers in both Wisconsin and Michigan will clearly benefit from this agreement. Once the Presque Isla plant is sold, Wisconsin customers no longer have to pay for the operating costs associated with the plant. Our Michigan customers will also avoid short-term costs. And Michigan's Upper Peninsula will have more control over its energy future as it will no longer be part of a single Wisconsin-Michigan system. An end, this agreement addresses the needs of all parties in the settlement, and clears the way for Michigan State regulatory approval of our proposed acquisition. 
And now turning to recent developments in our core business, as you may recall last July, we received the final written order from the Wisconsin Commission approving our request to build and operate a new major natural gas lateral in West Central Wisconsin. The 85 miles of pipeline and connected facilities will run from Northern Oclar County in the far Western part of the state, to the City of Tomah in West Central Wisconsin. The project will address natural gas reliability concerns in that region, it will also help meet the demand being driven by customers converting from propane to natural gas and by the growth of the sand mining industry in that part of the state. The commission's approval also includes franchise awards for 10 communities along the route, and authorizes us to begin delivering natural gas within the borders of those communities. 
In October, we began work on portions of the downstream facilities. Two of the 3 branch lines were installed as of mid-November. Construction on the third branchline began in January, and of course we have one major large diameter lateral to install. Route clearing for that lateral also began early this year. We expect to complete the entire project in the fourth quarter of this year at a projected cost of $175 million to $185 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. 
On the generation side of our business, you'll recall that we're converting the fuel source for our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. The 2 unit valley plant is a cogeneration facility located along the Menomonee River near downtown Milwaukee. Valley generates electricity for the grid, produces steam for more than 400 customers in the downtown Milwaukee business center and provides voltage support for our electric distribution network. I'm pleased to report that the project remains on schedule and on budget. Unit 1 achieved commercial operation burning natural gas back in November. The entire Valley plant is available to operate at full power at this time, with Unit 1 natural gas and Unit 2 continuing to burn coal. And we expect Unit 2 to be converted to natural gas in time for next winter's heating season.  Overall, the project is currently about 66% complete. We expect the total conversion costs to be between $65 million and $70 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Converting Valley to natural gas will reduce our operating costs and enhance the environmental performance of the units. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at 280 megawatts, and we believe our plan will help support a vibrant downtown Milwaukee for many years to come. 
Now I'd like to touch on the upgrade of our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant. The Twin Falls was built in 1912 and is one of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. The plant is located on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Construction now underway to build a new powerhouse and its spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. We continue to make good progress on the major construction work at Twin Falls. The Upstream Cofferdam has been completed, and rock excavation is well underway. Overall, the project, as we speak today, is approximately 37% complete. We plan to begin construction of the new powerhouse this spring and expect commercial operation of the new powerhouse to begin in the summer of 2016. The total investment is budgeted at $60 million to $65 million excluding funds used during construction. 
Also we continue to make excellent progress on our initiative to improve fuel flexibility at the Oak Creek expansion units. As you recall, these units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal. However, given the cost differential now between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the 2 types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year, depending on the bland. In 2013, we received the necessary environmental approvals, began making changes to the boilers and started testing various lens of bituminous and PRB coal at the plant. With a few modifications, both units can sustain a 20% PRB blend. We've also conducted limited testing on unit 2 at various levels up to 100% PRB. Although testing has gone well, there are operational issues that needed to be solved and equipment that must be modified to sustain the higher blends of PRB coal on a long-term basis. So on July of last year, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission to improve additional capital spending for modifications of the plant. Our share of that investment would be approximately $21 million. If approved, the modifications are expected to support sustained operation and up to 60% PRB and allow us to continue testing blends up to 100% PRB. Also it's very clear that you need space and equipment to handle additional coal inventory at the site. As a result, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission in October of last year for an expanded coal storage facility and additional handling equipment. Our estimated capital cost for this particular project is $58 million. We hope to receive commission approval for both of these projects in the second half of this year. 
Looking forward, we see a significant investment opportunities in our existing core business as we continue to upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on delivering the future. Our updated capital budget, and this is new information, our updated capital budget calls for spending $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion over the 5-year period 2015 through 2019. Our rolling 10 year capital budget, now calls for investing between $6.6 billion and $7.2 billion over the appeared period 2015 through 2024. 
Turning now to our dividend policy, at its January meeting, our Board of Directors raised our quarterly dividend to 42 and a quarter cents a share, an increase of 8.3% over the dividend paid during 2014. The new quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual rate of $1.69 a share. The board also reaffirmed our standalone dividend policy that targets a payout ratio trending to 65% to 70% of earnings in 2017. The payout ratio is more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector. At the closing of the Integrys acquisition, I expect to increase in the dividend again by 7% to 0% for Wisconsin energy shareholders to reflect the dividend policy of the combined company. And then going forward, the projected payout target for the combined company is expected to be 65% to 70% of earnings. 
And, finally, turning to Wisconsin REIT matters, in December, the Wisconsin Commission issued its final order on our REIT filings for the years 2016 and 2016. The order approved a net bill increase of 1/10 of 1% related to the nonfuel cost for our retail electric customers in Wisconsin. The new rates will went into effect in January 1. The order also approved an increase in the fixed portion of our customers monthly bills while correspondingly reducing the kilowatt hour charge. As you know, higher fixed charge and a lower energy charge more accurately reflect our cost structure. Lastly, the commission approved the return on equity of 10.2% for Wisconsin Energy and 10.3% for Wisconsin Gas. it also authorize an increase of the Wisconsin gas common equity component on average of 49.5%, up from 47.5%. The midpoint of Wisconsin electricity component remains unchanged at 51%. 
In summary, ladies and gentlemen, 2014 was another year of achievement for Wisconsin Energy, the company continues to perform at a high level both financially and operationally and our proposed acquisition of Integrys positions us well for strong future growth if we focus on delivering the future. And now with more details, on our full year performance and our outlook for 2015, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?"
315117,282917489,759953,"Wisconsin Energy Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, for 2014, our adjusted earnings grew to $2.65 a share compared with $2.51 a share for 2013. Our GAAP earnings for 2013 were $2.59 a share, which includes $0.06 of costs associated with the acquisition of Integrys. Consi",1224,"Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, for 2014, our adjusted earnings grew to $2.65 a share compared with $2.51 a share for 2013. Our GAAP earnings for 2013 were $2.59 a share, which includes $0.06 of costs associated with the acquisition of Integrys. Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our 2 business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. 
Our consolidated operating income for the full year of 2014 was $1,112,000,000 as compared with $1.80 billion 2013, that's an increase of $32 million. Starting with the utility energy segment, operating income in 2014 totaled $770.2 million, an increase of $50.8 million over 2013. On the positive side, lower O&M spending, in part driven by lower benefits costs, increased our margins by $59.3 million. We also had a $28 million increase in our revenues due to the second year of our Wisconsin rate order. On the negative side, depreciation expenses increased by $20.4 million in 2014, primarily because our biomass plant was placed into service late in 2013. We estimate that weather resulted in a net $14.8 million decline. While we experienced cold winter weather in 2014, this was more than offset by our cool summer. 
Now turning to our non-Utility segment, operating income was up $1.1 million when compared to last year. This increase reflects new investments at our Power the Future plants. Our corporate and other segment showed an operating loss of $26.3 million, which is almost $20 million more than the prior year. During 2014, we incurred $14.6 million of external costs, primarily legal, banking and professional fees related to the Integrys acquisition. Taking the changes for these segments together, you arrive at a $32 million increase in operating income or a $46.6 million increase adjusted for the $14.6 million of acquisition costs. During 2014, turnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company, totaled nearly $66 million which was a $2.5 million decline in 2013. Our other income net declined by $5.4 million primarily because of lower AFUDC. AFUDC decreased because we completed the biomass facility in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our net interest expense declined by $10.6 million. This was primarily driven by lower long-term interest costs as our new debt issuances were at rates lower than the rates on scheduled maturities. Our consolidated income tax expense rose by $23.8 million because of higher pretax earnings and a slightly higher effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2014 was 38.1% as compared to 36.9% in 2013. We Estimate that our standalone effective tax rate in 2015 would be between 37% and 38%. Combining all of these items brings you to $588.3 million of net income, or GAAP earnings of $2.59 a share for the year. Adding back $0.06 per share for the after-tax impact of acquisition costs, we saw adjusted earnings of $2.65 per share. 
During 2014, our operating cash flows totaled $1,198,000,000, which is a $33 million decrease from 2013. We experienced higher net income and depreciation and amortization costs. However, these factors were offset by higher working capital requirements related to natural gas inventories. Our capital expenditures totaled $736.1 million in 2014, a $48.7 million increase compared to 2013. We saw higher construction expenditures related to the conversion of the Valley Power Plant to natural gas and investments in our distribution infrastructure. And we paid $352 million in common dividends in 2014, which was $23.1 million greater than in 2013. We're also pleased to report that our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.4% at the end of 2014, which is lower than our 2013 ratio of 52.5%. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other plans. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares except for the Integrys acquisition. 
I'll now report on 2014 electric deliveries to our customers. Delivered electricity reflects the demand from both our retail and electric choice customers and thus is a good indicator of how the regional economy is fairing. Whether normalize gross margin deliveries of electricity, excluding the mines, rose by 4/10 of a percent during 2014 as compared to 2013. Actual deliveries were down by 7/10 of a percent. Looking at the individual customer segments, we saw normalized residential deliveries increase by 1/10 of a percent in 2014. Actual residential deliveries declined by 2.4%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, weather normalized deliveries declined by 1/10 of a percent. On an actual basis, full year deliveries to this group were down 4/10 of a percent Normalized deliveries to the large commercial industrial segment for the full year 2014, excluding the iron ore mines, were up by 1.3% [ph] for the year. Actual deliveries rose by 9/10 of a percent for the year.  Overall, for 2015, we are forecasting a modest increase of 1/10 of a percent in weather normalized deliveries, again, excluding the iron ore mines. We plan to meet our earnings targets without relying on significant gains and energy usage by our customers.  Looking at 2015 by individual customer segments, we expect residential deliveries to grow by 2/10 of a percent, impacted positively by continued modest growth in housing starts but offset by conservation. In the small commercial and industrial segment, we're projecting an increase of 3/10 of a percent. In the large commercial industrial group, we are projecting a decrease of 3/10 of a percent. On the natural gas side of the business, total volumes in 2014 increased by 5.2%, driven partly by the colder weather. On a normalized basis, and excluding the volumes used in power generation, gas volumes increased by 3.6% compared to 2013.  We attribute this to an increase in customers, fuel switching to natural gas and the positive impact of additional gas used in the sand mining industry.  Looking over the period 2015 through 2019 as a standalone company, we're projecting positive free cash flow totaling $300 million. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as the cash available after capital spending and dividends. 
Next I'd like to announce our standalone earnings guidance for 2015. We will revise our 2015 guidance after the Integrys acquisition has been completed, and as Gale already mentioned, we anticipate closing the transaction in the second half of 2015. As we've discussed, our adjusted earnings in 2014 were $2.65 a share. Subtracting $0.03 for the impact of weather, we estimate that normalized adjusted earnings for 2014 were $2.62 a share. Taking this into account, we expect our adjusted earnings for 2015 to be in a range of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes transaction-related costs. Again, our guidance for 2015 on a stand-alone basis is $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. 
Finally, let's look at first quarter guidance. Last year's first quarter earnings were $0.91 a share, and that included $0.10 of weather benefit created by the polar vortex. In addition, the polar vortex helped last year's first quarter fuel recovery. Taking these 2 factors into account, we expect our first quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 to be in the range of $0.79 to $0.81 a share. That assumes normal weather and excludes transaction-related costs. Once again, our first quarter 2015 guidance is $0.79 to $0.81 a share. 
And with that, I will turn things back to Gale"

Let me start where the large commercial and industrial customers, our large customer group, and there's an interesting statistic that we did not put on the script but I think is worth mentioning. If you look at our delivered volumes of electricity to our large customers for 2014 and include the iron ore mines up in the Upper Peninsula, which we're still responsible for delivery regardless of where the supply comes from, if you look at that customer segment, weather-normal, it was actually up 3.8% during 2014. That's pretty strong industrial growth in 2014. We're projecting virtually flat for that customer segment in 2015 coming off that big uptick in '14, and that's based really on the input we receive from our large customers when we interviewed them in the fall of the year as we finalized our forecast. So in essence, what we're expecting on the large commercial and industrial side of our business is to sustain the growth that occurred in '14 but probably stay pretty close to that level. So that's really the insight that I would give you on our large commercial and industrial. And then in essence, for residential weather-normal, for commercial weather-normal, basically a little bit of growth offset by conservation and a net, net of flat."

I would say, the growth is going to level off and we're not going to see for the near-term any significant additional growth. But they're not seeing any downturn either.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2014 year-end results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett,",2819,"Colleen, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2014 year-end results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of Wisconsin Energy and CEO of our Generation Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer. 
Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, and as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $2.65 a share for 2014. This compares with earnings of $2.51 a share for 2013. Our adjusted earnings exclude expenses of $0.06 a share related to our acquisition of the Integrys Energy Group. 
I'm very pleased to report to you that 2014 was another exceptional year for Wisconsin Energy. We delivered record financial results. We were named the most reliable utility in the Midwest for the fourth year in a row, extending our strong track record of network reliability and customer satisfaction. We invested nearly $740 million in our core business, with all major projects on time and on budget. We achieved the safest year of operation in the history of the company, which dates back more than 100 years. And we announced the acquisition of Integrys Energy. We believe that the combination of our 2 companies will create the premier regulated utility system in the Midwest, with superior service and competitive pricing for years to come. The benefits to all of our stakeholders are clear, compelling and achievable. 
Turning now to the state of the economy. Wisconsin's unemployment rate declined 5.2% at the end of 2014, well below the national average and the state's lowest unemployment rate since 2008. As the economy continued to improve over the course of the year, deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers began to strengthen as well. On a weather-normal basis for the year, our large customers, excluding the iron ore mines, consumed approximately 1.3% more electricity than they did in 2013. 
We also saw steady improvement in several important sectors of the state's economy, including paper manufacturing, food products, primary metals and rubber and plastics production. In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system, particularly in our natural gas distribution business. For example, new electric service connections were up by 5.7% for the year, but new natural gas installations rose by more than 28% during 2014. 
Later in my remarks, I'll update you on several developments in our core business as well as the important construction projects we have underway. But first, I'd like to discuss our progress in obtaining regulatory approvals for the acquisition of Integrys. Now to refresh your memory, on June 23 of 2014, we announced our plan to acquire Integrys in a cash and stock transaction. Combining the 2 companies to form the WEC Energy Group will create a strong electric and natural gas delivery company with deep operational expertise, scale and the financial resources to meet the region's future energy needs. We'll serve more than 4.3 million customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota. In fact, the combination will create the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in America, and the strong cash flow of the combined company will be invested prudently in new and upgraded energy infrastructure for the region. 
Now as you're well aware, we have consistently used 3 criteria to evaluate any potential acquisition opportunity: first, we would have to believe that the acquisition would be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing; second, it would need to be largely credit-neutral; and finally, we would have to believe that the long-term growth rate of any acquisition would be at least equal to Wisconsin Energy's stand-alone growth rate. Our analysis continues to show that the combination meets or exceeds all 3 criteria. We expect the combined company will be able to grow earnings per share at 5% to 7% per year, faster than either one of us is projecting on a stand-alone basis, and importantly, more than 99% of these earnings would come from regulated businesses. Our customers will clearly benefit from the operational efficiency that comes with increased scale and geographic proximity, and over time, we'll enhance the operations of the 7 utilities that will be part of our energy group by incorporating best practices systemwide. 
In addition, as many of you know, Integrys today is one of the major owners of American Transmission Company with a 34.1% interest. Wisconsin Energy is the second-largest owner with a 26.2% interest. That means the combined entity will have a 60% stake in one of the largest transmission companies in the country. ATC, of course, has a 10-year capital investment plan to bolster electric reliability in our region. In fact, ATC's capital plan for the years 2014 to 2023 calls for investment of between $3.3 billion and $3.9 billion. We believe it's a solid plan, and we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. 
So where do we stand in gaining the necessary approvals? Again, to refresh your memory, the proposed acquisition was approved by Wisconsin Energy and Integrys shareholders back on November 21 of 2014. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice completed its review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act on October 24, 2014, with no further action required by the company. As you know, the transaction also requires the approval of several regulatory agencies, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Wisconsin and Michigan Public Service Commissions, the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. We filed with all 4 state utility commissions in early August, and we're currently working through each of the proceedings. 
Perhaps the most notable regulatory development has occurred in Michigan, where we reached a settlement last month that helps to pave the way for the acquisition while addressing electric reliability concerns in the Upper Peninsula. I'll talk about the settlement in more detail in just a moment, but it's important to note that the Michigan governor, the Michigan attorney general and the iron ore mines all sent letters to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in January stating that they have no objections to our transaction. These parties will not oppose, will not condition or delay the consummation of the transaction in any proceeding at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In addition, the state attorney general, the Michigan commission staff and the mines will not seek or support any other conditions to the merger in proceedings at the Michigan Public Service Commission. And the Michigan Commission has set a schedule now that calls for a decision by June 15 of this year. 
In Wisconsin, the commission expects to vote on the acquisition no later than April 16. In Illinois, the Commerce Commission staff has proposed a schedule that calls for a decision 2 days after the fourth, on July 6, 2015. And the Minnesota commission is expected to review our application in early May. Finally, at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the public comment periods in our merger case have now closed, and we continue to work diligently to gain FERC approval. In summary, we're making very good progress on all regulatory fonts, and we still anticipate closing the transaction during the second half of 2015. 
Two final items related to our acquisition of Integrys. Back in June, Integrys announced the sale of its unregulated power and natural gas marketing business. That sale was completed on November 3, 2014, to a subsidiary of Exelon. The other item relates to the Michigan settlement that I discussed earlier. The settlement calls for the sale of the electric distribution assets owned by both Wisconsin Energy and Integrys in the Upper Peninsula as well the sale of our Presque Isle Power Plant to Upper Peninsula Power Company. Under the terms of the agreement, Wisconsin Energy's distribution assets would be sold for an amount slightly higher than book value. Subject to state regulatory approval, we intend to return that premium over book value to our customers. The Presque Isle plant would be sold for $1, reflecting the current market value of the facility. 
As you may recall, we attempted to sell Presque Isle last year, but we did not receive any valid offers. We expect to treat the plant sale as an asset retirement, and we will seek recovery of the approximately $200 million of net unrecovered plant balance consistent with prior regulatory practice.  Customers in both Wisconsin and Michigan will clearly benefit from this agreement. Once the Presque Isle plant is sold, Wisconsin customers will no longer have to pay for the operating costs associated with the plant. Our Michigan customers will also avoid short-term costs, and Michigan's Upper Peninsula will have more control over its energy future as it will no longer be part of a single Wisconsin-Michigan system. In the end, this agreement addresses the needs of all the parties in the settlement and clears the way for Michigan State regulatory approval of our proposed acquisition 
And now turning to recent developments in our core business. As you may recall, last July, we received the final written order from the Wisconsin Commission approving our request to build and operate a new major natural gas lateral in west-central Wisconsin. The 85 miles of pipeline and connected facilities will run from northern Eau Claire County in the far western part of the state to the City of Tomah in west-central Wisconsin. The project will address natural gas reliability concerns in that region. It will also help meet the demand being driven by customers converting from propane to natural gas and by the growth of the sand mining industry in that part of the state. The commission's approval also includes franchise awards for 10 communities along the route and authorizes us to begin delivering natural gas within the borders of those communities. 
In October, we began work on portions of the downstream facilities 2 of the 3 branch lines were installed as of mid-November. Construction on the third branchline began in January, and of course, we have one major large diameter lateral to install. Route clearing for that lateral also began early this year. We expect to complete the entire project in the fourth quarter of this year at a projected cost of $175 million to $185 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. 
On the generation side of our business, you'll recall that we're converting the fuel source for our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. The 2-unit Valley plant is a cogeneration facility located along the Menomonee River near downtown Milwaukee. Valley generates electricity for the grid, produces steam for more than 400 customers in the downtown Milwaukee business center and provides voltage support for our electric distribution network. I'm pleased to report that the project remains on schedule and on budget. Unit 1 achieved commercial operation burning natural gas back in November. The entire Valley plant is available to operate at full power at this time, with Unit 1 burning natural gas and Unit 2 continuing to burn coal, and we expect Unit 2 to be converted to natural gas in time for next winter's heating season.  
Overall, the project is currently about 66% complete. We expect the total conversion cost to be between $65 million and $70 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Converting Valley to natural gas will reduce our operating costs and enhance the environmental performance of the units. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at 280 megawatts, and we believe our plan will help support a vibrant downtown Milwaukee for many years to come. 
Now I'd like to touch on the upgrade of our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant. The Twin Falls was built in 1912 and is one of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. The plant is located on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Construction now underway to build a new powerhouse and add spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. We continue to make good progress on the major construction work at Twin Falls. The Upstream Cofferdam has been completed, and rock excavation is well underway. Overall, the project, as we speak today, is approximately 37% complete. We plan to begin construction of the new powerhouse this spring, and we expect commercial operation of the new powerhouse to begin in the summer of 2016. The total investment is budgeted at $60 million to $65 million, excluding funds used during construction. 
Also, we continue to make excellent progress on our initiative to improve fuel flexibility at the Oak Creek expansion units. As you recall, these units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal. However, given the cost differential now between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the 2 types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year, depending on the blend. In 2013, we received the necessary environmental approvals, began making changes to the boilers and started testing various blends of bituminous and PRB coal at the plant. With a few modifications both units can sustain a 20% PRB blend. 
We've also conducted limited testing on Unit 2 at various levels up to 100% PRB. Although testing has gone well, there are operational issues that need to be solved and equipment that must be modified to sustain the higher blends of PRB coal on a long-term basis. So on July of last year, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission to approve additional capital spending for modifications of the plant. Our share of that investment would be approximately $21 million. If approved, the modifications are expected to support sustained operation at up to 60% PRB and allow us to continue testing blends up to 100% PRB. 
Also, it's very clear that we need space and equipment to handle additional coal inventory at the site. As a result, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission in October of last year for an expanded coal storage facility and additional handling equipment. Our estimated capital cost for this particular project is $58 million. We hope to receive commission approval for both of these projects in the second half of this year. 
Looking forward, we see significant investment opportunities in our existing core business as we continue to upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on delivering the future. Our updated capital budget -- now this is new information. Our updated capital budget calls for spending $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion over the 5-year period 2015 through 2019. Our rolling 10-year capital budget now calls for investing between $6.6 billion and $7.2 billion over the period 2015 through 2024. 
Turning now to our dividend policy. At its January meeting, our Board of Directors raised our quarterly dividend to $0.4225 a share, an increase of 8.3% over the dividend paid during 2014. The new quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual rate of $1.69 a share. The board also reaffirmed our stand-alone dividend policy that targets a payout ratio trending to 65% to 70% of earnings in 2017, a payout ratio that is more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector. At the closing of the Integrys acquisition, we expect to increase in the dividend again by 7% to 8% for Wisconsin Energy shareholders to reflect the dividend policy of the combined company. And then going forward, the projected payout target for the combined company is expected to be 65% to 70% of earnings. 
And finally, turning to Wisconsin rate matters. In December, the Wisconsin Commission issued its final order on our rate filing for the years 2015 and 2016. The order approved a net bill increase of 0.1% related to the nonfuel costs for our retail electric customers in Wisconsin. The new rates went into effect on January 1. The order also approved an increase in the fixed portion of our customers' monthly bills while correspondingly reducing the kilowatt hour charge. As you know, a higher fixed charge and a lower energy charge more accurately reflect our cost structure. Lastly, the commission approved a return on equity of 10.2% for Wisconsin Electric and 10.3% for Wisconsin Gas. It also authorized an increase on the Wisconsin Gas common equity component to an average of 49.5%, up from 47.5%. The midpoint of Wisconsin Electric's equity component remains unchanged at 51%. 
In summary, ladies and gentlemen, 2014 was another year of achievement for Wisconsin Energy. The company continues to perform at a high level both financially and operationally, and our proposed acquisition of Integrys positions us well for strong future growth as we focus on delivering the future. 
And now with more details on our full year performance and our outlook for 2015, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?"
315117,282917489,760234,"Wisconsin Energy Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, for 2014, our adjusted earnings grew to $2.65 a share compared with $2.51 a share for 2013. Our GAAP earnings for 2014 were $2.59 a share, which includes $0.06 of costs associated with the acquisition of Integrys. Consi",1185,"Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, for 2014, our adjusted earnings grew to $2.65 a share compared with $2.51 a share for 2013. Our GAAP earnings for 2014 were $2.59 a share, which includes $0.06 of costs associated with the acquisition of Integrys. Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our 2 business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. 
Our consolidated operating income for the full year 2014 was $1,112,000,000 as compared with $1,080,000,000 in 2013. That's an increase of $32 million. Starting with the utility energy segment, operating income in 2014 totaled $770.2 million, an increase of $50.8 million over 2013. On the positive side, lower O&M spending, in part driven by lower benefits costs, increased our margins by $59.3 million. We also had a $28 million increase in revenues due to the second year of our Wisconsin rate order. On the negative side, depreciation expense increased by $20.4 million in 2014 primarily because our biomass plant was placed into service late in 2013. We estimate that weather resulted in a net $14.8 million decline. While we experienced cold winter weather in 2014, this was more than offset by our cool summer. 
Now turning to our non-utility segment. Operating income was up $1.1 million when compared to last year. This increase reflects new investments in our Power the Future plans. Our corporate and other segment showed an operating loss of $26.3 million, which is almost $20 million more than the prior year. During 2014, we incurred $14.6 million of external costs, primarily legal, banking and professional fees, related to the Integrys acquisition. Taking the changes for these segments together, you arrive at a $32 million increase in operating income or a $46.6 million increase adjusted for the $14.6 million of acquisition costs. 
During 2014, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled nearly $66 million, which was a $2.5 million decline from 2013. Our other income net declined by $5.4 million primarily because of lower AFUDC. AFUDC decreased because we completed the biomass facility in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our net interest expense declined by $10.6 million. This was primarily driven by lower long-term interest costs as our new debt issuances were at rates lower than the rates on scheduled maturities. 
Our consolidated income tax expense rose by $23.8 million because of higher pretax earnings and a slightly higher effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2014 was 38.1% as compared to 36.9% in 2013. We estimate that our stand-alone effective tax rate in 2015 will be between 37% and 38%. Combining all of these items brings you to $588.3 million of net income or GAAP earnings of $2.59 a share for the year. Adding back $0.06 per share for the after-tax impact of acquisition costs, we saw adjusted earnings of $2.65 per share. 
During 2014, our operating cash flows totaled $1,198,000,000, which is a $33 million decrease from 2013. We experienced higher net income and depreciation and amortization costs. However, these factors were offset by higher working capital requirements related to natural gas inventories. Our capital expenditures totaled $736.1 million in 2014, a $48.7 million increase compared to 2013. We saw higher construction expenditures related to the conversion of the Valley Power Plant to natural gas and investments in our distribution infrastructure. And we paid $352 million in common dividends in 2014, which was $23.1 million greater than in 2013. We're also pleased to report that our adjusted-debt-to-capital ratio was 51.4% at the end of 2014, which is lower than our 2013 ratio of 52.5%. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares except for the Integrys acquisition. 
I'll now report on 2014 electric deliveries to our customers. Delivered electricity reflects the demand from both our retail and electric choice customers and thus, is a good indicator of how the regional economy is faring. Weather-normalized retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the mines, rose by 0.4% during 2014 as compared to 2013. Actual deliveries were down by 0.7%. 
Looking at the individual customer segments. We saw normalized residential deliveries increase by 0.1% in 2014. Actual residential deliveries declined by 2.4%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, weather-normalized deliveries declined by 0.1%. On an actual basis, full year deliveries to this group were down 0.4%. Normalized deliveries to the large commercial industrial segment for the full year 2014, excluding the iron ore mines, were up by 1.3% for the year. Actual deliveries rose by 0.9% for the year. Overall, for 2015, we're forecasting a modest increase of 0.1% in weather-normalized deliveries, again, excluding the iron ore mines. We plan to meet our earnings targets without relying on significant gains in energy usage by our customers.  
Looking at 2015 by individual customer segments. We expect residential deliveries to grow by 0.2%, impacted positively by continued modest growth in housing starts but offset by conservation. In the small commercial and industrial segment, we are projecting an increase of 0.3%. In the large commercial industrial group, we are projecting a decrease of 0.3%. 
On the natural gas side of the business, total volumes in 2014 increased by 5.2%, driven partly by the colder weather. On a normalized basis and excluding the volumes used in power generation, gas volumes increased by 3.6% compared to 2013.  We attribute this to an increase in customers fuel-switching to natural gas and the positive impact of additional gas used in the sand mining industry.  Looking over the period 2015 through 2019, as a stand-alone company, we're projecting positive free cash flow totaling $300 million. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as the cash available after capital spending and dividends. 
Next, I'd like to announce our stand-alone earnings guidance for 2015. We will revise our 2015 guidance after the Integrys acquisition has been completed, and as Gale already mentioned, we anticipate closing the transaction in the second half of 2015. As we've discussed, our adjusted earnings in 2014 were $2.65 a share. Subtracting $0.03 for the impact of weather, we estimate that normalized adjusted earnings for 2014 were $2.62 a share. Taking this into account, we expect our adjusted earnings for 2015 to be in a range of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes transaction-related costs. Again, our guidance for 2015 on a stand-alone basis is $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. 
Finally, let's look at first quarter guidance. Last year's first quarter earnings were $0.91 a share, and that included $0.10 of weather benefit created by the polar vortex. In addition, the polar vortex helped last year's first quarter fuel recovery. Taking these 2 factors into account, we expect our first quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 to be in a range of $0.79 to $0.81 a share. That assumes normal weather and excludes transaction-related costs. Once again, our first quarter 2015 guidance is $0.79 to $0.81 a share. 
And with that, I will turn things back to Gale"

So we're focusing our upgrades, we're focusing our replacements on equipment that is reaching or passing that age.

And there's an interesting statistic that we did not put in the script but I think is worth mentioning. If you look at our delivered volumes of electricity to our large customers for 2014 and include the iron ore mines up in the Upper Peninsula, which we're still responsible for delivery regardless of where their supply comes from, if you look at that customer segment, weather normal, it was actually up 3.8% during 2014. That's pretty strong industrial growth in 2014. We're projecting virtually flat for that customer segment in 2015 coming off that big uptick in '14, and that's based really on the input we receive from our large customers when we interviewed them in the fall of the year as we finalized our forecast. So in essence, what we're expecting on the large commercial and industrial side of our business is to sustain the growth that occurred in '14 but probably stay pretty close to that level. So that's really the insight that I would give you on our large commercial and industrial. And then, in essence, for residential weather normal, for commercial weather normal, basically a little bit of growth offset by conservation and a net-net of flat."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2014 year-end results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett,",2817,"Colleen, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2014 year-end results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of Wisconsin Energy and CEO of our Generation Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer. 
Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, and as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $2.65 a share for 2014. This compares with earnings of $2.51 a share for 2013. Our adjusted earnings exclude expenses of $0.06 a share related to our acquisition of the Integrys Energy Group. 
I'm very pleased to report to you that 2014 was another exceptional year for Wisconsin Energy. We delivered record financial results. We were named the most reliable utility in the Midwest for the fourth year in a row, extending our strong track record of network reliability and customer satisfaction. We invested nearly $740 million in our core business, with all major projects on time and on budget. We achieved the safest year of operation in the history of the company, which dates back more than 100 years. And we announced the acquisition of Integrys Energy. We believe that the combination of our 2 companies will create the premier regulated utility system in the Midwest, with superior service and competitive pricing for years to come. The benefits to all of our stakeholders are clear, compelling and achievable. 
Turning now to the state of the economy. Wisconsin's unemployment rate declined to 5.2% at the end of 2014, well below the national average and the state's lowest unemployment rate since 2008. As the economy continued to improve over the course of the year, deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers began to strengthen as well. On a weather-normal basis for the year, our large customers, excluding the iron ore mines, consumed approximately 1.3% more electricity than they did in 2013. 
We also saw steady improvement in several important sectors of the state's economy, including paper manufacturing, food products, primary metals and rubber and plastics production. In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system, particularly in our natural gas distribution business. For example, new electric service connections were up by 5.7% for the year, but new natural gas installations rose by more than 28% during 2014. 
Later in my remarks, I'll update you on several developments in our core business as well as the important construction projects we have underway. But first, I'd like to discuss our progress in obtaining regulatory approvals for the acquisition of Integrys. Now to refresh your memory, on June 23, 2014, we announced our plan to acquire Integrys in a cash and stock transaction. Combining the 2 companies to form the WEC Energy Group will create a strong electric and natural gas delivery company with deep operational expertise, scale and the financial resources to meet the region's future energy needs. We'll serve more than 4.3 million customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota. In fact, the combination will create the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in America, and the strong cash flow of the combined company will be invested prudently in new and upgraded energy infrastructure for the region. 
Now as you're well aware, we have consistently used 3 criteria to evaluate any potential acquisition opportunity: first, we would have to believe that the acquisition would be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing; second, it would need to be largely credit-neutral; and finally, we would have to believe that the long-term growth rate of any acquisition would be at least equal to Wisconsin Energy's stand-alone growth rate. Our analysis continues to show that the combination meets or exceeds all 3 criteria. We expect the combined company will be able to grow earnings per share at 5% to 7% per year, faster than either one of us is projecting on a stand-alone basis, and importantly, more than 99% of these earnings would come from regulated businesses. Our customers will clearly benefit from the operational efficiency that comes with increased scale and geographic proximity, and over time, we'll enhance the operations of the 7 utilities that will be part of our energy group by incorporating best practices systemwide. 
In addition, as many of you know, Integrys today is one of the major owners of American Transmission Company with a 34.1% interest. Wisconsin Energy is the second-largest owner with a 26.2% interest. That means the combined entity will have a 60% stake in one of the largest transmission companies in the country. ATC, of course, has a 10-year capital investment plan to bolster electric reliability in our region. In fact, ATC's capital plan for the years 2014 to 2023 calls for investment of between $3.3 billion and $3.9 billion. We believe it's a solid plan, and we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. 
So where do we stand in gaining the necessary approvals? Again, to refresh your memory, the proposed acquisition was approved by Wisconsin Energy and Integrys shareholders back on November 21, 2014. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice completed its review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act on October 24, 2014, with no further action required by the company. As you know, the transaction also requires the approval of several regulatory agencies, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Wisconsin and Michigan Public Service Commissions, the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. We filed with all 4 state utility commissions in early August, and we're currently working through each of the proceedings. 
Perhaps the most notable regulatory development has occurred in Michigan, where we reached a settlement last month that helps to pave the way for the acquisition while addressing electric reliability concerns in the Upper Peninsula. I'll talk about the settlement in more detail in just a moment, but it's important to note that the Michigan governor, the Michigan attorney general and the iron ore mines all sent letters to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in January stating that they have no objections to our transaction. These parties will not oppose, will not condition or delay the consummation of the transaction in any proceeding at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In addition, the state attorney general, the Michigan commission staff and the mines will not seek or support any other conditions to the merger in proceedings at the Michigan Public Service Commission. And the Michigan Commission has set a schedule now that calls for a decision by June 15 of this year. 
In Wisconsin, the commission expects to vote on the acquisition no later than April 16. In Illinois, the Commerce Commission staff has proposed a schedule that calls for a decision 2 days after the fourth, on July 6, 2015. And the Minnesota commission is expected to review our application in early May. Finally, at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the public comment periods in our merger case have now closed, and we continue to work diligently to gain FERC approval. In summary, we're making very good progress on all regulatory fonts, and we still anticipate closing the transaction during the second half of 2015. 
Two final items related to our acquisition of Integrys. Back in June, Integrys announced the sale of its unregulated power and natural gas marketing business. That sale was completed on November 3, 2014, to a subsidiary of Exelon. The other item relates to the Michigan settlement that I discussed earlier. The settlement calls for the sale of the electric distribution assets owned by both Wisconsin Energy and Integrys in the Upper Peninsula as well the sale of our Presque Isle Power Plant to Upper Peninsula Power Company. Under the terms of the agreement, Wisconsin Energy's distribution assets would be sold for an amount slightly higher than book value. Subject to state regulatory approval, we intend to return that premium over book value to our customers. The Presque Isle plant would be sold for $1, reflecting the current market value of the facility. 
As you may recall, we attempted to sell Presque Isle last year, but we did not receive any valid offers. We expect to treat the plant sale as an asset retirement, and we will seek recovery of the approximately $200 million of net unrecovered plant balance consistent with prior regulatory practice.  Customers in both Wisconsin and Michigan will clearly benefit from this agreement. Once the Presque Isle plant is sold, Wisconsin customers will no longer have to pay for the operating costs associated with the plant. Our Michigan customers will also avoid short-term costs, and Michigan's Upper Peninsula will have more control over its energy future as it will no longer be part of a single Wisconsin-Michigan system. In the end, this agreement addresses the needs of all the parties in the settlement and clears the way for Michigan State regulatory approval of our proposed acquisition. 
And now turning to recent developments in our core business. As you may recall, last July, we received the final written order from the Wisconsin Commission approving our request to build and operate a new major natural gas lateral in west-central Wisconsin. The 85 miles of pipeline and connected facilities will run from northern Eau Claire County in the far western part of the state to the City of Tomah in west-central Wisconsin. The project will address natural gas reliability concerns in that region. It will also help meet the demand being driven by customers converting from propane to natural gas and by the growth of the sand mining industry in that part of the state. The commission's approval also includes franchise awards for 10 communities along the route and authorizes us to begin delivering natural gas within the borders of those communities. 
In October, we began work on portions of the downstream facilities. 2 of the 3 branch lines were installed as of mid-November. Construction on the third branchline began in January, and of course, we have one major large diameter lateral to install. Route clearing for that lateral also began early this year. We expect to complete the entire project in the fourth quarter of this year at a projected cost of $175 million to $185 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. 
On the generation side of our business, you'll recall that we're converting the fuel source for our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. The 2-unit Valley plant is a cogeneration facility located along the Menomonee River near downtown Milwaukee. Valley generates electricity for the grid, produces steam for more than 400 customers in the downtown Milwaukee business center and provides voltage support for our electric distribution network. I'm pleased to report that the project remains on schedule and on budget. Unit 1 achieved commercial operation burning natural gas back in November. The entire Valley plant is available to operate at full power at this time, with Unit 1 burning natural gas and Unit 2 continuing to burn coal, and we expect Unit 2 to be converted to natural gas in time for next winter's heating season.  
Overall, the project is currently about 66% complete. We expect the total conversion cost to be between $65 million and $70 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Converting Valley to natural gas will reduce our operating costs and enhance the environmental performance of the units. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at 280 megawatts, and we believe our plan will help support a vibrant downtown Milwaukee for many years to come. 
Now I'd like to touch on the upgrade of our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant. The Twin Falls was built in 1912 and is one of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. The plant is located on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Construction now underway to build a new powerhouse and add spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. We continue to make good progress on the major construction work at Twin Falls. The Upstream Cofferdam has been completed, and rock excavation is well underway. Overall, the project, as we speak today, is approximately 37% complete. We plan to begin construction of the new powerhouse this spring, and we expect commercial operation of the new powerhouse to begin in the summer of 2016. The total investment is budgeted at $60 million to $65 million, excluding funds used during construction. 
Also, we continue to make excellent progress on our initiative to improve fuel flexibility at the Oak Creek expansion units. As you recall, these units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal. However, given the cost differential now between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the 2 types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year, depending on the blend. In 2013, we received the necessary environmental approvals, began making changes to the boilers and started testing various blends of bituminous and PRB coal at the plant. With a few modifications both units can sustain a 20% PRB blend. 
We've also conducted limited testing on Unit 2 at various levels up to 100% PRB. Although testing has gone well, there are operational issues that need to be resolved and equipment that must be modified to sustain the higher blends of PRB coal on a long-term basis. So on July of last year, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission to approve additional capital spending for modifications of the plant. Our share of that investment would be approximately $21 million. If approved, the modifications are expected to support sustained operation at up to 60% PRB and allow us to continue testing blends up to 100% PRB. 
Also, it's very clear that we need space and equipment to handle additional coal inventory at the site. As a result, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission in October of last year for an expanded coal storage facility and additional handling equipment. Our estimated capital cost for this particular project is $58 million. We hope to receive commission approval for both of these projects in the second half of this year. 
Looking forward, we see significant investment opportunities in our existing core business as we continue to upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on delivering the future. Our updated capital budget -- now this is new information. Our updated capital budget calls for spending $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion over the 5-year period 2015 through 2019. Our rolling 10-year capital budget now calls for investing between $6.6 billion and $7.2 billion over the period 2015 through 2024. 
Turning now to our dividend policy. At its January meeting, our Board of Directors raised our quarterly dividend to $0.4225 a share, an increase of 8.3% over the dividend paid during 2014. The new quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual rate of $1.69 a share. The board also reaffirmed our stand-alone dividend policy that targets a payout ratio trending to 65% to 70% of earnings in 2017, a payout ratio that is more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector. At the closing of the Integrys acquisition, we expect to increase the dividend again by 7% to 8% for Wisconsin Energy shareholders to reflect the dividend policy of the combined company. And then going forward, the projected payout target for the combined company is expected to be 65% to 70% of earnings. 
And finally, turning to Wisconsin rate matters. In December, the Wisconsin Commission issued its final order on our rate filing for the years 2015 and 2016. The order approved a net bill increase of 0.1% related to the nonfuel costs for our retail electric customers in Wisconsin. The new rates went into effect on January 1. The order also approved an increase in the fixed portion of our customers' monthly bills while correspondingly reducing the kilowatt hour charge. As you know, a higher fixed charge and a lower energy charge more accurately reflect our cost structure. Lastly, the commission approved a return on equity of 10.2% for Wisconsin Electric and 10.3% for Wisconsin Gas. It also authorized an increase on the Wisconsin Gas common equity component to an average of 49.5%, up from 47.5%. The midpoint of Wisconsin Electric's equity component remains unchanged at 51%. 
In summary, ladies and gentlemen, 2014 was another year of achievement for Wisconsin Energy. The company continues to perform at a high level both financially and operationally, and our proposed acquisition of Integrys positions us well for strong future growth as we focus on delivering the future. 
And now with more details on our full year performance and our outlook for 2015, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?"

As Gale mentioned, for 2014, our adjusted earnings grew to $2.65 a share compared with $2.51 a share for 2013. Our GAAP earnings for 2014 were $2.59 a share, which includes $0.06 of costs associated with the acquisition of Integrys. Consi",1185,"Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, for 2014, our adjusted earnings grew to $2.65 a share compared with $2.51 a share for 2013. Our GAAP earnings for 2014 were $2.59 a share, which includes $0.06 of costs associated with the acquisition of Integrys. Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our 2 business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. 
Our consolidated operating income for the full year 2014 was $1,112,000,000 as compared with $1,080,000,000 in 2013. That's an increase of $32 million. Starting with the utility energy segment, operating income in 2014 totaled $770.2 million, an increase of $50.8 million over 2013. On the positive side, lower O&M spending, in part driven by lower benefits costs, increased our margins by $59.3 million. We also had a $28 million increase in revenues due to the second year of our Wisconsin rate order. On the negative side, depreciation expense increased by $20.4 million in 2014 primarily because our biomass plant was placed into service late in 2013. We estimate that weather resulted in a net $14.8 million decline. While we experienced cold winter weather in 2014, this was more than offset by our cool summer. 
Now turning to our non-utility segment. Operating income was up $1.1 million when compared to last year. This increase reflects new investments in our Power the Future plans. Our corporate and other segment shows an operating loss of $26.3 million, which is almost $20 million more than the prior year. During 2014, we incurred $14.6 million of external costs, primarily legal, banking and professional fees, related to the Integrys acquisition. Taking the changes for these segments together, you arrive at a $32 million increase in operating income or a $46.6 million increase adjusted for the $14.6 million of acquisition costs. 
During 2014, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled nearly $66 million, which was a $2.5 million decline from 2013. Our other income net declined by $5.4 million primarily because of lower AFUDC. AFUDC decreased because we completed the biomass facility in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our net interest expense declined by $10.6 million. This was primarily driven by lower long-term interest costs as our new debt issuances were at rates lower than the rates on scheduled maturities. 
Our consolidated income tax expense rose by $23.8 million because of higher pretax earnings and a slightly higher effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2014 was 38.1% as compared to 36.9% in 2013. We estimate that our stand-alone effective tax rate in 2015 will be between 37% and 38%. Combining all of these items brings you to $588.3 million of net income or GAAP earnings of $2.59 a share for the year. Adding back $0.06 per share for the after-tax impact of acquisition costs, we saw adjusted earnings of $2.65 per share. 
During 2014, our operating cash flows totaled $1,198,000,000, which is a $33 million decrease from 2013. We experienced higher net income and depreciation and amortization costs. However, these factors were offset by higher working capital requirements related to natural gas inventories. Our capital expenditures totaled $736.1 million in 2014, a $48.7 million increase compared to 2013. We saw higher construction expenditures related to the conversion of the Valley Power Plant to natural gas and investments in our distribution infrastructure. And we paid $352 million in common dividends in 2014, which was $23.1 million greater than in 2013. We're also pleased to report that our adjusted-debt-to-capital ratio was 51.4% at the end of 2014, which is lower than our 2013 ratio of 52.5%. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares except for the Integrys acquisition. 
I'll now report on 2014 electric deliveries to our customers. Delivered electricity reflects the demand from both our retail and electric choice customers and thus, is a good indicator of how the regional economy is faring. Weather-normalized retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the mines, rose by 0.4% during 2014 as compared to 2013. Actual deliveries were down by 0.7%. 
Looking at the individual customer segments. We saw normalized residential deliveries increase by 0.1% in 2014. Actual residential deliveries declined by 2.4%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, weather-normalized deliveries declined by 0.1%. On an actual basis, full year deliveries to this group were down 0.4%. Normalized deliveries to the large commercial industrial segment for the full year 2014, excluding the iron ore mines, were up by 1.3% for the year. Actual deliveries rose by 0.9% for the year. Overall, for 2015, we're forecasting a modest increase of 0.1% in weather-normalized deliveries, again, excluding the iron ore mines. We plan to meet our earnings targets without relying on significant gains in energy usage by our customers.  
Looking at 2015 by individual customer segments. We expect residential deliveries to grow by 0.2%, impacted positively by continued modest growth in housing starts but offset by conservation. In the small commercial and industrial segment, we are projecting an increase of 0.3%. In the large commercial industrial group, we are projecting a decrease of 0.3%. 
On the natural gas side of the business, total volumes in 2014 increased by 5.2%, driven partly by the colder weather. On a normalized basis and excluding the volumes used in power generation, gas volumes increased by 3.6% compared to 2013. We attribute this to an increase in customers fuel-switching to natural gas and the positive impact of additional gas used in the sand mining industry. Looking over the period 2015 through 2019, as a stand-alone company, we're projecting positive free cash flow totaling $300 million. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as the cash available after capital spending and dividends. 
Next, I'd like to announce our stand-alone earnings guidance for 2015. We will revise our 2015 guidance after the Integrys acquisition has been completed, and as Gale already mentioned, we anticipate closing the transaction in the second half of 2015. As we've discussed, our adjusted earnings in 2014 were $2.65 a share. Subtracting $0.03 for the impact of weather, we estimate that normalized adjusted earnings for 2014 were $2.62 a share. Taking this into account, we expect our adjusted earnings for 2015 to be in a range of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes transaction-related costs. Again, our guidance for 2015 on a stand-alone basis is $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. 
Finally, let's look at first quarter guidance. Last year's first quarter earnings were $0.91 a share, and that included $0.10 of weather benefit created by the polar vortex. In addition, the polar vortex helped last year's first quarter fuel recovery. Taking these 2 factors into account, we expect our first quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 to be in a range of $0.79 to $0.81 a share. That assumes normal weather and excludes transaction-related costs. Once again, our first quarter 2015 guidance is $0.79 to $0.81 a share.

So we're saying we expect to close in the second half of 2015. Much of the acquisition relates to acquiring natural gas distribution companies. Obviously, their sales are quite low in the third quarter. So we really, unfortunately, can't give you any more precise information about the impact of 1 month or not because it really does depend upon the month or the season, depends upon the weather. But I don't think it's going to have a huge impact one way or another. We're still expecting to close in the second half."

One of -- about 2/3 of our overall capital spending over the course of the next several years really will be focused on upgrading our aging electric and gas natural gas distribution networks, particularly the electric distribution networks. And that's very much age-driven. If you look at the reliability of the equipment in our industry, which is, as you know, is incredibly reliable, you start to see, though, a significant uptick in failure rates after the equipment reaches age 50. So we're focusing our upgrades, we're focusing our replacements on equipment that is reaching or passing that age. And we're seeing more equipment -- and we're seeing more investment requirement related to upgrading those electric distribution networks.

If you look at our delivered volumes of electricity to our large customers for 2014 and include the iron ore mines up in the Upper Peninsula, which we're still responsible for delivery regardless of where their supply comes from, if you look at that customer segment, weather normal, it was actually up 3.8% during 2014. That's pretty strong industrial growth in 2014. We're projecting virtually flat for that customer segment in 2015 coming off that big uptick in '14, and that's based really on the input we receive from our large customers when we interview them in the fall of the year as we finalize our forecast. So in essence, what we're expecting on the large commercial and industrial side of our business is to sustain the growth that occurred in '14 but probably stay pretty close to that level.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2015 first quarter results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leve",2282,"Colleen, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2015 first quarter results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of Wisconsin Energy and CEO of our Generation Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer. Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, but as you saw from our news release this morning we reported adjusted earnings of $0.90 a share for the first quarter of 2015, this compares with earnings of $0.91 a share for the first quarter last year. Our adjusted earnings exclude expenses of $0.04 a share related to our acquisition of Integrys Energy Group. While the story of the first quarter was our cold winter weather, though not nearly as extreme as the weather that ripped our region last year, temperatures were almost 12% colder than normal, driving strong customer demand for natural gas. In fact during February, we delivered more natural gas to our retail customers than during any other February in our history, exceeding last year's record by 5.5%. I'm also pleased to report that our natural gas distribution networks performed exceptionally well underscoring the benefit to customers of our Deliver The Future program. You may recall as part of Deliver the Future, we're accelerating the replacement of older natural gas distribution lines, the lines that are more susceptible to stress during severe weather. 
Turning now to the state of the economy, the Wisconsin unemployment rate felt to 4.6% in March. That's the state's lowest unemployment rate since 2008 and is nearly a full percentage point better than that national average of 5.5%. Wisconsin added more than 48,000 private sector jobs between March of 2014 and March of 2015. And as the economy continues to improve, deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers improved as well, rising by 6/10 of 1% in the first quarter. Sectors that showed particular strength included plastics, printing and food processing. In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. Early May, new electric service connections are up almost 19% and new natural gas installations are up nearly 14% compared to the same time period last year. 
Now later in my remarks, I'll update you on other developments in our core business and the important construction projects we have underway. But first, I'd like to discuss our progress in obtaining regulatory approvals for the acquisition of Integrys. To refresh your memory, on June 23 last year, we announced plans to acquire Integrys in a cash and stock transaction. Our analysis shows that combining the 2 companies to form the WEC Energy Group meets or exceeds all 3 criteria that we used to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities. First, we believe the acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing, of course, that would be 2016; second, we believe that we're largely credit neutral; and finally, we believe the long-term growth rate would at least be equal to Wisconsin Energy's standalone growth rate. We expect the combined company will grow earnings per share at 5% to 7% per year, faster than either of us is projecting on a stand-alone basis with more than 99% of those earnings coming from regulated businesses. Our customers will benefit from the operational efficiency that comes with increased scale and geographic proximity, and over time we'll enhance the operations of the 7 utilities that will be part of our company by incorporating best practices system-wide. We believe that customers can actually see as much as the $1 billion of savings over the next 10 years through a combination of lower capital and operating costs in Wisconsin. In addition, Integrys today, as you may recall, owns a 34.1% interest in American transmission company. Wisconsin Energy owns 26.2%. That means the combined entity will have a 60% stake in one of the largest independent transmission companies in the United States. ATC has a 10-year capital investment plan to bolster electric reliability in our region that calls for an investment of $3.3 billion to $3.9 billion by the year 2023. We believe it's a solid plan and we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. 
So where do we stand in getting the regulatory approvals for our acquisition of Integrys? Again, to refresh your memory, the proposed acquisition was approved by Wisconsin Energy and Integrys shareholders last November. In addition the U.S. Department of Justice completed its review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in October of last year with no further action required by the company. Just a few weeks ago on April 7, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found the transaction to be in the public interest and issued an order with no conditions other than those we proposed. Then on April 13, the Federal Communications Commission approved the transfer of certain communication licenses. So all federal approvals for the transaction are now complete. 
Turning to the state proceedings, the Michigan Commission issued its approval on April 23 and the Wisconsin Commission voted to approve the transaction at its open meeting on April 30, determining the transaction to be in the best interest of utility customers, stockholders and the public. The Wisconsin Commission applied several conditions to its approval, including a requirement that we share with customers for a 3-year period beginning in 2016, any earnings at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas that are above or allowed rates of return. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service, the Integrys utility based in Green Bay, will not be allowed to build a natural gas-fired generating unit unless a study of the joint needs of all our companies determines a need for new capacity. We expect to receive a final written order from the Wisconsin Commission by the end of May. In Minnesota, the commission there is expected to review our application during May and the schedule for the Illinois Commerce Commission calls for a decision no later than July 6. In summary, we're making excellent progress on all regulatory fonts and we anticipate closing the transaction now by the end of the summer. 
Now before we discuss the standards of our ongoing construction projects, I'd also like to take just a moment to follow-up on the settlement agreement in Michigan. As we discussed during our previous calls, we've been working toward a long-term electric reliability solution for the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In cooperation with the Michigan Governor, the Michigan Attorney General, the Michigan commission staff and the iron ore mines, we reached an agreement on March 12 that placed the original arrangement we announced in January. The revised agreement includes the following important elements: First, Wisconsin Electric will retain ownership of the Presque Isle power plant and our current electric distribution assets. The iron ore mines have entered into long-term contracts to purchase power from Wisconsin Electric. Wisconsin Energy then expressed a willingness, if requested, to invest in a generating plant in the Upper Peninsula and/or purchase power from the new facility. This would allow for the eventual retirement of the Presque Isle plant. And, finally, Wisconsin energy would potentially create a separate Michigan-only utility. If formed, our electric customers residing in the upper Peninsula of Michigan will become part of this utility and the utility would be a subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy. So overall, we're very pleased with this result. 
And now turning to recent developments in our core business, as you may recall last July, we received the final written order from the Wisconsin Commission approving our request to build and operate a new natural gas lateral which will span an 85-mile route through Western and Central Wisconsin. The project will address natural gas reliability concerns in that region of the state. It will also help meet the demand being driven by customers converting from propane to natural gas and demand from the sand mining industry. The commission's approval also includes franchise awards for 10 communities along the route and authorizes us to begin delivering natural gas within the borders of those communities. We began work last October on portions of the downstream facilities. Two of the 3 branch lines were installed by mid-November. Construction of the third branchline began in January and is now nearing completion. Route clearing for the final large diameter lateral is now complete, construction on the regulator stations is on schedule and 100% of the large diameter steel pipe has been delivered to our work yards. We're on time, we're on budget and we expect to complete the project in the fourth quarter of this year at a projected cost of $175 million to $185 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. 
On the generation side of our business, you'll recall that we're converting the fuel source for our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. The 2 unit Valley Plant is a cogeneration facility located along the Menomonee River near downtown Milwaukee. The Valley generates electricity for the grid, produces steam for more than 400 customers in the downtime Milwaukee business center and also provides important voltage support for the electric network. The Valley conversion project achieved another milestone on April 10. That's when unit 2 started its coal to gas conversion outage and the Valley Power Plant stopped burning coal after more than 46 years. Unit 2 should be completed by early fall, in time for the next heating season. Unit 1 of course achieved commercial operation burning natural gas last November. Overall, the Valley project is more than 70% complete. We expect the total cost to range between $65 million and $70 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Converting Valley to natural gas will reduce our operating costs and enhance the environmental performance of the units. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at 280 megawatts. 
Now, I'd like to touch on the upgrade of our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant. Located in the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula, Twin Falls was built back in the day in 1912 and is one of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. Construction began in late 2013 to build a new powerhouse and add spillway capacity that meet current federal standards. Construction activity has now resumed at Twin Falls after a planned break for the winter. We continue to make good progress on all the major construction work. The Upstream Cofferdam is finished, rock excavation is roughly 90% complete, and overall, the project is on time and on budget, with approximately 42% of the work now finished. We will begin physical construction of the new powerhouse later this spring. We expect to achieve commercial operation in the summer of 2016. We're forecasting the total investment at $60 million to $65 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Also, we continue to make excellent progress on our initiative to improve fuel flexibility at our Oak Creek expansion units. As you recall, these units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal. However, given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the 2 types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year depending upon the blend. So after receiving the necessary environmental approvals, we began making changes to the boilers and testing various blends of bituminous and PRB coal of the plant. We've actually conducted limited testing on Unit 2 at levels of up to 100% PRB. Although the testing has gone very well, there are operational issues that need to be addressed and equipment that must be modified. So last July, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission to approve additional capital spending to modify the plant. Our share of that investment would be $21 million. If approved, the modifications are expected to support sustained operation at up to 60% PRB and allow us to continue testing blends of up to 100% PRB. We also need space on equipment to handle additional coal inventory on the site. As a result, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission last October for an expanded coal storage facility and additional handling equipment. Our share of the estimated capital cost for this project is $58 million. We hope to receive commission approval for both of these initiatives this summer. 
Looking forward, we continue to see significant investment opportunity at our existing core business, as we upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on delivering the future. Our capital budget calls for spending $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion over a 5-year period 2015 through 2019. Our rolling 10 year capital budget calls for investing between $6.6 billion and $7.2 billion over the period 2015 through 2024. 
Turning now to our dividend policy, our current stand-alone policy targets a dividend payout ratio trending to 65% to 70% of earnings in 2017, a policy that's more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector. At the closing of the Integrys acquisition, we expect to increase the dividend for Wisconsin Energy stockholders by 7% to 8% to achieve parity with Integrys shareholders. Going forward, the payout target for the combined company is projected to be at 65% to 70% of earnings. 
In conclusion, we're off to a strong start both financially and operationally in 2015 and we're pleased with the progress we've made as we work to finalize our acquisition of Integrys. And now, for more details on our first quarter, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?"

As Gale mentioned, our 2015 first quarter adjusted earnings were $0.90 a share compared with $0.91 a share for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our 2 business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Our consolidated operating income for the first quarter was $358.8 million as compared to $381.8 million in 2014. That's a decrease of $23 million. Starting with the Utility Energy segment, you'll see that operating income in the first quarter totaled $276.5 million for 2015, a decrease of $16.2 million from the first quarter of 2014. On the favorable side, we estimate that our operating income increased by $14.7 million because of the impacts of the 2015 rate case. On the downside, we estimate that our gas and electric margins decreased by $20.6 million because of the weather. As Gale mentioned earlier, the first quarter of 2015 was cold. Our heating degree days were up almost 12% as compared to normal. However, heating degree days last year were 24% higher than normal due to the polar vortex. In addition, our depreciation expense increased by $4.3 million due to additional capital placed into service. 
Operating income in the 9 utility segment was up $1.4 million when compared to 2014. This increase reflects additional investment at our Power the Future plans. Our corporate and other segment showed an operating loss of $9.3 million this quarter as compared to $1.1 million loss in the first quarter of 2014. This increase is directly driven by costs associated with the acquisition. Taking the changes for these segments together we arrived at the $23 million decline in operating income. 
During the first quarter, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $16.1 million, a slight decline from the same period last year. This decline was in line with our expectations and is directly related to an anticipated reduction in unauthorized returns for transmission companies. Our other income net increased by $1.9 million largely because of higher AFUDC. The AFUDC increased primarily because of our gas expansion project in Western Wisconsin. Our net interest expense decreased by $2.6 million, primarily because of lower long-term interest rates. Last year, we replaced maturing debt with new debt at lower rates. Consolidated income tax expense fell by $7.9 million because of lower pretax earnings. Our effective income tax rate was in line with the prior year. We expect our annual effective tax rate for 2015 to be between 37% and 38%. Combining all of these items brings you to $195.8 million of net income for the first quarter of 2015 or earnings of $0.86 per share. Our adjusted earnings, which exclude $0.04 of acquisition-related costs, were $0.90 per share. 
During the first quarter of 2015, our operating cash flows totaled $329.7 million, which is $55.4 million less in 2014. In January, we contributed $100 million to our pension trust which reduced operating cash flows. No contributions were made in 2014. Our capital expenditures totaled $149.5 billion [ph] in the first quarter, a $20.3 million increase compared to 2014. The largest increase was related to the gas expansion project in Western Wisconsin. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.6% at the end of March. Our calculation treats after our hybrid securities as common equity which is consistent with past presentations. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares, except, of course, for those shares in connection with the acquisition of Integrys. We also paid $95.3 million in common dividends in the first quarter of 2015, an increase of $7.2 million over the first quarter last year. 
Weather normalized, retail deliveries of electricity fell by 7/10 of a percent in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the first quarter of 2014. Actual first quarter deliveries fell by 2.4%. Looking at the individual customer segments, we saw weather normalized residential deliveries drop by $3.1 million. Actual residential deliveries fell 7.1%. Across our small commercial industrial group, weather normalized quarterly deliveries were flat with last year. Actual deliveries fell by 1.2%. In the large commercial industrial segment, deliveries for the first quarter of 2015 were up by 6/10 of a percent. If you exclude the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries fell by 5/10 of a percent. Our first quarter weather normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, improved by 2.2% compared to the same period in 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again excluding gas usage power generation were down 6.8% compared to the polar vortex driven gas sales and last year's first quarter. Our overall results for gas and electric sales in the first quarter are in line with our expectations for the year. 
Turning now to our earnings forecast, we are reaffirming our 2015 stand-alone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. We're off to a strong start with the still have 9 more months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our stand-alone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. Finally, let's take a look at second quarter guidance. Last year's second quarter adjusted earnings were $0.59 a share which excludes $0.01 a share related to our acquisition of Integrys. Last year's second quarter earnings were buoyed by a favorable O& costs and lower benefits cost. This year, our maintenance schedule calls for more work in the second quarter than we performed last year in addition. Our April weather this year was much milder than last year. Taking these factors into account, we expect our second quarter 2015 adjusted earnings to be in a range of $0.54 to $0.56 a share, that assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes transaction-related costs. Once again, our second quarter 2015 adjusted guidance is $0.54 to $0.56 a share.

The short answer is, yes, I do think that the first quarter residential weather normal numbers are statistical anomaly, right. You've heard me say this before but the weather normalization techniques that are available to companies like ours, they simply break down when you get to do 3 standard deviations off the North. And last year, with the polar vortex, particularly in the Midwest and Wisconsin, I mean, we were way, way off the norm, so I honestly don't put much stock in the weather normal numbers for the first quarter. On the other hand, if you look at our large commercial and industrial segment, which is far less whether sensitively son uptick of 6% even compared to the polar vortex numbers of a year ago. So as we look at this and believe me, we've analyzed this about 14 ways to Sunday, our bottom line conclusion is we're on track overall for what we expected for the year and we weren't expecting, as you know, significant uptick in kilowatt hours sales. So we feel pretty good about where we stand and again, I would take it with a grain of salt, the weather normal numbers when you compare that to such extraordinary period a year ago. Hope that helps, Greg."

So that would be one of the first steps that we would take me immediately following the acquisition. We would put a very experienced, professional, solid management team in place at Peoples Gas.

Both we and Integrys felt that, that a delay was not necessary because there's a separate docket where the Illinois Commerce Commission is reviewing any concern and reviewing the matter in which the gas main replacement program has been manage. So there's a separate docket underrate that would probably go on for number of months. That the initiative law judge determined that the delay was not simply necessary and ruled in favor of no delay. The commission staff also suggested no delay. So at the moment, there would be nothing on the table that would postpone a decision by July 6 so I hope that's helpful on the scheduling standpoint. In terms of the review of the what's called AMRP, the advanced main replacement, the Illinois commerce commission had already authorized an independent audit, if you will, of how Peoples are managing that construction program and of course, that construction program, as you know, is very extensive, that will last probably at least for a 10 year period. The legislation actually recovers at 10 year period in Illinois for the replacement of aging gas pipes in the city of Chicago. Some of those pipes by the way are Civil War aero pipes, they really do badly need replacing. So long story short, there already was an external audit going on of the AMRP program and how it's been managed.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2015 first quarter results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Le",2282,"Colleen, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2015 first quarter results. 
Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of Wisconsin Energy and CEO of our Generation Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer. 
Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.90 a share for the first quarter of 2015, this compares with earnings of $0.91 a share for the first quarter last year. 
Our adjusted earnings exclude expenses of $0.04 a share, related to our acquisition of Integrys Energy Group. While the story of the first quarter was our cold winter weather, though not nearly as extreme as the weather that gripped our region last year, temperatures were almost 12% colder than normal, driving strong customer demand for natural gas. In fact during February, we delivered more natural gas to our retail customers than during any other February in our history, exceeding last year's record by 5.5%. 
I'm also pleased to report that our natural gas distribution networks performed exceptionally well, underscoring the benefit to customers of our Deliver The Future program. You may recall that as part of Deliver the Future, we're accelerating the replacement of older natural gas distribution lines, the lines that are most susceptible to stress during severe weather. 
Turning now to the state of the economy, the Wisconsin unemployment rate fell to 4.6% in March. That's the state's lowest unemployment rate since 2008 and is nearly a full percentage point better than the national average of 5.5%. Wisconsin added more than 48,000 private sector jobs between March of 2014 and March of 2015. And as the economy continues to improve, deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers improved as well, rising by 0.6% in the first quarter. 
Sectors that showed particular strength included plastics, printing and food processing. In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. Through early May, new electric service connections are up almost 19% and new natural gas installations are up nearly 14% compared to the same time period last year. 
Now later in my remarks, I'll update you on other developments in our core business and the important construction projects we have underway. But first, I'd like to discuss our progress in obtaining regulatory approvals for the acquisition of Integrys. To refresh your memory, on June 23 last year, we announced plans to acquire Integrys in a cash and stock transaction. Our analysis shows that combining the 2 companies to form the WEC Energy Group meets or exceeds all 3 criteria that we used to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities. 
First, we believe the acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing, of course, that would be 2016; second, we believe that we're largely credit neutral; and finally, we believe the long-term growth rate will be at least equal to Wisconsin Energy's standalone growth rate. 
We expect the combined company will grow earnings per share at 5% to 7% per year, faster than either of us is projecting on a stand-alone basis with more than 99% of those earnings coming from regulated businesses. 
Our customers will benefit from the operational efficiency that comes with increased scale and geographic proximity, and over time we'll enhance the operations of the 7 utilities that will be part of our company by incorporating best practices system-wide. We believe that customers could actually see as much as $1 billion of savings over the next 10 years through a combination of lower capital and operating costs in Wisconsin. 
In addition, Integrys today, as you may recall, owns a 34.1% interest in American transmission company. Wisconsin Energy owns 26.2%. That means the combined entity will have a 60% stake in one of the largest independent transmission companies in the United States. ATC has a 10-year capital investment plan to bolster electric reliability in our region that calls for an investment of $3.3 billion to $3.9 billion by the year 2023. We believe it's a solid plan and we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. 
So where do we stand in getting the regulatory approvals for our acquisition of Integrys? Again, to refresh your memory, the proposed acquisition was approved by Wisconsin Energy and Integrys shareholders last November. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice completed its review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in October of last year with no further action required by the company. 
Just a few weeks ago, on April 7, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found the transaction to be in the public interest and issued an order with no conditions other than those we proposed. Then, on April 13, the Federal Communications Commission approved the transfer of certain communication licenses. So all federal approvals for the transaction are now complete. 
Turning to the state proceedings, the Michigan Commission issued its approval on April 23 and the Wisconsin Commission voted to approve the transaction at its open meeting on April 30, determining the transaction to be in the best interest of utility customers, stockholders and the public. 
The Wisconsin Commission applied several conditions to its approval, including a requirement that we share with customers for a 3-year period beginning in 2016, any earnings at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas that are above our allowed rates of return. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service, the Integrys utility based in Green Bay, will not be allowed to build a new natural gas fire-generating unit unless a study of the joint needs of all our companies determines a need for new capacity. We expect to receive a final written order from the Wisconsin Commission by the end of May. 
In Minnesota, the commission there is expected to review our application during May and the schedule for the Illinois Commerce Commission calls for a decision no later than July 6. In summary, we're making excellent progress on all regulatory fronts and we anticipate closing the transaction now by the end of the summer. 
Now before we discuss the status of our ongoing construction projects, I'd also like to take just a moment to follow-up on the settlement agreement in Michigan. As we discussed during our previous calls, we've been working toward a long-term electric reliability solution for the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In cooperation with the Michigan Governor, the Michigan Attorney General, the Michigan commission staff and the iron ore mines, we reached an agreement on March 12 that replaced the original arrangement we had announced in January. 
The revised agreement includes the following important elements: first, Wisconsin Electric will retain ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant and our current electric distribution assets. The iron ore mines have entered into long-term contracts to purchase power from Wisconsin Electric. Wisconsin Energy then expressed a willingness, if requested, to invest in a new generating plant in the Upper Peninsula and/or purchase power from the new facility. This would allow for the eventual retirement of the Presque Isle Plant. 
And finally, Wisconsin Energy would potentially create a separate Michigan-only utility. If formed, our electric customers residing in the upper peninsula of Michigan will become part of this utility and the utility would be a subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy. So overall, we're very pleased with this result. 
And now turning to recent developments in our core business, as you may recall last July, we received the final written order from the Wisconsin Commission approving our request to build and operate a new natural gas lateral, which will span an 85-mile route through Western and Central Wisconsin. The project will address natural gas reliability concerns in that region of the state. It will also help meet the demand being driven by customers converting from propane to natural gas and demand from the sand mining industry. 
The commission's approval also includes franchise awards for 10 communities along the route and authorizes us to begin delivering natural gas within the borders of those communities. We began work last October on portions of the downstream facilities. Two of the 3 branch lines were installed by mid-November. Construction of the third branchline began in January and is now nearing completion. Route clearing for the final large diameter lateral is now complete; construction on the regulator stations is on schedule; and 100% of the large diameter steel pipe has been delivered to our work yards. 
We're on time, we're on budget and we expect to complete the project in the fourth quarter of this year at a projected cost of $175 million to $185 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. 
On the generation side of our business, you'll recall that we're converting the fuel source for our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. The 2 unit Valley Plant is a cogeneration facility located along the Menomonee River near downtown Milwaukee. Valley generates electricity for the grid, produces steam for more than 400 customers in the downtime Milwaukee business center and also provides important voltage support for the electric network.
The Valley conversion project achieved another milestone on April 10. That's when unit 2 started its coal-to-gas conversion outage and the Valley Power Plant stopped burning coal after more than 46 years. Unit 2 should be completed by early fall, in time for the next heating season. Unit 1 of course achieved commercial operation burning natural gas last November.
Overall, the Valley project is more than 70% complete. We expect the total cost to range between $65 million and $70 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Converting Valley to natural gas will reduce our operating costs and enhance the environmental performance of the units. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at 280 megawatts. 
Now, I'd like to touch on the upgrade of our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant. Located on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula, Twin Falls was built back in the day in 1912 and is one of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. Construction began in late 2013 to build a new powerhouse and add spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. Construction activities have now resumed at Twin Falls after a planned break for the winter. We continue to make good progress on all the major construction work. The Upstream Cofferdam is finished, rock excavation is roughly 90% complete, and overall, the project is on time and on budget, with approximately 42% of the work now finished. 
We will begin physical construction of the new powerhouse later this spring. We expect to achieve commercial operation in the summer of 2016. We're forecasting the total investment at $60 million to $65 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Also, we continue to make excellent progress on our initiative to improve fuel flexibility at our Oak Creek expansion units. As you recall, these units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal. However, given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the 2 types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year depending upon the blend. 
So after receiving the necessary environmental approvals, we began making changes to the boilers and testing various blends of bituminous and PRB coal at the plant. We've actually conducted limited testing on Unit 2 at levels of up to 100% PRB. Although the testing has gone very well, there are operational issues that need to be addressed and equipment that must be modified. 
So last July, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission to approve additional capital spending to modify the plant. Our share of that investment would be $21 million. If approved, the modifications are expected to support sustained operation at up to 60% PRB and allow us to continue testing blends of up to 100% PRB. We also need space and equipment to handle additional coal inventory on the site. As a result, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission last October for an expanded coal storage facility and additional handling equipment. Our share of the estimated capital cost for this project is $58 million. We hope to receive commission approval for both of these initiatives this summer. 
Looking forward, we continue to see significant investment opportunities in our existing core business, as we upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on delivering the future. Our capital budget calls for spending $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion over a 5-year period 2015 through 2019. Our rolling 10 year capital budget calls for investing between $6.6 billion and $7.2 billion over the period 2015 through 2024. 
Turning now to our dividend policy, our current stand-alone policy targets a dividend payout ratio trending to 65% to 70% of earnings in 2017, a policy that's more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector. At the closing of the Integrys acquisition, we expect to increase the dividend for Wisconsin Energy stockholders by 7% to 8% to achieve parity with the Integrys shareholders. Going forward, the payout target for the combined company is projected to be at 65% to 70% of earnings. 
In conclusion, we're off to a strong start both financially and operationally in 2015 and we're pleased with the progress we've made as we work to finalize our acquisition of Integrys. 
And now, for more details on our first quarter, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?"

As Gale mentioned, our 2015 first quarter adjusted earnings were $0.90 a share compared with $0.91 a share for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our 2 business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. 
Our consolidated operating income for the first quarter was $358.8 million as compared to $381.8 million in 2014. That's a decrease of $23 million. Starting with the Utility Energy segment, you'll see that operating income in the first quarter totaled $276.5 million for 2015, a decrease of $16.2 million from the first quarter of 2014. On the favorable side, we estimate that our operating income increased by $14.7 million because of the impacts of the 2015 rate case. On the downside, we estimate that our gas and electric margins decreased by $20.6 million because of the weather. 
As Gale mentioned earlier, the first quarter of 2015 was cold. Our heating degree days were up almost 12% as compared to normal. However, heating degree days last year were 24% higher than normal due to the polar vortex. In addition, our depreciation expense increased by $4.3 million due to additional capital placed into service. 
Operating income in the non-utility segment was up $1.4 million when compared to 2014. This increase reflects additional investment at our Power the Future plans. Our corporate and other segment showed an operating loss of $9.3 million this quarter as compared to $1.1 million loss in the first quarter of 2014. This increase is directly driven by costs associated with the acquisition. Taking the changes for these segments together we arrive at the $23 million decline in operating income. 
During the first quarter, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $16.1 million, a slight decline from the same period last year. This decline was in line with our expectations and is directly related to an anticipated reduction and authorized returns for transmission companies. 
Our other income net increased by $1.9 million largely because of higher AFUDC. AFUDC increased primarily because of our gas expansion project in Western Wisconsin. Our net interest expense decreased by $2.6 million, primarily because of lower long-term interest rates. Last year, we replaced maturing debt with new debt at lower rates. 
Consolidated income tax expense fell by $7.9 million because of lower pretax earnings. Our effective income tax rate was in line with the prior year. We expect our annual effective tax rate for 2015 to be between 37% and 38%. Combining all of these items brings you to $195.8 million of net income for the first quarter of 2015 or earnings of $0.86 per share. Our adjusted earnings, which exclude $0.04 of acquisition-related costs, were $0.90 per share. 
During the first quarter of 2015, our operating cash flows totaled $329.7 million, which is $55.4 million less in 2014. In January, we contributed $100 million to our pension trust, which reduced operating cash flows. No contributions were made in 2014. Our capital expenditures totaled $149.5 million in the first quarter, a $20.3 million increase compared to 2014. The largest increase was related to the gas expansion project in Western Wisconsin.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.6% at the end of March. Our calculation treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares, except, of course, for those shares in connection with the acquisition of Integrys. We also paid $95.3 million in common dividends in the first quarter of 2015, an increase of $7.2 million over the first quarter last year. 
Weather-normalized retail deliveries of electricity fell by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the first quarter of 2014. Actual first quarter deliveries fell by 2.4%. Looking at the individual customer segments, we saw weather-normalized residential deliveries drop by 3.1%. Actual residential deliveries fell 7.1%.
Across our small commercial industrial group, weather-normal quarterly deliveries were flat with last year. Actual deliveries fell by 1.2%. In the large commercial industrial segment, deliveries for the first quarter of 2015 were up by 0.6%. If you exclude the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries fell by 0.5%. 
Our first quarter weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, improved by 2.2% compared to the same period in 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again excluding gas-user power generation, were down 6.8% compared to the polar vortex driven gas sales and last year's first quarter. Our overall results for gas and electric sales in the first quarter are in line with our expectations for the year. 
Turning now to our earnings forecast, we are reaffirming our 2015 stand-alone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. We're off to a strong start, but we still have 9 more months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our stand-alone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. 
Finally, let's take a look at second quarter guidance. Last year's second quarter adjusted earnings were $0.59 a share, which excludes $0.01 a share related to our acquisition of Integrys. Last year's second quarter earnings were buoyed by a favorable O&M cost and lower benefits cost. This year, our maintenance schedule calls for more work in the second quarter than we performed last year. In addition, our April weather this year was much milder than last year. Taking these factors into account, we expect our second quarter 2015 adjusted earnings to be in a range of $0.54 to $0.56 a share, that assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes transaction-related costs. 
Once again, our second quarter 2015 adjusted guidance is $0.54 to $0.56 a share. And with that, I will turn things back to Gale"

The short answer is, yes, I do think that the first quarter residential weather normal numbers are a statistical anomaly. You've heard me say this before, but the weather normalization techniques that are available to companies like ours, they simply break down when you get 2 to 3 standard deviations off the norm. And last year, with the polar vortex, particularly as it hit the Midwest and Wisconsin, I mean, we were way, way off the norm, so I honestly don't put much stock in the weather normal numbers for the first quarter. On the other hand, if you look at our large commercial and industrial segment, which is far less whether sensitive, you saw an uptick of 0.6% even compared to the polar vortex numbers of a year ago. So as we've looked at this and believe me, we've analyzed this about 14 ways to Sunday, our bottom line conclusion is we're on track overall for what we expected for the year. And we weren't expecting, as you know, significant uptick in kilowatt hours sales. So we feel pretty good about where we stand. And again, I would take with a grain of salt, the weather normal numbers when you compare it to such an extraordinary period a year ago. Hope that helps, Greg."

But on the other hand, I would say steady as she goes from the general input we're getting from our industrial customers. And then, of course, we should see an interesting development in the second quarter.

So that will be one of the first steps that we will take, immediately following the acquisition. We will put a very experienced, professional, solid management team in place at Peoples Gas.

Well, first of all, just to explain the procedure with the Illinois Commerce Commission, the State Attorney General in Illinois filed a motion with the administrative law judge that is presiding over our merger case petitioning the administrative law judge to, in essence, delay an ICC decision on our merger from the statutory deadline of July 6 for an additional 90 days, while the review continues on the management of the advanced main replacement program that Peoples Gas is undertaking. Both we and Integrys felt that a delay was not necessary because there's a separate docket where the Illinois Commerce Commission is reviewing any concern and reviewing the matter in which the gas main replacement program has been managed. So there's a separate docket underway that will probably go on for a number of months. The administrative law judge determined that a delay was simply not necessary and ruled in favor of no delay. The commission staff also suggested no delay. So at the moment, there would be nothing on the table that would postpone a decision by July 6 so I hope that's helpful on the scheduling standpoint. In terms of the review of the what's called AMRP, the advanced main replacement program. The Illinois Commerce Commission had already authorized an independent audit, if you will, of how Peoples is managing that construction program. And of course, that construction program, as you know, is very extensive. It will last probably at least for a 10-year period. The legislation actually covers a 10-year period in Illinois for the replacement of aging gas pipes in the City of Chicago. Some of those pipes by the way are Civil War-era pipes, and really do badly need replacing. So long story short, there already was an external audit going on of the AMRP program and how it's been managed. That audit is well along, an interim report, there's an auditing firm called Liberty and the Liberty report, the interim report is out and has been shared with us, and we would expect, Allen, a final Liberty report, I would assume, within the next 30 to 45 days."

One, clearly just the low price of natural gas; and secondly, the opportunity that we have to continue to gain customers through switching from propane to natural gas. You may have heard me say this before, but the national statistics from a year ago would indicate that Wisconsin is one of the 5 heaviest using propane states in the United States. And I think there's a tremendous opportunity for customer growth. I mean, forget about per usage customer for a minute, but I think there's a tremendous opportunity for customer growth as we continue to see customers wanting to switch to our natural gas distribution network. In fact, I mentioned in the script the uptick in customer growth that we're seeing and its double-digit so far this year compared to the uptick we saw even last year. So to make a long story short, if I were a betting man, I would say gas grows faster than electric by a bit over the next 4 to 5 years."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2015 first quarter results. 
Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of Wisconsin Energy and CEO of our Generation Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer. 
Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.90 a share for the first quarter of 2015, this compares with earnings of $0.91 a share for the first quarter last year. 
Our adjusted earnings exclude expenses of $0.04 a share, related to our acquisition of Integrys Energy Group. While the story of the first quarter was our cold winter weather, though not nearly as extreme as the weather that gripped our region last year, temperatures were almost 12% colder than normal, driving strong customer demand for natural gas. In fact during February, we delivered more natural gas to our retail customers than during any other February in our history, exceeding last year's record by 5.5%. 
I'm also pleased to report that our natural gas distribution networks performed exceptionally well, underscoring the benefit to customers of our Deliver The Future program. You may recall that as part of Deliver the Future, we're accelerating the replacement of older natural gas distribution lines, the lines that are most susceptible to stress during severe weather. 
Turning now to the state of the economy, the Wisconsin unemployment rate fell to 4.6% in March. That's the state's lowest unemployment rate since 2008 and is nearly a full percentage point better than the national average of 5.5%. Wisconsin added more than 48,000 private sector jobs between March of 2014 and March of 2015. And as the economy continues to improve, deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers improved as well, rising by 0.6% in the first quarter. 
Sectors that showed particular strength included plastics, printing and food processing. In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. Through early May, new electric service connections are up almost 19% and new natural gas installations are up nearly 14% compared to the same time period last year. 
Now later in my remarks, I'll update you on other developments in our core business and the important construction projects we have underway. But first, I'd like to discuss our progress in obtaining regulatory approvals for the acquisition of Integrys. To refresh your memory, on June 23 last year, we announced plans to acquire Integrys in a cash and stock transaction. Our analysis shows that combining the 2 companies to form the WEC Energy Group meets or exceeds all 3 criteria that we used to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities. 
First, we believe the acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing, of course, that would be 2016; second, we believe that we're largely credit neutral; and finally, we believe the long-term growth rate will be at least equal to Wisconsin Energy's standalone growth rate. 
We expect the combined company will grow earnings per share at 5% to 7% per year, faster than either of us is projecting on a stand-alone basis with more than 99% of those earnings coming from regulated businesses. 
Our customers will benefit from the operational efficiency that comes with increased scale and geographic proximity, and over time we'll enhance the operations of the 7 utilities that will be part of our company by incorporating best practices system-wide. We believe that customers could actually see as much as $1 billion of savings over the next 10 years through a combination of lower capital and operating costs in Wisconsin. 
In addition, Integrys today, as you may recall, owns a 34.1% interest in American Transmission Company. Wisconsin Energy owns 26.2%. That means the combined entity will have a 60% stake in one of the largest independent transmission companies in the United States. ATC has a 10-year capital investment plan to bolster electric reliability in our region that calls for an investment of $3.3 billion to $3.9 billion by the year 2023. We believe it's a solid plan and we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. 
So where do we stand in getting the regulatory approvals for our acquisition of Integrys? Again, to refresh your memory, the proposed acquisition was approved by Wisconsin Energy and Integrys shareholders last November. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice completed its review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in October of last year with no further action required by the company. 
Just a few weeks ago, on April 7, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found the transaction to be in the public interest and issued an order with no conditions other than those we proposed. Then, on April 13, the Federal Communications Commission approved the transfer of certain communication licenses. So all federal approvals for the transaction are now complete. 
Turning to the state proceedings, the Michigan Commission issued its approval on April 23 and the Wisconsin Commission voted to approve the transaction at its open meeting on April 30, determining the transaction to be in the best interest of utility customers, stockholders and the public. 
The Wisconsin Commission applied several conditions to its approval, including a requirement that we share with customers for a 3-year period beginning in 2016, any earnings at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas that are above our allowed rates of return. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service, the Integrys utility based in Green Bay, will not be allowed to build a new natural gas fire-generating unit unless a study of the joint needs of all our companies determines a need for new capacity. We expect to receive a final written order from the Wisconsin Commission by the end of May. 
In Minnesota, the commission there is expected to review our application during May and the schedule for the Illinois Commerce Commission calls for a decision no later than July 6. In summary, we're making excellent progress on all regulatory fronts and we anticipate closing the transaction now by the end of the summer. 
Now before we discuss the status of our ongoing construction projects, I'd also like to take just a moment to follow-up on the settlement agreement in Michigan. As we discussed during our previous calls, we've been working toward a long-term electric reliability solution for the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In cooperation with the Michigan Governor, the Michigan Attorney General, the Michigan commission staff and the iron ore mines, we reached an agreement on March 12 that replaced the original arrangement we had announced in January. 
The revised agreement includes the following important elements: first, Wisconsin Electric will retain ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant and our current electric distribution assets. The iron ore mines have entered into long-term contracts to purchase power from Wisconsin Electric. Wisconsin Energy then expressed a willingness, if requested, to invest in a new generating plant in the Upper Peninsula and/or purchase power from the new facility. This would allow for the eventual retirement of the Presque Isle Plant. 
And finally, Wisconsin Energy would potentially create a separate Michigan-only utility. If formed, our electric customers residing in the upper peninsula of Michigan will become part of this utility and the utility would be a subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy. So overall, we're very pleased with this result. 
And now turning to recent developments in our core business, as you may recall last July, we received a final written order from the Wisconsin Commission approving our request to build and operate a new natural gas lateral, which will span an 85-mile route through Western and Central Wisconsin. The project will address natural gas reliability concerns in that region of the state. It will also help meet the demand being driven by customers converting from propane to natural gas and demand from the sand mining industry. 
The commission's approval also includes franchise awards for 10 communities along the route and authorizes us to begin delivering natural gas within the borders of those communities. We began work last October on portions of the downstream facilities. Two of the 3 branch lines were installed by mid-November. Construction of the third branch line began in January and is now nearing completion. Route clearing for the final large diameter lateral is now complete; construction on the regulator stations is on schedule; and 100% of the large diameter steel pipe has been delivered to our work yards. 
We're on time, we're on budget and we expect to complete the project in the fourth quarter of this year at a projected cost of $175 million to $185 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. 
On the generation side of our business, you'll recall that we're converting the fuel source for our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. The 2 unit Valley Plant is a cogeneration facility located along the Menomonee River near downtown Milwaukee. Valley generates electricity for the grid, produces steam for more than 400 customers in the downtown Milwaukee business center and also provides important voltage support for the electric network.
The Valley conversion project achieved another milestone on April 10. That's when unit 2 started its coal-to-gas conversion outage and the Valley Power Plant stopped burning coal after more than 46 years. Unit 2 should be completed by early fall, in time for the next heating season. Unit 1 of course achieved commercial operation burning natural gas last November.
Overall, the Valley project is more than 70% complete. We expect the total cost to range between $65 million and $70 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Converting Valley to natural gas will reduce our operating costs and enhance the environmental performance of the units. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at 280 megawatts. 
Now, I'd like to touch on the upgrade of our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant. Located on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula, Twin Falls was built back in the day in 1912 and is one of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. Construction began in late 2013 to build a new powerhouse and add spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. Construction activities have now resumed at Twin Falls after a planned break for the winter. We continue to make good progress on all the major construction work. The Upstream Cofferdam is finished, rock excavation is roughly 90% complete, and overall, the project is on time and on budget, with approximately 42% of the work now finished. 
We will begin physical construction of the new powerhouse later this spring. We expect to achieve commercial operation in the summer of 2016. We're forecasting the total investment at $60 million to $65 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Also, we continue to make excellent progress on our initiative to improve fuel flexibility at our Oak Creek expansion units. As you recall, these units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal. However, given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the 2 types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year depending upon the blend. 
So after receiving the necessary environmental approvals, we began making changes to the boilers and testing various blends of bituminous and PRB coal at the plant. We've actually conducted limited testing on Unit 2 at levels of up to 100% PRB. Although the testing has gone very well, there are operational issues that need to be addressed and equipment that must be modified. 
So last July, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission to approve additional capital spending to modify the plant. Our share of that investment would be $21 million. If approved, the modifications are expected to support sustained operation at up to 60% PRB and allow us to continue testing blends of up to 100% PRB. We also need space and equipment to handle additional coal inventory on the site. As a result, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission last October for an expanded coal storage facility and additional handling equipment. Our share of the estimated capital cost for this project is $58 million. We hope to receive commission approval for both of these initiatives this summer. 
Looking forward, we continue to see significant investment opportunities in our existing core business, as we upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on delivering the future. Our capital budget calls for spending $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion over a 5-year period 2015 through 2019. Our rolling 10 year capital budget calls for investing between $6.6 billion and $7.2 billion over the period 2015 through 2024. 
Turning now to our dividend policy, our current stand-alone policy targets a dividend payout ratio trending to 65% to 70% of earnings in 2017, a policy that's more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector. At the closing of the Integrys acquisition, we expect to increase the dividend for Wisconsin Energy stockholders by 7% to 8% to achieve parity with the Integrys shareholders. Going forward, the payout target for the combined company is projected to be at 65% to 70% of earnings. 
In conclusion, we're off to a strong start both financially and operationally in 2015 and we're pleased with the progress we've made as we work to finalize our acquisition of Integrys. 
And now, for more details on our first quarter, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?"
315117,290552930,804481,"Wisconsin Energy Corp., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2015 first quarter adjusted earnings were $0.90 a share compared with $0.91 a share for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our 2 business segments a",989,"Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2015 first quarter adjusted earnings were $0.90 a share compared with $0.91 a share for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our 2 business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. 
Our consolidated operating income for the first quarter was $358.8 million as compared to $381.8 million in 2014. That's a decrease of $23 million. Starting with the Utility Energy segment, you'll see that operating income in the first quarter totaled $276.5 million for 2015, a decrease of $16.2 million from the first quarter of 2014. On the favorable side, we estimate that our operating income increased by $14.7 million because of the impacts of the 2015 rate case. On the downside, we estimate that our gas and electric margins decreased by $20.6 million because of the weather. 
As Gale mentioned earlier, the first quarter of 2015 was cold. Our heating degree days were up almost 12% as compared to normal. However, heating degree days last year were 24% higher than normal due to the polar vortex. In addition, our depreciation expense increased by $4.3 million due to additional capital placed into service. 
Operating income in the non-utility segment was up $1.4 million when compared to 2014. This increase reflects additional investment at our Power the Future plans. Our corporate and other segment showed an operating loss of $9.3 million this quarter as compared to $1.1 million loss in the first quarter of 2014. This increase is directly driven by costs associated with the acquisition. Taking the changes for these segments together we arrive at the $23 million decline in operating income. 
During the first quarter, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $16.1 million, a slight decline from the same period last year. This decline was in line with our expectations and is directly related to an anticipated reduction in authorized returns for transmission companies. 
Our other income net increased by $1.9 million largely because of higher AFUDC. AFUDC increased primarily because of our gas expansion project in Western Wisconsin. Our net interest expense decreased by $2.6 million, primarily because of lower long-term interest rates. Last year, we replaced maturing debt with new debt at lower rates. 
Consolidated income tax expense fell by $7.9 million because of lower pretax earnings. Our effective income tax rate was in line with the prior year. We expect our annual effective tax rate for 2015 to be between 37% and 38%. Combining all of these items brings you to $195.8 million of net income for the first quarter of 2015 or earnings of $0.86 per share. Our adjusted earnings, which exclude $0.04 of acquisition-related costs, were $0.90 per share. 
During the first quarter of 2015, our operating cash flows totaled $329.7 million, which is $55.4 million less than 2014. In January, we contributed $100 million to our pension trust, which reduced operating cash flows. No contributions were made in 2014. Our capital expenditures totaled $149.5 million in the first quarter, a $20.3 million increase compared to 2014. The largest increase was related to the gas expansion project in Western Wisconsin.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.6% at the end of March. Our calculation treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares, except, of course, for those shares in connection with the acquisition of Integrys. We also paid $95.3 million in common dividends in the first quarter of 2015, an increase of $7.2 million over the first quarter last year. 
Weather-normalized retail deliveries of electricity fell by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the first quarter of 2014. Actual first quarter deliveries fell by 2.4%. Looking at the individual customer segments, we saw weather-normalized residential deliveries drop by 3.1%. Actual residential deliveries fell 7.1%.
Across our small commercial industrial group, weather-normal quarterly deliveries were flat with last year. Actual deliveries fell by 1.2%. In the large commercial industrial segment, deliveries for the first quarter of 2015 were up by 0.6%. If you exclude the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries fell by 0.5%. 
Our first quarter weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, improved by 2.2% compared to the same period in 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again excluding gas used for power generation, were down 6.8% compared to the polar vortex driven gas sales and last year's first quarter. Our overall results for gas and electric sales in the first quarter are in line with our expectations for the year. 
Turning now to our earnings forecast, we are reaffirming our 2015 stand-alone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. We're off to a strong start, but we still have 9 more months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our stand-alone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. 
Finally, let's take a look at second quarter guidance. Last year's second quarter adjusted earnings were $0.59 a share, which excludes $0.01 a share related to our acquisition of Integrys. Last year's second quarter earnings were buoyed by a favorable O&M cost and lower benefits cost. This year, our maintenance schedule calls for more work in the second quarter than we performed last year. In addition, our April weather this year was much milder than last year. Taking these factors into account, we expect our second quarter 2015 adjusted earnings to be in a range of $0.54 to $0.56 a share, that assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes transaction-related costs. 
Once again, our second quarter 2015 adjusted guidance is $0.54 to $0.56 a share. And with that, I will turn things back to Gale"

The short answer is, yes, I do think that the first quarter residential weather normal numbers are a statistical anomaly. You've heard me say this before, but the weather normalization techniques that are available to companies like ours, they simply break down when you get 2 to 3 standard deviations off the norm. And last year, with the polar vortex, particularly as it hit the Midwest and Wisconsin, I mean, we were way, way off the norm, so I honestly don't put much stock in the weather normal numbers for the first quarter. On the other hand, if you look at our large commercial and industrial segment, which is far less weather sensitive, you saw an uptick of 0.6% even compared to the polar vortex numbers of a year ago. So as we've looked at this and believe me, we've analyzed this about 14 ways to Sunday, our bottom line conclusion is we're on track overall for what we expected for the year. And we weren't expecting, as you know, a significant uptick in kilowatt hour sales. So we feel pretty good about where we stand. And again, I would take with a grain of salt, the weather normal numbers when you compare it to such an extraordinary period a year ago. Hope that helps, Greg."

But on the other hand, I would say steady as she goes from the general input we're getting from our industrial customers. And then, of course, we should see an interesting development in the second quarter.

As you probably have read, specifically related to your question on Peoples Gas, we were asked by the Illinois Commerce Commission what our plans would be for management at Peoples Gas and we responded to the Illinois commission in writing committing that we would essentially place a minimum of 3 new senior officers from our team at Peoples Gas. So that will be one of the first steps that we will take, immediately following the acquisition. We will put a very experienced, professional, solid management team in place at Peoples Gas. We're going to find, we know this already, some very talented people in the operational ranks of Peoples Gas so I think we're going to have a really solid team from Day 1 at Peoples Gas.

Well, first of all, just to explain the procedure with the Illinois Commerce Commission, the State Attorney General in Illinois filed a motion with the administrative law judge that is presiding over our merger case petitioning the administrative law judge to, in essence, delay an ICC decision on our merger from the statutory deadline of July 6 for an additional 90 days, while the review continues on the management of the advanced main replacement program that Peoples Gas is undertaking. Both we and Integrys felt that a delay was not necessary because there's a separate docket where the Illinois Commerce Commission is reviewing any concern and reviewing the matter in which the gas main replacement program has been managed. So there's a separate docket underway that will probably go on for a number of months. The administrative law judge determined that a delay was simply not necessary and ruled in favor of no delay. The commission staff also suggested no delay. So at the moment, there would be nothing on the table that would postpone a decision by July 6 so I hope that's helpful on the scheduling standpoint. In terms of the review of the what's called AMRP, the advanced main replacement program. The Illinois Commerce Commission had already authorized an independent audit, if you will, of how Peoples is managing that construction program. And of course, that construction program, as you know, is very extensive. It will last probably at least for a 10-year period. The legislation actually covers a 10-year period in Illinois for the replacement of aging gas pipes in the City of Chicago. Some of those pipes by the way are Civil War-era pipes, and really do badly need replacing. So long story short, there already was an external audit going on of the AMRP program and how it's been managed. That audit is well along, an interim report, there's an auditing firm called Liberty and the Liberty report, the interim report is out and has been shared with us, and we would expect, Allen, a final Liberty report, I would assume, within the next 30 to 45 days."

One, clearly just the low price of natural gas; and secondly, the opportunity that we have to continue to gain customers through switching from propane to natural gas. You may have heard me say this before, but the national statistics from a year ago would indicate that Wisconsin is one of the 5 heaviest using propane states in the United States. And I think there's a tremendous opportunity for customer growth. I mean, forget about per usage customer for a minute, but I think there's a tremendous opportunity for customer growth as we continue to see customers wanting to switch to our natural gas distribution network. In fact, I mentioned in the script the uptick in customer growth that we're seeing and it's double-digit so far this year compared to the uptick we saw even last year. So to make a long story short, if I were a betting man, I would say gas grows faster than electric by a bit over the next 4 to 5 years."

315117,290552930,806190,"Wisconsin Energy Corp., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Colleen, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2015 first quarter results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Le",2283,"Colleen, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2015 first quarter results. 
Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of Wisconsin Energy and CEO of our Generation Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer. 
Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.90 a share for the first quarter of 2015, this compares with earnings of $0.91 a share for the first quarter last year. 
Our adjusted earnings exclude expenses of $0.04 a share, related to our acquisition of Integrys Energy Group. While the story of the first quarter was our cold winter weather, though not nearly as extreme as the weather that gripped our region last year, temperatures were almost 12% colder than normal, driving strong customer demand for natural gas. In fact during February, we delivered more natural gas to our retail customers than during any other February in our history, exceeding last year's record by 5.5%. 
I'm also pleased to report that our natural gas distribution networks performed exceptionally well, underscoring the benefit to customers of our Deliver The Future program. You may recall that as part of Deliver the Future, we're accelerating the replacement of older natural gas distribution lines, the lines that are most susceptible to stress during severe weather. 
Turning now to the state of the economy, the Wisconsin unemployment rate fell to 4.6% in March. That's the state's lowest unemployment rate since 2008 and is nearly a full percentage point better than the national average of 5.5%. Wisconsin added more than 48,000 private sector jobs between March of 2014 and March of 2015. And as the economy continues to improve, deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers improved as well, rising by 0.6% in the first quarter. 
Sectors that showed particular strength included plastics, printing and food processing. In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. Through early May, new electric service connections are up almost 19% and new natural gas installations are up nearly 14% compared to the same time period last year. 
Now later in my remarks, I'll update you on other developments in our core business and the important construction projects we have underway. But first, I'd like to discuss our progress in obtaining regulatory approvals for the acquisition of Integrys. To refresh your memory, on June 23 last year, we announced plans to acquire Integrys in a cash and stock transaction. Our analysis shows that combining the 2 companies to form the WEC Energy Group meets or exceeds all 3 criteria that we used to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities. 
First, we believe the acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing, of course, that would be 2016; second, we believe that we're largely credit neutral; and finally, we believe the long-term growth rate will be at least equal to Wisconsin Energy's standalone growth rate. 
We expect the combined company will grow earnings per share at 5% to 7% per year, faster than either of us is projecting on a stand-alone basis with more than 99% of those earnings coming from regulated businesses. 
Our customers will benefit from the operational efficiency that comes with increased scale and geographic proximity, and over time we'll enhance the operations of the 7 utilities that will be part of our company by incorporating best practices system-wide. We believe that customers could actually see as much as $1 billion of savings over the next 10 years through a combination of lower capital and operating costs in Wisconsin. 
In addition, Integrys today, as you may recall, owns a 34.1% interest in American Transmission Company. Wisconsin Energy owns 26.2%. That means the combined entity will have a 60% stake in one of the largest independent transmission companies in the United States. ATC has a 10-year capital investment plan to bolster electric reliability in our region that calls for an investment of $3.3 billion to $3.9 billion by the year 2023. We believe it's a solid plan and we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. 
So where do we stand in getting the regulatory approvals for our acquisition of Integrys? Again, to refresh your memory, the proposed acquisition was approved by Wisconsin Energy and Integrys shareholders last November. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice completed its review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in October of last year with no further action required by the company. 
Just a few weeks ago, on April 7, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found the transaction to be in the public interest and issued an order with no conditions other than those we proposed. Then, on April 13, the Federal Communications Commission approved the transfer of certain communication licenses. So all federal approvals for the transaction are now complete. 
Turning to the state proceedings, the Michigan Commission issued its approval on April 23 and the Wisconsin Commission voted to approve the transaction at its open meeting on April 30, determining the transaction to be in the best interest of utility customers, stockholders and the public. 
The Wisconsin Commission applied several conditions to its approval, including a requirement that we share with customers for a 3-year period beginning in 2016, any earnings at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas that are above our allowed rates of return. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service, the Integrys utility based in Green Bay, will not be allowed to build a new natural gas fire-generating unit unless a study of the joint needs of all our companies determines a need for new capacity. We expect to receive a final written order from the Wisconsin Commission by the end of May. 
In Minnesota, the commission there is expected to review our application during May and the schedule for the Illinois Commerce Commission calls for a decision no later than July 6. In summary, we're making excellent progress on all regulatory fronts and we anticipate closing the transaction now by the end of the summer. 
Now before we discuss the status of our ongoing construction projects, I'd also like to take just a moment to follow-up on the settlement agreement in Michigan. As we discussed during our previous calls, we've been working toward a long-term electric reliability solution for the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In cooperation with the Michigan Governor, the Michigan Attorney General, the Michigan commission staff and the iron ore mines, we reached an agreement on March 12 that replaced the original arrangement we had announced in January. 
The revised agreement includes the following important elements: first, Wisconsin Electric will retain ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant and our current electric distribution assets. The iron ore mines have entered into long-term contracts to purchase power from Wisconsin Electric. Wisconsin Energy then expressed a willingness, if requested, to invest in a new generating plant in the Upper Peninsula and/or purchase power from the new facility. This would allow for the eventual retirement of the Presque Isle Plant. 
And finally, Wisconsin Energy would potentially create a separate Michigan-only utility. If formed, our electric customers residing in the upper peninsula of Michigan will become part of this utility and the utility would be a subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy. So overall, we're very pleased with this result. 
And now turning to recent developments in our core business, as you may recall last July, we received a final written order from the Wisconsin Commission approving our request to build and operate a new natural gas lateral, which will span an 85-mile route through Western and Central Wisconsin. The project will address natural gas reliability concerns in that region of the state. It will also help meet the demand being driven by customers converting from propane to natural gas and demand from the sand mining industry. 
The commission's approval also includes franchise awards for 10 communities along the route and authorizes us to begin delivering natural gas within the borders of those communities. We began work last October on portions of the downstream facilities. Two of the 3 branch lines were installed by mid-November. Construction of the third branch line began in January and is now nearing completion. Route clearing for the final large diameter lateral is now complete; construction on the regulator stations is on schedule; and 100% of the large diameter steel pipe has been delivered to our work yards. 
We're on time, we're on budget and we expect to complete the project in the fourth quarter of this year at a projected cost of $175 million to $185 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. 
On the generation side of our business, you'll recall that we're converting the fuel source for our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. The 2 unit Valley Plant is a cogeneration facility located along the Menomonee River near downtown Milwaukee. Valley generates electricity for the grid, produces steam for more than 400 customers in the downtown Milwaukee business center and also provides important voltage support for the electric network.
The Valley conversion project achieved another milestone on April 10. That's when unit 2 started its coal-to-gas conversion outage and the Valley Power Plant stopped burning coal after more than 46 years. Unit 2 should be completed by early fall, in time for the next heating season. Unit 1 of course achieved commercial operation burning natural gas last November.
Overall, the Valley project is more than 70% complete. We expect the total cost to range between $65 million and $70 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Converting Valley to natural gas will reduce our operating costs and enhance the environmental performance of the units. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at 280 megawatts. 
Now I'd like to touch on the upgrade of our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant. Located on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula, Twin Falls was built back in the day in 1912 and is one of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. Construction began in late 2013 to build a new powerhouse and add spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. Construction activities have now resumed at Twin Falls after a planned break for the winter. We continue to make good progress on all the major construction work. The Upstream Cofferdam is finished, rock excavation is roughly 90% complete, and overall, the project is on time and on budget, with approximately 42% of the work now finished. 
We will begin physical construction of the new powerhouse later this spring. We expect to achieve commercial operation in the summer of 2016. We're forecasting the total investment at $60 million to $65 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Also, we continue to make excellent progress on our initiative to improve fuel flexibility at our Oak Creek expansion units. As you recall, these units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal. However, given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the 2 types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year depending upon the blend. 
So after receiving the necessary environmental approvals, we began making changes to the boilers and testing various blends of bituminous and PRB coal at the plant. We've actually conducted limited testing on Unit 2 at levels of up to 100% PRB. Although the testing has gone very well, there are operational issues that need to be addressed and equipment that must be modified. 
So last July, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission to approve additional capital spending to modify the plant. Our share of that investment would be $21 million. If approved, the modifications are expected to support sustained operation at up to 60% PRB and allow us to continue testing blends of up to 100% PRB. We also need space and equipment to handle additional coal inventory on the site. As a result, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission last October for an expanded coal storage facility and additional handling equipment. Our share of the estimated capital cost for this project is $58 million. We hope to receive commission approval for both of these initiatives this summer. 
Looking forward, we continue to see significant investment opportunities in our existing core business, as we upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on delivering the future. Our capital budget calls for spending $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion over a 5-year period 2015 through 2019. Our rolling 10 year capital budget calls for investing between $6.6 billion and $7.2 billion over the period 2015 through 2024. 
Turning now to our dividend policy, our current stand-alone policy targets a dividend payout ratio trending to 65% to 70% of earnings in 2017, a policy that's more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector. At the closing of the Integrys acquisition, we expect to increase the dividend for Wisconsin Energy stockholders by 7% to 8% to achieve parity with the Integrys shareholders. Going forward, the payout target for the combined company is projected to be at 65% to 70% of earnings. 
In conclusion, we're off to a strong start both financially and operationally in 2015 and we're pleased with the progress we've made as we work to finalize our acquisition of Integrys. 
And now for more details on our first quarter, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?"
315117,290552930,806190,"Wisconsin Energy Corp., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2015 first quarter adjusted earnings were $0.90 a share compared with $0.91 a share for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our 2 business segments a",989,"Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2015 first quarter adjusted earnings were $0.90 a share compared with $0.91 a share for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our 2 business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. 
Our consolidated operating income for the first quarter was $358.8 million as compared to $381.8 million in 2014. That's a decrease of $23 million. Starting with the Utility Energy segment, you'll see that operating income in the first quarter totaled $276.5 million for 2015, a decrease of $16.2 million from the first quarter of 2014. On the favorable side, we estimate that our operating income increased by $14.7 million because of the impacts of the 2015 rate case. On the downside, we estimate that our gas and electric margins decreased by $20.6 million because of the weather. 
As Gale mentioned earlier, the first quarter of 2015 was cold. Our heating degree days were up almost 12% as compared to normal. However, heating degree days last year were 24% higher than normal due to the polar vortex. In addition, our depreciation expense increased by $4.3 million due to additional capital placed into service. 
Operating income in the non-utility segment was up $1.4 million when compared to 2014. This increase reflects additional investment at our Power the Future plans. Our corporate and other segment showed an operating loss of $9.3 million this quarter as compared to $1.1 million loss in the first quarter of 2014. This increase is directly driven by costs associated with the acquisition. Taking the changes for these segments together we arrive at the $23 million decline in operating income. 
During the first quarter, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $16.1 million, a slight decline from the same period last year. This decline was in line with our expectations and is directly related to an anticipated reduction in authorized returns for transmission companies. 
Our other income net increased by $1.9 million largely because of higher AFUDC. AFUDC increased primarily because of our gas expansion project in Western Wisconsin. Our net interest expense decreased by $2.6 million, primarily because of lower long-term interest rates. Last year, we replaced maturing debt with new debt at lower rates. 
Consolidated income tax expense fell by $7.9 million because of lower pretax earnings. Our effective income tax rate was in line with the prior year. We expect our annual effective tax rate for 2015 to be between 37% and 38%. Combining all of these items brings you to $195.8 million of net income for the first quarter of 2015 or earnings of $0.86 per share. Our adjusted earnings, which exclude $0.04 of acquisition-related costs, were $0.90 per share. 
During the first quarter of 2015, our operating cash flows totaled $329.7 million, which is $55.4 million less than 2014. In January, we contributed $100 million to our pension trust, which reduced operating cash flows. No contributions were made in 2014. Our capital expenditures totaled $149.5 million in the first quarter, a $20.3 million increase compared to 2014. The largest increase was related to the gas expansion project in Western Wisconsin.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.6% at the end of March. Our calculation treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares, except, of course, for those shares in connection with the acquisition of Integrys. We also paid $95.3 million in common dividends in the first quarter of 2015, an increase of $7.2 million over the first quarter last year. 
Weather-normalized retail deliveries of electricity fell by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the first quarter of 2014. Actual first quarter deliveries fell by 2.4%. Looking at the individual customer segments, we saw weather-normalized residential deliveries drop by 3.1%. Actual residential deliveries fell 7.1%.
Across our small commercial industrial group, weather-normal quarterly deliveries were flat with last year. Actual deliveries fell by 1.2%. In the large commercial industrial segment, deliveries for the first quarter of 2015 were up by 0.6%. If you exclude the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries fell by 0.5%. 
Our first quarter weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, improved by 2.2% compared to the same period in 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again excluding gas used for power generation, were down 6.8% compared to the polar vortex driven gas sales and last year's first quarter. Our overall results for gas and electric sales in the first quarter are in line with our expectations for the year. 
Turning now to our earnings forecast, we are reaffirming our 2015 stand-alone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. We're off to a strong start, but we still have 9 more months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our stand-alone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. 
Finally, let's take a look at second quarter guidance. Last year's second quarter adjusted earnings were $0.59 a share, which excludes $0.01 a share related to our acquisition of Integrys. Last year's second quarter earnings were buoyed by a favorable O&M cost and lower benefits cost. This year, our maintenance schedule calls for more work in the second quarter than we performed last year. In addition, our April weather this year was much milder than last year. Taking these factors into account, we expect our second quarter 2015 adjusted earnings to be in a range of $0.54 to $0.56 a share, that assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes transaction-related costs. 
Once again, our second quarter 2015 adjusted guidance is $0.54 to $0.56 a share. And with that, I will turn things back to Gale"

The short answer is, yes, I do think that the first quarter residential weather normal numbers are a statistical anomaly. You've heard me say this before, but the weather normalization techniques that are available to companies like ours, they simply break down when you get 2 to 3 standard deviations off the norm. And last year, with the polar vortex, particularly as it hit the Midwest and Wisconsin, I mean, we were way, way off the norm, so I honestly don't put much stock in the weather normal numbers for the first quarter. On the other hand, if you look at our large commercial and industrial segment, which is far less weather sensitive, you saw an uptick of 0.6% even compared to the polar vortex numbers of a year ago. So as we've looked at this and believe me, we've analyzed this about 14 ways to Sunday, our bottom line conclusion is we're on track overall for what we expected for the year. And we weren't expecting, as you know, a significant uptick in kilowatt hour sales. So we feel pretty good about where we stand. And again, I would take with a grain of salt, the weather normal numbers when you compare it to such an extraordinary period a year ago. Hope that helps, Greg."

But on the other hand, I would say steady as she goes from the general input we're getting from our industrial customers. And then, of course, we should see an interesting development in the second quarter.

Once we complete the acquisition, we intend to function as one company, one team, with 7 customer-facing brands, all focused on customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. That's basically the mantra, the mission and how we will go about achieving the important objectives that we've laid out for the transaction, including meeting all 3 of the criteria that we continued to talk about as the criteria that we use for any acquisition opportunity. As you probably have read, specifically related to your question on Peoples Gas, we were asked by the Illinois Commerce Commission what our plans would be for management at Peoples Gas and we responded to the Illinois commission in writing committing that we would essentially place a minimum of 3 new senior officers from our team at Peoples Gas. So that will be one of the first steps that we will take, immediately following the acquisition. We will put a very experienced, professional, solid management team in place at Peoples Gas. We're going to find, we know this already, some very talented people in the operational ranks of Peoples Gas so I think we're going to have a really solid team from Day 1 at Peoples Gas. And the Peoples Gas organization will report directly to me."

Well, first of all, just to explain the procedure with the Illinois Commerce Commission, the State Attorney General in Illinois filed a motion with the administrative law judge that is presiding over our merger case petitioning the administrative law judge to, in essence, delay an ICC decision on our merger from the statutory deadline of July 6 for an additional 90 days, while the review continues on the management of the advanced main replacement program that Peoples Gas is undertaking. Both we and Integrys felt that a delay was not necessary because there's a separate docket where the Illinois Commerce Commission is reviewing any concern and reviewing the matter in which the gas main replacement program has been managed. So there's a separate docket underway that will probably go on for a number of months. The administrative law judge determined that a delay was simply not necessary and ruled in favor of no delay. The commission staff also suggested no delay. So at the moment, there would be nothing on the table that would postpone a decision by July 6 so I hope that's helpful on the scheduling standpoint. In terms of the review of the what's called AMRP, the advanced main replacement program. The Illinois Commerce Commission had already authorized an independent audit, if you will, of how Peoples is managing that construction program. And of course, that construction program, as you know, is very extensive. It will last probably at least for a 10-year period. The legislation actually covers a 10-year period in Illinois for the replacement of aging gas pipes in the City of Chicago. Some of those pipes by the way are Civil War-era pipes, and really do badly need replacing. So long story short, there already was an external audit going on of the AMRP program and how it's been managed. That audit is well along, an interim report, there's an auditing firm called Liberty and the Liberty report, the interim report is out and has been shared with us, and we would expect, Allen, a final Liberty report, I would assume, within the next 30 to 45 days."

You may have heard me say this before, but the national statistics from a year ago would indicate that Wisconsin is one of the 5 heaviest using propane states in the United States. And I think there's a tremendous opportunity for customer growth. I mean, forget about per usage customer for a minute, but I think there's a tremendous opportunity for customer growth as we continue to see customers wanting to switch to our natural gas distribution network. In fact, I mentioned in the script the uptick in customer growth that we're seeing and it's double-digit so far this year compared to the uptick we saw even last year. So to make a long story short, if I were a betting man, I would say gas grows faster than electric by a bit over the next 4 to 5 years."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our second quarter results. As I'm sure you know, on June 29, we acquired Integrys in a $9 billion transaction to form WEC Energy Group. We now serve 4.4 million electric customers and natural gas customers across 4 Midwestern states. I'll provide you with much more detail on the new company shortly, but first, as always, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of WEC Energy Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scout Lauber, our Treasurer. I'd also like to welcome Beth Stronka, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Now many of you know Beth from her work over the past decade or so as one of the more perceptive analysts covering our industry. I wanted to tell you we've forgiven her for that, and we're delighted that she's with us. 
Turning now to the second quarter, pat will review our financial results in detail a bit later on the call, but as you saw from our earnings release this morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.59 a share from the second quarter of this year. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.59 a share from the second quarter of 2014. I should point out that the numbers we're reporting to you today reflect Wisconsin Energy only. Since the acquisition closed on June 29, Integrys earnings were immaterial. 
Taking a very quick look now at the state of the economy, Wisconsin unemployment rate stood at 4.6% June, well below the national average. Deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers however, excluding the iron ore mines, fell by 1.4% in the second quarter. And several sectors showed strength, including plastics, prancing and food processing. Also, our small commercial and industrial segment is growing. With electricity use rising by 2.3% over the second quarter of a year ago. In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. NEw electric service connections are up 8.2% and new natural gas installations were up 4% compared to the same time period last year. 
Now I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing our plans for the future of the new WEC Energy Group. When we first considered the opportunity to acquire Integrys, we weighted against our 3 important criteria for evaluating any potential acquisition. After considerable due diligence, we found that it met or exceeded all 3 criteria. First, it wouldn't be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing; second, it would be largely credit-neutral; and third, the long-term growth rate would be equal to or greater than Wisconsin Energy's standalone growth rate. We also saw tremendous opportunity in the framework of the new company. WEC Energy Group has the scale, scope, technical depth, geographic region, financial resources to thrive in our consolidating industry. We plan to leverage those strengths to deliver operational and financial benefits to all of our stakeholders, from the customers and communities we serve to the people we employ, to the shareholders who count on us to create value. And with our proven leadership team, we will incorporate best practices across the organization to streamline our operations and reduce costs. 
So what does our new footprint look like? Well as I mentioned, the new company provides electricity and natural gas to 4.4 million customers across 4 states through our customer-facing brands, We Energies, Wisconsin Public Service, Peoples Gas, North Shore Gas, Michigan Gas Utilities and Minnesota Energy Resources. Our company operates in a balanced regulatory environment, with greater jurisdiction on diversity than before the acquisition. And of course, more than 99% of our earnings will come from regulated operations. WEC Energy Group is now the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in the country and one of the 15 largest investor-owned utilities systems in the United States with significant opportunities for growth. Of course, the majority of the earning assets we acquired are here in Wisconsin, a familiar landscape for us. And major infrastructure upgrades are underway now with Wisconsin Public Service in the Northern part of the state. These investment opportunities are similar to those we have pursued over the years on time and on budget at We Energies. We're also in excellent position to take advantage of new customer growth across the region, especially in Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota, where propane and oil users are continuing to convert to natural gas.  In addition, as many of you know, Integrys and Wisconsin Energy were the 2 largest owner of American Transmission Company. Today, WEC Energy Group has become a 60% owner of ATC. As you recall, ATC plans to invest between $3.3 billion and $3.9 billion between 2014 and 2023  to bolster electric reliability in our service area. We believe this is a solid plan, and we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. 
Now I'd like to briefly discuss some of the conditions we agreed to as we worked our way through the regulatory approvals for the acquisition. In Wisconsin, we committed to an earnings cap for our Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas subsidiaries. Starting in 2016 next year, we will share with our customers any earnings in excess of our allowed rate of return. The first 50 basis points of earnings above our authorized return will be split equally between the company and our customers. Then any earnings above that level will go exclusively to customers. This sharing mechanism will be in effect through 2018. We also agreed to develop an integrated resource plan detailing the joint capacity of needs of Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Public Service. We expect to file the resource plan with the Wisconsin Commission later this quarter. In Michigan, as we've discussed on previous calls, we expect to pursue the formation of a Michigan-only utility. Our customers in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan will be served by this entity, and we expressed a willingness, if requested, to invest in a new generating plant in the Upper Peninsula and/or purchase power from a new facility. This will allow for the eventual retirement of the Presque Isle power plant. In Illinois, we agreed to return a minimum level of jobs in the state of Illinois for the next 2 years. We also committed to a 2 year base rate freeze and a capital spending floor from 2015 through 2017. In a recent development this past Friday, the Citizens Utility Board, the city of Chicago and the State Attorney General's office, asked the Illinois Commerce Commission to rehear our merger order. These parties are seeking additional conditions, conditions that they previously requested during the year-long approval process. The Illinois Commission now has until August 13 to accept or deny the request. We believe the commission's June 24 decision was correct and is supported by sound principles and by an extensive body of evidence. 
Now let's touch on some of the key financial metrics for the new company. For starters, as you may recall, we issued $1.5 billion of parent company debt to help finance the transaction. The all-in interest cost for the debt is approximately 2.2% annually, an excellent result and clearly lower than we anticipated. So for 2016, we now project our growth in earnings per share to be in the range of 6% to 8%. The 6% to 8% for next year assumes that Wisconsin Energy's standalone achieves earnings of $2.72 a share this year, which is the midpoint of our current 2015 guidance. Just to clarify, we start with the base of $2.72 a share for our standalone earnings this year, and we expect the combined company to grow earnings per share in the 6% to 8% range next year. For the longer term, after 2016, we see earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% annually, driven by operating efficiency, financial discipline and infrastructure investments that the region needs for reliability and for improved environmental performance. We look forward to providing you with additional sales on our capital investment plans at the EEI Finance Conference coming up in November. 
Regarding our dividend policy, in June, the Wisconsin Energy Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend to forty five and three quarter cents a share, that's an increase of 8.3% over the previous quarterly rate. This is equivalent to an annual rate of $1.83 a share. Going forward, we will target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings and we expect dividend growth to be in line with growth in earnings per share. 
Switching gears now, I'd like to update you on several of our major construction projects. On the generation side of our business, as you may recall, we're working to add fuel flexibility in our Oak Creek expansion units as part of our ongoing Power of the Future initiative. These units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal, however, given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the 2 types of fuel can save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year depending upon the blend. During extensive testing, we identified operational and equipment related improvements that will be needed to sustain the higher blends of PRB coal on a long-term basis. In May, the Wisconsin Commission approved our request for additional capital spending for plant modifications, expansion of our coal storage capacity and additional coal handling equipment. We already started the work to expand our coal storage capability and the first In-Plant capital improvements are expected to be made on the first unit at Oak Creek, the Oak Creek expansion during a planned outage this September. We plan to upgrade the second unit during the first quarter of 2016. Our share of these investments is targeted at approximately $80 million. 
Next, the conversion of our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. That conversion is now more than 80% complete. This conversion cost are expected to be in the $60 million to $65 million range excluding allowance for funds used during construction. We expect to complete the project on time and on budget before the end of this year. Our Western Wisconsin natural gas expansion project, which will address natural gas reliability concerns in the Western part of the state, is now more than 75% complete and is running on time and better than budget. We expect to complete this new 85-mile natural gas pipeline in the fourth quarter of this year at a cost actually well below the $175 million budget, a budget that again excludes allowance for funds used during construction. 
Looking forward, we continue to see significant investment opportunities in Wisconsin Energy's traditional business as we upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on delivering the future. Just to remind you, Wisconsin Energy's standalone capital budget calls for spending $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion over the 5-year period 2015 through 2019 and our 10-year standalone capital budget calls for investing between $6.6 billion and $7.2 billion over the period 2015 through 2024. 
Now before I turn the call over to Pat, I'd also like to discuss our plans for the accelerated main replacement program at Peoples Gas in Chicago. Just to refresh your memory, this is one of the largest infrastructure modernization programs in the country. The program calls for the replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging gas pipeline system over the next 20 years. Some of these pipes, ladies and gentlemen, literally date back to the time of the Civil War. One of our immediate and most important goals is to improve the management and performance of this project. Our first step was to appoint a new senior management team at People's, a new President, a new Vice President for construction, a new operations vice president and a new vice president for customer service. All of them are proven, experienced leaders from the Wisconsin Energy system. Over the past 3 weeks, our team has conducted a thorough evaluation of the accelerated main replacement program. They determine that the best approach is a fresh start. We begun transitioning the management of the project to in-house personnel. Previously the project was managed by an outside contractor. Going forward, we also plan to engage a nationally recognized firm to help conduct an independent bottom-up review of the cost, scope and schedule for the program. This past Monday, we notified the Illinois Commerce Commission of our decisions, and we will incorporate these decisions into a broader transition plan. This broader transition plan will address the recommendations made by Liberty Consulting group in their audit of the program. Liberty audit was completed earlier this year at the request of the Illinois Commerce Commission. I'm confident that the steps we'll taken will ensure that Chicago gets the save, modern natural gas delivery system that they deserve. 
In conclusion, these are exciting times filled with opportunity for our new combined company. We believe we have a very bright future ahead. We will build an enduring enterprise by focusing on the fundamentals, world-class reliability, operating efficiency, financial discipline and exceptional customer care. 
Now for more details on our second quarter performance and our outlook for the remainder of 2015, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?"
315117,307209375,841529,"WEC Energy Group, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2015 second quarter adjusted earnings were $0.59 a share. That's the same as our adjusted earnings for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Costs related to the acquisition of Integrys Energy reduced earnings by $0.24",1336,"Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2015 second quarter adjusted earnings were $0.59 a share. That's the same as our adjusted earnings for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Costs related to the acquisition of Integrys Energy reduced earnings by $0.24 per share in the second quarter 2015 and $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2014. Because of the timing of the acquisition, earnings results this quarter are exclusively from Wisconsin Energy. Going forward, our consolidated earnings will include the operating results of the Integrys Company's. Please note that the balance sheet included in this quarter's earnings package does incorporate the Integrys balance sheet. 
Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for Wisconsin Energy's 2 big business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Excluding acquisition-related costs, second quarter consolidated operating income was $232.5 million as compared with $245.8 million in 2014. That's a decline of $13.3 million. Starting with the Utility Energy segment, operating income in the second quarter totaled $140.4 million for 2015, a decline of $14.8 million in the second quarter of 2014. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, our earnings were helped by $9.5 million because of the impact to the 2015 rate case and by $3.4 million related to improved fuel recoveries. On the downside, we saw an increase in utility operations and maintenance costs of $18.5 million, primarily driven by increased regulatory amortizations, the timing of projects and certain benefit costs. We estimate that weather reduced our margins by $4.8 million, and we also saw increased depreciation and expense of $4.2 million. Combining these and other factors results in a $14.8 million decline in utility operating income in the second quarter 2015 compared with the same quarter in the prior year. 
Operating income in our Non-utility Energy segment was $93.5 million, which is $1.8 million higher than the prior year. Our corporate and other segment, which includes corporate costs and smaller affiliates, was essentially flat with last year's second quarter. Taking the changes from these segments together, you arrive at the second quarter operating income before acquisition-related costs of $232.5 million, a $13.3 million decline as compared to the second quarter of 2014. In addition, for the second quarter of 2015, we recognize $66.7 million of acquisition-related costs associated with benefit plan agreements, legal and banking fees and other costs. Overall, these costs were in line with our expectations. 
During the second quarter of 2015, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $14.3 million, a decline of $3.2 million from the same period in the prior year. As we mentioned in the first quarter, ATC has established reserves in light of recent appeals to the FERC related to authorize returns from regional transmission authorizations. Our earnings reflect Wisconsin Energy's share of ATC's results. Our other income net increased by $18 million. During the second quarter of 2015, we recognized an incremental gain of $15.2 million on the sale of a legacy asset. The purchase of sale of assets is a regular part of our business. In fact, we have real estate development subsidiary and this quarter's sale was part of our financial plan for the year. Our net interest expense increased by $3.1 million primarily because of higher debt levels. Consolidated income tax expense fell by $11.1 million for the quarter. Going forward, WEC Energy Group's annual effective income tax rate, driven by a onetime adjustment related to the acquisition of Integrys, is expected to be between 38% and 39% in 2015. We expect that Wisconsin Energy's standalone effective annual tax rate for 2015 will be between 37% and 38%. Combining all of these items brings you to the adjusted net income of $0.59 per share for the second quarter of 2015. 
During the first 6 months of 2015, our operating cash flows totaled $715.9 million, which is a $5.4 million decrease from the first 6 months of 2014. During 2015, we contributed $100 million to our pension plans. No such contributions were made during 2014. Operating cash flows were helped by improved working capital, for example, lower natural gas prices dropped accounts receivable balances and reduced the cost of gas and storage. Our capital expenditures totaled $356.5 million in the first 6 months of 2015, a $51 million increase compared to 2014. The increase was primarily driven by the increased expenditures related to the Western Gas lateral. 
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio as of June 30, 2015 was 50.7%. This ratio reflects the Integrys acquisition, treating half of WEC Energy Group hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. 
We paid $190.5 million in common dividends in the first 6 months of 2015, that's an increase of $14.5 million over the same period last year. Weather normalized retail deliveries of electricity fell by 1.3% in the second quarter of 2015 as compared to the second quarter of 2014. Actual second quarter deliveries fell by 1.6%. 
Looking now at individual customer segments, we saw weather normalized residential deliveries drop by 3.8%. Actual residential deliveries fell 5%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, whether normal quarterly deliveries rose by 2.4%. Actual deliveries rose by 2.3%. In the Large Commercial Industrial segment, deliveries for the second quarter of 2015 fell by 2.5%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries fell by 1.4%. Our year-to-date, weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding the gas used for power generation, were flat compared to the same period in 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again, excluding the gas used for power generation, were down 7.2% compared to the polar vortex driven gas sales last year. Our overall results for gas and electric sales in the first 6 months of 2015 are slightly behind our expectations for the year. 
Turning now to our earnings forecast, for the remainder of 2015, we will continue to guide based on standalone Wisconsin Energy earnings. As Gale mentioned, our long-term earnings per share growth rate is based upon these standalone earnings. We will, therefore, make the following adjustments to the WEC Energy Group GAAP earnings: Number one, remove the impact of Integrys; number two, remove the impact of acquisition debt. As Gale noted previously, we funded the $1.5 billion cash portion of the acquisition with $1.2 billion of long-term debt and $300 million of commercial paper. This long-term debt included 3, 5 and 10-year tranches. Overall, our debt has an approximate interest cost of 2.2% annually. Number three, move the impact of acquisition and other onetime costs such as banking and legal fees; number four, modify the effective tax rate to remove the impact of the onetime adjustment I just referred to earlier; and, finally, number five, remove the impact of the additional shares issue as part of the acquisition. 
With that, we'll move to our 2015 guidance. We are reaffirming our 2015 standalone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. We are off to a strong start, but still have 6 months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our standalone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. And, finally, let's take a look at third quarter guidance. Last year's third quarter adjusted earnings were $0.57 a share, which excludes $0.01 a share related to the acquisition of Integrys. 
Similar to last year, our summer got off to a very slow start this year with temperatures significantly below normal during the first 10 days in July. So taking this July weather into account, we expect our third quarter 2015 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.58 a share. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any remaining transition-related costs. Once again, our third quarter 2015 adjusted guidance is $0.56 to $0.58 a share. 
And with that, I'll turn things back to Gale."

Let me first start with initial part of your question, how do we think about the trajectory of earnings going forward here now that we've closed the acquisition, as you may have heard me say on the script, given everything we see today and given the terrific result that we got in terms of the annual interest cost on the parent company debt, we're projecting 2016 to have a growth rate over our standalone 2015 guidance, midpoint of our guidance. So we're projecting 2016 to grow 6% to 8%. And then post 2016, we still see a 5% to 7% growth rate. There are a couple of important underlying assumptions that we're making and that we really feel very good about delivering related to the growth rate. First is that we believe we can, through best practices, through cost reductions, through financial discipline and through on-time and on budget investing in the infrastructure upgrades that are needed, we believe we can move all of the utilities, the former Integrys utilities, at or near the allowed rates of return in Illinois and Michigan and Minnesota and of course WPS Wisconsin. So that's a pretty important underlying assumption. And to your question about where were the allowed rates of return for those utilities, just a reminder that We Energies and Wisconsin Gas have historically earned at or very close to and some years slightly above the allowed rates of return. With that, Pat has the specific numbers on where the other Integrys utilities have been from an ROE standpoint. Pat?"

And as I mentioned, we will -- at the BEI Fall finance conference we'll give you a lot more granular detail particularly about our next 3 to 5-year capital investment program. But we see tremendous need and tremendous opportunity for the use of that cash flow to upgrade the electric and natural gas infrastructures at the region. So that's priority #1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 for the cash flow. And then obviously, we want to maintain the 65% to 70% target for dividend payouts. And if there's any cash left over, well, we've got 3 doors we can go through. One is debt reduction, one would be if we can find legitimately additional investment opportunities for additional infrastructure projects; and then the third would be where we were before, which is a share buyback. But I would hope that -- and really I'm very hopeful that there will be additional investment opportunities that are really needed and that we can put that cash to really good use through infrastructure upgrades."

There's one very helpful ongoing docket. Let me back up and explain that. The commission, before we got involved with the potential acquisition, the commission brought in a outside consulting group by the name of Liberty Consulting. So basically do a review of the management physical, on-the-ground management of the gas main replacement project. Liberty has come back with 95 specific recommendations, most of which are very practical and all of which we agree with. So what the commission has done is they've kept that docket open, and they've asked us by September, early September, to file a transition plan that, in part, lays out how we plan to incorporate those recommendations into our management of the program. So I think a lot of what you're asking about has a schedule and has a definite plan for resolution. But I view the Liberty Consulting report as very helpful and certainly I know the commission has a good bit of faith in the recommendations. The recommendations are very practical. They're recommendations that we would automatically have put in our transition plan anyway. So I think that's the way, I mean, that's the way as we take a step back and relook the entire project, from soup to nuts, from scope to schedule to logistics. We will be incorporating the Liberty audits along the way, and Liberty will also have input along the way.

Let us answer it very directly. First of all, gas, we're picking up a lot of gas delivery companies, and yes, they generally have a very good fourth quarter, they also have a lousy third quarter simply because of lack of gas demand. But let's step back here. A couple of factors. First of all, the logic, the financial logic for the acquisition was that an acquisition we would want to make, like the Integrys acquisition, would add to our earnings per share growth in the first full calendar year after closing. So that's 2016. So I think the logical starting point is, okay, what would you have done standalone 2015? What would your growth rate standalone have been 2016 and is this better than that? And the answer is yes, it's better than that. So I think if it's making any sense to you, Michael, I think we're starting with the correct starting point. But I'd like to add one other factor, and that is in the second half of this year there will be significant accounting adjustments, a lot of accounting noise around the acquisition as you even saw in our second quarter adjustment. So really the GAAP numbers for Integrys, the Integrys utilities for the second half of '15 are really going to be irrelevant to the long run earnings capability of Integrys utilities going forward. Does that help, Michael?"

So it's a little early to give you much more granular detail, but let me back up. There's nothing that we've seen that would indicate that our earlier thinking and information we've said publicly has nothing to indicate that, that's off track. I would expect that over the 10 years, there will be a minimum of $1 billion of savings for Wisconsin customers alone and a combination of capital and operating costs. And that to me still stands as a good preliminary early estimate. So we'll keep working on it. But right now, I feel very good about where we are. And let me back up to your earlier question again. Remember, the 2 72  that we're talking about as a base for 2015 is Wisconsin Energy's standalone.

And what that represents is going into the rate case last year. When the rates were set effective January 1, the Wisconsin Commission assumed a certain level of SSR earnings, SSR revenues. And what has happened is that the SSR, we reached an agreement with the State of Michigan and those stopped, but in the Wisconsin rate case, we were allowed to have the incremental rapid associated with that. So if you remember last year in the SSR, in the first half of the year, the SSRs were based on the suspension and then later in the year, it went to the return SSRs so the dollar amount was greater in the latter part of there. So the short answer is you will not see this big a benefit last part of the year, but you'll see a little bit of a benefit. Does that make sense?"

Generally you get a year to do that but when you close this early in the year, the SEC would like to bottom down many of the purchase price adjustments by the time of the filing of the 10-K, which should be early, early next year. So one of the major amount of accounting work that has to be done is all the purchase price adjustment work. Then I'm certain there will be some onetime transition-type costs, and there's a whole slew of different types of costs that would be onetime costs that we would incur in the second half of this year.

So that actually simplifies a great deal the purchase accounting, however, there are other things that we have to take a hard look at like the value of some of the smaller assets of that Integrys has retained, like the value of a company called Trillium which is the compressed natural gas fueling station company. So there are other assets. I think there's a waste-to-energy plant in Texas that they had.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our second quarter results. As I'm sure you know, on June 29, we acquired Integrys in a $9 billion transaction to form WEC Energy Group. We now serve 4.4 million electric customers and natural gas customers across 4 Midwestern states. I'll provide you with much more detail of the new company shortly, but first, as always, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of WEC Energy Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer. I'd also like to welcome Beth Straka, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Now many of you know Beth from her work over the past decade or so as one of the more perceptive analysts covering our industry. I wanted to tell you we've forgiven her for that, and we're delighted that she's with us. 
Turning now to the second quarter, Pat will review our financial results in detail a bit later on the call, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.59 a share for the second quarter of this year. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.59 a share from the second quarter of 2014. I should point out that the numbers we're reporting to you today reflect Wisconsin Energy only. Since the acquisition closed on June 29, Integrys earnings were immaterial.
Taking a very quick look now at the state of the economy, Wisconsin's unemployment rate stood at 4.6% at June, well below the national average. Deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers however, excluding the iron ore mines, fell by 1.4% in the second quarter. But several sectors showed strength, including plastics, printing and food processing. Also, our small commercial and industrial segment is growing, with electricity use rising by 2.3% over the second quarter of a year ago. In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. New electric service connections are up 8.2% and new natural gas installations are up 4% compared to the same time period last year. 
Now I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing our plans for the future of the new WEC Energy Group. When we first considered the opportunity to acquire Integrys, we weighted against our 3 important criteria for evaluating any potential acquisition. After considerable due diligence, we found that it met or exceeded all 3 criteria. First, it wouldn't be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing; second, it would be largely credit-neutral; and third, the long-term growth rate would be equal to or greater than Wisconsin Energy's standalone growth rate. We also saw a tremendous opportunity in the framework of the new company. WEC Energy Group has the scale, scope, technical depth, geographic reach and financial resources to thrive in our consolidating industry. We plan to leverage those strengths to deliver operational and financial benefits to all of our stakeholders, from the customers and communities we serve to the people we employ, to the shareholders who count on us to create value. And with our proven leadership team, we will incorporate best practices across the organization to streamline our operations and reduce costs.
So what does our new footprint look like? Well as I mentioned, the new company provides electricity and natural gas to 4.4 million customers across 4 states through our customer-facing brands, We Energies, Wisconsin Public Service, Peoples Gas, North Shore Gas, Michigan Gas Utilities and Minnesota Energy Resources. Our company operates in a balanced regulatory environment, with greater jurisdictional diversity than before the acquisition. And of course, more than 99% of our earnings will come from regulated operations. WEC Energy Group is now the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in the country and one of the 15 largest investor-owned utilities systems in the United States with significant opportunities for growth. Of course, the majority of the earning assets we acquired are here in Wisconsin, a familiar landscape for us. And major infrastructure upgrades are underway now with Wisconsin Public Service in the Northern part of the state. These investment opportunities are similar to those we have pursued over the years on time and on budget at We Energies. We're also in excellent position to take advantage of new customer growth across the region, especially in Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota, where propane and oil users are continuing to convert to natural gas. In addition, as many of you know, Integrys and Wisconsin Energy were the 2 largest owners of American Transmission Company. Today, WEC Energy Group has become a 60% owner of ATC. As you recall, ATC plans to invest between $3.3 billion and $3.9 billion between 2014 and 2023 to bolster electric reliability in our service area. We believe this is a solid plan, and we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. 
Now I'd like to briefly discuss some of the conditions we agreed to as we worked our way through the regulatory approvals for the acquisition. In Wisconsin, we committed to an earnings cap for our Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas subsidiaries. Starting in 2016 next year, we will share with our customers any earnings in excess of our allowed rate of return. The first 50 basis points of earnings above our authorized return will be split equally between the company and our customers. Then any earnings above that level will go exclusively to customers. This sharing mechanism will be in effect through 2018. We also agreed to develop an integrated resource plan detailing the joint capacity of needs of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. We expect to file the resource plan with the Wisconsin Commission later this quarter. In Michigan, as we've discussed on previous calls, we expect to pursue the formation of a Michigan-only utility. Our customers in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan will be served by this entity, and we expressed a willingness, if requested, to invest in a new generating plant in the Upper Peninsula and/or purchase power from a new facility. This will allow for the eventual retirement of the Presque Isle Power Plant. In Illinois, we agreed to return a minimum level of jobs in the state of Illinois for the next 2 years. We also committed to a 2 year base rate freeze and a capital spending floor from 2015 through 2017. In a recent development this past Friday, the Citizens Utility Board, the city of Chicago and the State Attorney General's Office, asked the Illinois Commerce Commission to rehear our merger order. These parties are seeking additional conditions, conditions that they previously requested during the year-long approval process. The Illinois Commission now has until August 13 to accept or deny the request. We believe the commission's June 24 decision was correct and is supported by sound principles and by an extensive body of evidence. 
Now let's touch on some of the key financial metrics for the new company. For starters, as you may recall, we issued $1.5 billion of parent company debt to help finance the transaction. The all-in interest cost for the debt is approximately 2.2% annually, an excellent result and clearly, lower than we anticipated. So for 2016, we now project our growth in earnings per share to be in the range of 6% to 8%. The 6% to 8% growth for next year assumes that Wisconsin Energy's standalone achieves earnings of $2.72 a share this year, which is the midpoint of our current 2015 guidance. Just to clarify, we start with the base of $2.72 a share for our standalone earnings this year, and we expect the combined company to grow earnings per share in the 6% to 8% range next year. For the longer term, after 2016, we see earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% annually, driven by operating efficiency, financial discipline and infrastructure investments that the region needs for reliability and for improved environmental performance. We look forward to providing you with additional sales on our capital investment plans at the EEI Finance Conference coming up in November. 
Regarding our dividend policy, in June, the Wisconsin Energy Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend to $45.75 share, that's an increase of 8.3% over the previous quarterly rate. This is equivalent to an annual rate of $1.83 a share. Going forward, we will target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings and we expect dividend growth to be in line with growth in earnings per share. 
Switching gears now, I'd like to update you on several of our major construction projects. On the generation side of our business, as you may recall, we're working to add fuel flexibility in our Oak Creek expansion units as part of our ongoing Power the Future initiative. These units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal, however, given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the 2 types of fuel can save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year depending upon the blend. During extensive testing, we identified operational and equipment related improvements that will be needed to sustain the higher blends of PRB coal on a long-term basis. In May, the Wisconsin Commission approved our request for additional capital spending for plant modifications, expansion of our coal storage capacity and additional coal handling equipment. We already started the work to expand our coal storage capability and the first In-Plant capital improvements are expected to be made on the first unit at Oak Creek, the Oak Creek expansion during a planned outage this September. We plan to upgrade the second unit during the first quarter of 2016. Our share of these investments is targeted at approximately $80 million.
Next, the conversion of our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. That conversion is now more than 80% complete. Double conversion costs are expected to be in the $60 million to $65 million range excluding allowance for funds used during construction. We expect to complete the project on time and on budget before the end of this year. Our Western Wisconsin natural gas expansion project, which will address natural gas reliability concerns in the western part of the state, is now more than 75% complete and is running on time and better than budget. We expect to complete this new 85-mile natural gas pipeline in the fourth quarter of this year at a cost actually well below the $175 million budget, a budget that again excludes allowance for funds used during construction. 
Looking forward, we continue to see significant investment opportunities in Wisconsin Energy's traditional business as we upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on delivering the future. Just to remind you, Wisconsin Energy's standalone capital budget calls for spending $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion over the 5-year period 2015 through 2019 and our 10-year standalone capital budget calls for investing between $6.6 billion and $7.2 billion over the period 2015 through 2024. 
Now before I turn the call over to Pat, I'd also like to discuss our plans for the accelerated main replacement program at Peoples Gas in Chicago. Just to refresh your memory, this is one of the largest infrastructure modernization programs in the country. The program calls for the replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging gas pipeline system over the next 20 years. Some of these pipes, ladies and gentlemen, literally date back to the time of the Civil War. One of our immediate and most important goals is to improve the management and performance of this project. Our first step was to appoint a new senior management team at People's, a new president, a new vice president for construction, a new operations vice president and a new vice president for customer service. All of them are proven, experienced leaders from the Wisconsin Energy system. Over the past 3 weeks, our team has conducted a thorough evaluation of the accelerated main replacement program. They determined that the best approach is a fresh start. We have begun transitioning the management of the project to in-house personnel. Previously, the project was managed by an outside contractor. Going forward, we also plan to engage a nationally recognized firm to help conduct an independent bottom-up review of the cost, scope and schedule for the program. This past Monday, we notified the Illinois Commerce Commission of our decisions, and we will incorporate these decisions into a broader transition plan. This broader transition plan will address the recommendations made by Liberty Consulting Group in their audit of the program. The Liberty audit was completed earlier this year at the request of the Illinois Commerce Commission. I'm confident that the steps we're taking will ensure that Chicagoans get the safe, modern natural gas delivery system that they deserve.
In conclusion, these are exciting times filled with opportunity for our new combined company. We believe we have a very bright future ahead. We will build an enduring enterprise by focusing on the fundamentals, world-class reliability, operating efficiency, financial discipline and exceptional customer care.
And now for more details on our second quarter performance and our outlook for the remainder of 2015, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?"
315117,307209375,841949,"WEC Energy Group, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2015 second quarter adjusted earnings were $0.59 a share. That's the same as our adjusted earnings for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Costs related to the acquisition of Integrys Energy reduced earnings by $0.24",1336,"Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2015 second quarter adjusted earnings were $0.59 a share. That's the same as our adjusted earnings for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Costs related to the acquisition of Integrys Energy reduced earnings by $0.24 per share in the second quarter 2015 and $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2014. Because of the timing of the acquisition, earnings results this quarter are exclusively from Wisconsin Energy. Going forward, our consolidated earnings will include the operating results of the Integrys Company's. Please note that the balance sheet included in this quarter's earnings package does incorporate the Integrys balance sheet.
Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for Wisconsin Energy's 2 business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Excluding acquisition-related costs, second quarter consolidated operating income was $232.5 million as compared with $245.8 million in 2014. That's a decline of $13.3 million. Starting with the utility energy segment, operating income in the second quarter totaled $140.4 million for 2015, a decline of $14.8 million in the second quarter of 2014. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, our earnings were helped by $9.5 million because of the impacts of the 2015 rate case and by $3.4 million related to improved fuel recoveries. On the downside, we saw an increase in utility operations and maintenance costs of $18.5 million, primarily driven by increased regulatory amortizations, the timing of projects and certain benefit costs. We estimate that weather reduced our margins by $4.8 million, and we also saw increased depreciation and expense of $4.2 million. Combining these and other factors results in a $14.8 million decline in utility operating income in the second quarter of 2015 compared with the same quarter in the prior year. 
Operating income in our non-utility energy segment was $93.5 million, which is $1.8 million higher than the prior year. Our corporate and other segment, which includes corporate costs and smaller affiliates, was essentially flat with last year's second quarter. Taking the changes for these segments together, you arrive at the second quarter operating income before acquisition-related costs of $232.5 million, a $13.3 million decline as compared to the second quarter of 2014. In addition, for the second quarter of 2015, we recognize $66.7 million of acquisition-related costs associated with benefit plan agreements, legal and banking fees and other costs. Overall, these costs were in line with our expectations.
During the second quarter of 2015, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $14.3 million, a decline of $3.2 million from the same period in the prior year. As we mentioned in the first quarter, ATC has established reserves in light of recent appeals to the FERC related to authorized returns from regional transmission organizations. Our earnings reflect Wisconsin Energy's share of ATC's results. Our other income net increased by $18 million. During the second quarter of 2015, we recognized an incremental gain of $15.2 million on the sale of a legacy asset. The purchase of sale of assets is a regular part of our business. In fact, we have real estate development subsidiary and this quarter's sale was part of our financial plan for the year. Our net interest expense increased by $3.1 million primarily because of higher debt levels. Consolidated income tax expense fell by $11.1 million for the quarter. Going forward, WEC Energy Group's annual effective income tax rate, driven by a onetime adjustment related to the acquisition of Integrys, is expected to be between 38% and 39% in 2015. We expect that Wisconsin Energy's standalone effective annual tax rate for 2015 will be between 37% and 38%. Combining all of these items brings you to the adjusted net income of $0.59 per share for the second quarter of 2015. 
During the first 6 months of 2015, our operating cash flows totaled $715.9 million, which is a $5.4 million decrease from the first 6 months of 2014. During 2015, we contributed $100 million to our pension plans. No such contributions were made during 2014. Operating cash flows were helped by improved working capital. For example, lower natural gas prices dropped accounts receivable balances and reduced the cost of gas and storage. Our capital expenditures totaled $356.5 million in the first 6 months of 2015, a $51 million increase compared to 2014. The increase was primarily driven by the increased expenditures related to the Western gas lateral.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio as of June 30, 2015 was 50.7%. This ratio reflects the Integrys acquisition, treating half of WEC Energy Group's hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
We paid $190.5 million in common dividends in the first 6 months of 2015, that's an increase of $14.5 million over the same period last year. Weather normalized retail deliveries of electricity fell by 1.3% in the second quarter of 2015 as compared to the second quarter of 2014. Actual second quarter deliveries fell by 1.6%.
Looking now at individual customer segments. We saw weather normalized residential deliveries drop by 3.8%. Actual residential deliveries fell 5%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, whether normal quarterly deliveries rose by 2.4%. Actual deliveries rose by 2.3%. In the large commercial industrial segment, deliveries for the second quarter of 2015 fell by 2.5%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries fell by 1.4%. Our year-to-date weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding the gas used for power generation, were flat compared to the same period in 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again, excluding the gas used for power generation, were down 7.2% compared to the polar vortex driven gas sales last year. Our overall results for gas and electric sales in the first 6 months of 2015 are slightly behind our expectations for the year. 
Turning now to our earnings forecast, for. The remainder of 2015, we will continue to guide based on standalone Wisconsin Energy earnings. As Gale mentioned, our long-term earnings per share growth rate is based upon these standalone earnings. We will, therefore, make the following adjustments to the WEC Energy Group GAAP earnings: Number one, remove the impact of Integrys; number two, remove the impact of acquisition debt. As Gale noted previously, we funded the $1.5 billion cash portion of the acquisition with $1.2 billion of long-term debt and $300 million of commercial paper. This long-term debt included 3, 5 and 10-year tranches. Overall, our debt has an approximate interest cost of 2.2% annually; number three, move the impact of acquisition and other onetime costs such as banking and legal fees; number four, modify the effective tax rate to remove the impact of the onetime adjustment I just referred to earlier; and, finally, number five, remove the impact of the additional shares issue as part of the acquisition. 
With that, we'll move to our 2015 guidance. We are reaffirming our 2015 standalone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. We are off to a strong start, but still have 6 months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our standalone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. And finally, let's take a look at third quarter guidance. Last year's third quarter adjusted earnings were $0.57 a share, which excludes $0.01 a share related to the acquisition of Integrys.
Similar to last year, our summer got off to a very slow start this year with temperatures significantly below normal during the first 10 days of July. So taking this July weather into account, we expect our third quarter 2015 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.58 a share. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any remaining transition-related costs. Once again, our third quarter 2015 adjusted guidance is $0.56 to $0.58 a share.
And with that, I'll turn things back to Gale."

But let me first start with the initial part of your question, how do we think about the trajectory of earnings going forward here now that we've closed the acquisition. As you may have heard me say on the script, given everything we see today and given the terrific result that we got in terms of the annual interest cost on the parent company debt, we're projecting 2016 to have a growth rate over our standalone 2015 guidance, the midpoint of that guidance. So we're projecting 2016 to grow 6% to 8%. And then post 2016, we still see a 5% to 7% growth rate. There are a couple of important underlying assumptions that we're making and that we really feel very good about delivering related to the growth rate. First is that we believe we can, through best practices, through cost reductions, through financial discipline and through on-time and on budget investing and the infrastructure upgrades that are needed, we believe we can move all of the utilities, the former Integrys utilities, at or near the allowed rates of return in Illinois and Michigan and Minnesota and of course, WPS Wisconsin. So that's a pretty important underlying assumption. And to your question of where were the allowed rates of return for those utilities, just a reminder that We Energies and Wisconsin Gas have historically earned at or very close to and some years slightly above the allowed rates of return. With that, Pat has the specific numbers on where the other Integrys utilities have been from an ROE standpoint. Pat?"

And then the other 3 utilities, last year, that will be North Shore, Minnesota and Michigan. Two of the 3 hit, one was beneath, but the year before, the one that missed hit and another one did, and so they're more or less may be slightly underneath on average. Probably, the simplest way to state that. Does that help?"

One is debt reduction, one would be if we can find legitimately additional investment opportunities and additional infrastructure projects; and then the third would be where we were before, which is a share buyback.

There's one very helpful ongoing docket. And let me back up and explain that. The commission, before we got involved with the potential acquisition, the commission brought in a outside consulting group by the name of Liberty Consulting. So basically do a review of the management physical, on-the-ground management of the gas main replacement project. Liberty has come back with 95 specific recommendations, most of which are very practical and all of which we agree with. So what the commission has done is they've kept that docket open, and they've asked us by September, early September, to file a transition plan that, in part, lays out how we plan to incorporate those recommendations into our management of the program. So I think a lot of what you're asking about has a schedule and has a definite plan for resolution. But I view the Liberty Consulting report as very helpful and certainly, I know the commission has a good bit of faith in the recommendations. The recommendations are very practical. They're recommendations that we would automatically have put in our transition plan anyway. And so I think that's the way, I mean, that's the way as we take a step back and relook the entire project, from soup to nuts, from scope to schedule to logistics. We will be incorporating the Liberty audits along the way, and Liberty will also have input along the way. So again, the schedule and a date has been set for us telling the commission how we plan to incorporate the Liberty recommendations. And I think that will go a long way in addition to the expertise that we're going to bring to this project."

I know you're starting from the base of kind of a $2.72 midpoint for WEC standalone. I'm just trying to put apples.

Let us answer it very directly. First of all, yes, we're picking up a lot of gas delivery companies, and yes, they generally have a pretty good fourth quarter, they also have a lousy third quarter simply because of lack of gas demand. But let's step back here. A couple of factors. First of all, the logic, the financial logic for the acquisition was that an acquisition that we would want to make, like the Integrys acquisition, would add to our earnings per share growth in the first full calendar year after closing. So that's 2016. So I think the logical starting point is, okay, well, what would you have done standalone 2015? What would your growth rate standalone have been 2016 and is this better than that? And the answer is yes, it's better than that. So I think if it's making any sense to you, Michael, I think we are starting with the correct starting point. But I'd like to add one other factor and that is in the second half of this year, there will be significant accounting adjustments, a lot of accounting noise around the acquisition as you even saw in our second quarter adjustments. So really the GAAP numbers for Integrys, the Integrys utilities for the second half of '15 are really going to be irrelevant to the long run earnings capability of Integrys utilities going forward. Does that help, Michael?"

So it's a little early to give you much more granular detail, but let me back up. There's nothing that we've seen that would indicate that our earlier thinking and information we've said publicly has nothing to indicate that, that's off track. I would expect that over the 10 years, there will be a minimum of $1 billion of savings for Wisconsin customers alone and a combination of capital and operating costs. And that to me still stands as a good preliminary early estimate. So we'll keep working on it. But right now, I feel very good about where we are. And let me back up to your earlier question again. Remember, the $2.72 that we're talking about as the base for 2015 is Wisconsin Energy's standalone. So we're basically taking out either a positive or negative impact of Integrys utilities from the second half of the year to give you a clean starting point, if you will, that was basically the foundation for the logic of the acquisition."

But essentially, as you know, in any acquisition, we're not immune from this, one of the things that has to be done is purchase price adjustments. Generally, you get a year to do that but when you close this early in the year, the SEC would like you to button down many of the purchase price adjustments by the time of the filing of the 10-K, which would be early, early next year. So one of the major amount of accounting work that has to be done is all the purchase price adjustment work. Then I'm certain there will be some onetime transition-type costs, and there's a whole slew of different types of costs that would be onetime costs that we would incur in the second half of this year. For example, we want to get an improvement in call center responsiveness for a number of the Integrys utilities. There will be some onetime costs to that.

So that actually simplifies a great deal the purchase accounting. However, there are other things that we have to take a hard look at like the value of some of the solar assets that Integrys has retained, like the value of a company called Trillium is the compressed natural gas fueling station company. So there are other assets. I think there's a waste-to-energy plant in Texas that they had. There are several of these assets that we're going to have to take a hard look at and give an appropriate value to.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our second quarter results. As I'm sure you know, on June 29, we acquired Integrys in a $9 billion transaction to form WEC Energy Group. We now serve 4.4 million electric customers and natural gas customers across 4 Midwestern states. I'll provide you with much more detail of the new company shortly, but first, as always, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of WEC Energy Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer. I'd also like to welcome Beth Straka, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Now many of you know Beth from her work over the past decade or so as one of the more perceptive analysts covering our industry. I want to tell you we've forgiven her for that, and we're delighted that she's with us. 
Turning now to the second quarter, Pat will review our financial results in detail a bit later on the call, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.59 a share for the second quarter of this year. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.59 a share from the second quarter of 2014. I should point out that the numbers we're reporting to you today reflect Wisconsin Energy only. Since the acquisition closed on June 29, Integrys earnings were immaterial.
Taking a very quick look now at the state of the economy, Wisconsin's unemployment rate stood at 4.6% at June, well below the national average. Deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers however, excluding the iron ore mines, fell by 1.4% in the second quarter. But several sectors showed strength, including plastics, printing and food processing. Also, our small commercial and industrial segment is growing, with electricity use rising by 2.3% over the second quarter of a year ago. In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. New electric service connections are up 8.2% and new natural gas installations are up 4% compared to the same time period last year. 
Now I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing our plans for the future of the new WEC Energy Group. When we first considered the opportunity to acquire Integrys, we weighted against our 3 important criteria for evaluating any potential acquisition. After considerable due diligence, we found that it met or exceeded all 3 criteria. First, it would be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing; second, it would be largely credit-neutral; and third, the long-term growth rate would be equal to or greater than Wisconsin Energy's standalone growth rate. We also saw a tremendous opportunity in the framework of the new company. WEC Energy Group has the scale, scope, technical depth, geographic reach and financial resources to thrive in our consolidating industry. We plan to leverage those strengths to deliver operational and financial benefits to all of our stakeholders, from the customers and communities we serve to the people we employ, to the shareholders who count on us to create value. And with our proven leadership team, we will incorporate best practices across the organization to streamline our operations and reduce costs.
So what does our new footprint look like? Well as I mentioned, the new company provides electricity and natural gas to 4.4 million customers across 4 states through our customer-facing brands, We Energies, Wisconsin Public Service, Peoples Gas, North Shore Gas, Michigan Gas Utilities and Minnesota Energy Resources. Our company operates in a balanced regulatory environment, with greater jurisdictional diversity than before the acquisition. And of course, more than 99% of our earnings will come from regulated operations. WEC Energy Group is now the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in the country and one of the 15 largest investor-owned utilities systems in the United States, with significant opportunities for growth. Of course, the majority of the earning assets we acquired are here in Wisconsin, a familiar landscape for us. And major infrastructure upgrades are underway now with Wisconsin Public Service in the Northern part of the state. These investment opportunities are similar to those we have pursued over the years on time and on budget at We Energies. We're also in excellent position to take advantage of new customer growth across the region, especially in Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota, where propane and oil users are continuing to convert to natural gas. In addition, as many of you know, Integrys and Wisconsin Energy were the 2 largest owners of American Transmission Company. Today, WEC Energy Group has become a 60% owner of ATC. As you recall, ATC plans to invest between $3.3 billion and $3.9 billion between 2014 and 2023 to bolster electric reliability in our service area. We believe this is a solid plan, and we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. 
Now I'd like to briefly discuss some of the conditions we agreed to as we worked our way through the regulatory approvals for the acquisition. In Wisconsin, we committed to an earnings cap for our Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas subsidiaries. Starting in 2016 next year, we will share with our customers any earnings in excess of our allowed rate of return. The first 50 basis points of earnings above our authorized return will be split equally between the company and our customers. Then any earnings above that level will go exclusively to customers. This sharing mechanism will be in effect through 2018. We also agreed to develop an integrated resource plan detailing the joint capacity needs of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. We expect to file the resource plan with the Wisconsin Commission later this quarter. In Michigan, as we've discussed on previous calls, we expect to pursue the formation of a Michigan-only utility. Our customers in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan will be served by this entity, and we expressed a willingness, if requested, to invest in a new generating plant in the Upper Peninsula and/or purchase power from a new facility. This will allow for the eventual retirement of the Presque Isle Power Plant. In Illinois, we agreed to retain a minimum level of jobs in the state of Illinois for the next 2 years. We also committed to a 2 year base rate freeze and a capital spending floor from 2015 through 2017. In a recent development this past Friday, the Citizens Utility Board, the city of Chicago and the State Attorney General's Office asked the Illinois Commerce Commission to rehear our merger order. These parties are seeking additional conditions, conditions that they previously requested during the year-long approval process. The Illinois Commission now has until August 13 to accept or deny the request. We believe the commission's June 24 decision was correct and is supported by sound principles and by an extensive body of evidence. 
Now let's touch on some of the key financial metrics for the new company. For starters, as you may recall, we issued $1.5 billion of parent company debt to help finance the transaction. The all-in interest cost for the debt is approximately 2.2% annually, an excellent result and clearly lower than we anticipated. So for 2016, we now project our growth in earnings per share to be in the range of 6% to 8%. The 6% to 8% growth for next year assumes that Wisconsin Energy's standalone achieves earnings of $2.72 a share this year, which is the midpoint of our current 2015 guidance. Just to clarify, we start with the base of $2.72 a share for our standalone earnings this year, and we expect the combined company to grow earnings per share in the 6% to 8% range next year. For the longer term, after 2016, we see earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% annually, driven by operating efficiency, financial discipline and infrastructure investments that the region needs for reliability and for improved environmental performance. We look forward to providing you with additional sales on our capital investment plans at the EEI Finance Conference coming up in November. 
Regarding our dividend policy, in June, the Wisconsin Energy Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend to $0.4575 per share. That's an increase of 8.3% over the previous quarterly rate. This is equivalent to an annual rate of $1.83 a share. Going forward, we will target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings and we expect dividend growth to be in line with growth in earnings per share. 
Switching gears now, I'd like to update you on several of our major construction projects. On the generation side of our business, as you may recall, we're working to add fuel flexibility at our Oak Creek expansion units as part of our ongoing Power the Future initiative. These units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal, however, given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the 2 types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year depending upon the blend. During extensive testing, we identified operational and equipment related improvements that will be needed to sustain the higher blends of PRB coal on a long-term basis. In May, the Wisconsin Commission approved our request for additional capital spending for plant modifications, expansion of our coal storage capacity and additional coal handling equipment. We've already started the work to expand our coal storage capability and the first in-plant capital improvements are expected to be made on the first unit at Oak Creek, the Oak Creek expansion, during a planned outage this September. We plan to upgrade the second unit during the first quarter of 2016. Our share of these investments is targeted at approximately $80 million.
Next, the conversion of our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. That conversion is now more than 80% complete. Total conversion costs are expected to be in the $60 million to $65 million range excluding allowance for funds used during construction. We expect to complete the project on time and on budget before the end of this year. Our Western Wisconsin natural gas expansion project, which will address natural gas reliability concerns in the western part of the state, is now more than 75% complete and is running on time and better than budget. We expect to complete this new 85-mile natural gas pipeline in the fourth quarter of this year at a cost actually well below the $175 million budget, a budget that again excludes allowance for funds used during construction. 
Looking forward, we continue to see significant investment opportunities in Wisconsin Energy's traditional business as we upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on delivering the future. Just to remind you, Wisconsin Energy's standalone capital budget calls for spending $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion over the 5-year period 2015 through 2019 and our 10-year standalone capital budget calls for investing between $6.6 billion and $7.2 billion over the period 2015 through 2024. 
Now before I turn the call over to Pat, I'd also like to discuss our plans for the accelerated main replacement program at Peoples Gas in Chicago. Just to refresh your memory, this is one of the largest infrastructure modernization programs in the country. The program calls for the replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging gas pipeline system over the next 20 years. Some of these pipes, ladies and gentlemen, literally date back to the time of the Civil War. One of our immediate and most important goals is to improve the management and performance of this project. Our first step was to appoint a new senior management team at People's, a new president, a new vice president for construction, a new operations vice president and a new vice president for customer service. All of them are proven, experienced leaders from the Wisconsin Energy system. Over the past 3 weeks, our team has conducted a thorough evaluation of the accelerated main replacement program. They determined that the best approach is a fresh start. We have begun transitioning the management of the project to in-house personnel. Previously, the project was managed by an outside contractor. Going forward, we also plan to engage a nationally recognized firm to help conduct an independent bottom-up review of the cost, scope and schedule for the program. This past Monday, we notified the Illinois Commerce Commission of our decisions, and we will incorporate these decisions into a broader transition plan. This broader transition plan will address the recommendations made by Liberty Consulting Group in their audit of the program. The Liberty audit was completed earlier this year at the request of the Illinois Commerce Commission. I'm confident that the steps we're taking will ensure that Chicagoans get the safe, modern natural gas delivery system that they deserve.
In conclusion, these are exciting times filled with opportunity for our new combined company. We believe we have a very bright future ahead. We will build an enduring enterprise by focusing on the fundamentals, world-class reliability, operating efficiency, financial discipline and exceptional customer care.
And now for more details on our second quarter performance and our outlook for the remainder of 2015, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?"

As Gale mentioned, our 2015 second quarter adjusted earnings were $0.59 a share. That's the same as our adjusted earnings for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Costs related to the acquisition of Integrys Energy reduced earnings by $0.24",1334,"Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2015 second quarter adjusted earnings were $0.59 a share. That's the same as our adjusted earnings for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Costs related to the acquisition of Integrys Energy reduced earnings by $0.24 per share in the second quarter 2015 and $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2014. Because of the timing of the acquisition, earnings results this quarter are exclusively from Wisconsin Energy. Going forward, our consolidated earnings will include the operating results of the Integrys companies. Please note that the balance sheet included in this quarter's earnings package does incorporate the Integrys balance sheet.
Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for Wisconsin Energy's 2 business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Excluding acquisition-related costs, second quarter consolidated operating income was $232.5 million as compared with $245.8 million in 2014. That's a decline of $13.3 million. Starting with the Utility Energy segment, operating income in the second quarter totaled $140.4 million for 2015, a decline of $14.8 million in the second quarter of 2014. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, our earnings were helped by $9.5 million because of the impacts of the 2015 rate case and by $3.4 million related to improved fuel recoveries. On the downside, we saw an increase in utility operations and maintenance costs of $18.5 million, primarily driven by increased regulatory amortizations, the timing of projects and certain benefit costs. We estimate that weather reduced our margins by $4.8 million, and we also saw increased depreciation expense of $4.2 million. Combining these and other factors results in a $14.8 million decline in utility operating income in the second quarter of 2015 compared with the same quarter in the prior year. 
Operating income in our Non-Utility Energy segment was $93.5 million, which is $1.8 million higher than the prior year. Our Corporate and Other segment, which includes corporate costs and smaller affiliates, was essentially flat with last year's second quarter. Taking the changes for these segments together, you arrive at the second quarter operating income before acquisition-related costs of $232.5 million, a $13.3 million decline as compared to the second quarter of 2014. In addition, for the second quarter of 2015, we recognize $66.7 million of acquisition-related costs associated with benefit plan agreements, legal and banking fees and other costs. Overall, these costs were in line with our expectations.
During the second quarter of 2015, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $14.3 million, a decline of $3.2 million from the same period in the prior year. As we mentioned in the first quarter, ATC has established reserves in light of recent appeals to the FERC related to authorized returns from regional transmission organizations. Our earnings reflect Wisconsin Energy's share of ATC's results. Our other income net increased by $18 million. During the second quarter of 2015, we recognized an incremental gain of $15.2 million on the sale of a legacy asset. The purchase and sale of assets is a regular part of our business. In fact, we have real estate development subsidiary and this quarter's sale was part of our financial plan for the year. Our net interest expense increased by $3.1 million primarily because of higher debt levels. Consolidated income tax expense fell by $11.1 million for the quarter. Going forward, WEC Energy Group's annual effective income tax rate, driven by a onetime adjustment related to the acquisition of Integrys, is expected to be between 38% and 39% in 2015. We expect that Wisconsin Energy's standalone effective annual tax rate for 2015 will be between 37% and 38%. Combining all of these items brings you to the adjusted net income of $0.59 per share for the second quarter of 2015. 
During the first 6 months of 2015, our operating cash flows totaled $715.9 million, which is a $5.4 million decrease from the first 6 months of 2014. During 2015, we contributed $100 million to our pension plans. No such contributions were made during 2014. Operating cash flows were helped by improved working capital. For example, lower natural gas prices dropped accounts receivable balances and reduced the cost of gas and storage. Our capital expenditures totaled $356.5 million in the first 6 months of 2015, a $51 million increase compared to 2014. The increase was primarily driven by the increased expenditures related to the Western gas lateral.
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio as of June 30, 2015 was 50.7%. This ratio reflects the Integrys acquisition, treating half of WEC Energy Group's hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
We paid $190.5 million in common dividends in the first 6 months of 2015; that's an increase of $14.5 million over the same period last year. Weather normalized retail deliveries of electricity fell by 1.3% in the second quarter of 2015 as compared to the second quarter of 2014. Actual second quarter deliveries fell by 1.6%.
Looking now at the individual customer segments. We saw weather-normalized residential deliveries drop by 3.8%. Actual residential deliveries fell 5%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, weather-normal quarterly deliveries rose by 2.4%. Actual deliveries rose by 2.3%. In the large commercial industrial segment, deliveries for the second quarter of 2015 fell by 2.5%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries fell by 1.4%. Our year-to-date weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding the gas used for power generation, were flat compared to the same period in 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again excluding the gas used for power generation, were down 7.2% compared to the polar vortex driven gas sales last year. Our overall results for gas and electric sales in the first 6 months of 2015 are slightly behind our expectations for the year. 
Turning now to our earnings forecast. For the remainder of 2015, we will continue to guide based on standalone Wisconsin Energy earnings. As Gale mentioned, our long-term earnings per share growth rate is based upon these standalone earnings. We will, therefore, make the following adjustments to the WEC Energy Group GAAP earnings: Number one, remove the impact of Integrys; number two, remove the impact of acquisition debt. As Gale noted previously, we funded the $1.5 billion cash portion of the acquisition with $1.2 billion of long-term debt and $300 million of commercial paper. This long-term debt included 3, 5 and 10-year tranches. Overall, our debt has an approximate interest cost of 2.2% annually; number three, remove the impact of acquisition and other onetime costs such as banking and legal fees; number four, modify the effective tax rate to remove the impact of the onetime adjustment I just referred to earlier; and, finally, number five, remove the impact of the additional shares issue as part of the acquisition. 
With that, we'll move to our 2015 guidance. We are reaffirming our 2015 standalone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. We are off to a strong start, but still have 6 months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our standalone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. And finally, let's take a look at third quarter guidance. Last year's third quarter adjusted earnings were $0.57 a share, which excludes $0.01 a share related to our acquisition of Integrys.
Similar to last year, our summer got off to a very slow start this year with temperatures significantly below normal during the first 10 days of July. So taking this July weather into account, we expect our third quarter 2015 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.58 a share. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any remaining transition-related costs. Once again, our third quarter 2015 adjusted guidance is $0.56 to $0.58 a share.
And with that, I'll turn things back to Gale."

But let me first start with the initial part of your question, how do we think about the trajectory of earnings going forward here now that we've closed the acquisition. As you may have heard me say on the script, given everything we see today and given the terrific result that we got in terms of the annual interest cost on the parent company debt, we're projecting 2016 to have a growth rate over our standalone 2015 guidance, the midpoint of that guidance. So we're projecting 2016 to grow 6% to 8%. And then post 2016, we still see a 5% to 7% growth rate. There are a couple of important underlying assumptions that we're making and that we really feel very good about delivering related to the growth rate. First is that we believe we can, through best practices, through cost reductions, through financial discipline and through on-time and on budget investing in the infrastructure upgrades that are needed, we believe we can move all of the utilities, the former Integrys utilities, at or near the allowed rates of return in Illinois and Michigan and Minnesota and of course, WPS Wisconsin. So that's a pretty important underlying assumption. And to your question of where were the allowed rates of return for those utilities, just a reminder that We Energies and Wisconsin Gas have historically earned at or very close to and some years slightly above the allowed rates of return. With that, Pat has the specific numbers on where the other Integrys utilities have been from an ROE standpoint. Pat?"

Let me frame the answer for you. There's not one single thing that could pop us to the top end of the range on a permanent basis. But if you think about our business and where we're headed, there are several factors, the biggest of which would be increased investment opportunity or increased investment requirement that we build on time and on budget and get cost recovery for. That would be the single biggest thing. Then in between, in between rate cases, if you have an economic pickup and a stronger sales growth, there are a number of things that can happen in between rate periods. But the single biggest factor that could drive us to the top end would be additional investment opportunities and infrastructure upgrades. Pat, Allen, anything you'd like to add?"

There's one very helpful ongoing docket. And let me back up and explain that. The commission, before we got involved with the potential acquisition, the commission brought in a outside consulting group by the name of Liberty Consulting to basically do a review of the management, physical, on-the-ground management of the gas main replacement project. Liberty has come back with 95 specific recommendations, most of which are very practical and all of which we agree with. So what the commission has done is they've kept that docket open, and they've asked us by September, early September, to file a transition plan that, in part, lays out how we plan to incorporate those recommendations into our management of the program. So I think a lot of what you're asking about has a schedule and has a definite plan for resolution. But I view the Liberty Consulting report as very helpful and certainly, I know the commission has a good bit of faith in the recommendations. The recommendations are very practical. They're recommendations that we would automatically have put into our transition plan anyway. And so I think that's the way, I mean, that's the way as we take a step back and relook the entire project, from soup to nuts, from scope to schedule to logistics, we will be incorporating the Liberty audits along the way, and Liberty will also have input along the way. So again, the schedule and a date has been set for us telling the commission how we plan to incorporate the Liberty recommendations. And I think that will go a long way in addition to the expertise that we're going to bring to this project."

I know you're starting from the base of kind of a $2.72 midpoint for WEC standalone. I'm just trying to put apples. I'm worried we're comparing apples and oranges here because Integrys has a large gas utility presence. That means it generates or delivers a decent amount of its annual earnings in the fourth quarter. And just -- are you thinking that the second half of this year, that Integrys would actually have contributed to EPS or would it have detracted from EPS from the original standalone entity?

Let us answer it very directly. First of all, yes, we're picking up a lot of gas delivery companies, and yes, they generally have a pretty good fourth quarter, they also have a lousy third quarter simply because of lack of gas demand. But let's step back here. A couple of factors. First of all, the logic, the financial logic for the acquisition was that an acquisition that we would want to make, like the Integrys acquisition, would add to our earnings per share growth in the first full calendar year after closing. So that's 2016. So I think the logical starting point is, okay, well, what would you have done standalone 2015? What would your growth rate standalone have been 2016 and is this better than that? And the answer is yes, it's better than that. So I think if it's making any sense to you, Michael, I think we are starting with the correct starting point. But I'd like to add one other factor and that is in the second half of this year, there will be significant accounting adjustments, a lot of accounting noise around the acquisition as you even saw in our second quarter adjustments. So really the GAAP numbers for Integrys, the Integrys utilities for the second half of '15 are really going to be irrelevant to the long run earnings capability of Integrys utilities going forward. Does that help, Michael?"

So it's a little early to give you much more granular detail, but let me back up. There's nothing that we've seen that would indicate that our earlier thinking and information we've said publicly, there's nothing to indicate that, that's off track. I would expect that over the 10 years, there will be a minimum of $1 billion of savings for Wisconsin customers alone and a combination of capital and operating costs. And that to me still stands as a good preliminary early estimate. So we'll keep working on it. But right now, I feel very good about where we are. And let me back up to your earlier question again. Remember, the $2.72 that we're talking about as the base for 2015 is Wisconsin Energy standalone. So we're basically taking out either a positive or negative impact of Integrys utilities from the second half of the year to give you a clean starting point, if you will, that was basically the foundation for the logic of the acquisition."

But essentially, as you know, in any acquisition, we're not immune from this, one of the things that has to be done is purchase price adjustments. Generally, you get a year to do that but when you close this early in the year, the SEC would like you to button down many of the purchase price adjustments by the time of the filing of the 10-K, which would be early, early next year. So one of the major amount of accounting work that has to be done is all the purchase price adjustment work. Then I'm certain there will be some onetime transition-type costs, and there's a whole slew of different types of costs that would be onetime costs that we would incur in the second half of this year. For example, we want to get an improvement in call center responsiveness for a number of the Integrys utilities. There will be some onetime costs to that. Pat tells me that there are software licensing costs that we will incur that would be onetime non-recurring in the second half of this year.

But in general terms, when you value regulated assets, it may come over onto your balance sheet at carrying value, at rate base value, if I'm making any sense to you. So that actually simplifies a great deal the purchase accounting. However, there are other things that we have to take a hard look at like the value of some of the solar assets that Integrys has retained, like the value of a company called Trillium, which  is the compressed natural gas fueling station company. So there are other assets. I think there's a waste-to-energy plant in Texas that they had. There are several of these assets that we're going to have to take a hard look at and give an appropriate value to. But in terms of major impact on 2016 earnings growth and beyond, Steve, I don't see any, do you?"

This, of course, is our first full quarter as a newly combined company. If formed WEC Energy Group on June 29 when we closed our acquisition of Integrys. I'll update you on our progress as a company in just a moment. But first, as always, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of WEC Energy Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; bow Scott Lauber, Treasurer; and Vince Vice President for Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. We also have one member of our senior team with us today  he is our new Vice President of Controller, he has more than 20 years of solid experience in our industry prior to the acquisition, he served as Treasurer of Integrys, Bill, welcome aboard. 
Turning now to the third quarter. I'd like to remind you that there reporting our legacy Wisconsin Energy results only through the remainder of 2015. So the financial results and the guidance that we'll be discussing have been adjusted to remove the impact of the acquisition. Pat will review our results in detail in just a few minutes, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported Wisconsin Energy adjusted standalone earnings of $0.61 a share for the third quarter of this year. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.57 a share for the third quarter of 2014. We delivered strong results through an unusual pattern of summer weather, a cool July, a cool August followed by an unseasonably warm September. 
Taking a quick look at the state of the economy, Wisconsin's unemployment rate fell to 4.3% in September, well below the national average and the lowest rate of unemployment we've seen here since back in April of 2011. And in the latest survey of the climate for business, Wisconsin was ranked the 12th Best State for Business by Chief Executive Magazine. This ranking represents a huge leap forward since 2010 when the state came in at 41st. In this year's third quarter, residential use of electricity surged by 11.5% compared to last year's abnormally cool summer. Also, our small commercial and industrial segment grew slightly, with electricity use rising by 1.6% over the third quarter of a year ago. And deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers, excluding the iron ore mines, rose by 6/10 of a percent in the quarter. Several sectors continued to show strength, including food processing, printing and to Mrs. Robinson, plastics.  In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. Wisconsin Energy is serving 6,000 more electric customers and 10,000 more natural gas customers today than we were a year ago. 
Now I'd like to spend just a few minutes discussing our plans for the future of the new WEC Energy Group. When we first considered the opportunity to acquire Integrys, we weighted against our 3 important criteria for evaluating any potential acquisition. And after considerable due diligence, we found that it met or exceeded all 3 criteria. First, it would be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing; second it would be largely credit-neutral; and third, the long-term growth rate would be equal to or greater than Wisconsin Energy's standalone growth rate. Of course, over the past year, a number of similar deals have been announced, several as you know in just the past few months. We're pleased that the metrics for our transaction compare very favorably to these recent announcements. We also see tremendous opportunity in the framework of the new company. WEC Energy Group has the scale, scope, technical depth, geographic reach and financial resources to thrive in our consolidating industry. We plan to leverage these strengths to deliver operational and financial benefits to all of our stakeholders from the customers and communities we serve to the people we employ, to the shareholders who count on us to create value. And with our proven leadership team, we will incorporate best practices across the organization to streamline the operations and reduce costs. WEC Energy Group is now the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in America and one of the 15 largest investor-owned utility systems in the United States, with significant opportunities for growth. Bottom line, we have the same top management team, and now with a new platform for growth, a platform-focused on the energy infrastructure needs of 4.4 million customers across the Midwest. 
Now let's touch on some of the key financial measures for the new company. For starters, we issued $1.5 billion of parent company debt to help finance the transaction. They all-in interest cost for the debt was 2.21% annually, an outstanding result and clearly lower than we had expected. So for 2016, we now project growth in earnings per share for the combined company to be in the range of 6% to 8%, 6% to 8% earnings growth for next year assumes that Wisconsin Energy's standalone delivers earnings $2.72 a share this year. For the longer term, we see earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% annually, driven by operating efficiency, financial discipline and infrastructure investments that the region needs for reliability and for improved environmental performance. And on the subject of infrastructure upgrades, you may recall that we originally projected capital spending for the combined company in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion a year, for the remainder of the decade and actually beyond. Now about 120 days since the company, as we look at the spectrum of projects that need to be addressed to deliver industry-leading reliability, we're seeing even stronger investment opportunities. And in the latter part of the decade, our capital investments could range above $1.5 billion a year. With a few other minor changes to our estimates, we continue to project longer-term earnings per share growth in the 5% to 7% a year range and we're comfortable at the midpoint of that range. Lastly, a reminder about our dividend policy, in June, our Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend to forty five and three quarters cents a share, an increase of 8.3% over the previous quarterly rate. This is equivalent to an annual rate of $1.83 a share. You may recall this was our second dividend increase during 2015. In total, we've raised the dividend by 17.3% this year. Going forward, we're targeting, as you may have heard us say, a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings, and we expect dividend growth to be in line with growth in earnings per share. Looking forward, we expect to return to our normal pattern of dividend action and has been typically brings the dividend proposal to the board in January of each year and we would expect to do so in January of 2016. 
Now I'd like to spend just a few minutes discussing some of our operational highlights in the past quarter. First, I'm pleased to report that just 2 weeks ago, WE Energies was renamed the most reliable energy utility in the Midwest for the fifth year in a row. And in recent national studies of large utility systems, WE Energy is ranked in the top quartile in the Midwest for customer service and power quality and the top quartile nationally for customer service. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service was ranked #2 in the Midwest for overall customer satisfaction among midsized utilities. We're also making progress on the accelerated main replacement project at People's Gas in Chicago. As you recall, this is one of the largest infrastructure modernization programs in the country. The program calls for the replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging gas pipelines over the next 20 years. Some of those pipes, ladies and gentlemen, literally date back to the days of Abraham Lincoln. One of our most immediate and important goals is to improve the management and the performance of this project. Since we closed the acquisition, we put in place an entirely new senior leadership team at Peoples, and we built an in-house construction management group with extensive project experience. They determined that the best approach for the main replacement program in Chicago is a fresh start. So over the past 100 days, we transitioned the management of the project from an outside contractor to our experienced in-house team. We've also engaged a nationally known firm to conduct an independent review of the cost, scope and schedule for the program. We expect to submit this review and our recommendations to the Illinois Commerce Commission by the end of October. I'm confident the steps we're taking will ensure Chicago will have a safe, modern natural gas delivery system that they deserve. 
Then on the Natural gas distribution side of our business in Wisconsin, I'm pleased to announce that our West Central gas pipeline project is now complete, and as of November 1, in service. This was the largest expansion of our natural gas distribution network in company history. 85 mile line addresses reliability concerns and allows us to add a significant number of customers in the areas where propane use is the heaviest. The project came in on time and actually better than budget in just under $130 million excluding allowance for funds used during construction. On the power generation side of the business, you may recall that we're working to add fuel fax ability at our Oak Creek expansion units. These units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal, but given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River basin coal, blending the 2 types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year in fuel costs, depending on the blend. We are working now to expand our coal storage capability at the Oak Creek site, and the first capital improvements inside the plant began in September, during a planned outage for one of the 2 units. We plan to upgrade the second unit during the first quarter of next year. Our share of these investments for the new Oak Creek units is targeted at approximately $80 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. 
Next, the conversion of our Valley power plant from coal to natural gas is now more than 97% complete with only tuning and just punchlist items remaining for the project. So our conversion costs will be $60 million to $62 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. We expect to complete the work at the Valley plant on time and on budget within the next 30 days. We also continue to make good progress on the major construction work at our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. After more than 100 years of operation, we're building a new powerhouse and adding spillway capacity that will meet current federal standards. Overall, the project is on time and on budget, with approximately 60% of the construction now complete. We're targeting commercial operation for the summer of 2016 and we're forecasting a total investment of $60 million to $65 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Looking ahead, we continue to see significant investment opportunities as we upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on delivering the future. We plan to provide you, as we promised, with more details on our capital investment plans for the next 10 years at the EEI conference in just a few days. 
Turning to our transmission business, WEC Energy Group, I would remind you, is now a 60% owner of American Transmission Company. As you may have seen, ATC recently updated its 10-year capital plan. The plan has slightly lower growth in the near term, but it calls for ATC to invest $3.7 billion to $4.5 billion between now and 2024 to bolster the reliability of the grid. This latest projection is up from the previous 10-year plan. That previous plan, as you recall, had an investment ranging from $3.3 billion to $3.9 billion. As I said in the past, we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. 
On a final note, we completed our evaluation of the compressed natural gas business that we inherited with the acquisition of Integrys. That business is known as Trillium CNG. We determined that the enterprise has value but does not fit our focus on our core regulated business. As a result, we're now seeking a new for Trillium.  So in summary, ladies and gentlemen, these are exciting times filled with opportunity for our company, and we believe we have a very bright future ahead. 
Now for more details on our third quarter performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?"

As Gale mentioned, our 2015 third quarter Wisconsin Energy standalone adjusted earnings were $0.61 a share. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.57 a share for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Our adjusted earnings exclude the Integrys company's earnings and the impacts of the acquisition. They are also adjusted for the shares issued in connection with the merger. To facilitate comparisons with last year's third quarter, my discussion of results will focus primarily on legacy Wisconsin Energy. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the result of Integrys companies and has a full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation. We will continue this practice for the remainder of 2015. 
First, I'll focus on operating income for Wisconsin Energy and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Third quarter adjusted consolidated operating income was $262.2 million as compared with adjusted income of $249.1 million in 2014. That's an improvement of $13.1 million. Starting with utility energy, adjusted operating income in the third quarter totaled $168.5 million for 2015, an improvement of $10.1 million from the third quarter of 2014. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, weather helped our earnings by $27.6 million. We had a warmer than normal September in 2015 and a very cool third quarter in 2014. We were also helped by $12 million of improved fuel recoveries and $10.1 million from the impact of the 2015 rate case. On the downside, we saw an increase in utility operations and maintenance costs of $36 million, primarily driven by increased regulatory amortizations, the timing of projects and certain benefits costs. And we also saw increased depreciation expense of $3.6 million associated with higher capital expenditures. Combining these and other factors results in a $10.1 million increase in adjusted utility operating income in the third quarter of 2015 compared with the same quarter last year. Our nonutility operating income was $93.2 million, which is $1.2 million higher than the prior year due to additional investment in our Oak Creek expansion units. Our adjusted corporate and other improves slightly by $1.8 million over the previous year. Taking the exchanges together, we arrive at Wisconsin Energy's third quarter adjusted operating income of $262.2 million. This is a $13.1 million improvement over the third quarter of 2014. 
During the third quarter of this year, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $17.6 million, a decline of $400,000 as compared to the same period in the prior year. As we previously mentioned, ATC has established reserves in light of recent appeals to the FERC regarding authorized returns for regional transmission organizations. These earnings only reflect Wisconsin Energy's standalone share of ATC's results. 
Other income net increased by $900,000 driven by higher AFUDC and our adjusted net interest expense increased by $700,000 primarily because of higher utility debt levels. Wisconsin Energy's standalone income tax expense rose by $4 million for the quarter. We expect that Wisconsin Energy's standalone effective tax rate for the calendar year will be between 37% and 38%. WC Energy Group's effective income tax rate driven by a onetime adjustment related to the acquisition of Integrys is expected to be between 38% and 39% for 2015. Combining all of these items, brings you to adjusted net income of $138.2 million or $0.61 a share for the third quarter of 2015. 
Turning now to operating cash flows, we have provided information in your earnings packet for the consolidated WEC Energy Group, exclusively on a GAAP basis, and thus this includes 3 months of results from Integrys. We believe this will be a more accurate indicator of the cash position of the company. During the first 9 months of 2015, WEC Energy Group's operating cash flows totaled $1,073,000,000, which is a $39 million improvement over the first 9 months of 2014. Operating cash flows were helped by improved working capital. Lower natural gas prices, dropped accounts receivable balances and reduced the cost of gas and storage. Legacy Wisconsin Energy's year-to-date operating cash flows in 2015 were about $100 million lower as compared to 2014. As previously discussed, we contributed $100 million to our pension plans in 2015. No such contributions were made during 2014. 
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio as of September 30 2015 was 50.3%. This ratio reflects the Integrys acquisition and treats half of the WEC Energy Group's hybrid securities as common equity which is consistent with past presentations. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. For comparison purposes, the sales information I'll discuss next will reflect results for WE Energy's only. Actual third quarter retail deliveries rose by 9/10 of a percent. Excluding the iron ore mines, retail deliveries increased by 4.4%. Weather normalized retail deliveries, again, excluding the iron ore mines, were flat compared to the third quarter of 2014. Looking at the individual customer segments, we saw weather normalized residential deliveries rise by 1.4%, and as Gale mentioned, actual residential deliveries rose by 11.5%. Across our small commercial industrial group, weather normal quarterly deliveries fell by 7/10 of a percent. Actual deliveries rose by 1.6%, and in the large commercial industrial segment, deliveries for the third quarter of 2015 fell by 8.2%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries rose by 6/10 of a percent. Our year-to-date weather normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, dropped 4/10 of a percent compared to the same period in 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again, excluding gas used for power generation, were down 6.7% compared to the polar vortex driven gas sales last year.  Moving to other items of interest, in September of 2015, Wisconsin Gas issued a $200 million 10 year bond at a coupon of 3.53%. In part, this new bond is replacing $125 million bond with a coupon of 5.2% that comes due in December. 
Turning now to our 2015 earnings forecast, for the remainder of the year, we will continue to guide based on adjusted standalone earnings for Wisconsin Energy. And again for your reference, adjusted earnings exclude the results of Integrys, exclude the impacts of the acquisition and adjusts for the additional shares that was issued as part of the acquisition. Wisconsin Energy's adjusted earnings through the third quarter are $2.10 per share. Taking into account the impact of a relatively warm October as we enter the heating season, and assuming normal weather for the rest of the quarter, we project our fourth quarter adjusted earnings to be $0.62 per share, thus the 2015 adjusted earnings forecast for Wisconsin Energy is $2.72 a share. At $2.72, Wisconsin Energy's regulated utilities will earn at or near their allowed rates of return. So again, we project our fourth quarter adjusted earnings to be $0.62 per share. 
Finally, I'd like to announce our earnings guidance for 2016. As Gale mentioned, we forecast earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in the range of 6% to 8% off a projected base of $2.72 a share. Therefore, our guidance for 2016 is in the range from $2.88 to $2.94 a share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential remaining acquisition-related costs. Again, our guidance for 2016 is $2.88 to $2.94 per share. 
And with that, I will turn things back to Gale"

And then in terms of the types of projects that we're seeing, we'll give you some really granular detail at the EEI conference on the 10 year capital spending and on the uptick that we're seeing in the latter part of the decade. But let me just say in general, we're seeing additional requirements, additional capital spending for upgrades and expansion, particularly with natural gas in Wisconsin, and for that matter, in Minnesota. So they're really infrastructure projects, they're the kinds of things we've been talking about. But as we look across, as I mentioned, across the spectrum of projects now with the new combined company, we're really seeing infrastructure needs that are going to drive the capital spending higher. If you recall, as we made the acquisition, we indicated that our #1 priority, if there were legitimate needed projects, will be to deploy some of our positive free cash flow to that type of investment. So basically what we're saying is that over the course of the last 120 days, as we really refined our estimates and look at the spectrum of projects, we're seeing higher capital spend out in those years, largely delivery networks, a lot of it gas."

There is a governing factor driven mostly by just the physical capability of how many streets you can dig up and repair. That's number one. Number two, related to the fresh start, I mean, as you may recall, there was a commission mandated audit of the management of the program. It was a rather critical audit. The prior management had outsourced the management of this project, and we really felt like bringing in an experienced construction management team that is very important to the future of the project and to managing that project well. And that team has looked at the project controls and all of the other issues that they found, and that's why we decided to go back with a fresh start with a whole new bottoms up analysis, and you will see when we file publicly on November 30 what our long-term cost projections are and what our immediate priorities will be."

First of all, this was designed initially to be a 20-year program. When we walked into the door after the acquisition, there had been an estimate, a revised estimate made by the previous outsourced firm that the cost might rise to as much as say $8 billion over the 20-year period. I don't think the previous management had confidence in that estimate. We did not have confidence in that estimate. That's why we brought in our experienced team and another outside nationally known firm to basically take a complete bottoms up review. Having said that, the legislation that enables this program to move forward with current and appropriate cost recovery caps the amount of capital spending on this program at roughly $250 million a year. From what I have seen personally over the last 120 days, it would be extremely difficult, I mentioned earlier that there are only so many streets you can dig up and you can't do a lot of this work in the dead of winter. So from a weather standpoint and just a sheer congestion and in a major city standpoint, I don't think you could technically just physically spend much more than $250 million a year anyway. So I wouldn't make the assumption. I think, it would be an inappropriate assumption that we would be spending much more on that advanced main replacement program in any given year than $250 million to $300 million. Does that help, Paul?"

But having said that, just the sheer logistics, I would still believe that given the weather constraints, this sheer logistics, we're probably physically capped at the $250 million to $300 million a year. Now you ask when are we going to see more specific estimates. Well, the date is November 30. We promised the Illinois Commerce Commission that we will file on November 30, our longer-term cost estimates for that 20-year period. Now as you know, try to estimate precisely the cost of the construction program that is going to span 20 years, you know the only thing we're going to be is wrong. So we will probably give a range of values, we'll probably have a low case, a medium case and a high case that I would expect that what we will really focus on is, okay, those are projections, but what are we going to do over the next 3 years to make the most progress in getting that natural gas delivery system as safe and efficient as possible. I think you'll see a broad range for a lengthy period of time. So a low case, high case, medium case, and then we will really focus on what we plan to do in the next 3 years and what the cost of that is and what the progress will be. And all of that look forward to November 30. Now in terms of the rate impact, and I think I'm glad you asked that question, the legislation basically caps at that $250 million to $300 million a year. Caps consumer rate increases at an average of 4%. But it's very important to understand what that 4% is based on. That 4% is based on what we call base rates. So base rates make up like less than 1/3 of the residential customers gas bill. The rest is the commodity. So we're not talking about tremendous rate pressure here. We're talking about  4% of -- we're talking about, basically 4% on [ph] a 1/3 of the total customer bill each year."

It has to be done efficiently, it has to be managed well, but Chicago has to have the modern, efficient system that it deserves."

By contrast, Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota are 3 of the 10 heaviest propane using states in the U.S. And, for example, in Minnesota, recently, there was legislation passed that in essence reduces the upfront hook up cost for customers to switch over to the natural gas delivery network and allows more of those capital costs to be basically put into rate base as opposed to the individual customer having to pay more for hooking into the system. And that was done because of the very significant concern in Minnesota about what happened in '14 during the polar vortex with propane supplies. So we would expect Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan, in terms of gas demand and growth in gas customers to be stronger."

Essentially, I think, we did a good job of due diligence and what we're seeing in terms of best practices, in terms of driving costs down, in terms of more efficient operations. I think, all of the potential we saw is really there. So I would first say, the one upside for the past 120 days is the clear identification of infrastructure upgrades beyond what we thought in our due diligence. And that led to what I discussed about the higher capital spending on rate base opportunities here in the latter part of the decade. In terms of cost reductions, remember, this transaction was far more about growth than about cost reductions. The cost reductions we have estimated, basically will be needed in any given year to help us make sure we earn our allowed rates of return. So again, I don't want to make -- I want to make sure that no one is thinking that there are going to be huge cost savings that are then going to somehow result in earnings above the allotted rates of return. That's not the plan, and that's not what we're seeing. I will say this though. I think, long-term, there will be significant and tangible savings. There's no question about that. And even in Wisconsin, let me reiterate what we said earlier, and that is over the next 10 years, I see a combination of capital cost savings and O&M savings of at least $1 billion of cost savings. Again, that's a combination of capital in O&M. And the first tangible result of that was when we were able to, with the commission's approval, we were able to take off the table the need for Wisconsin Public Service to build a Fox 3 which was a combined cycle natural gas unit that have been planned. That's a $600 million investment that we can postpone for a very long time. So that's a tangible savings for customers right there. We will see, over time, for example, in just having to build only one, and it's being built by Integrys right now, only one new major customer information and billing system. The project is called ICE, I-C-E, and those projects had $150 million, $120 million, $150 million a pop, we're really only going to build one of them and that is being built right now. So you can see all across our operations how we can drive cost savings over time. I hope that responds to your question."

So that industry and literally has just burgeoned over the course of the past 5 years, 10 to 110. Now those 110 operations, because of the price oil and lesser demand for frac sand, those operations are down. I think, we're seeing -- of those we are serving today with natural gas, about an 11% decline this year in their natural gas demand. However, we were not serving anywhere near all of those 110 operations because we didn't have the infrastructure backbone to support that. I mentioned earlier that our West Central gas expansion project is now complete, that 85-mile line. That will allow us to sign up more of those operations. So we are not, I mean, we're going to see growth in the firms that we deliver to that industry in Western Wisconsin over time, simply because we weren't serving that many of them during the boom times as they were down about 11% in terms of firms now but we will be serving more of them now that we have completed the West central line. In fact, one of the major frac sand operators has just signed a contract with us to switch over from propane to natural gas. And remember, the ones we're not serving now are basically drying their sand with propane. And their preference would be to move to less costly, more predictable natural gas.

This, of course, is our first full quarter as a newly combined company. We formed WEC Energy Group on June 29 when we closed our acquisition of Integrys. I'll update you on our progress as a new company in just a moment. But first, as always, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of WEC Energy Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Scott Lauber, Treasurer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President for Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. We also have one new member of our senior team with us today, Bill Guc. Bill is our new Vice President and Controller. He has more than 20 years of solid experience in our industry prior to the acquisition. He served as Treasurer of Integrys. Bill, welcome aboard. 
Turning now to the third quarter. I'd like to remind you that we're reporting our legacy Wisconsin Energy results only through the remainder of 2015. So the financial results and the guidance that we'll be discussing have been adjusted to remove the impact of the acquisition. Pat will review our results in detail in just a few minutes. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported Wisconsin Energy adjusted stand-alone earnings of $0.61 a share for the third quarter of this year. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.57 a share for the third quarter of 2014. We delivered strong results through an unusual pattern of summer weather, a cool July, a cool August followed by an unseasonably warm September. 
Taking a quick look at the state of the economy, Wisconsin's unemployment rate fell to 4.3% in September, well below the national average and the lowest rate of unemployment we've seen here since back in April of 2011. And in the latest survey of the climate for business, Wisconsin was ranked the 12th Best State for Business by Chief Executive magazine. This ranking represents a huge leap forward since 2010 when the state came in at 41st. 
In this year's third quarter, residential use of electricity surged by 11.5% compared to last year's abnormally cool summer. Also, our small commercial and industrial segment grew slightly, with electricity use rising by 1.6% over the third quarter of a year ago. And deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers, excluding the iron ore mines, rose by 6/10 of a percent in the quarter. Several sectors continued to show strength, including food processing, printing and, to Mrs. Robinson, plastics. 
In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. WE Energies is serving 6,000 more electric customers and 10,000 more natural gas customers today than we were a year ago. 
Now I'd like to spend just a few minutes discussing our plans for the future of the new WEC Energy Group. When we first considered the opportunity to acquire Integrys, we weighted against our 3 important criteria for evaluating any potential acquisition. And after considerable due diligence, we found that it met or exceeded all 3 criteria. First, it would be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing. Second, it would be largely credit-neutral. And third, the long-term growth rate would be equal to or greater than Wisconsin Energy's stand-alone growth rate. Of course, over the past year, a number of similar deals have been announced, several as you know in just the past few months. We're pleased that the metrics for our transaction compare very favorably to these recent announcements. 
We also see tremendous opportunity in the framework of the new company. WEC Energy Group has the scale, scope, technical depth, geographic reach and financial resources to thrive in our consolidating industry. We plan to leverage these strengths to deliver operational and financial benefits to all of our stakeholders, from the customers and communities we serve to the people we employ, to the shareholders who count on us to create value. And with our proven leadership team, we will incorporate best practices across the organization to streamline the operations and reduce costs. 
WEC Energy Group is now the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in America and one of the 15 largest investor-owned utility systems in the United States, with significant opportunities for growth. Bottom line, we have the same top management team, but now with a new platform for growth, a platform-focused on the energy infrastructure needs of 4.4 million customers across the Midwest. 
Now let's touch on some of the key financial measures for the new company. For starters, we issued $1.5 billion of parent company debt to help finance the transaction. The all-in interest cost for the debt was 2.21% annually, an outstanding result and clearly lower than we had expected. So for 2016, we now project growth in earnings per share for the combined company to be in the range of 6% to 8%, 6% to 8% earnings growth for next year assumes that Wisconsin Energy's stand-alone delivers earnings of $2.72 a share this year. For the longer term, we see earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% annually, driven by operating efficiency, financial discipline and infrastructure investments that the region needs for reliability and for improved environmental performance. 
And on the subject of infrastructure upgrades, you may recall that we originally projected capital spending for the combined company in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion a year for the remainder of the decade and actually beyond. Now about 120 days since the company, as we look at the spectrum of projects that need to be addressed to deliver industry-leading reliability, we're seeing even stronger investment opportunities. And in the latter part of the decade, our capital investments could range above $1.5 billion a year. With a few other minor changes to our estimates, we continue to project longer-term earnings per share growth in the 5% to 7% a year range, and we're comfortable at the midpoint of that range. 
Lastly, a reminder about our dividend policy. In June, our Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend of $0.4575 a share, an increase of 8.3% over the previous quarterly rate. This is equivalent to an annual rate of $1.83 a share. You may recall this was our second dividend increase during 2015. In total, we've raised the dividend by 17.3% this year. Going forward, we're targeting, as you may have heard us say, a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings, and we expect dividend growth to be in line with growth in earnings per share. Looking forward, we expect to return to our normal pattern of dividend action and has been typically brings the dividend proposal to the board in January of each year, and we would expect to do so in January of 2016. 
Now I'd like to spend just a few minutes discussing some of our operational highlights in the past quarter. First, I'm pleased to report that just 2 weeks ago, WE Energies was renamed the most reliable utility in the Midwest for the fifth year in a row. And in recent national studies of large utility systems, WE Energies ranked in the top quartile of the Midwest for customer service and power quality and to the top quartile nationally for customer service. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service was ranked #2 in the Midwest for overall customer satisfaction among midsized utilities. 
We're also making progress on the accelerated main replacement project at Peoples Gas in Chicago. As you recall, this is one of the largest infrastructure modernization programs in the country. The program calls for the replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging gas pipelines over the next 20 years. Some of those pipes, ladies and gentlemen, literally date back to the days of Abraham Lincoln. One of our most immediate and important goal is to improve the management and the performance of this project. Since we closed the acquisition, we put in place an entirely new senior leadership team at Peoples, and we built an in-house construction management group with extensive project experience. They determined that the best approach for the main replacement program in Chicago is a fresh start. So over the past 100 days, we've transitioned the management of the project from an outside contractor to our experienced in-house team. We've also engaged a nationally known firm to help us conduct an independent review of the cost, scope and schedule for the program. We expect to submit this review and our recommendations to the Illinois Commerce Commission by the end of November. I'm confident that the steps we're taking will ensure that Chicago will have a safe, modern natural gas delivery system that they deserve. 
Then on the natural gas distribution side of our business in Wisconsin, I'm pleased to announce that our West Central gas pipeline project is now complete, and as of November 1, in service. This was the largest expansion of our natural gas distribution network in company history. The 85-mile line addresses reliability concerns and allows us to add a significant number of customers in the areas where propane use is the heaviest. The project came in on time and actually better than budget in just under $130 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. 
On the power generation side of our business, you may recall that we're working to add fuel flexibility at our Oak Creek expansion units. These units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal. But given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River basin coal, blending the 2 types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year in fuel costs depending on the blend. We're working now to expand our coal storage capability at the Oak Creek site, and the first capital improvements inside the plant began in September during a planned outage for one of the 2 units. We plan to upgrade the second unit during the first quarter of next year. Our share of these investments for the new Oak Creek units is targeted at approximately $80 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. 
Next, the conversion of our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas is now more than 97% complete with only tuning and just punch-list items remaining for the project. So our conversion costs will be $60 million to $62 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. We expect to complete the work at the Valley plant on time and on budget within the next 30 days. We also continue to make good progress on the major construction work at our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. After more than 100 years of operation, we're building a new powerhouse and adding spillway capacity that will meet current federal standards. Overall, the project is on time and on budget with approximately 60% of the construction now complete. We're targeting commercial operation for the summer of 2016, and we're forecasting a total investment of $60 million to $65 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. 
Looking ahead, we continue to see significant investment opportunities as we upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on delivering the future. We plan to provide you, as we promised, with more details on our capital investment plans for the next 10 years at the EEI Conference in just a few days. 
Turning to our transmission business, WEC Energy Group, I would remind you, is now a 60% owner of American Transmission Company. As you may have seen, ATC recently updated its 10-year capital plan. The plan has slightly lower growth in the near term, but it calls for ATC to invest $3.7 billion to $4.5 billion between now and 2024 to bolster the reliability of the grid. This latest projection is up from the previous 10-year plan. That previous plan, as you recall, had an investment ranging from $3.3 billion to $3.9 billion. As I've said in the past, we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. 
On a final note, we completed our evaluation of the compressed natural gas business that we inherited with the acquisition of Integrys. That business is known as Trillium CNG. We determined that the enterprise has value, but does not fit our focus on our core regulated business. As a result, we're now seeking a new owner for Trillium.
So in summary, ladies and gentlemen, these are exciting times filled with opportunity for our company, and we believe we have a very bright future ahead. 
Now for more details on our third quarter performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?"

That compares to adjusted earnings of $0.57 a share for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Our adjusted earnings exclude the Integrys companies' earnings and the impacts of the acquisition. They are also adjusted for the shares issued in connection with the merger. To facilitate comparisons with last year's third quarter, my discussion of results will focus primarily on legacy Wisconsin Energy. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results to the of Integrys companies and has a full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation. We will continue this practice for the remainder of 2015. 
First, I'll focus on operating income for Wisconsin Energy and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Third quarter adjusted consolidated operating income was $262.2 million as compared with adjusted income of $249.1 million in 2014, that's an improvement of $13.1 million. Starting with utility energy, adjusted operating income in the third quarter totaled $168.5 million for 2015, an improvement of $10.1 million from the third quarter of 2014. 
On a quarter-over-quarter basis, weather helped our earnings by $27.6 million. We had a warmer-than-normal September in 2015 and a very cool third quarter in 2014. We were also helped by $12 million of improved fuel recoveries and $10.1 million from the impact of the 2015 rate case. On the downside, we saw an increase in utility operations and maintenance costs of $36 million, primarily driven by increased regulatory amortizations, the timing of projects and certain benefits costs. And we also saw increased depreciation expense of $3.6 million associated with higher capital expenditures. Combining these and other factors results to the $10.1 million increase in adjusted utility operating income in the third quarter of 2015 compared with the same quarter last year. 
Our nonutility operating income was $93.2 million, which is $1.2 million higher than the prior year due to additional investment in our Oak Creek expansion units. Our adjusted corporate and other improved slightly by $1.8 million over the previous year. Taking the exchanges together, we arrive at Wisconsin Energy's third quarter adjusted operating income of $262.2 million. This is a $13.1 million improvement over the third quarter of 2014. 
During the third quarter of this year, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $17.6 million, a decline of $400,000 as compared to the same period in the prior year. As we previously mentioned, ATC has established reserves in light of recent appeals to the FERC regarding authorized returns for regional transmission organizations. These earnings only reflect Wisconsin Energy's stand-alone share of ATC's results. 
Other income net increased by $900,000, driven by higher AFUDC. And our adjusted net interest expense increased by $700,000, primarily because of higher utility debt levels. Wisconsin Energy's stand-alone income tax expense rose by $4 million for the quarter. We expect that Wisconsin Energy's stand-alone effective tax rate for the calendar year will be between 37% and 38%. WC Energy Group's effective income tax rate, driven by a onetime adjustment related to the acquisition of Integrys, is expected to be between 38% and 39% for 2015. Combining all of these items brings you to adjusted net income of $138.2 million or $0.61 a share for the third quarter of 2015. 
Turning now to operating cash flows. We have provided information in your earnings packet for the consolidated WEC Energy Group, exclusively on a GAAP basis and thus, this includes 3 months of results from Integrys. We believe this will be a more accurate indicator of the cash position of the company. During the first 9 months of 2015, WEC Energy Group's operating cash flows totaled $1,073,000,000, which is a $39 million improvement over the first 9 months of 2014. Operating cash flows were helped by improved working capital, lower natural gas prices, drop accounts receivable balances and reduce the cost of gas and storage. Legacy Wisconsin Energy's year-to-date operating cash flows in 2015 were about $100 million lower as compared to 2014. As previously discussed, we contributed $100 million to our pension plans in 2015. No such contributions were made during 2014. 
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio as of September 30, 2015, was 50.3%. This ratio reflects the Integrys acquisition and treats half of the WEC Energy Group's hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. 
For comparison purposes, the sales information I'll discuss next will reflect results for WE Energy's only. Actual third quarter retail deliveries rose by 0.9%. Excluding the iron ore mines, retail deliveries increased by 4.4%. Weather normalized retail deliveries, again, excluding the iron ore mines, were flat compared to the third quarter of 2014. Looking at the individual customer segments, we saw weather normalized residential deliveries rise by 1.4%, and as Gale mentioned, actual residential deliveries rose by 11.5%. Across our small commercial industrial group, weather-normal quarterly deliveries fell by 0.7% of a percent and actual deliveries rose by 1.6%. And in the large commercial industrial segment, deliveries for the third quarter of 2015 fell by 8.2%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries rose by 0.6%. 
Our year-to-date weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, dropped 0.4% compared to the same period in 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again, excluding gas used for power generation, were down 6.7% compared to the polar vortex driven gas sales last year.
Moving to other items of interest. In September of 2015, Wisconsin Gas issued a $200 million 10-year bond at a coupon of 3.53%. In part, this new bond is replacing $125 million bond with a coupon of 5.2% that comes due in December. 
Turning now to our 2015 earnings forecast. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to buy -- we will continue to guide based on adjusted stand-alone earnings for Wisconsin Energy. And again, for your reference, adjusted earnings exclude the results of Integrys, exclude the impacts of the acquisition and adjusts for the additional shares that were issued as part of the acquisition. Wisconsin Energy's adjusted earnings through the third quarter are $2.10 per share. Taking into account the impact of a relatively warm October as we enter the heating season and assuming normal weather for the rest of the quarter, we project our fourth quarter adjusted earnings to be $0.62 per share, thus, the 2015 adjusted earnings forecast for Wisconsin Energy is $2.72 a share. At $2.72, Wisconsin Energy's regulated utilities will earn at or near their allowed rates of return. So again, we project our fourth quarter adjusted earnings to be $0.62 per share. 
Finally, I'd like to announce our earnings guidance for 2016. As Gale mentioned, we forecast earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in the range of 6% to 8% off a projected base of $2.72 a share. Therefore, our guidance for 2016 is in the range from $2.88 to $2.94 a share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential remaining acquisition-related costs. Again, our guidance for 2016 is $2.88 to $2.94 per share. 
And with that, I will turn things back to Gale"

So they're really infrastructure projects. They are the kinds of things we have been talking about. But as we look across, as I mentioned, across the spectrum of projects now with the new combined company, we're really seeing infrastructure needs that are going to drive the capital spending higher. Now if you recall, as we made the acquisition, we indicated that we would -- our #1 priority, if there were legitimate needed projects, will be to deploy some of our positive free cash flow to that type of investment. So basically, what we're saying is that over the course of the last 120 days as we really refined our estimates and look at the spectrum of projects, we're seeing higher capital spend out in those years, largely delivery networks, a lot of it gas."

Number two, related to the fresh start, I mean, as you may recall, there was a commission-mandated audit of the management of the program. It was a rather critical audit. The prior management had outsourced the management of this project, and we really felt like bringing in an experienced construction management team. It was very important to the future of the project and to managing that project well. And that team has looked at the project controls and all of the other issues that they found, and that's why we've decided to go back with a fresh start with a whole new bottoms-up analysis, and you will see when we file publicly on November 30 what our long-term cost projections are and what our immediate priorities will be."

First of all, this was designed initially to be a 20-year program. When we walked into the door after the acquisition, there had been an estimate, a revised estimate made by the previous outsourced firm that the cost might rise to as much as, say, $8 billion over the 20-year period. I don't think the previous management had confidence in that estimate. We did not have confidence in that estimate, that's why we brought in our experienced team and another outside nationally-known firm to basically take a complete bottoms-up review. Having said that, the legislation that enables this program to move forward with current and appropriate cost recovery caps the amount of capital spending on this program at roughly $250 million a year. From what I have seen personally over the last 120 days, it would be extremely difficult. I mentioned earlier that there are only so many streets you can dig up, and you can't do a lot of this work in the dead of winter. So from a weather standpoint and just a sheer congestion and in a major city standpoint, I don't think you could technically just physically spend much more than about $250 million a year anyway. So I wouldn't make the assumption. I think, it will be an inappropriate assumption that we would be spending much more on that advanced main replacement program in any given year than $250 million to $300 million.

I mean, there are -- there's something called keyhole technology, which we are experimenting with right now. But having said that, just the sheer logistics, I would still believe that given the weather constraints to the sheer logistics, we're probably physically capped at the $250 million to $300 million a year. Now you asked when are we going to see more specific estimates. Well, the date is November 30. We promised the Illinois Commerce Commission that we will file on November 30, our longer-term cost estimates for that 20-year period. Now, as you know, trying to estimate precisely the cost of the construction program that is going to span 20 years, you know the only thing we're going to be is wrong. So we will probably give a range of values. We'll probably have a low case, a medium case and a high case that I would expect that what we will really focus on is, okay, those are projections, but what are we going to do in the next 3 years to make the most progress in getting that natural gas delivery system as safe and efficient as possible. I think you'll see a broad range for a lengthy period of time. So a low case, high case, medium case, and then we will really focus on what we plan to do in the next 3 years and what the cost of that is and what the progress will be. And all of that look forward to November 30. Now in terms of rate impact, and I think I'm glad you asked that question, the legislation basically caps at that $250 million to $300 million a year. Caps consumer rate increases at an average of 4%. But it's very important to understand what that 4% is based on. That 4% is based on what we call base rates. So base rates make up like less than 1/3 of our residential customers gas bill. The rest is the commodity. So we're not talking about tremendous rate pressure here. We're talking about  4% off of -- we're talking about, basically 4% on a 1/3 of the total customer bill each year."

By contrast, Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota are 3 of the 10 heaviest using -- heaviest propane using states in the U.S. And for example, in Minnesota, recently, there was legislation passed that, in essence, reduces the upfront hook-up cost for customers to switch over to the natural gas delivery network and allows more of those capital costs to be basically put into rate base as opposed to the individual customer having to pay more for hooking into the system. And that was done because of the very significant concern in Minnesota about what happened in '14 during the polar vortex with propane supplies. So we would expect Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan, in terms of gas demand and growth in gas customers, to be stronger."

Essentially, I think we did a good job of due diligence and what we're seeing in terms of best practices, in terms of driving costs down, in terms of more efficient operations. I think all of the potential we saw is really there. So I would first say, the one upside for the past 120 days is the clear identification of infrastructure upgrades beyond what we thought in our due diligence. And that led to what I discussed about the higher capital spending on rate base opportunities here in the latter part of the decade. In terms of cost reductions, remember, this transaction was far more about growth than about cost reductions. The cost reductions we have estimated, basically will be needed in any given year to help us make sure we earn our allowed rates of return. So again, I don't want to make -- I want to make sure that no one is thinking that there are going to be huge cost savings that are then going to somehow result in earnings above the allotted rates of return. That's not the plan, and that's not what we're seeing. I will say this, though, I think, long-term, there will be significant and tangible savings. There's no question about that. And even in Wisconsin, let me reiterate what we said earlier, and that is over the next 10 years, I'm seeing a combination of capital cost savings and O&M savings, at least $1 billion of cost savings. Again, that's a combination of capital in O&M. And the first tangible result of that was when we were able to, with the commission's approval, we were able to take off the table, the need for Wisconsin Public Service to build the Fox 3, which was a combined cycle of natural gas unit that have been planned. That's a $600 million investment that we can postpone for a very long time. So that's a tangible savings for customers right there. We will see, over time, for example, in just having to build only one, and it's being built by Integrys right now, only one new major customer information and billing system. The project is called ICE, I-C-E, and those projects are -- had $150 million, $120 million, $150 million a pop, we're really going to need to build a lot of them and that's being built right now. So you can see all across our operations how we can drive cost savings over time. I hope that responds to your question."

So that industry and literally has just burgeoned over the course of the past 5 years, 10 to 110. Now those 110 operations, because of the price oil and lesser demand for frac sand, those operations are down. I think, we're seeing about -- of those we are serving today with natural gas, about an 11% decline this year in their natural gas demand. However, we were not serving anywhere near all of those 110 operations because we didn't have the infrastructure backbone to support that. I mentioned earlier that our West Central gas expansion project is now complete, that 85-mile line. That will allow us to sign up more of those operations. So we are not -- I mean, we're going to see growth in the firms that we deliver to that industry in Western Wisconsin over time, simply because we weren't serving that many of them during the boom times. As I've stated, they're down about 11% in terms of firms now, but we're going to be serving more of them now that we have completed the West Central line. In fact, one of the major frac sand operators has just signed a contract with us to switch over from propane to natural gas. And remember, the ones we're not serving now are basically drying their sand with propane. And their preference would be to move to a less costly, more predictable natural gas.

This, of course, is our first full quarter as a newly combined company. We formed WEC Energy Group on June 29 when we closed our acquisition of Integrys. I'll update you on our progress as a new company in just a moment. But first, as always, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of WEC Energy Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Scott Lauber, Treasurer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President for Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. We also have one new member of our senior team with us today, Bill Guc. Bill is our new Vice President and Controller. He has more than 20 years of solid experience in our industry. Prior to the acquisition, he served as Treasurer of Integrys. Bill, welcome aboard. 
Turning now to the third quarter. I'd like to remind you that we're reporting our legacy Wisconsin Energy results only through the remainder of 2015. So the financial results and the guidance that we'll be discussing have been adjusted to remove the impact of the acquisition. Pat will review our results in detail in just a few minutes. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported Wisconsin Energy adjusted standalone earnings of $0.61 a share for the third quarter of this year. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.57 a share for the third quarter of 2014. We delivered strong results through an unusual pattern of summer weather, a cool July, a cool August followed by an unseasonably warm September. 
Taking a quick look at the state of the economy, Wisconsin's unemployment rate fell to 4.3% in September, well below the national average and the lowest rate of unemployment we've seen here since back in April of 2011. And in the latest survey of the climate for business, Wisconsin was ranked the 12th Best State for Business by Chief Executive magazine. This ranking represents a huge leap forward since 2010 when the state came in at 41st. 
In this year's third quarter, residential use of electricity surged by 11.5% compared to last year's abnormally cool summer. Also, our small commercial and industrial segment grew slightly, with electricity use rising by 1.6% over the third quarter of a year ago. And deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers, excluding the iron ore mines, rose by 0.6% in the quarter. Several sectors continued to show strength, including food processing, printing, and to Mrs. Robinson, plastics. 
In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. We Energies is serving 6,000 more electric customers and 10,000 more natural gas customers today than we were a year ago. 
Now I'd like to spend just a few minutes discussing our plans for the future of the new WEC Energy Group. When we first considered the opportunity to acquire Integrys, we weighted against our 3 important criteria for evaluating any potential acquisition. And after considerable due diligence, we found that it met or exceeded all 3 criteria. First, it would be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing. Second, it would be largely credit-neutral. And third, the long-term growth rate would be equal to or greater than Wisconsin Energy's standalone growth rate. Of course, over the past year, a number of similar deals have been announced, several as you know in just the past few months. We're pleased that the metrics for our transaction compare very favorably to these recent announcements. 
We also see tremendous opportunity in the framework of the new company. WEC Energy Group has the scale, scope, technical depth, geographic reach and financial resources to thrive in our consolidating industry. We plan to leverage these strengths to deliver operational and financial benefits to all of our stakeholders, from the customers and communities we serve to the people we employ, to the shareholders who count on us to create value. And with our proven leadership team, we will incorporate best practices across the organization to streamline the operations and reduce costs. 
WEC Energy Group is now the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in America and one of the 15 largest investor-owned utility systems in the United States, with significant opportunities for growth. Bottom line, we have the same top management team, but now with a new platform for growth, a platform focused on the energy infrastructure needs of 4.4 million customers across the Midwest. 
Now let's touch on some of the key financial measures for the new company. For starters, we issued $1.5 billion of parent company debt to help finance the transaction. The all-in interest cost for the debt was 2.21% annually, an outstanding result and clearly lower than we had expected. So for 2016, we now project growth in earnings per share for the combined company to be in a range of 6% to 8%, 6% to 8% earnings growth for next year assumes that Wisconsin Energy's standalone delivers earnings of $2.72 a share this year. For the longer term, we see earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% annually, driven by operating efficiency, financial discipline and infrastructure investments that the region needs for reliability and for improved environmental performance. 
And on the subject of infrastructure upgrades, you may recall that we originally projected capital spending for the combined company in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion a year for the remainder of the decade and actually beyond. Now about 120 days into the company, as we look at the spectrum of projects that need to be addressed to deliver industry-leading reliability, we're seeing even stronger investment opportunities. And in the latter part of the decade, our capital investments could range above $1.5 billion a year. With a few other minor changes to our estimates, we continue to project longer-term earnings per share growth in the 5% to 7% a year range, and we're comfortable at the midpoint of that range. 
Lastly, a reminder about our dividend policy. In June, our Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend to $0.4575 a share, an increase of 8.3% over the previous quarterly rate. This is equivalent to an annual rate of $1.83 a share. You may recall this was our second dividend increase during 2015. In total, we've raised the dividend by 17.3% this year. Going forward, we're targeting, as you may have heard us say, a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings, and we expect dividend growth to be in line with growth in earnings per share. Looking forward, we expect to return to our normal pattern of dividend action. Management typically brings the dividend proposal to the board in January of each year, and we would expect to do so in January of 2016. 
Now I'd like to spend just a few minutes discussing some of our operational highlights in the past quarter. First, I'm pleased to report that just 2 weeks ago, We Energies was named the most reliable utility in the Midwest for the fifth year in a row. And in recent national studies of large utility systems, We Energies ranked in the top quartile of the Midwest for customer service and power quality and in the top quartile nationally for customer service. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service was ranked #2 in the Midwest for overall customer satisfaction among midsized utilities. 
We're also making progress on the accelerated main replacement project at Peoples Gas in Chicago. As you recall, this is one of the largest infrastructure modernization programs in the country. The program calls for the replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging gas pipelines over the next 20 years. Some of those pipes, ladies and gentlemen, literally date back to the days of Abraham Lincoln. One of our most immediate and important goals is to improve the management and the performance of this project. Since we closed the acquisition, we put in place an entirely new senior leadership team at Peoples, and we built an in-house construction management group with extensive project experience. They determined that the best approach for the main replacement program in Chicago is a fresh start. So over the past 100 days, we've transitioned the management of the project from an outside contractor to our experienced in-house team. We've also engaged a nationally known firm to help us conduct an independent review of the cost, scope and schedule for the program. We expect to submit this review and our recommendations to the Illinois Commerce Commission by the end of November. I'm confident that the steps we're taking will ensure that Chicagoans will have the safe, modern natural gas delivery system that they deserve. 
Then on the natural gas distribution side of our business in Wisconsin, I'm pleased to announce that our West Central gas pipeline project is now complete, and as of November 1, in service. This was the largest expansion of our natural gas distribution network in company history. The 85-mile line addresses reliability concerns and allows us to add a significant number of customers in the areas where propane use is the heaviest. The project came in on time and actually better than budget at just under $130 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. 
On the power generation side of our business, you may recall that we're working to add fuel flexibility at our Oak Creek expansion units. These units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal. But given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the 2 types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year in fuel costs depending on the blend. We're working now to expand our coal storage capability at the Oak Creek site, and the first capital improvements inside the plant began in September during a planned outage for one of the 2 units. We plan to upgrade the second unit during the first quarter of next year. Our share of these investments for the new Oak Creek units is targeted at approximately $80 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. 
Next, the conversion of our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas is now more than 97% complete with only tuning and just punch-list items remaining for the project. So our conversion costs will be $60 million to $62 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. We expect to complete the work at the Valley Plant on time and on budget within the next 30 days. We also continue to make good progress on the major construction work at our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. After more than 100 years of operation, we're building a new powerhouse and adding spillway capacity that will meet current federal standards. Overall, the project is on time and on budget with approximately 60% of the construction now complete. We're targeting commercial operation for the summer of 2016, and we're forecasting a total investment of $60 million to $65 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. 
Looking ahead, we continue to see significant investment opportunities as we upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on delivering the future. We plan to provide you, as we promised, with more details on our capital investment plans for the next 10 years at the EEI Conference in just a few days. 
Turning to our transmission business, WEC Energy Group, I would remind you, is now a 60% owner of American Transmission Company. As you may have seen, ATC recently updated its 10-year capital plan. The plan has slightly lower growth in the near term, but it calls for ATC to invest $3.7 billion to $4.5 billion between now and 2024 to bolster the reliability of the grid. This latest projection is up from the previous 10-year plan. That previous plan, as you recall, had an investment ranging from $3.3 billion to $3.9 billion. As I've said in the past, we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business. 
On a final note, we completed our evaluation of the compressed natural gas business that we inherited with the acquisition of Integrys. That business is known as Trillium CNG. We determined that the enterprise has value, but does not fit our focus on our core regulated business. As a result, we're now seeking a new owner for Trillium.
So in summary, ladies and gentlemen, these are exciting times filled with opportunity for our company, and we believe we have a very bright future ahead. 
Now for more details on our third quarter performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?"
315117,314428385,892702,"WEC Energy Group, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gale.

Our adjusted earnings exclude the Integ",1215,"Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2015 third quarter Wisconsin Energy standalone adjusted earnings were $0.61 a share. That compares to adjusted earnings of $0.57 a share for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Our adjusted earnings exclude the Integrys companies' earnings and the impacts of the acquisition. They are also adjusted for the shares issued in connection with the merger. To facilitate comparisons with last year's third quarter, my discussion of results will focus primarily on legacy Wisconsin Energy. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has a full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation. We will continue this practice for the remainder of 2015. 
First, I'll focus on operating income for Wisconsin Energy and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Third quarter adjusted consolidated operating income was $262.2 million as compared with adjusted income of $249.1 million in 2014, that's an improvement of $13.1 million. Starting with utility energy, adjusted operating income in the third quarter totaled $168.5 million for 2015, an improvement of $10.1 million from the third quarter of 2014. 
On a quarter-over-quarter basis, weather helped our earnings by $27.6 million. We had a warmer-than-normal September in 2015 and a very cool third quarter in 2014. We were also helped by $12 million of improved fuel recoveries and $10.1 million from the impact of the 2015 rate case. On the downside, we saw an increase in utility operations and maintenance costs of $36 million, primarily driven by increased regulatory amortizations, the timing of projects and certain benefits costs. And we also saw increased depreciation expense of $3.6 million associated with higher capital expenditures. Combining these and other factors results in a $10.1 million increase in adjusted utility operating income in the third quarter of 2015 compared with the same quarter last year. 
Our nonutility operating income was $93.2 million, which is $1.2 million higher than the prior year due to additional investment in our Oak Creek expansion units. Our adjusted corporate and other improved slightly by $1.8 million over the previous year. Taking these changes together, we arrive at Wisconsin Energy's third quarter adjusted operating income of $262.2 million. This is a $13.1 million improvement over the third quarter of 2014. 
During the third quarter of this year, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $17.6 million, a decline of $400,000, compared to the same period in the prior year. As we previously mentioned, ATC has established reserves in light of recent appeals to the FERC regarding authorized returns for regional transmission organizations. These earnings only reflect Wisconsin Energy's standalone share of ATC's results. 
Other income net increased by $900,000, driven by higher AFUDC. And our adjusted net interest expense increased by $700,000, primarily because of higher utility debt levels. Wisconsin Energy's standalone income tax expense rose by $4 million for the quarter. We expect that Wisconsin Energy's standalone effective tax rate for the calendar year will be between 37% and 38%. WC Energy Group's effective income tax rate, driven by a onetime adjustment related to the acquisition of Integrys, is expected to be between 38% and 39% for 2015. Combining all of these items brings you to adjusted net income of $138.2 million or $0.61 a share for the third quarter of 2015. 
Turning now to operating cash flows. We have provided information in your earnings packet for the consolidated WEC Energy Group, exclusively on a GAAP basis and thus, this includes 3 months of results from Integrys. We believe this will be a more accurate indicator of the cash position of the company. During the first 9 months of 2015, WEC Energy Group's operating cash flows totaled $1,073,000,000, which is a $39 million improvement over the first 9 months of 2014. Operating cash flows were helped by improved working capital, lower natural gas prices, dropped accounts receivable balances and reduced the cost of gas in storage. Legacy Wisconsin Energy's year-to-date operating cash flows in 2015 were about $100 million lower as compared to 2014. As previously discussed, we contributed $100 million to our pension plans in 2015. No such contributions were made during 2014. 
Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio as of September 30, 2015, was 50.3%. This ratio reflects the Integrys acquisition and treats half of the WEC Energy Group's hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. 
For comparison purposes, the sales information I'll discuss next will reflect results for We Energies only. Actual third quarter retail deliveries rose by 0.9%. Excluding the iron ore mines, retail deliveries increased by 4.4%. Weather-normalized retail deliveries, again excluding iron ore mines, were flat compared to the third quarter of 2014. Looking at the individual customer segments, we saw weather-normalized residential deliveries rise by 1.4%, and as Gale mentioned, actual residential deliveries rose by 11.5%. Across our small commercial industrial group, weather-normal quarterly deliveries fell by 0.7% and actual deliveries rose by 1.6%. And in the large commercial industrial segment, deliveries for the third quarter of 2015 fell by 8.2%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries rose by 0.6%. 
Our year-to-date weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, dropped 0.4% compared to the same period in 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again excluding gas used for power generation, were down 6.7% compared to the polar vortex driven gas sales last year.
Moving to other items of interest. In September of 2015, Wisconsin Gas issued a $200 million 10-year bond at a coupon of 3.53%. In part, this new bond is replacing a $125 million bond with a coupon of 5.2% that comes due in December. 
Turning now to our 2015 earnings forecast. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to buy -- we will continue to guide based on adjusted standalone earnings for Wisconsin Energy. And again, for your reference, adjusted earnings exclude the results of Integrys, exclude the impacts of the acquisition and adjusts for the additional shares that were issued as part of the acquisition. Wisconsin Energy's adjusted earnings through the third quarter are $2.10 per share. Taking into account the impact of a relatively warm October as we enter the heating season and assuming normal weather for the rest of the quarter, we project our fourth quarter adjusted earnings to be $0.62 per share, thus, the 2015 adjusted earnings forecast for Wisconsin Energy is $2.72 a share. At $2.72, Wisconsin Energy's regulated utilities will earn at or near their allowed rates of return. So again, we project our fourth quarter adjusted earnings to be $0.62 per share. 
Finally, I'd like to announce our earnings guidance for 2016. As Gale mentioned, we forecast earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in the range of 6% to 8% off a projected base of $2.72 a share. Therefore, our guidance for 2016 is in a range from $2.88 to $2.94 a share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential remaining acquisition-related costs. Again, our guidance for 2016 is $2.88 to $2.94 per share. 
And with that, I will turn things back to Gale."

And then in terms of the types of projects that we're seeing, we'll give you some really granular detail at the EEI Conference on the 10-year capital spending and on the uptick that we're seeing in the latter part of the decade. But let me just say, in general, we're seeing additional requirements, additional capital spending for upgrades and expansion, particularly with natural gas in Wisconsin, and for that matter, in Minnesota. So they're really infrastructure projects. They are the kinds of things we have been talking about. But as we looked across, as I mentioned, across the spectrum of projects now with the new combined company, we're really seeing infrastructure needs that are going to drive the capital spending higher. Now if you recall, as we made the acquisition, we indicated that we would -- our #1 priority, if there were legitimate needed projects, will be to deploy some of our positive free cash flow to that type of investment. So basically, what we're saying is that over the course of the last 120 days, as we've really refined our estimates and looked at the spectrum of projects, we're seeing higher capital spend out in those years, largely delivery networks, a lot of it gas."

So in essence, we are physically limited as to how much progress you can make in any given year in terms of the gas main replacement program, of those 2,000 miles of pipes under the streets of Chicago. So that means there's a governing factor that is driven mostly by just the physical capability of how many streets can you dig up and repair, so that's number one. Number two, related to the fresh start, I mean, as you may recall, there was a commission-mandated audit of the management of the program. It was a rather critical audit. The prior management had outsourced the management of this project, and we really felt like bringing in an experienced construction management team was very important to the future of the project and to managing that project well. And that team has looked at the project controls and all of the other issues that they found, and that's why we've decided to go back with a fresh start, with a whole new bottoms-up analysis, and you will see when we file publicly on November 30, what our long-term cost projections are and what our immediate priorities will be."

First of all, this was designed initially to be a 20-year program. When we walked into the door after the acquisition, there had been an estimate, a revised estimate made by the previous outsourced firm, that the cost might rise to as much as, say, $8 billion over the 20-year period. I don't think the previous management had confidence in that estimate. We did not have confidence in that estimate, that's why we brought in our experienced team and another outside nationally-known firm to basically take a complete bottoms-up review. Having said that, the legislation that enables this program to move forward with current and appropriate cost recovery, caps the amount of capital spending on this program at roughly $250 million a year. From what I have seen personally over the last 120 days, it would be extremely difficult, I mentioned earlier that there are only so many streets you can dig up, and you can't do a lot of this work in the dead of winter. So from a weather standpoint and just a sheer congestion and in a major city standpoint, I don't think you could technically just physically spend much more than about $250 million a year anyway. So I wouldn't make the assumption. I think, it will be an inappropriate assumption that we would be spending much more on that advanced main replacement program in any given year than $250 million to $300 million. Does that help, Paul?"

I mean, there are -- there's something called keyhole technology, which we are experimenting with right now. But having said that, just the sheer logistics, I would still believe that given the weather constraints and the sheer logistics, we're probably physically capped at the $250 million to $300 million a year. Now you asked when are we going to see more specific estimates. Well, the date is November 30. We promised the Illinois Commerce Commission that we will file on November 30 our longer-term cost estimates for the 20-year period. Now as you know, trying to estimate precisely the cost of a construction program that is going to span 20 years, you know the only thing we're going to be is wrong. So we will probably give a range of values. We'll probably have a low case, a medium case and a high case that I would expect that what we will really focus on is, okay, those are projections, but what are we going to do in the next 3 years to make the most progress in getting that natural gas delivery system as safe and efficient as possible. I think you'll see a broad range for a lengthy period of time. So a low case, high case, medium case, and then we will really focus on what we plan to do in the next 3 years and what the cost of that is and what the progress will be. And all of that, look forward to November 30. Now in terms of rate impact, and I think -- I'm glad you asked that question, the legislation basically caps at that $250 million to $300 million a year, caps consumer rate increases at an average of 4%. But it's very important to understand what that 4% is based on. That 4% is based on what we call base rates. So base rates make up like less than 1/3 of a residential customer's gas bill. The rest is the commodity. So we're not talking about tremendous rate pressure here. We're talking about 4% off of -- we're talking about, basically 4% on a 1/3 of the total customer bill each year."

By contrast, Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota are 3 of the 10 heaviest using -- heaviest propane using states in the U.S. And for example, in Minnesota, recently, there was legislation passed that in essence reduces the upfront hook-up cost for customers to switch over to the natural gas delivery network and allows more of those capital costs to be basically put into rate base as opposed to the individual customer having to pay more for hooking into the system. And that was done because of the very significant concern in Minnesota about what happened in '14 during the polar vortex with propane supplies. So we would expect Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan, in terms of gas demand and growth in gas customers, to be stronger."

Essentially, I think we did a good job of due diligence and what we're seeing in terms of best practices, in terms of driving costs down, in terms of more efficient operations, I think all of the potential we saw is really there. So I would first say, the one upside for the past 120 days is the clear identification of infrastructure upgrades beyond what we thought in our due diligence. And that led to what I discussed about the higher capital spending on rate base opportunities here in the latter part of the decade. In terms of cost reductions, remember, this transaction was far more about growth than about cost reductions. The cost reductions we have estimated basically will be needed in any given year to help us make sure we earn our allowed rates of return. So again, I don't want to make -- I want to make sure that no one is thinking that there are going to be huge cost savings that are then going to somehow result in earnings above the allowed rates of return. That's not the plan, and that's not what we're seeing. I will say this, though, I think long term, there will be significant and tangible savings. There's no question about that. And even in Wisconsin, let me reiterate what we said earlier, and that is over the next 10 years, I see in a combination of capital cost savings and O&M savings, at least $1 billion of cost savings. Again, that's a combination of capital and O&M. And the first tangible result of that was when we were able to, with the commission's approval, we were able to take off the table, the need for Wisconsin Public Service to build the Fox 3, which was a combined cycle natural gas unit that had been planned. That's a $600 million investment that we can postpone for a very long time. So that's a tangible savings for customers right there. We will see, over time, for example, in just having to build only one, and it's being built by Integrys right now, only one new major customer information and billing system. The project is called ICE, I-C-E, and those projects are -- had $150 million, $120 million, $150 million a pop. Well, we're only going to need to build one of them and that's being built right now. So you can see all across our operations how we can drive cost savings over time. I hope that responds to your question."

So that industry literally has just burgeoned over the course of the past 5 years, 10 to 110. Now those 110 operations, because of the price of oil and lesser demand for frac sand, those operations are down. I think, we're seeing about -- of those we are serving today with natural gas, about an 11% decline this year in their natural gas demand. However, we were not serving anywhere near all of those 110 operations because we didn't have the infrastructure backbone to support that. I mentioned earlier that our West Central gas expansion project is now complete, that 85-mile line. That will allow us to sign up more of those operations. So we are not -- I mean, we're going to see growth in the firms that we deliver to that industry in Western Wisconsin over time, simply because we weren't serving that many of them during the boom times. As I said, they're down about 11% in terms of therms now, but we're going to be serving more of them now that we have completed the West Central line.
