We closed our 2014 year with strong fourth quarter financial results that, once again, included market share gains in each of our business groups. 
The global markets we serve remain generally healthy, highlighted by, of course, continued strong patient traffic in North America, and we are particularly pleased with the solid internal sales growth in local currencies in our international businesses, too. 
We achieved adjusted EPS growth for the year of 10%, and are affirming our guidance range for 2015 diluted EPS. I'm also pleased to mention that in 2014, for the first time, Henry Schein exceeded the $10 billion sales mark on an annual basis. 
In a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our performance along with a review of some of our key accomplishments during 2014. Needless to say, we completed our 3-year strategic plan for the period 2012 to '14 and did very well from our point of view on, of course, planning and executing on our plan. We feel that our business units are in good shape. We have a great management team in each of our business units and at the corporate level and are well positioned for a good 2015 and beyond. 
So before I give you further comments and highlights on the company per se, Steven will review our quarterly financial results. Steven?"

I am also pleased to report strong results for the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as the full year. If you look at our Q4 results, our net sales for the quarter ended December 27, 2014, were $2.7 billion,",1530,"Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I am also pleased to report strong results for the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as the full year. 
If you look at our Q4 results, our net sales for the quarter ended December 27, 2014, were $2.7 billion, reflecting a 7.0% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. This consisted of 9.9% growth in local currencies and 2.9% decline related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 4.9%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 5.0%. You can see additional details of our sales growth in Exhibit A of our earnings news release that was issued this morning. 
Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was 7.5% and expanded by 11 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of last year. And even if you exclude the impact of acquisitions completed during the past 12 months, our margin also expanded by 6 basis points compared with last year's fourth quarter. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.7%, and this compares with 29.8% in the fourth quarter of 2013. The slightly lower tax rate is due to implementation of ongoing tax planning strategies as well as higher earnings in countries with lower corporate income tax rates. Going forward, for 2015, we believe our effective tax rate will continue at a similar rate and be in the 30% range. 
Our net income attributable to Henry Schein for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $133 million or $1.56 per diluted share. This represents growth of 7.0% and 9.1%, respectively, compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. 
I think it's important to note that foreign currency exchange had a negative impact of approximately $0.04 on the current quarter's EPS for the quarter. So $0.04 negative impact is included in our numbers. 
Looking to the results for the full year. There are a number of highlights. Sales increased 8.5%, exceeding $10 billion for the first time as Stan just mentioned. Our cash flow was very strong at $593 million and exceeded net income by over $126 million. Diluted EPS increased almost 10% at 9.9% to $5.44, and that's -- the increase is after adjusting non-GAAP items in the prior year. And we believe overall, 2014 was an excellent year from a financial perspective. 
You can see a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS in Exhibit D of our news release. 
If you look at some additional detail on our sales results for the quarter. Dental sales for the quarter -- for the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 3.9% to $1.4 billion. This 3.9% growth consisted of 7.5% growth in local currencies and a 3.6% decline related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 2.3%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 5.2%, primarily related to the acquisitions of BioHorizons and Arseus. 
If we look at the 2.3% internal growth in local currencies, the components are 1.9% in the North American market and 2.9% in the international market. If we look at the components within each of North America and international, the 1.9% internal growth in constant currencies in North America included very strong growth in Dental consumable merchandise of 4.9% and a decline in Dental equipment sales and service revenue of 4.7%. 
We believe that the equipment sales declined in North America substantially due to this late reinstatement of tax incentives for the U.S. market in 2004 (sic) (2011). These tax incentives were reduced to $25,000 at the end of 2013 and were not returned to the previous level of $500,000 until December 19, 2014, and we believe it was really too late for our customers really to take advantage of that increased benefit in the fourth quarter to impact sales growth. 
If you look at the 2.9% growth in the international market, we had 3.1% growth in consumable merchandise and 2.6% growth in equipment sales and service revenue. 
Turning to Animal Health. Our sales were $731.6 million in the quarter, an increase of 12.3%, which included growth in local currencies of 15.9%, offset by a decline again in foreign currency by -- of 3.6%. 
The internal sales in local currencies grew 7.8% while acquisitions contributed an additional 8.1%. That 7.8% internal growth in constant currencies included 6.9% growth in North America and 8.6% growth in our International Animal Health sales. 
If you normalize our North American Animal Health sales, the impact of certain products that switched from agency sales to standard sales, North American internal sales growth was a little bit less at 5.9%. 
Turning to medical. Our medical sales were $461.7 million for the quarter, an increase of 9.4%. That 9.4% consisted of local currency growth of 9.9%, offset by foreign exchange, currency declines of 0.5%. And the internal sales in local currencies was 9.4% and 0.5% related to acquisitions. That 9.4% growth consisted of 9.5% slightly higher in North America, and that was led by upmarket and mid-market customers, and growth also strong in international of 8.4%. 
During the quarter, we sold seasonal influenza vaccines at the rate of $26 million for the quarter, and that's up slightly from the $23.8 million in last year's quarter. 
I'll also point out that our fourth quarter results include about 1.5 months of agency revenue resulting from the strategic agreement with Cardinal Health, and Stanley will discuss a little more details on this agreement later on in the call. We remain confident that our strategy of focusing on large group practices and IDNs resulted in continued market share gains. 
Technology and Value-Added Services sales were $91.3 million in the quarter, an increase of 3.3%, and that includes 4.4% growth in local currencies, offset by 1.1% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, the internally generated sales growth was 1.5%, and acquisition growth was an additional 2.9%. That 1.5% growth was a slight decline in North America of 0.7% and 15% growth in international. But remember in the North American market, we also have a shift in sales from standard sales to agency sales. And if you adjust for that and normalize for that, our internal growth in local currencies were 6% and included 4.6% growth in North America. 
This will be the last quarter for this normalizing adjustment in technology since that shift is now annualized. We continue to repurchase common stock in the open market during the quarter. Specifically, we repurchased 595,000 shares at an average price of $124 per share, approximately $74 million. 
The impact of these repurchases in the fourth quarter was not material to our EPS. And looking forward, we still have $300 million available for 2015 repurchases. And for 2014, we did achieve our stated goal of repurchasing about $300 million for the year. 
If you look at our balance sheet and cash flow, we have strong operating cash flow for the quarter, $274 million, which is substantially the same as the $274.6 million last year. Our operating cash flow for the year was $592.5 million, and free cash flow was $510.4 million. 
Again, we're pleased that we exceeded our goals related to cash flow and free cash flow for the year. 
Looking at accounts receivable days outstanding, really not much change here. We improved a little bit from 40 days last year to 39.9 days, and inventory turns were pretty much consistent at 5.9 turns this year versus 6.2 turns last year. 
Let me concluded my remarks by affirming our 2015 financial guidance as follows. For 2015, we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be in the range of $5.90 to $6. That represents growth of 8% to 10% compared to our 2014 actual results. 
the U.S. dollar, as I think everyone knows, has strengthened. And assuming it stays at its current level, we would expect adjusted EPS to be toward the low end of the range for the year. Keep in mind that approximately 35% of our sales are based in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and primarily the euro is our largest currency, and we do not hedge against the translation exposure for foreign exchange. 
I think it's also important to point out that we expect adjusted EPS growth to accelerate during the year. This is typical for us as we typically make investments at the beginning of the year. That will pay off later in the year, and this acceleration reflects continued leveraging of our infrastructure and controlling of expenses as well as realizing efficiencies from recently acquired acquisitions. 
The 2015 guidance excludes restructuring costs related to a planned corporate initiative to rationalize some of the company's operations and provide significant expense efficiencies. We believe it's important to reduce our cost structure so we can invest further in new initiatives to drive future long-term growth. 
This initiative is expected to continue throughout 2015, and the costs are estimated at between $35 million and $40 million pretax or $0.29 to $0.33 per diluted share. As always, our guidance is for continuing operations as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of any future acquisitions. 
Let me now turn the call back to Stan."
339447,283117142,759549,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, Steven. So let's begin a discussion on our 4 business groups with Dental. In North America, internal consumable merchandise sales growth in local currencies remain strong at nearly 5%. Equipment sales and service revenue, as Steven no",2723,"Thank you very much, Steven. So let's begin a discussion on our 4 business groups with Dental. In North America, internal consumable merchandise sales growth in local currencies remain strong at nearly 5%. Equipment sales and service revenue, as Steven noted, declined in North America due to the issues surrounding the timing of tax incentives in 2014 that Steve mentioned. 
We, of course, had a lot of purchases in the fourth quarter of 2013 that were driven by the large amounts of accelerated depreciation that was available to customers. And of course, advising customers on December 19 that, that was now available for the window of 10 days or so was just not practical to have -- and had no real impact. 
Our international Dental growth was solid for both consumable and merchandise -- consumable merchandise and for the equipment side with internal growth bolstered by strategic acquisitions made earlier in the year, especially on the Dental equipment side. 
In early January, we announced that during the year's second quarter, we will be expanding our Dental equipment product offering in North America by adding the entire line of A-dec equipment. Our commitment to our Dental customers has always been to provide the widest possible selection of products, equipment and Value-Added Services to create customized solutions that meet our customers' needs. 
Products from A-dec, along with those from our other valued equipment supplier partners, further this commitment by providing greater access to the broadest range of Dental equipment from industry leaders. Let me just confirm that we will only be adding the A-dec line around the middle of the second quarter. 
We also recently announced the acquisition of ADS Florida, which is one of the largest dental practice transition of brokerage companies serving the State of Florida. Although this transaction represents only a few million dollars in revenue, it is a very important strategic for several reasons. It expands the geographic reach of our practice transitions offering to dental practice owners looking to practices to build upon and builds upon last year's acquisition of the Maddox practice group in California. This transaction also adds to our practice transitions footprint a large market where the dental industry is flourishing and incorporates ADS into the professional practice transitions group of Henry Schein financial services. 
Our goal is not only to provide national coverage on brokerage services, which I think we, by and large, have, but to add depth in key markets around the country. And although these acquisitions are not huge from a capital commitment point of view, they are adding strategic importance to the Henry Schein Value-Added Service offering such that we can all help the practitioner into practice and when the practitioner is ready to sell the practice, help the practitioner exit. 
So overall, on the animal -- on the dental side, we are comfortable, more than comfortable, actually quite happy with the progress. We have an outstanding management team across the board, added to that -- added young people to the team as well, and we believe that we are on solid footing to execute on our major strategies there ranging from advancing our specialty business to our practice managing software business and of course, most importantly, to advancing the digitalization of prosthetics on a global basis. So overall, happy with the Animal Health -- with the Dental business. 
Now let me turn to the Animal Health business for a few minutes with sales growth in the fourth quarter featured double-digit gains in local currencies in North America and international. With international, internal sales growth in local currencies at a multiyear high. 
Internationally, we saw particular strength in the U.K. as well as Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium. We currently -- we recently expanded our Animal Health equipment capabilities with addition -- with additional capabilities and capacity and particularly through the recent announced acquisition of scil animal care. scil will bring to Henry Schein a new Value-Added Services offering while deepening our relationship with new practices in the technical -- from a technical point of view in equipment area specifically and of course, the software area, too, building on our installed base of purchase management software, which we believe is the largest installed base of its kind. the scil animal health professionals will enhance the equipment sales and support capabilities of our Animal Health business, representing our key supplier partners and introducing veterinarians to important diagnostic options. 
We believe strongly that diagnostics are critical elements to help veterinarians provide high-quality care and increase practice revenue. We, furthermore, believe this will significantly -- that scil will significantly expand our diagnostic products category. Not only do we have a very good offering on our diagnostic equipment, but it's a Value-Added Services, the connection between the Value-Added Services and our Practice Management Software and electronic medical records that is so important that scil will add a very, very important element to connecting the hardware and the software and enable us to gain market share for our Animal Health diagnostics partners, which, of course, include amongst others, Abaxis, Heska, but there are others that as well, but these are the cornerstones in our. And of course, the scil software and the professionals' knowledge will tighten the ability of Abaxis, Heska and others to work with Henry Schein. 
We are pleased with our progress to date in representing the product lines from both of these companies. Let me remind our investors that we really only added these lines towards the end of the fourth quarter and are now up and running with our suppliers in the diagnostic space. scil hasn't closed yet. That will close soon, and we will -- once this is done, we will really have very good momentum in the equipment and diagnostic space as well as the software space. 
scil is based in Germany, sells services and supports laboratories and imaging diagnostic products and services to veterinarians, of course, in Germany but in the United States and Canada France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain with a distribution presence in 25 additional countries. With scil, we are adding Canada and Italy to the list of countries where Henry Schein Animal Health services veterinarians. We also are gaining more than 200 employees, including 32 veterinarians. I would like to stress this, 32 veterinarians, of course, 26 equipment specialists and more than 70 sales representatives. 
scil had sales for the 12 months ended September 30, 2014, of approximately $70 million. We do expect this transaction to close in the second quarter of 2015, of course, subject to standard regulatory approval, but we don't expect any real concerns over here. 
The sales are not hugely material from a Henry Schein corporate point of view but the knowhow, knowledge of the scil group, together with the know-how, knowledge of the Henry Schein group not only in the Animal Health space but generally in the equipment space and medical and of course, dental will put us in excellent position to advance our sales in this regard. 
At the 2015 North America veterinary conference in late January, we showcased the choices we offer veterinarians in diagnostics from software to equipment to business solutions. We introduced a new software product called Access-Q, a buyer directional integrated solution that proves workflow and reduces -- less patient charges. Access-Q operates between the Practice Management Software such as our important -- such as the important offering -- such as from the important offering of software that we offer such as infinity and Triple Crown and the clinics, Abaxis and Heska diagnostic equipment. 
Access-Q automates the workflow of diagnostic tests. So the clinician does not have to manually input codes, and it automatically returns the results to the electronic medical record. Feedback from the show was very positive. We worked on the system rather rapidly, and you can expect a lot more features and functions to be unfolded in the near future. 
We are committed to the Practice Management arena in Animal Health as in Dental. Software, electronic medical records, accounting systems are the cornerstone, but what differentiates Henry Schein in the digital space in the position space is the ability to offer a complete integrated system integrating key machinery, diagnostic, other equipment in the office and software in the office to our software. 
We will now further advance this in the Animal Health space as well. We expect to formally launch Access-Q in the second quarter of 2015. 
Let me now turn to the Medical Group. Medical sales growth accelerated in the fourth quarter compared with the third. And while at a multiyear high as we've continued progress with large group practices and IDNs, the integrated delivery networks. This progress will be significantly enhanced under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health. The agreement is designed to provide one of the most comprehensive service and product offerings to office-based medical practitioners. 
As we announced in late November, the agreement combines Cardinal Health's product line and extensive touch points across the health care system with our outstanding service capabilities and our history of servicing the office-based practice. And when we talk about the office-based practice, we're not talking only of the independents or the large group practices, but we are talking about the practices owned by IDNs, where we have shown a track record now of being in a position to deliver outstanding service. 
Together with Cardinal, we believe we will deliver to our integrated network customers, the IDN customers and individual physicians, small practices, multi-specialty, solo specialty practices, vastly improved efficiency, a wider breadth of product, world-class service and a value for the ultimate benefit of the patient. 
In essence, there are 3 components to this new agreement. First, we acquired Cardinal's physician office-focused commercial organization, and will integrate into Henry Schein Medical business. This will add more than 25,000 physician office location and more than $300 million in revenue to our Medical business that will be slightly accretive to 2015 earnings. 
Of course, the second component includes a multiyear supply agreement, where Henry Schein will purchase Cardinal-branded product and utilize Cardinal Health as a source for various other medical products. We view this as a real win-win relationship as we expect to have lower or comparable pricing on a wide range of products, and of course, Cardinal also benefit from increasing their sales into the sector through our focused approach. 
And then as a third component of the agreement, we are excited about providing a unique combined solution to integrated delivery networks. The timing is ideal as IDNs seek to improve the coordination of care, increase efficiency and drive consistently standardization across their networks. Of note, more than half of the U.S. physician practices interact with an IDN, and that percentage, of course, continues to increase. 
The cooperation to date between Henry Schein and Cardinal Health has been excellent, and the teams are really off to a great start. We are working to transition customers and the sales team and expect to complete the integration of this business towards the end of the second quarter. At that time, we look forward to welcoming more than 200 Cardinal Health employees to Team Schein. We'll keep you apprised, of course, of the progress of the strategic alliance on future calls. 
So I think you get a sense for how much progress we've made in our 3 verticals: Dental, Medical, Animal Health. This progress was really all chartered out in our strategic plan, the last few strategic plans, but I believe we made terrific progress in the 2012 to '14 plan, along -- to advance the needs and the market share and the profitability of these 3 global verticals. 
As investors are aware, we have a horizontal as well, and that's in the Technology and Value-Added Services arena, where we are also delighted to report that our internal international Technology and Value-Added Services sales growth in local currencies grew by double digits for the eighth consecutive quarter. 
The growth rate more than doubled was including the impact of strategic acquisitions. Of course, this is a business that has some good sales but more importantly, good profits. But what is more important here is the stickiness and the value-added service that we provide to our customers such that it keeps our customers bound to us when they view us versus our competition, and the options are driven, the answers to that, the options are driven towards us as people understand, as our customers understand our Value-Added Services and specifically around the Technology and Value-Added Services group. 
We believe that equipment financing as well as lower software sales in North America were both negatively impacted by the late reinstatement of tax incentives in the U.S. Having said that, our reoccurring revenue continues to grow, and this is a great, great business for us. 
So before taking questions, Steven and I, I'd like to reflect back a moment on a few highlights of the year from an overall point of view. We are extremely pleased to have met and even exceeded many significant goals while advancing our strategic plan. 
We reported diluted earnings per share for the year of $5.44, which exceeded the top of our EPS guidance range established in November of 2013 by $0.05 per diluted share. We achieved operating cash flow of close to $600 million and free cash flow of over $500 million, both well in excess of net income. 
So it's not only good enough to have good earnings per share on an accrual basis, but it is important to turn that accrual-based earnings into cash flow, which we have done now for several years. We also repurchased about $300 million in stock, which is in line with our standard annual goal, and we also entered 3 new geographies during this period, 3 critical markets: Japan, Brazil and Poland. 
That was on the heels of entering South African market just before the year -- just before the beginning of the year. We became a significant participant in the U.S. equine market via an acquisition and enhanced our domestic group via the strategic transaction with Cardinal as we discussed. 
We strengthened our corporate governance with 2 appointments of outstanding Board of Directors members, Dr. Dianne Rekow, the Dean of Kings College, formerly of NYU, and materials expert and an orthodontic expert, and Dr. Larry Bacow, former President of Tufts University, who also served on several other boards, and these are just simply outstanding directors. 
Our commitment to advancing technology and of course, the digital dental office was evident by opening our new headquarters for our domestic dental practice solutions business and hosting the first international symposium for dental registry -- digital dentistry. 
We are, of course, undertaking similar activities in Europe, invested in a terrific new facility in the U.K. with similar kinds of capabilities to the one we now have in Utah. 
And lastly, we received a number of awards and recognitions, including being named the Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies, being named among the year's most ethical companies by Ethisphere Institute and climbing a few notches of the Fortune 500 list of America's largest companies. 
During last quarter call, I discussed some of the key pillars of our 2015 to '17 strategic plan. These most recent accomplishments from 2014 were an excellent foundation for us to go into the 2015 plans. We have our priorities lined up as we always do. We will focus on them, but we will remain nimble enough to take advantage of additional opportunities that come our way. But we -- as we have been for years, actually foundational companies in our history is to be a very focused company. 
We know what we have to do over the next 3 years, particularly as it relates to new product categories, more product exclusives, new geographies, enhanced margins, of course, very important, new clients, specialty customers, new technology solutions. And above all, in 2015, it's about human capital, talent, investment, management, and you can be sure that Team Schein is focused on this great succession at all levels of the company. 
So with that overview of our quarterly financial and operating performance summary of the year, I'd like to thank you for your attention this morning. To those that are investors, thank you for your confidence, and we're open for questions."

On the first part of your question, I don't know if I want to give a specific number because it's really difficult to quantify what customers would have bought because of tax incentives that ultimately didn't buy, but we certainly believe we would have had good growth. If I peel the onion on the equipment categories in North America, I think it's important to note that our CAD/CAM sales growth was strong. Traditional equipment was down a little bit but not as much as the overall category, and really I think people on some of the discretionary digital solutions, that's really where we saw people hold back. In my opinion, a lot of that really is timing that people would have accelerated their purchases in Q4, they'll ultimately buy sometime in 2015, not necessarily in Q1 but sometime in 2015. Right now, the tax incentives, the way the U.S. government did it, they reinstated them December 19, but they re-expired on January 1, 2015. So no one knows whether they'll reinstate them again and at what time. But right now, the tax incentives are only at the $25,000 level. The second part of your question really -- again, I gave color on the components. I'm not sure there's a lot more to add there other than again, we feel like with the addition of additional equipment lines, including A-dec, we feel like we're going to have a good equipment year in 2015, and I think most people realize that the consumable sales growth, which was strong, just under 5%, really is a better indicator of how the market is doing than this one quarter of equipment sales."

So really, in Q1, there's really mostly expenses and not a lot benefit. So it is slightly accretive, but we do expect increased accretion, and really we're being very conservative on the potential for procurement and buying at better prices because we really don't know the impact of that yet. So that could be an additional upside. On certain products, obviously, we would think that Cardinal Health buys at better prices than we can do on our own especially on the pharma side. So hopefully that will be benefit, but it's too early really to quantify what that benefit will be."

U.S. GAAP doesn't allow us to record that revenue gross with all of the expenses. So we get a fee based on sales from Cardinal, which is designed to represent the estimated profitability of those sales that they're collecting on our behalf. And that number is what we included in the acquisition growth. So the organic growth does not include any impact from the Cardinal agency fee that we're receiving. Once integrated, so sometime during Q2 is the plan, we'll shift over to having those sales fulfilled through our distribution network, and we'll be taking the orders and doing all of the traditional distribution work. And at that time, we'll record the gross revenues again, which should be north of $300 million on a full year basis going forward."

Wish we could close all the deals in the pipeline. That's not a matter of capital. It's a matter of capacity because integrations are something that goes along with every acquisition, and so we don't have an issue finding acquisitions. I think we will have no issue in putting the capital to work that we've outlined I think something like somewhere between 45% and 50% of our cash flow will go into acquisitions. We will continue with our formula of accretive acquisitions. And in fact, I think we are in a better position today to make acquisitions than ever before. Our track record is outstanding for keeping management where we make commitments upfront. Our suppliers are generally supportive of us because they've seen us enter markets and not disrupt markets but, in fact, add to the distribution capability and the Value-Added Services in the market, which generally gets better after we enter from a competitive landscape point of view. So I don't think there is any issue from that point of view. We have no problem in keeping the pipeline full. We will expand our geographic presence in our Dental and our Animal Health business. We will probably do that in Medical again at some point when we want to get the Cardinal integration behind us. It's a big opportunity. We have the right to sell the Cardinal products abroad, and we will do that. And I think you will see us adding much more in the Value-Added Service area, continues to be important to us across the board, all countries. And of course, the specialty area, there's lots and lots of opportunity meanwhile we've become an important player in the specialty-only products. We are always an important player in selling general products, equipment consumables specialist, but it was the specialty products, the implants, the bone regeneration, the wires and brackets and related products and the endodontic-type specific products we're doing well, growing that throughout the world inorganically and of course, organically. So I don't think we'll have any issue in continuing to expand, and I don't think will be paying a penny more than we used to pay.

So we continue to expect to increase our presence. Having said that, at the moment, it's relatively small. And the entry to Japanese market, for example, is not a consolidated entry acquisition nor is the one in Brazil nor is the one in South Africa. We are doing well in all of these businesses, but they're not material. China, we are not material. We are growing, but it's not profitable. The others are all profitable, and Thailand is profitable although there was an issue for a couple of quarters because of the coup, but I think it's quite balanced today. We think we're going to have -- at least from an economic point view, things are looking better. So overall, I think these markets are all markets that are growing faster even if you take into account some of the losses in China, where we have a team much bigger than we need, a much more sophisticated team, an outstanding team actually. We believe we have the best professional team in China of anyone really in our space. So overall, I think that you will see that from a profitability point of view, it's pretty good. We're particularly pleased, by the way, with Brazil where our growth is really fantastic and South Africa, too. And so I would say that these are opportunities that are doing very well for us except for China, which is growing nicely on the top line but at this stage, still acquiring quite a bit of an investment."

I think A-dec is aware of this, and we hope to add to the marketplace in general. The A-dec chairs are slightly more expensive than chairs that we have been offering to date. Overall, we think we have outstanding offering. A-dec adds to that, but we also believe that the offering we have from our existing suppliers is a good one. It's been an outstanding one. It's allowed us to become a very significant player in the Equipment business. In fact, we believe we're the largest provider of equipment in the world, Dental equipment.

So assuming that the $1.13 stays for the entire year, which I'm not sure is a good or bad assumption, but we have to start with an assumption, that would have anywhere versus our previous guidance, anywhere between an $0.08 to $0.10 EPS impact. And that's why on the conference call, we said while we're still comfortable with our range, we're really, at this point, saying the lower end of our range. There are a few offsets. Cardinal is a little bit of an offset to it. Actually fuel prices are a little bit of an offset to it also but not significant. And again we don't know, which way fuel prices are going to go over the next 8 or 9 months, but I think we still feel like achieving our full year guidance is very doable. And obviously, if the dollar continues to strengthen, we'll look to see if we can continue to achieve the guidance by doing some other activities or not.

So I think and at the same time, the euro stays low, our imports on products go down in price, not only in terms of products from Europe but also from Asia.

But right now, we have to go with whatever the tax law is that exist, and it's only for the first $25,000 of capital expenditures, which is a relatively small amount. As you know, CAD/CAM is over $100,000. A lot of other equipment is expensive. So without that tax incentive, it doesn't give people the incentive to buy now, and they'll still buy, but they'll buy in due course rather than trying to accelerate it. So hopefully that answers your question."

We closed our 2014 year with strong fourth quarter financial results that, once again, included market share gains in each of our business groups. 
The global markets we serve remain generally healthy, highlighted by, of course, continued strong patient traffic in North America, and we are particularly pleased with the solid internal sales growth in local currencies in our international businesses, too. 
We achieved adjusted EPS growth for the year of 10%, and are affirming our guidance range for 2015 diluted EPS. I'm also pleased to mention that in 2014, for the first time, Henry Schein exceeded the $10 billion sales mark on an annual basis. 
In a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our performance, along with a review of some of our key accomplishments during 2014. Needless to say, we completed our 3-year strategic plan for the period 2012 to '14 and did very well from our point of view on, of course, planning and executing on that plan. We feel that our business units are in good shape. We have a great management team in each of our business units and at the corporate level, and are well-positioned for a good 2015 and beyond. 
So before I give you further comments and highlights on the company per se, Steven will review our quarterly financial results. Steven?"
339447,283117142,759882,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I am also pleased to report strong results for the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as the full year. If you look at our Q4 results, our net sales for the quarter ended December 27, 2014, were $2.7 billion,",1533,"Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I am also pleased to report strong results for the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as the full year. 
If you look at our Q4 results, our net sales for the quarter ended December 27, 2014, were $2.7 billion, reflecting a 7.0% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. This consisted of 9.9% growth in local currencies and 2.9% decline related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 4.9%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 5.0%. You can see additional details of our sales growth in Exhibit A of our earnings news release that was issued this morning. 
Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was 7.5% and expanded by 11 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of last year. And even if you exclude the impact of acquisitions completed during the past 12 months, our margin also expanded by 6 basis points compared with last year's fourth quarter. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.7%, and this compares with 29.8% in the fourth quarter of 2013. The slightly lower tax rate is due to implementation of ongoing tax planning strategies as well as higher earnings in countries with lower corporate income tax rates. Going forward, for 2015, we believe our effective tax rate will continue at a similar rate and be in the 30% range. 
Our net income attributable to Henry Schein for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $133 million or $1.56 per diluted share. This represents growth of 7.0% and 9.1%, respectively, compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. 
I think it's important to note that foreign currency exchange had a negative impact of approximately $0.04 on the current quarter's EPS for the quarter. So a $0.04 negative impact is included in our numbers. 
Looking to the results for the full year. There are a number of highlights. Sales increased 8.5%, exceeding $10 billion for the first time, as Stan just mentioned. Our cash flow was very strong at $593 million and exceeded net income by over $126 million. Diluted EPS increased almost 10% at 9.9% to $5.44, and that's -- the increase is after adjusting non-GAAP items in the prior year. And we believe, overall, 2014 was an excellent year from a financial perspective. 
You can see a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS in Exhibit D of our news release. 
If you look at some additional detail on our sales results for the quarter. Dental sales for the quarter -- for the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 3.9% to $1.4 billion. This 3.9% growth consisted of 7.5% growth in local currencies and a 3.6% decline related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 2.3%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 5.2%, primarily related to the acquisitions of BioHorizons and Arseus. 
If we look at the 2.3% internal growth in local currencies, the components are 1.9% in the North American market and 2.9% in the international market. If we look at the components within each of North America and international, the 1.9% internal growth in constant currencies in North America included very strong growth in Dental consumable merchandise of 4.9% and a decline in Dental equipment sales and service revenue of 4.7%. 
We believe that the equipment sales declined in North America substantially due to this late reinstatement of tax incentives for the U.S. market in 2004 (sic) [ 2014 ]. These tax incentives were reduced to $25,000 at the end of 2013 and were not returned to the previous level of $500,000 until December 19, 2014, and we believe it was really too late for our customers really to take advantage of that increased benefit in the fourth quarter to impact sales growth. If you look at the 2.9% growth in the international market, we had 3.1% growth in consumable merchandise and 2.6% growth in equipment sales and service revenue. 
Turning to Animal Health. Our sales were $731.6 million in the quarter, an increase of 12.3%, which included growth in local currencies of 15.9%, offset by a decline again in foreign currency by -- of 3.6%. 
The internal sales in local currencies grew 7.8%, while acquisitions contributed an additional 8.1%. That 7.8% internal growth in constant currencies included 6.9% growth in North America and 8.6% growth in our International Animal Health sales. If you normalize our North American Animal Health sales, the impact of certain products that switched from agency sales to standard sales, North American internal sales growth was a little bit less at 5.9%. 
Turning to Medical. Our Medical sales were $461.7  million for the quarter, an increase of 9.4%. That 9.4% consisted of local currency growth of 9.9%, offset by foreign exchange currency declines of 0.5%. And the internal sales in local currencies was 9.4% and 0.5% related to acquisitions. That 9.4% growth consisted of 9.5% slightly higher in North America, and that was led by up-market and mid-market customers, and growth also strong in international of 8.4%. 
During the quarter, we sold seasonal influenza vaccines at the rate of $26 million for the quarter, and that's up slightly from the $23.8 million in last year's quarter. 
I'll also point out that our fourth quarter results include about 1.5 months of agency revenue resulting from the strategic agreement with Cardinal Health, and Stanley will discuss a little more details on this agreement later on in the call. We remain confident that our strategy of focusing on large group practices and IDNs resulted in continued market share gains. 
Technology and Value-Added Service sales were $91.3 million in the quarter, an increase of 3.3%, and that includes 4.4% growth in local currencies, offset by 1.1% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, the internally generated sales growth was 1.5%, and acquisition growth was an additional 2.9%. That 1.5% growth was a slight decline in North America of 0.7% and 15% growth in international. But remember, in the North American market, we also have a shift in sales from standard sales to agency sales. And if you adjust for that and normalize for that, our internal growth in local currencies was 6% and included 4.6% growth in North America. 
This will be the last quarter for this normalizing adjustment in Technology since that shift has now annualized. 
We continue to repurchase common stock in the open market during the quarter. Specifically, we repurchased 595,000 shares at an average price of $124 per share, approximately $74 million. The impact of these repurchases in the fourth quarter was not material to our EPS. And looking forward, we still have $300 million available for 2015 repurchases. And for 2014, we did achieve our stated goal of repurchasing about $300 million for the year. 
If you look at our balance sheet and cash flow, we had strong operating cash flow for the quarter, $274 million, which is substantially the same as the $274.6 million last year. Our operating cash flow for the year was $592.5 million, and free cash flow was $510.4 million. 
Again, we're pleased that we exceeded our goals related to cash flow and free cash flow for the year. 
Looking at accounts receivable days outstanding, really not much changed here. We improved a little bit from 40 days last year to 39.9 days, and inventory turns were pretty much consistent at 5.9 turns this year versus 6.2 turns last year. 
Let me conclude my remarks by affirming our 2015 financial guidance as follows: for 2015, we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be in the range of $5.90 to $6. That represents growth of 8% to 10% compared to our 2014 actual results. 
The U.S. dollar, as I think everyone knows, has strengthened. And assuming it stays at its current level, we would expect adjusted EPS to be toward the low end of the range for the year. Keep in mind that approximately 35% of our sales are based in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and primarily the euro is our largest currency, and we do not hedge against the translation exposure for foreign exchange. 
I think it's also important to point out that we expect adjusted EPS growth to accelerate during the year. This is typical for us as we typically make investments at the beginning of the year. That will pay off later in the year, and this acceleration reflects continued leveraging of our infrastructure and controlling of expenses as well as realizing efficiencies from recently acquired acquisitions. 
The 2015 guidance excludes restructuring costs related to a planned corporate initiative to rationalize some of the company's operations and provide significant expense efficiencies. We believe it's important to reduce our cost structure so we can invest further in new initiatives to drive future long-term growth. This initiative is expected to continue throughout 2015, and the costs are estimated at between $35 million and $40 million pretax or $0.29 to $0.33 per diluted share. As always, our guidance is for continuing operations as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of any future acquisitions. 
Let me now turn the call back to Stan."
339447,283117142,759882,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, Steven. So let's begin a discussion on our 4 business groups with Dental. In North America, internal consumable merchandise sales growth in local currencies remained strong at nearly 5%. Equipment sales and service revenue, as Steven",2751,"Thank you very much, Steven. So let's begin a discussion on our 4 business groups with Dental. In North America, internal consumable merchandise sales growth in local currencies remained strong at nearly 5%. Equipment sales and service revenue, as Steven noted, declined in North America due to the issues surrounding the timing of tax incentives in 2014 that Steve mentioned. 
We, of course, had a lot of purchases in the fourth quarter of 2013 that were driven by the large amounts of accelerated depreciation that was available to customers. And of course, advising customers on December 19 that, that was now available for the window of 10 days or so was just not practical to have -- and had no real impact. 
Our international Dental growth was solid for both consumable and merchandise -- consumable merchandise and for the equipment side, with internal growth bolstered by strategic acquisitions made earlier in the year, especially on the Dental equipment side. 
In early January, we announced that during the year's second quarter, we will be expanding our Dental equipment product offering in North America by adding the entire line of A-dec equipment. Our commitment to our Dental customers has always been to provide the widest possible selection of products, equipment and Value-Added Services to create customized solutions that meet our customers' needs. 
Products from A-dec, along with those from our other valued equipment supplier partners, further this commitment by providing greater access to the broadest range of Dental equipment from industry leaders. Let me just confirm that we will only be adding the A-dec line around the middle of the second quarter. 
We also recently announced the acquisition of ADS Florida, which is one of the largest dental practice transition and brokerage companies serving the State of Florida. Although this transaction represents only a few million dollars in revenue, it is very important, strategically, for several reasons. It expands the geographic reach of our practice transitions offering to dental practice owners looking to buy or sell their practices to build upon -- and builds upon last year's acquisition of the Maddox practice group in California. This transaction also adds to our practice transitions footprint a large market where the dental industry is flourishing and incorporates ADS into the professional practice transitions group of Henry Schein Financial Services. 
Our goal is not only to provide national coverage on brokerage services, which I think we, by and large, have, but to add depth in key markets around the country. And although these acquisitions are not huge from a capital commitment point of view, they are adding strategic importance to the Henry Schein Value-Added Service offering such that we can now help the practitioner into practice, and when the practitioner is ready to sell the practice, help the practitioner exit. 
So overall, on the animal -- on the Dental side, we are comfortable, more than comfortable, actually quite happy with the progress we've made. We have an outstanding management team across the board, we've added to that. We've added young people to the team as well, and we believe that we are on solid footing to execute on our major strategies there, ranging from advancing our specialty business to our Practice Management Software business, and of course, most importantly, to advancing the digitalization of prosthetics on a global basis. So overall, happy with the Animal Health -- with the Dental business. 
Now let me turn to the Animal Health business for a few minutes, with sales growth in the fourth quarter featured double-digit gains in local currencies in North America and international. With international, internal sales growth in local currency is in a multiyear high. 
Internationally, we saw particular strength in the U.K. as well as Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium. We currently -- we recently expanded our Animal Health equipment capabilities with addition -- with additional capabilities and capacities and particularly through the recent announced acquisition of scil animal care. scil will bring to Henry Schein a new Value-Added Services offering while deepening our relationship with new practices in a technical -- from a technical point of view in equipment area, specifically, and of course, the software area, too, building on our installed base of Practice Management software, which we believe is the largest installed base of its kind. The scil animal health professionals will enhance the equipment sales and support capabilities of our Animal Health business, representing our key supplier partners and introducing veterinarians to important diagnostic options. 
We believe strongly that diagnostics are critical elements to help veterinarians provide high-quality care and increase practice revenue. We furthermore believe this will significantly -- that scil will significantly expand our diagnostic products category. Not only do we have a very good offering of diagnostic equipment, but it's Value-Added Services and the connection between the Value-Added Services and our Practice Management Software and electronic medical records that is so important. And scil will add a very, very important element to connecting the hardware and the software and enable us to gain market share for our Animal Health diagnostics partners, which, of course, include amongst others, Abaxis, Heska, but there are others as well, but these are the cornerstones in our mold. And of course, the scil software and the professionals' knowledge will tighten the ability of Abaxis, Heska and others to work with Henry Schein. 
We are pleased with our progress to date in representing the product lines from both of these companies. Let me remind our investors that we really only added these lines towards the end of the fourth quarter and are now up and running with our suppliers in the diagnostic space. scil hasn't closed yet, but it will close soon, and we will -- once this is done, we will really have very good momentum in the equipment and diagnostic space as well as the software space. 
scil is based in Germany, sells services and supports laboratories in imaging diagnostic products and services to veterinarians, of course in Germany, but in the United States, in Canada, France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, with a distribution presence in 25 additional countries. With scil, we are adding Canada and Italy to the list of countries where Henry Schein Animal Health service veterinarians. We also are gaining more than 200 employees, including 32 veterinarians. And I would like to stress this, 32 veterinarians, of course, 26 equipment specialists and more than 70 sales representatives. scil had sales for the 12 months ended September 30, 2014, of approximately $70 million. We do expect this transaction to close in the second quarter of 2015, of course, subject to standard regulatory approval, but we don't expect any real concerns over here. 
The sales are not hugely material from a Henry Schein corporate point of view, but the know-how knowledge of the scil group, together with the know-how knowledge of the Henry Schein group, not only in the Animal Health space, but generally in the equipment space, in medical, and of course, Dental, will put us in excellent position to advance our sales in this regard. 
At the 2015 North America Veterinary Conference in late January, we showcased the choices we offer veterinarians in diagnostics from software to equipment to business solutions. We introduced a new software product called Axis-Q, a bio-directional -- important bio-directional integrated solution that improves workflow and reduces list patient charges. Axis-Q operates between the Practice Management Software, such as our important -- such as the important offer -- such as from the important offering of software that we offer, such as AVImark, Infinity and Triple Crown; and the clinics, Abaxis and Heska diagnostic equipment. 
Axis-Q automates the workflow of diagnostic tests, so the clinician does not have to manually input codes, and it automatically returns the results to their electronic medical record. Feedback from the show was very positive. We worked on the system rather rapidly, and you can expect a lot more features and functions to be unfolded in the near future. 
We are committed to the Practice Management arena in Animal Health as in Dental. Software, electronic medical records, accounting systems are the cornerstone, but what differentiates Henry Schein in the dental space, the physician space, is the ability to offer a complete integrated system integrating key machinery, diagnostic, other equipment in the office and software in the office to our software. We will now further advance this in the Animal Health space as well. We expect to formally launch Axis-Q in the second quarter of 2015. 
Let me now turn to the Medical Group. Medical sales growth accelerated in the fourth quarter compared to the third, and while it's at a multiyear high as we made continued progress with large group practices and IDNs, the integrated delivery networks. This progress will be significantly enhanced under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health. The agreement is designed to provide one of the most comprehensive service and product offerings to office-based medical practitioners. 
As we announced in late November, the agreement combines Cardinal Health's product line and extensive touch points across the health care system with our outstanding service capabilities and our history of servicing the office-based practice. And when we talk about the office-based practice, we're not talking only of the independents or the large group practicers, but we're talking about the practicers owned by IDNs. We have shown a track record now of being in a position to deliver outstanding service. 
Together with Cardinal, we believe we will deliver to our integrated network customers, the IDN customers, and individual physicians, small practicers, multi-specialty, solo-specialty practicers, vastly improved efficiency, a wider breadth of product, world-class service and a value for the ultimate benefit of the patient. 
In essence, there are 3 components in the new agreement. First, we acquired Cardinal's physician office-focused commercial organization, and we'll integrate it into Henry Schein's Medical business. This will add more than 25,000 physician office location and more than $300 million in revenue to our Medical business, and will be slightly accretive to 2015 earnings. 
Of course, the second component includes a multiyear supply agreement, where Henry Schein will purchase Cardinal-branded products and utilize Cardinal Health as a source for various other medical products. We view this as a real win-win relationship as we expect to have lower or comparable pricing on a wide range of products, and of course, Cardinal will also benefit from increasing their sales into the sector through our focused approach. 
And then there's a third component of the agreement, we are excited about providing a unique combined solution to integrated delivery networks. The timing is ideal, as IDNs seek to improve the coordination of care, increase efficiency and drive consistency and standardization across their networks. Of note, more than half of the U.S. physician practicers interact with an IDN, and that percentage, of course, continues to increase. 
The cooperation to date between Henry Schein and Cardinal Health has been excellent, and the teams are really off to a great start. We are working to transition customers and the sales team and expect to complete the integration of this business towards the end of the second quarter. At that time, we look forward to welcoming more than 200 Cardinal Health employees to Team Schein. We'll keep you apprised, of course, of the progress of this strategic alliance on future calls. 
So I think you get a sense for how much progress we've made in our 3 verticals: Dental, Medical, Animal Health. This progress was really all chartered out in our strategic plan -- the last few strategic plans, but I believe we made terrific progress in the 2012 to '14 plan, along -- to advance the needs and the market share and the profitability of these 3 global verticals. 
As investors are aware, we have a horizontal as well, and that's in the Technology and Value-Added Services arena, where we are also delighted to report that our internal -- international Technology and Value-Added Services sales growth, in local currencies, grew by double digits for the eighth consecutive quarter. 
The growth rate more than doubled when including the impact of strategic acquisitions. Of course, this is a business that has some good sales, but more importantly, good profits. But what is more important here is the stickiness and the value-added service that we provide to our customers, such that it keeps our customers bound to us when they view us versus our competition. And the options are driven -- the answers to that, the options are driven towards us as people understand -- as our customers understand our Value-Added Services and specifically around the Technology and Value-Added Services group. 
We believe that equipment financing as well as lower software sales in North America both negatively impacted by the late reinstatement of tax incentives in the U.S. Having said that, our reoccurring revenue continues to grow, and this is a great, great business for us. 
So before taking questions, Steven and I, I'd like to reflect back a moment on a few highlights of the year from an overall point of view. We are extremely pleased to have met and even exceeded many significant goals while advancing our strategic plan. We reported diluted earnings per share for the year of $5.44, which exceeded the top of our EPS guidance range established in November of 2013 by $0.05 per diluted share. We achieved operating cash flow of close to $600 million and free cash flow of over $500 million, both well in excess of net income. 
So it's not only good enough to have good earnings per share on an accrual basis, but it is important to turn that accrual-based earnings into cash flow, which we have done now for several years. We also repurchased about $300 million in stock, which is in line with our standard annual goal, and we also entered 3 new geographies during this period, 3 critical markets: Japan, Brazil and Poland. That was on the heels of entering the South African market just before the year -- just before the beginning of the year. 
We became a significant participant in the U.S. equine market via an acquisition and enhanced our domestic group via the strategic transaction with Cardinal, as we discussed. 
We strengthened our corporate governance with 2 appointments of outstanding Board of Directors members, Dr. Dianne Rekow, the Dean of Kings College, formerly of NYU, as materials expert and an orthodontic expert; and Dr. Larry Bacow, former President of Tufts University, who is also serves -- who also serves on several other boards, and these are just simply outstanding directors. 
Our commitment to advancing technology and, of course, the digital dental office was evidenced by opening our new headquarters for our domestic Dental Practice Solutions business and hosting the first international symposium for dental -- on digital dentistry. 
Our -- we are, of course, undertaking similar activities in Europe, invested in a terrific new facility in the U.K. with similar kinds of capabilities to the one we now have in Utah. 
And lastly, we received a number of awards and recognitions, including being named the Fortune Magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies, being named among the year's most ethical companies by Ethisphere Institute, and climbing a few notches of the Fortune 500 list of America's largest companies. 
During the last quarter call, I discussed some of the key pillars of our 2015 to '17 strategic plan. These most recent accomplishments from 2014 were an excellent foundation for us to go into the 2015 plan. We have our priorities lined up as we always do. We will focus on them, but we will remain nimble enough to take advantage of additional opportunities that come our way. But we -- as we have been for years. Actually the foundation of the companies and our history is to be a very focused company. We know what we have to do over the next 3 years, particularly as it relates to new product categories, more product exclusives, new geographies, enhanced margins, of course, very important, new clients, specialty customers, new technology solutions. And above all, in 2015, it's about human capital, talent, investment, management, and you can be sure that Team Schein is focused on this great succession at all levels of the company.

On the first part of your question, I don't know if I want to give a specific number because it's really difficult to quantify what customers would have bought because of tax incentives that ultimately didn't buy, but we certainly believe we would have had good growth. If I peel the onion on the equipment categories in North America, I think it's important to note that our CAD/CAM sales growth was strong. Traditional equipment was down a little bit but not as much as the overall category. And really, I think people on some of the discretionary digital solutions, that's really where we saw people hold back. In my opinion, a lot of that really is timing that people would have accelerated their purchases in Q4, they'll ultimately buy sometime in 2015, not necessarily in Q1 but sometime in 2015. Right now, the tax incentives, the way that U.S. government did it, they reinstated them December 19, but they re-expired on January 1, 2015. So no one knows whether they'll reinstate them again and at what time, but right now, the tax incentives are only at the $25,000 level. The second part of your question really -- again, I gave color on the components. I'm not sure there's a lot more to add there other than, again, we feel like, with the addition of additional equipment lines, including A-dec, we feel like we're going to have a good equipment year in 2015. And I think most people realize that the consumable sales growth, which was strong, just under 5%, really is a better indicator of how the market is doing than this one quarter of equipment sales."

That's somewhere a couple of pennies or so of accretion for 2015. Remember, that's net of all integration costs and onetime costs, so -- and we're not expecting to complete the integration until Q2. So really, in Q1, there's really mostly expenses and not a lot of benefit. So it is slightly accretive, but we do expect increased accretion, and really we're being very conservative on the potential for procurement and buying at better prices because we really don't know the impact of that yet. So that could be an additional upside. On certain products, obviously, we would think that Cardinal Health buys at better prices than we could do on our own, especially on the pharma side. So hopefully, that will be a benefit, but it's too early really to quantify what that benefit will be."

So because, right now, Cardinal is continuing to service customers, they are taking orders, they are shipping, they're billing, they're collecting, they're really doing all of the functions until integration. U.S. GAAP doesn't allow us to record that revenue gross with all of the expenses. So we get a fee based on sales from Cardinal, which is designed to represent the estimated profitability of those sales that they're collecting on our behalf. And that number is what we included in the acquisition growth. So the organic growth does not include any impact from the Cardinal agency fee that we're receiving. Once integrated, so sometime during Q2 is the plan, we'll shift over to having those sales fulfilled through our distribution network, and we'll be taking the orders and doing all of the traditional distribution work. And at that time, we'll record the gross revenues again, which should be north of $300 million on a full year basis going forward."

Our pipeline on acquisitions is as full as ever. Wish we could close all the deals in the pipeline. It's not a matter of capital, it's a matter of capacity, because integrations are something that goes along with every acquisition. So we don't have an issue finding acquisitions. I think we will have no issue in putting the capital to work that we've outlined, I think something like somewhere between 45% and 50% of our cash flow will go into acquisitions. We will continue with our formula of accretive acquisitions. And in fact, I think we are in a better position today to make acquisitions than ever before. Our track record is outstanding for keeping management where we make commitments upfront. Our suppliers are generally supportive of us because they've seen us enter markets and not disrupt markets but, in fact, add to the distribution capability and the Value-Added Services in the market, which generally gets better after we enter from a competitive landscape point of view. So I don't think there is any issue from that point of view. We have no problem in keeping the pipeline full. We will expand our geographic presence in our Dental and our Animal Health business. We will probably do that in Medical again at some point, when we want to get the Cardinal integration behind us. It's a big opportunity. We have the right to sell the Cardinal products abroad, and we will do that. And I think you will see us adding much more in the Value-Added Service area, continues to be important to us across the board, all countries. And of course, the specialty area, there's lots and lots of opportunity. Meanwhile, we've become an important player in the specialty-only products. We're always an important player in selling general products, equipment consumables, specialists, but it was the specialty products, the implants, the bone regeneration, the wires and brackets and related products and the endodontic-type specific products we're doing well, growing that throughout the world inorganically, and of course, organically. So I don't think we'll have any issue in continuing to expand, and I don't think we'll be paying $0.01 more than we used to pay. We have a very good reputation in this area and are very good at integrating businesses once we acquire them."

First of all -- that's a very good question, John. It's something that's very important for us. It's clear that Asia and the developing world are growing at a much faster rate than the developed world, and certainly faster than Europe. So -- and that there's a big market. There's at least 1/3 of the world's Dental business that's available in these developing world markets/Asia, and of course, Japan is not a developing -- Korea is now a developing world country. So we continue to expect to increase our presence. Having said that, at the moment, it's relatively small. And the entry to Japanese market, for example, is not a consolidated entry acquisition, nor is the one in Brazil, nor is the one in South Africa. We are doing well in all of these businesses, but they're not material. China, we are not material. We are growing, but it's not profitable, the others are all profitable. And Thailand is profitable, although it was an issue for a couple of quarters because of the coup, but I think it's quite balanced today. We think we're going to have -- at least from an economic point view, things are looking better. So overall, I think these markets are all markets that are growing faster, even if you take into account some of the losses in China, where we have a team much bigger than we need, a much more sophisticated team, an outstanding team, actually. We believe we have the best professional team in China of anyone, really, in our space. So overall, I think you will see that, from a profitability point of view, it's pretty good. We're particularly pleased, by the way, with Brazil, where our growth is really fantastic, and South Africa, too. And so I would say that these are opportunities that are doing very well for us except for China, which is growing nicely on the top line but is, at this stage, still requiring quite a bit of an investment."

Our goal is to expand the A-dec business together with ours, but at the same time, not in any way distract from our loyal suppliers over the year. So we will go carefully, I think A-dec is aware of this, and we hope to add to the marketplace in general. The A-dec chairs are slightly more expensive than chairs that we have been offering to date. Overall, we think we have an outstanding offering. A-dec adds to that, but we also believe that the offering we have from our existing suppliers is a good one. It's been an outstanding one. It's allowed us to become a very significant player in the equipment business. In fact, we believe we're the largest provider of equipment in the world, Dental equipment. So we just have to be careful not to disrupt the market and make sure that we're additive.

So when we issued guidance, and I'll just focus on the dollar to the euro, because that's our major currency, although there was a little bit of impact on some of the other currencies, too.

So assuming that the $1.13 stays for the entire year, which I'm not sure is a good or bad assumption, but we have to start with an assumption, that would have anywhere, versus our previous guidance, anywhere between an $0.08 to $0.10 EPS impact. And that's why on the conference call we said, while we're still comfortable with our range, we're really, at this point, saying the lower end of the range. There are a few offsets. Cardinal is a little bit of an offset to it. Actually, fuel prices are a little bit of an offset to it also, but not significant. And again, we don't know which way fuel prices are going to go over the next 8 or 9 months. But I think we still feel like achieving our full year guidance is very doable. And obviously, if the dollar continues to strengthen, we'll look to see if we can continue to achieve the guidance by doing some other activities or not. But again, it's so hard to predict, and I really don't want to predict what I think the full year impact will be because I think it's too difficult. There are too many variables."

So I think -- and at the same time, the euro stays low, our imports of products go down in price, not only in terms of products from Europe but also from Asia.

And I think, overall, in the end, Henry Schein will be a better investment for our shareholders from this point of view. So I will say that also, and I think you've seen this from others who've reported traffic into the Animal Health spaces, okay? It's a great market. We're seeing lots of capital coming into this market, and we remain very bullish. We've invested heavily from a management point of view in Europe, in Australia, and New Zealand. Our CEO of Animal Health business in the U.S. retired. He's still a consultant for the company. We've replaced Kevin with an outstanding new president, who's presiding over an outstanding team. So we remain extremely excited about the third leg to Henry Schein that we added really about 4 or 5 years ago in a material way.

How are you tracking against that now 9 or 12 months later? And then, Steven, to an earlier question I just want to make sure think about this correctly. If I estimate about a $40 million shortfall in North American Dental equipment because of the 179 delay, we should be that largely as a pickup from 4Q '14 to 4Q '15 as those accounts away sort of the implementation of implementation of 179 rather than trickling in throughout 2015?"

And our global category for CAD/CAM, the hardware, the entry devices, the materials is doing well and is growing. We have a team in place. It's been in place for 4 years now and really are doing very, very well. So I think our -- this category is probably, at least for the big categories, the fastest-growing category. I believe that, overall, we're doing quite well, but -- in fact, we're getting market share globally. But to give you a precise number of the new units sold in the fourth quarter versus what our competitors sold -- our competitors [indiscernible] several units today, it's very hard to tell. We will track that in a much more -- much longer period of time."

Q4, I think, when you look at how much market share we grew on CAD/CAM, because of the reduced sales with tax incentives, I don't know if it's really indicative. But while saying that, we still had something in the high teens sales growth in CAD/CAM in North America. So we still have very strong growth. Maybe probably it would have been a lot stronger if the tax incentives were available, but they just weren't. With respect to the second part of your question, if nothing changes from where we are, we'll kind of have a normal year, I believe, for equipment because we did not get pulled forward in 2014 -- in Q4 2014 from 2015. And if nothing changes, the tax incentives aren't increased, we probably won't get much pull forward at the end of 2015, pulling forward from 2016. So would be kind of a normal year, which would be good, I think. We're still hopeful, and I think there's still possibilities that the tax incentives could be reinstated at some point. But right now, we have to go with whatever the tax laws that exist. And it's only for the first $25,000 of capital expenditures, which is a relatively small amount. As you know, CAD/CAM is over $100,000. A lot of other equipment is expensive. So without that tax incentive, it doesn't give people the incentive to buy now, and they'll still buy, but they'll buy in due course rather than trying to accelerate it. So hopefully that answers your question."

The global markets we serve remain generally healthy highlighted by of course continued strong patient traffic in North America, and we are particularly pleased with the solid internal sales growth in local currencies in our international businesses, too. 
We achieved adjusted EPS growth for the year of 10%, and are affirming our guidance range for 2015 diluted EPS. I'm also pleased to mention that in 2014, for the first time, Henry Schein exceeded the $10 billion sales mark on an annual basis. 
In a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our performance along with a review of some of our key accomplishments during 2014. Needless to say, we completed our 3-year strategic plan for the period 2012 to '14 and did very well from our point of view on, of course, planning and executing on that plan.

I am also pleased to report strong results for the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as the full year. If you look at our Q4 results, our net sales for the quarter ended December 27, 2014, were $2.7 billion,",1532,"Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I am also pleased to report strong results for the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as the full year. 
If you look at our Q4 results, our net sales for the quarter ended December 27, 2014, were $2.7 billion, reflecting a 7.0% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. This consisted of 9.9% growth in local currencies and 2.9% decline related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 4.90%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 5.0%. You can see additional details of our sales growth in Exhibit A of our earnings news release that was issued this morning. 
Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was 7.5% and expanded by 11 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of last year. And even if you exclude the impact of acquisitions completed during the past 12 months, our margin also expanded by 6 basis points compared with last year's fourth quarter. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.7% and this compares with 29.8% in the fourth quarter of 2013. The slightly lower tax rate is due to implementation of ongoing tax planning strategies as well as higher earnings in countries with lower corporate income tax rates. Going forward for 2015, we believe our effective tax rate will continue at a similar rate and be in the 30% range. 
Our net income attributable to Henry Schein for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $133 million or $1.56 per diluted share. This represents growth of 7.0% and 9.1%, respectively, compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. 
I think it's important to note that foreign currency exchange had a negative impact of approximately $0.04 on the current quarter's EPS for the quarter. So a $0.04 negative impact is included in our numbers. 
Looking to the results for the full year. There are a number of highlights. Sales increased 8.5%, exceeding $10 billion for the first time as Stan just mentioned. Our cash flow was very strong at $593 million and exceeded net income by over $126 million. Diluted EPS increased almost 10% at 9.9% to $5.44, and that's -- the increase is after adjusting non-GAAP items in the prior year. And we believe, overall, 2014 was an excellent year from a financial perspective. 
You can see a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS in Exhibit D of our news release. 
If you look at some additional detail on our sales results for the quarter. Dental sales for the quarter -- for the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 3.9% to $1.4 billion. This 3.9% growth consisted of 7.5% growth in local currencies and a 3.6% decline related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 2.3%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 5.2% primarily related to the acquisitions of BioHorizons and Arseus. 
If we look at the 2.3% internal growth in local currencies, the components are 1.9% in the North American market and 2.9% in the international market. If we look at the components within each of North America and international, the 1.9% internal growth in constant currencies in North America included very strong growth in Dental consumable merchandise of 4.9% and a decline in Dental equipment sales and service revenue of 4.7%. 
We believe that the equipment sales declined in North America substantially due to this late reinstatement of tax incentives for the U.S. market in 2004 (sic) [ 2014 ]. These tax incentives were reduced to $25,000 at the end of 2013 and were not returned to the previous level of $500,000 until December 19, 2014, and we believe it was really too late for our customers really to take advantage of that increased benefit in the fourth quarter to impact sales growth. If you look at the 2.9% growth in the international market, we had 3.1% growth in consumable merchandise and 2.6% growth in equipment sales and service revenue. 
Turning to Animal Health. Our sales were $731.6 million in the quarter, an increase of 12.3%, which included growth in local currencies of 15.9%, offset by a decline again in foreign currency by -- of 3.6%. 
The internal sales in local currencies grew 7.8%, while acquisitions contributed an additional 8.1%. That 7.8% internal growth in constant currencies included 6.9% growth in North America and 8.6% growth in our International Animal Health sales. If you normalize our North American Animal Health sales, the impact of certain products that switched from agency sales to standard sales, North American internal sales growth was a little bit less at 5.9%. 
Turning to Medical. Our Medical sales were $461.7  million for the quarter, an increase of 9.4%. That 9.4% consisted of local currency growth of 9.9%, offset by foreign exchange currency declines of 0.5%. And the internal sales in local currencies was 9.4% and 0.5% related to acquisitions. That 9.4% growth consisted of 9.5% slightly higher in North America, and that was led by up-market and mid-market customers and growth also strong in international of 8.4%. 
During the quarter, we sold seasonal influenza vaccines at the rate of $26 million for the quarter, and that's up slightly from the $23.8 million in last year's quarter. 
I'll also point out that our fourth quarter results include about 1.5 months of agency revenue resulting from the strategic agreement with Cardinal Health, and Stanley will discuss a little more details on this agreement later on in the call. We remain confident that our strategy of focusing on large group practices and IDNs resulted in continued market share gains. 
Technology and Value-Added Service sales were $91.3 million in the quarter, an increase of 3.3%, and that includes 4.4% growth in local currencies offset by 1.1% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, the internally generated sales growth was 1.5%, and acquisition growth was an additional 2.9%. That 1.5% growth was a slight decline in North America of 0.7% and 15% growth international. But remember, in the North American market, we also have a shift in sales from standard sales to agency sales. And if you adjust for that and normalize for that, our internal growth in local currencies were 6% and included 4.6% growth in North America. 
This will be the last quarter for this normalizing adjustment in technology since that shift has now annualized. 
We continue to repurchase common stock in the open market during the quarter. Specifically, we repurchased 595,000 shares at an average price of $124 per share, approximately $74 million. The impact of these repurchases in the fourth quarter was not material to our EPS. And looking forward, we still have $300 million available for 2015 repurchases. And for 2014, we did achieve our stated goal of repurchasing about $300 million for the year. 
If you look at our balance sheet and cash flow, we had strong operating cash flow for the quarter, $274 million, which is substantially the same as the $274.6 million last year. Our operating cash flow for the year was $592.5 million, and free cash flow was $510.4 million. 
Again, we're pleased that we exceeded our goals related to cash flow and free cash flow for the year. 
Looking at accounts receivable days outstanding, really not much change here. We improved a little bit from 40 days last year to 39.9 days, and inventory turns were pretty much consistent at 5.9 turns this year versus 6.2 turns last year. 
Let me conclude my remarks by affirming our 2015 financial guidance as follows: for 2015, we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be in the range of $5.90 to $6. That represents growth of 8% to 10% compared to our 2014 actual results. 
The U.S. dollar, as I think everyone knows, has strengthened. And assuming it stays at its current level, we would expect adjusted EPS to be toward the low end of the range for the year. Keep in mind that approximately 35% of our sales are based in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and primarily the euro is our largest currency, and we do not hedge against the translation exposure for foreign exchange. 
I think it's also important to point out that we expect adjusted EPS growth to accelerate during the year. This is typical for us as we typically make investments at the beginning of the year that will pay off later in the year. And this acceleration reflects continued leveraging of our infrastructure and controlling of expenses as well as realizing efficiencies from recently acquired acquisitions. 
The 2015 guidance excludes restructuring costs related to a planned corporate initiative to rationalize some of the company's operations and provide significant expense efficiencies. We believe it's important to reduce our cost structure so we can invest further in new initiatives to drive future long-term growth. This initiative is expected to continue throughout 2015, and the costs are estimated at between $35 million and $40 million pretax or $0.29 to $0.33 per diluted share. As always, our guidance is for continuing operations as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of any future acquisitions. 
Let me now turn the call back to Stan."

So let's begin a discussion on our 4 business groups with Dental. In North America, internal consumable merchandise sales growth in local currencies remained strong at nearly 5%. Equipment sales and service revenue, as Steven",2754,"Thank you very much, Steven. So let's begin a discussion on our 4 business groups with Dental. In North America, internal consumable merchandise sales growth in local currencies remained strong at nearly 5%. Equipment sales and service revenue, as Steven noted, declined in North America due to the issues surrounding the timing of tax incentives in 2014 that Steve mentioned. 
We, of course, had a lot of purchases in the fourth quarter of 2013 that were driven by the large amount of accelerated depreciation that was available to customers. And of course, advising customers on December 19 that, that was now available for the window of 10 days or so was just not practical to have -- and had no real impact. 
Our international Dental growth was solid for both consumable and merchandise -- consumable merchandise and for the equipment side with internal growth bolstered by strategic acquisitions made earlier in the year, especially on the Dental equipment side. 
In early January, we announced that during the year's second quarter, we will be expanding our Dental equipment product offering in North America by adding the entire line of A-dec equipment. Our commitment to our Dental customers has always been to provide the widest possible selection of products, equipment and Value-Added Services to create customized solutions that meet our customers' needs. 
Products from A-dec along with those from our other valued equipment supplier partners further this commitment by providing greater access to the broadest range of Dental equipment from industry leaders. Let me just confirm that we will only be adding the A-dec line around the middle of the second quarter. 
We also recently announced the acquisition of ADS Florida, which is one of the largest dental practice transition and brokerage companies serving the state of Florida. Although this transaction represents only a few million dollars in revenue, it is very important, strategically, for several reasons. It expands the geographic reach of our practice transitions offering to dental practice owners looking to buy or sell their practices and build upon -- and builds upon last year's acquisition of the Maddox practice group in California. This transaction also adds to our practice transitions footprint a large market where the dental industry is flourishing and incorporates ADS into the professional practice transitions group of Henry Schein Financial Services. 
Our goal is not only to provide national coverage on brokerage services, which I think we, by and large, have, but to add depth in key markets around the country. And although these acquisitions are not huge from a capital commitment point of view, they are adding strategic importance to the Henry Schein Value-Added Service offering such that we can now help put a practitioner into practice, and when the practitioner is ready to sell the practice, help the practitioner exit. 
So overall, on the animal -- on the Dental side, we are comfortable, more than comfortable, actually quite happy with the progress we've made. We have an outstanding management team across the board. We've added to that. We've added young people to the team as well, and we believe that we are on solid footing to execute on our major strategies there, ranging from advancing our specialty business to our Practice Management Software business, and of course most importantly, to advancing the digitalization of prosthetics on a global basis. So overall, happy with the Animal Health -- with the Dental business. 
Now let me turn to the Animal Health business for a few minutes with sales growth in the fourth quarter featured double-digit gains in local currencies in North America and international. With international, internal sales growth in local currency is at a multiyear high. 
Internationally, we saw particular strength in the U.K. as well as Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium. We currently -- we recently expanded our Animal Health equipment capabilities with addition -- with additional capabilities and capacities and particularly through the recent announced acquisition of scil animal care. Scil will bring to Henry Schein a new Value-Added Services offering while deepening our relationship with vet new practices in a technical -- from a technical point of view in equipment area, specifically, and of course, the software area, too, building on our installed base of Practice Management software, which we believe is the largest installed base of its kind. The scil animal health professionals will enhance the equipment sales and support capabilities of our Animal Health business, representing our key supplier partners and introducing veterinarians to important diagnostic options. 
We believe strongly that diagnostics are critical elements to help veterinarians provide high-quality care and increase practice revenue. We furthermore believe this will significantly -- that scil will significantly expand our diagnostic products category. Not only do we have a very good offering of diagnostic equipment, but it's Value-Added Services and the connection between the Value-Added Services and our Practice Management Software and electronic medical records that is so important. And scil will add a very, very important element to connecting the hardware and the software and enable us to gain market share for our Animal Health diagnostics partners, which, of course, include amongst others, Abaxis, Heska, but there are others as well, but these are the cornerstones in our mold. And of course, the scil software and the professionals' knowledge will tighten the ability of Abaxis, Heska and others to work with Henry Schein. 
We are pleased with our progress to-date in representing the product lines from both of these companies. Let me remind our investors that we really only added these lines towards the end of the fourth quarter and are now up and running with our suppliers in the diagnostic space. Scil hasn't closed yet, but it will close soon, and we will -- once this is done, we will really have very good momentum in the equipment and diagnostic space as well as the software space. 
Scil is based in Germany, sells services and supports laboratories in imaging diagnostic products and services to veterinarians, of course, in Germany, but in the United States, in Canada, France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, with a distribution presence in 25 additional countries. With scil, we are adding Canada and Italy to the list of countries where Henry Schein Animal Health serves veterinarians. We also are gaining more than 200 employees, including 32 veterinarians. And I would like to stress this, 32 veterinarians, of course, 26 equipment specialists and more than 70 sales representatives. Scil had sales for the 12 months ended September 30, 2014, of approximately $70 million. We do expect this transaction to close in the second quarter of 2015, of course, subject to standard regulatory approval, but we don't expect any real concerns over here. 
The sales are not hugely material from a Henry Schein corporate point of view, but the knowhow knowledge of the scil group, together with the knowhow knowledge of the Henry Schein group, not only in the Animal Health space, but generally in the equipment space, in medical, and of course, Dental, will put us in an excellent position to advance our sales in this regard. 
At the 2015 North America Veterinary Conference in late January, we showcased the choices we offer veterinarians in diagnostics from software to equipment to business solutions. We introduced a new software product called Axis-Q, a bio-directional -- important, bio-directional integrated solution that improves workflow and reduces missed patient charges. Axis-Q operates between the Practice Management Software, such as our important -- such as the important offer -- such as from the important offering of software that we offer, such as AVImark, Infinity and Triple Crown; and the clinics, Abaxis and Heska diagnostic equipment. 
Axis-Q automates the workflow of diagnostic tests, so the clinician does not have to manually input codes, and it automatically returns the results to their electronic medical records. Feedback from the show was very positive. We worked on the system rather rapidly, and you can expect a lot more features and functions to be unfolded in the near future. 
We are committed to the Practice Management arena in Animal Health as in Dental. Software, electronic medical records, accounting systems are the cornerstone, but what differentiates Henry Schein in the dental space, the physician space, is the ability to offer a complete integrated system integrating key machinery, diagnostic, other equipment in the office and software in the office to our software. We will now further advance this in the Animal Health space as well. We expect to formally launch Axis-Q in the second quarter of 2015. 
Let me now turn to the Medical Group. Medical sales growth accelerated in the fourth quarter compared to the third, and while it's at a multiyear high as we made continued progress with large group practices and IDNs, the integrated delivery networks. This progress will be significantly enhanced under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health. The agreement is designed to provide one of the most comprehensive service and product offerings to office-based medical practitioners. 
As we announced in late November, the agreement combines Cardinal Health's product line and extensive touch points across the health-care system with our outstanding service capabilities and our history of servicing the office-based practice. And when we talk about the office-based practice, we're not talking only of the independents or the large group practices, but we're talking about the practices owned by IDNs. We have shown a track record now of being in a position to deliver outstanding service. 
Together with Cardinal, we believe we will deliver to our integrated network customers, the IDN customers, and individual physicians, small practices, multi-specialty, solo-specialty practices, vastly improved efficiency, a wider breadth of product, world-class service and a value for the ultimate benefit of the patient. 
In essence, there are 3 components in the new agreement. First, we acquired Cardinal's physician office-focused commercial organization, and we'll integrate it into Henry Schein's Medical business. This will add more than 25,000 physician office locations and more than $300 million in revenue to our Medical business and will be slightly accretive to 2015 earnings. 
Of course, the second component includes a multiyear supply agreement, where Henry Schein will purchase Cardinal-branded products and utilize Cardinal Health as a source for various other medical products. We view this as a real win-win relationship as we expect to have lower or comparable pricing on a wide range of products, and of course, Cardinal will also benefit from increasing their sales into the sector through our focused approach. 
And then there's a third component of the agreement. We are excited about providing a unique combined solution to integrated delivery networks. The timing is ideal as IDNs seek to improve the coordination of care, increase efficiency and drive consistency and standardization across their networks. Of note, more than half of the U.S. physician practicers interact with an IDN, and that percentage, of course, continues to increase. 
The cooperation to-date between Henry Schein and Cardinal Health has been excellent, and the teams are really off to a great start. We are working to transition customers and the sales team and expect to complete the integration of this business towards the end of the second quarter. At that time, we look forward to welcoming more than 200 Cardinal Health employees to Team Schein. We'll keep you apprised, of course, on the progress of this strategic alliance on future calls. 
So I think you get a sense for how much progress we've made in our 3 verticals: Dental, Medical, Animal Health. This progress was really all charted out in our strategic plan -- the last few strategic plans, but I believe we've made terrific progress in the 2012 to '14 plan, along -- to advance the needs and the market share and the profitability of these 3 global verticals. 
As investors are aware, we have a horizontal as well, and that's in the Technology and Value-Added Services arena, where we are also delighted to report that our internal -- international Technology and Value-Added Services sales growth in local currencies grew by double digits for the eighth consecutive quarter. 
The growth rate more than doubled when including the impact of strategic acquisitions. Of course, this is a business that has some good sales, but more importantly, good profits. But what is more important here is the stickiness and the value-added service that we provide to our customers, such that it keeps our customers bound to us when they view us versus our competition. And the options are driven -- the answers to that, the options are driven towards us as people understand -- as our customers understand our value-added services and specifically around the Technology and Value-Added Services group. 
We believe that equipment financing as well as lower software sales in North America were both negatively impacted by the late reinstatement of tax incentives in the U.S. Having said that, our reoccurring revenue continues to grow, and this is a great, great business for us. 
So before taking questions, Steven and I, I'd like to reflect back a moment on a few highlights of the year from an overall point of view. We are extremely pleased to have met and even exceeded many significant goals while advancing our strategic plan. We reported diluted earnings per share for the year of $5.44, which exceeded the top of our EPS guidance range established in November of 2013 by $0.05 per diluted share. We achieved operating cash flow of close to $600 million and free cash flow of over $500 million, both well in excess of net income. 
So it's not only good enough to have good earnings per share on an accrual basis, but it is important to turn that accrual-based earnings into cash flow, which we have done now for several years. We also repurchased about $300 million in stock, which is in line with our standard annual goal, and we also entered 3 new geographies during this period, 3 critical markets: Japan, Brazil and Poland. That was on the heels of entering the South African market just before the year -- just before the beginning of the year. 
We became a significant participant in the U.S. equine market via an acquisition and enhanced our domestic group via the strategic transaction with Cardinal as we discussed. 
We strengthened our corporate governance with 2 appointments of outstanding Board of Directors members, Dr. Dianne Rekow, the Dean of King's College, and formerly of NYU, as a materials expert and an orthodontic expert; and Dr. Larry Bacow, former President of Tufts University, who is also serves -- who also serves on several other boards, and these are just simply outstanding directors. 
Our commitment to advancing technology and, of course, the digital dental office was evidenced by opening our new headquarters for our domestic Dental Practice Solutions business and hosting the first international symposium for dental -- on digital dentistry. 
Our -- we are, of course, undertaking similar activities in Europe, invested in a terrific new facility in the U.K. with similar kinds of capabilities to the one we now have in Utah. 
And lastly, we received a number of awards and recognitions, including being named to Fortune Magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies, being named among the year's most ethical companies by Ethisphere Institute, and climbing a few notches of the Fortune 500 list of America's largest companies. 
During the last quarter call, I discussed some of the key pillars of our 2015 to '17 strategic plan. These most recent accomplishments from 2014 were an excellent foundation for us to go into the 2015 plans. We have our priorities lined up as we always do. We will focus on them, but we will remain nimble enough to take advantage of additional opportunities that come our way. But we -- as we have been for years, actually the foundation of the companies and our history is to be a very focused company. We know what we have to do over the next 3 years, particularly, as it relates to new product categories, more product exclusives, new geographies, enhanced margins, of course, very important, new clients, specialty customers, new technology solutions. And above all, in 2015, it's about human capital, talent, investment, management and you can be sure that Team Schein is focused on this great succession at all levels of the company. 
So with that overview of our quarterly financial and operating performance and summary of the year, I'd like to thank you for your attention this morning. To those that are investors, thank you for your confidence, and we're open for questions."

On the first part of your question, I don't know if I want to give a specific number because it's really difficult to quantify what customers would have bought because of tax incentives that ultimately didn't buy, but we certainly believe we would have had good growth. If I peel the onion on the equipment categories in North America, I think it's important to note that our CAD/CAM sales growth was strong. Traditional equipment was down a little bit but not as much as the overall category. And really, I think people on some of the discretionary digital solutions, that's really where we saw people hold back. In my opinion, a lot of that really is timing that people would have accelerated their purchases in Q4 they'll ultimately buy sometime in 2015, not necessarily in Q1 but sometime in 2015. Right now, the tax incentives, the way that U.S. government did it, they reinstated them December 19, but they re-expired on January 1, 2015. So no one knows whether they'll reinstate them again and at what time, but right now, the tax incentives are only at the $25,000 level. The second part of your question really -- again, I gave color on the components. I'm not sure there's a lot more to add there other than, again, we feel like with the addition of additional equipment lines, including A-dec, we feel like we're going to have a good equipment year in 2015. And I think most people realize that the consumable sales growth, which was strong, just under 5%, really is a better indicator of how the market is doing than this one quarter of equipment sales."

That's somewhere a couple of pennies or so of accretion for 2015. Remember, that's net of all integration costs and onetime costs, so -- and we're not expecting to complete the integration until Q2. So really, in Q1, there's really mostly expenses and not a lot of benefit. So it is slightly accretive, but we do expect increased accretion, and really, we're being very conservative on the potential for procurement and buying at better prices because we really don't know the impact of that yet. So that could be an additional upside. On certain products, obviously, we would think that Cardinal Health buys at better prices than we could do on our own, especially on the pharma side. So hopefully, that will be a benefit, but it's too early really to quantify what that benefit will be."

So because, right now, Cardinal is continuing to service customers, they are taking orders, they are shipping, they're billing, they're collecting, they're really doing all of the functions until integration. U.S. GAAP doesn't allow us to record that revenue gross with all of the expenses. So we get a fee based on sales from Cardinal, which is designed to represent the estimated profitability of those sales that they're collecting on our behalf. And that number is what we included in the acquisition growth. So the organic growth does not include any impact from the Cardinal agency fee that we're receiving. Once integrated, so sometime during Q2 is the plan, we'll shift over to having those sales fulfilled through our distribution network, and we'll be taking the orders and doing all of the traditional distribution work. And at that time, we'll record the gross revenues again, which should be north of $300 million on a full year basis going forward."

Our pipeline on acquisitions is as full as ever. Wish we could close all the deals in the pipeline. It's not a matter of capital, it's a matter of capacity because integrations are something that goes along with every acquisition. So we don't have an issue finding acquisitions. I think we will have no issue in putting the capital to work that we've outlined, I think something like somewhere between 45% and 50% of our cash flow will go into acquisitions. We will continue with our formula of accretive acquisitions. And in fact, I think we are in a better position today to make acquisitions than ever before. Our track record is outstanding for keeping management where we make commitments upfront. Our suppliers are generally supportive of us because they've seen us enter markets and not disrupt markets but, in fact, add to the distribution capability and the Value-Added Services in the market, which generally gets better after we enter from a competitive landscape point of view. So I don't think there is any issue from that point of view. We have no problem in keeping the pipeline full. We will expand our geographic presence in our Dental and our Animal Health business. We will probably do that in Medical again at some point when we want to get the Cardinal integration behind us. It's a big opportunity. We have the right to sell the Cardinal products abroad, and we will do that. And I think you will see us adding much more in the Value-Added Service area, continues to be important to us across the board in all countries. And of course, the specialty area, there's lots and lots of opportunity. Meanwhile, we've become an important player in the specialty-only products. We're always an important player in selling general products, equipment consumables to specialists, but it was the specialty products, the implants, the bone regeneration, the wires and brackets and related products, and the endodontic-type specific products we're doing well growing that throughout the world inorganically, and of course, organically. So I don't think we'll have any issue in continuing to expand, and I don't think we'll be paying $0.01 more than we used to pay. We have a very good reputation in this area and are very good at integrating businesses once we acquire them."

It is clear that Asia and the developing world are growing at a much faster rate than the developed world and certainly faster than Europe. So -- and that there's a big market. There's at least 1/3 of the world's Dental business that's available in these developing world markets/Asia, and of course, Japan is not a developing -- Korea is now a developing world country. So we continue to expect to increase our presence. Having said that, at the moment, it's relatively small. And the entry to the Japanese market, for example, is not a consolidated entry acquisition, nor is the one in Brazil, nor is the one in South Africa. We are doing well in all of these businesses, but they're not material. China, we are not material. We are growing, but it's not profitable. The others are all profitable. And Thailand is profitable, although it was an issue for a couple of quarters because of the coup, but I think it's quite balanced today. We think we're going to have -- at least from an economic point view, things are looking better. So overall, I think these markets are all markets that are growing faster, even if you take into account some of the losses in China where we have a team much bigger than we need, a much more sophisticated team, an outstanding team, actually. We believe we have the best professional team in China of anyone, really, in our space. So overall, I think you will see that, from a profitability point of view, it's pretty good. We're particularly pleased, by the way, with Brazil, where our growth is really fantastic, and South Africa, too. And so I would say that these are opportunities that are doing very well for us except for China, which is growing nicely on the top line but is, at this stage, still requiring quite a bit of an investment."

Our goal is to expand the A-dec business together with ours, but at the same time, not in any way distract from our loyal suppliers over the year. So we will go carefully, I think A-dec is aware of this, and we hope to add to the marketplace in general. The A-dec chairs are slightly more expensive than chairs that we have been offering to-date. Overall, we think we have an outstanding offering. A-dec adds to that, but we also believe that the offering we have from our existing suppliers is a good one. It's been an outstanding one. It's allowed us to become a very significant player in the equipment business. In fact, we believe we're the largest provider of equipment in the world, Dental equipment.

So when we issued guidance, and I'll just focus on the dollar to the euro, because that's our major currency, although there was a little bit of impact on some of the other currencies, too.

So assuming that the $1.13 stays for the entire year, which I'm not sure is a good or bad assumption, but we have to start with an assumption, that would have anywhere, versus our previous guidance, anywhere between an $0.08 to $0.10 EPS impact. And that's why on the conference call we said, while we're still comfortable with our range, we're really, at this point, saying the lower end of the range. There are a few offsets. Cardinal is a little bit of an offset to it. Actually, fuel prices are a little bit of an offset to it also but not significant. And again, we don't know which way fuel prices are going to go over the next 8 or 9 months. But I think we still feel like achieving our full year guidance is very doable. And obviously, if the dollar continues to strengthen, we'll look to see if we can continue to achieve the guidance by doing some other activities or not. But again, it's so hard to predict, and I really don't want to predict what I think the full year impact will be because I think it's too difficult. There are too many variables."

So I think -- and at the same time, if the euro stays low, our imports of products go down in price, not only in terms of products from Europe but also from Asia. So it's much too early, and I think Steven is correct to signal the lower end, but there's so many variables that could move in a positive direction as well. So -- but it's much too early to go much further than that."

Clearly, it was a distraction as it was for others in the marketplace. I don't know whether this quarter is indicative of the trends or not, but I will tell you that our Animal Health business is solid. We will do well in the diagnostic field. I'm quite convinced about that. We've had this type of issue so many times in our history, and we've always come out in the end quite strong. In fact, it's a welcome wake-up call because I think you'll see us investing much heavier in our software businesses, and so we will move towards this bidirectional integration that improves the quality of our systems, the use of the system today [ph]. And I think, overall, in the end, Henry Schein will be a better investment for our shareholders from this point of view. So I will say that also, and I think you've seen this from others who've reported traffic into the Animal Health space is okay. It's a great market. We're seeing lots of capital coming into this market, and we remain very bullish. We've invested heavily from a management point of view in Europe, in Australia/New Zealand. Our CEO of Animal Health business in the U.S. retired. He's still a consultant for the company. We've replaced Kevin with an outstanding new president who's presiding over an outstanding team. So we remain extremely excited about the third leg to Henry Schein that we added really about 4 or 5 years ago in a material way. It's a great investment and you'll see us making more investments not only on expanding our distribution but in Value-Added Services and advancing unique products in this area, a great market. And I think we should have -- it's hard to give you precise numbers, but we should have a very good 2015 in the Animal Health space."

How are you tracking against that now 9 or 12 months later? And then, Steven, to an earlier question, I just want to make sure think about this correctly. If I estimate about a $40 million shortfall in North American Dental equipment because of the 179 delay, we should view that largely as a pickup from 4Q '14 to 4Q '15 as those accounts await sort of the reimplementation of 179 rather than trickling in throughout 2015?"

Q4, I think, when you look at how much market share we grew on CAD/CAM because of the reduced sales with tax incentives, I don't know if it's really indicative. But while saying that, we still had something in the high teens sales growth in CAD/CAM in North America. So we still had very strong growth. Maybe probably it would have been a lot stronger if the tax incentives were available, but they just weren't. With respect to the second part of your question, if nothing changes from where we are, we'll kind of have a normal year, I believe, for equipment because we did not get pull forward in 2014 -- in Q4 2014 from 2015. And if nothing changes, the tax incentives aren't increased, we probably won't get much pull forward at the end of 2015 pulling forward from 2016, so will be kind of a normal year, which would be good, I think. We're still hopeful, and I think there's still possibilities that the tax incentives could be reinstated at some point. But right now, we have to go with whatever the tax laws that exist. And it's only for the first $25,000 of capital expenditures, which is a relatively small amount. As you know, CAD/CAM is over $100,000. A lot of other equipment is expensive. So without that tax incentive, it doesn't give people the incentive to buy now, and they'll still buy, but they'll buy in due course rather than trying to accelerate it. So hopefully that answers your question."

The global markets we serve remain generally healthy highlighted by of course continued strong patient traffic in North America, and we are particularly pleased with the solid internal sales growth in local currencies in our international businesses, too. 
We achieved adjusted EPS growth for the year of 10%, and are affirming our guidance range for 2015 diluted EPS. I'm also pleased to mention that in 2014, for the first time, Henry Schein exceeded the $10 billion sales mark on an annual basis. 
In a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our performance along with a review of some of our key accomplishments during 2014.

I am also pleased to report strong results for the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as the full year. If you look at our Q4 results, our net sales for the quarter ended December 27, 2014, were $2.7 billion,",1532,"Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I am also pleased to report strong results for the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as the full year. 
If you look at our Q4 results, our net sales for the quarter ended December 27, 2014, were $2.7 billion, reflecting a 7.0% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. This consisted of 9.9% growth in local currencies and 2.9% decline related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 4.90%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 5.0%. You can see additional details of our sales growth in Exhibit A of our earnings news release that was issued this morning. 
Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was 7.5% and expanded by 11 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of last year. And even if you exclude the impact of acquisitions completed during the past 12 months, our margin also expanded by 6 basis points compared with last year's fourth quarter. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.7% and this compares with 29.8% in the fourth quarter of 2013. The slightly lower tax rate is due to implementation of ongoing tax planning strategies as well as higher earnings in countries with lower corporate income tax rates. Going forward for 2015, we believe our effective tax rate will continue at a similar rate and be in the 30% range. 
Our net income attributable to Henry Schein for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $133 million or $1.56 per diluted share. This represents growth of 7.0% and 9.1%, respectively, compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. 
I think it's important to note that foreign currency exchange had a negative impact of approximately $0.04 on the current quarter's EPS for the quarter. So a $0.04 negative impact is included in our numbers. 
Looking to the results for the full year. There are a number of highlights. Sales increased 8.5%, exceeding $10 billion for the first time as Stan just mentioned. Our cash flow was very strong at $593 million and exceeded net income by over $126 million. Diluted EPS increased almost 10% at 9.9% to $5.44, and that's -- the increase is after adjusting non-GAAP items in the prior year. And we believe, overall, 2014 was an excellent year from a financial perspective. 
You can see a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS in Exhibit D of our news release. 
If you look at some additional detail on our sales results for the quarter. Dental sales for the quarter -- for the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 3.9% to $1.4 billion. This 3.9% growth consisted of 7.5% growth in local currencies and a 3.6% decline related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 2.3%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 5.2% primarily related to the acquisitions of BioHorizons and Arseus. 
If we look at the 2.3% internal growth in local currencies, the components are 1.9% in the North American market and 2.9% in the international market. If we look at the components within each of North America and international, the 1.9% internal growth in constant currencies in North America included very strong growth in Dental consumable merchandise of 4.9% and a decline in Dental equipment sales and service revenue of 4.7%. 
We believe that the equipment sales declined in North America substantially due to this late reinstatement of tax incentives for the U.S. market in 2004 (sic) [ 2014 ]. These tax incentives were reduced to $25,000 at the end of 2013 and were not returned to the previous level of $500,000 until December 19, 2014, and we believe it was really too late for our customers really to take advantage of that increased benefit in the fourth quarter to impact sales growth. If you look at the 2.9% growth in the international market, we had 3.1% growth in consumable merchandise and 2.6% growth in equipment sales and service revenue. 
Turning to Animal Health. Our sales were $731.6 million in the quarter, an increase of 12.3%, which included growth in local currencies of 15.9%, offset by a decline again in foreign currency by -- of 3.6%. 
The internal sales in local currencies grew 7.8%, while acquisitions contributed an additional 8.1%. That 7.8% internal growth in constant currencies included 6.9% growth in North America and 8.6% growth in our International Animal Health sales. If you normalize our North American Animal Health sales, the impact of certain products that switched from agency sales to standard sales, North American internal sales growth was a little bit less at 5.9%. 
Turning to Medical. Our Medical sales were $461.7 million for the quarter, an increase of 9.4%. That 9.4% consisted of local currency growth of 9.9%, offset by foreign exchange currency declines of 0.5%. And the internal sales in local currencies was 9.4% and 0.5% related to acquisitions. That 9.4% growth consisted of 9.5% slightly higher in North America, and that was led by up-market and mid-market customers and growth also strong in international of 8.4%. 
During the quarter, we sold seasonal influenza vaccines at the rate of $26 million for the quarter, and that's up slightly from the $23.8 million in last year's quarter. 
I'll also point out that our fourth quarter results include about 1.5 months of agency revenue resulting from the strategic agreement with Cardinal Health, and Stanley will discuss a little more details on this agreement later on in the call. We remain confident that our strategy of focusing on large group practices and IDNs resulted in continued market share gains. 
Technology and Value-Added Service sales were $91.3 million in the quarter, an increase of 3.3%, and that includes 4.4% growth in local currencies offset by 1.1% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, the internally generated sales growth was 1.5%, and acquisition growth was an additional 2.9%. That 1.5% growth was a slight decline in North America of 0.7% and 15% growth international. But remember, in the North American market, we also have a shift in sales from standard sales to agency sales. And if you adjust for that and normalize for that, our internal growth in local currencies were 6% and included 4.6% growth in North America. 
This will be the last quarter for this normalizing adjustment in technology since that shift has now annualized. 
We continue to repurchase common stock in the open market during the quarter. Specifically, we repurchased 595,000 shares at an average price of $124 per share, approximately $74 million. The impact of these repurchases in the fourth quarter was not material to our EPS. And looking forward, we still have $300 million available for 2015 repurchases. And for 2014, we did achieve our stated goal of repurchasing about $300 million for the year. 
If you look at our balance sheet and cash flow, we had strong operating cash flow for the quarter, $274 million, which is substantially the same as the $274.6 million last year. Our operating cash flow for the year was $592.5 million, and free cash flow was $510.4 million. 
Again, we're pleased that we exceeded our goals related to cash flow and free cash flow for the year. 
Looking at accounts receivable days outstanding, really not much change here. We improved a little bit from 40 days last year to 39.9 days, and inventory turns were pretty much consistent at 5.9 turns this year versus 6.2 turns last year. 
Let me conclude my remarks by affirming our 2015 financial guidance as follows: for 2015, we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be in the range of $5.90 to $6. That represents growth of 8% to 10% compared to our 2014 actual results. 
The U.S. dollar, as I think everyone knows, has strengthened. And assuming it stays at its current level, we would expect adjusted EPS to be toward the low end of the range for the year. Keep in mind that approximately 35% of our sales are based in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and primarily the euro is our largest currency, and we do not hedge against the translation exposure for foreign exchange. 
I think it's also important to point out that we expect adjusted EPS growth to accelerate during the year. This is typical for us as we typically make investments at the beginning of the year that will pay off later in the year. And this acceleration reflects continued leveraging of our infrastructure and controlling of expenses as well as realizing efficiencies from recently acquired acquisitions. 
The 2015 guidance excludes restructuring costs related to a planned corporate initiative to rationalize some of the company's operations and provide significant expense efficiencies. We believe it's important to reduce our cost structure so we can invest further in new initiatives to drive future long-term growth. This initiative is expected to continue throughout 2015, and the costs are estimated at between $35 million and $40 million pretax or $0.29 to $0.33 per diluted share. As always, our guidance is for continuing operations as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of any future acquisitions. 
Let me now turn the call back to Stan."
339447,283117142,760667,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, Steven. So let's begin a discussion on our 4 business groups with Dental. In North America, internal consumable merchandise sales growth in local currencies remained strong at nearly 5%. Equipment sales and service revenue, as Steven",2754,"Thank you very much, Steven. So let's begin a discussion on our 4 business groups with Dental. In North America, internal consumable merchandise sales growth in local currencies remained strong at nearly 5%. Equipment sales and service revenue, as Steven noted, declined in North America due to the issues surrounding the timing of tax incentives in 2014 that Steve mentioned. 
We, of course, had a lot of purchases in the fourth quarter of 2013 that were driven by the large amount of accelerated depreciation that was available to customers. And of course, advising customers on December 19 that, that was now available for the window of 10 days or so was just not practical to have -- and had no real impact. 
Our international Dental growth was solid for both consumable and merchandise -- consumable merchandise and for the equipment side with internal growth bolstered by strategic acquisitions made earlier in the year, especially on the Dental equipment side. 
In early January, we announced that during the year's second quarter, we will be expanding our Dental equipment product offering in North America by adding the entire line of A-dec equipment. Our commitment to our Dental customers has always been to provide the widest possible selection of products, equipment and Value-Added Services to create customized solutions that meet our customers' needs. 
Products from A-dec along with those from our other valued equipment supplier partners further this commitment by providing greater access to the broadest range of Dental equipment from industry leaders. Let me just confirm that we will only be adding the A-dec line around the middle of the second quarter. 
We also recently announced the acquisition of ADS Florida, which is one of the largest dental practice transition and brokerage companies serving the state of Florida. Although this transaction represents only a few million dollars in revenue, it is very important, strategically, for several reasons. It expands the geographic reach of our practice transitions offering to dental practice owners looking to buy or sell their practices and build upon -- and builds upon last year's acquisition of the Maddox practice group in California. This transaction also adds to our practice transitions footprint a large market where the dental industry is flourishing and incorporates ADS into the professional practice transitions group of Henry Schein Financial Services. 
Our goal is not only to provide national coverage on brokerage services, which I think we, by and large, have, but to add depth in key markets around the country. And although these acquisitions are not huge from a capital commitment point of view, they are adding strategic importance to the Henry Schein Value-Added Service offering such that we can now help put a practitioner into practice, and when the practitioner is ready to sell the practice, help the practitioner exit. 
So overall, on the animal -- on the Dental side, we are comfortable, more than comfortable, actually quite happy with the progress we've made. We have an outstanding management team across the board. We've added to that. We've added young people to the team as well, and we believe that we are on solid footing to execute on our major strategies there, ranging from advancing our specialty business to our Practice Management Software business, and of course most importantly, to advancing the digitalization of prosthetics on a global basis. So overall, happy with the Animal Health -- with the Dental business. 
Now let me turn to the Animal Health business for a few minutes with sales growth in the fourth quarter featured double-digit gains in local currencies in North America and international. With international, internal sales growth in local currency is at a multiyear high. 
Internationally, we saw particular strength in the U.K. as well as Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium. We currently -- we recently expanded our Animal Health equipment capabilities with addition -- with additional capabilities and capacities and particularly through the recent announced acquisition of scil animal care. Scil will bring to Henry Schein a new Value-Added Services offering while deepening our relationship with vet new practices in a technical -- from a technical point of view in equipment area, specifically, and of course, the software area, too, building on our installed base of Practice Management software, which we believe is the largest installed base of its kind. The scil animal health professionals will enhance the equipment sales and support capabilities of our Animal Health business, representing our key supplier partners and introducing veterinarians to important diagnostic options. 
We believe strongly that diagnostics are critical elements to help veterinarians provide high-quality care and increase practice revenue. We furthermore believe this will significantly -- that scil will significantly expand our diagnostic products category. Not only do we have a very good offering of diagnostic equipment, but it's Value-Added Services and the connection between the Value-Added Services and our Practice Management Software and electronic medical records that is so important. And scil will add a very, very important element to connecting the hardware and the software and enable us to gain market share for our Animal Health diagnostics partners, which, of course, include amongst others, Abaxis, Heska, but there are others as well, but these are the cornerstones in our mold. And of course, the scil software and the professionals' knowledge will tighten the ability of Abaxis, Heska and others to work with Henry Schein. 
We are pleased with our progress to-date in representing the product lines from both of these companies. Let me remind our investors that we really only added these lines towards the end of the fourth quarter and are now up and running with our suppliers in the diagnostic space. Scil hasn't closed yet, but it will close soon, and we will -- once this is done, we will really have very good momentum in the equipment and diagnostic space as well as the software space. 
Scil is based in Germany, sells services and supports laboratories in imaging diagnostic products and services to veterinarians, of course, in Germany, but in the United States, in Canada, France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, with a distribution presence in 25 additional countries. With scil, we are adding Canada and Italy to the list of countries where Henry Schein Animal Health serves veterinarians. We also are gaining more than 200 employees, including 32 veterinarians. And I would like to stress this, 32 veterinarians, of course, 26 equipment specialists and more than 70 sales representatives. Scil had sales for the 12 months ended September 30, 2014, of approximately $70 million. We do expect this transaction to close in the second quarter of 2015, of course, subject to standard regulatory approval, but we don't expect any real concerns over here. 
The sales are not hugely material from a Henry Schein corporate point of view, but the knowhow knowledge of the scil group, together with the knowhow knowledge of the Henry Schein group, not only in the Animal Health space, but generally in the equipment space, in medical, and of course, Dental, will put us in an excellent position to advance our sales in this regard. 
At the 2015 North America Veterinary Conference in late January, we showcased the choices we offer veterinarians in diagnostics from software to equipment to business solutions. We introduced a new software product called Axis-Q, a bio-directional -- important, bio-directional integrated solution that improves workflow and reduces missed patient charges. Axis-Q operates between the Practice Management Software, such as our important -- such as the important offer -- such as from the important offering of software that we offer, such as AVImark, Infinity and Triple Crown; and the clinics, Abaxis and Heska diagnostic equipment. 
Axis-Q automates the workflow of diagnostic tests, so the clinician does not have to manually input codes, and it automatically returns the results to their electronic medical records. Feedback from the show was very positive. We worked on the system rather rapidly, and you can expect a lot more features and functions to be unfolded in the near future. 
We are committed to the Practice Management arena in Animal Health as in Dental. Software, electronic medical records, accounting systems are the cornerstone, but what differentiates Henry Schein in the dental space, the physician space, is the ability to offer a complete integrated system integrating key machinery, diagnostic, other equipment in the office and software in the office to our software. We will now further advance this in the Animal Health space as well. We expect to formally launch Axis-Q in the second quarter of 2015. 
Let me now turn to the Medical Group. Medical sales growth accelerated in the fourth quarter compared to the third, and while it's at a multiyear high as we made continued progress with large group practices and IDNs, the integrated delivery networks. This progress will be significantly enhanced under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health. The agreement is designed to provide one of the most comprehensive service and product offerings to office-based medical practitioners. 
As we announced in late November, the agreement combines Cardinal Health's product line and extensive touch points across the health-care system with our outstanding service capabilities and our history of servicing the office-based practice. And when we talk about the office-based practice, we're not talking only of the independents or the large group practices, but we're talking about the practices owned by IDNs. We have shown a track record now of being in a position to deliver outstanding service. 
Together with Cardinal, we believe we will deliver to our integrated network customers, the IDN customers, and individual physicians, small practices, multi-specialty, solo-specialty practices, vastly improved efficiency, a wider breadth of product, world-class service and a value for the ultimate benefit of the patient. 
In essence, there are 3 components in the new agreement. First, we acquired Cardinal's physician office-focused commercial organization, and we'll integrate it into Henry Schein's Medical business. This will add more than 25,000 physician office locations and more than $300 million in revenue to our Medical business and will be slightly accretive to 2015 earnings. 
Of course, the second component includes a multiyear supply agreement, where Henry Schein will purchase Cardinal-branded products and utilize Cardinal Health as a source for various other medical products. We view this as a real win-win relationship as we expect to have lower or comparable pricing on a wide range of products, and of course, Cardinal will also benefit from increasing their sales into the sector through our focused approach. 
And then there's a third component of the agreement. We are excited about providing a unique combined solution to integrated delivery networks. The timing is ideal as IDNs seek to improve the coordination of care, increase efficiency and drive consistency and standardization across their networks. Of note, more than half of the U.S. physician practicers interact with an IDN, and that percentage, of course, continues to increase. 
The cooperation to-date between Henry Schein and Cardinal Health has been excellent, and the teams are really off to a great start. We are working to transition customers and the sales team and expect to complete the integration of this business towards the end of the second quarter. At that time, we look forward to welcoming more than 200 Cardinal Health employees to Team Schein. We'll keep you apprised, of course, on the progress of this strategic alliance on future calls. 
So I think you get a sense for how much progress we've made in our 3 verticals: Dental, Medical, Animal Health. This progress was really all charted out in our strategic plan -- the last few strategic plans, but I believe we've made terrific progress in the 2012 to '14 plan, along -- to advance the needs and the market share and the profitability of these 3 global verticals. 
As investors are aware, we have a horizontal as well, and that's in the Technology and Value-Added Services arena, where we are also delighted to report that our internal -- international Technology and Value-Added Services sales growth in local currencies grew by double digits for the eighth consecutive quarter. 
The growth rate more than doubled when including the impact of strategic acquisitions. Of course, this is a business that has some good sales, but more importantly, good profits. But what is more important here is the stickiness and the value-added service that we provide to our customers, such that it keeps our customers bound to us when they view us versus our competition. And the options are driven -- the answers to that, the options are driven towards us as people understand -- as our customers understand our value-added services and specifically around the Technology and Value-Added Services group. 
We believe that equipment financing as well as lower software sales in North America were both negatively impacted by the late reinstatement of tax incentives in the U.S. Having said that, our reoccurring revenue continues to grow, and this is a great, great business for us. 
So before taking questions, Steven and I, I'd like to reflect back a moment on a few highlights of the year from an overall point of view. We are extremely pleased to have met and even exceeded many significant goals while advancing our strategic plan. We reported diluted earnings per share for the year of $5.44, which exceeded the top of our EPS guidance range established in November of 2013 by $0.05 per diluted share. We achieved operating cash flow of close to $600 million and free cash flow of over $500 million, both well in excess of net income. 
So it's not only good enough to have good earnings per share on an accrual basis, but it is important to turn that accrual-based earnings into cash flow, which we have done now for several years. We also repurchased about $300 million in stock, which is in line with our standard annual goal, and we also entered 3 new geographies during this period, 3 critical markets: Japan, Brazil and Poland. That was on the heels of entering the South African market just before the year -- just before the beginning of the year. 
We became a significant participant in the U.S. equine market via an acquisition and enhanced our domestic group via the strategic transaction with Cardinal as we discussed. 
We strengthened our corporate governance with 2 appointments of outstanding Board of Directors members, Dr. Dianne Rekow, the Dean of King's College, and formerly of NYU, as a materials expert and an orthodontic expert; and Dr. Larry Bacow, former President of Tufts University, who is also serves -- who also serves on several other boards, and these are just simply outstanding directors. 
Our commitment to advancing technology and, of course, the digital dental office was evidenced by opening our new headquarters for our domestic Dental Practice Solutions business and hosting the first international symposium for dental -- on digital dentistry. 
Our -- we are, of course, undertaking similar activities in Europe, invested in a terrific new facility in the U.K. with similar kinds of capabilities to the one we now have in Utah. 
And lastly, we received a number of awards and recognitions, including being named to Fortune Magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies, being named among the year's most ethical companies by Ethisphere Institute, and climbing a few notches of the Fortune 500 list of America's largest companies. 
During the last quarter call, I discussed some of the key pillars of our 2015 to '17 strategic plan. These most recent accomplishments from 2014 were an excellent foundation for us to go into the 2015 plans. We have our priorities lined up as we always do. We will focus on them, but we will remain nimble enough to take advantage of additional opportunities that come our way. But we -- as we have been for years, actually the foundation of the companies and our history is to be a very focused company. We know what we have to do over the next 3 years, particularly, as it relates to new product categories, more product exclusives, new geographies, enhanced margins, of course, very important, new clients, specialty customers, new technology solutions. And above all, in 2015, it's about human capital, talent, investment, management and you can be sure that Team Schein is focused on this great succession at all levels of the company. 
So with that overview of our quarterly financial and operating performance and summary of the year, I'd like to thank you for your attention this morning. To those that are investors, thank you for your confidence, and we're open for questions."

On the first part of your question, I don't know if I want to give a specific number because it's really difficult to quantify what customers would have bought because of tax incentives that ultimately didn't buy, but we certainly believe we would have had good growth. If I peel the onion on the equipment categories in North America, I think it's important to note that our CAD/CAM sales growth was strong. Traditional equipment was down a little bit but not as much as the overall category. And really, I think people on some of the discretionary digital solutions, that's really where we saw people hold back. In my opinion, a lot of that really is timing that people would have accelerated their purchases in Q4 they'll ultimately buy sometime in 2015, not necessarily in Q1 but sometime in 2015. Right now, the tax incentives, the way that U.S. government did it, they reinstated them December 19, but they re-expired on January 1, 2015. So no one knows whether they'll reinstate them again and at what time, but right now, the tax incentives are only at the $25,000 level. The second part of your question really -- again, I gave color on the components. I'm not sure there's a lot more to add there other than, again, we feel like with the addition of additional equipment lines, including A-dec, we feel like we're going to have a good equipment year in 2015. And I think most people realize that the consumable sales growth, which was strong, just under 5%, really is a better indicator of how the market is doing than this one quarter of equipment sales."

So really, in Q1, there's really mostly expenses and not a lot of benefit. So it is slightly accretive, but we do expect increased accretion, and really, we're being very conservative on the potential for procurement and buying at better prices because we really don't know the impact of that yet. So that could be an additional upside. On certain products, obviously, we would think that Cardinal Health buys at better prices than we could do on our own, especially on the pharma side. So hopefully, that will be a benefit, but it's too early really to quantify what that benefit will be."

U.S. GAAP doesn't allow us to record that revenue gross with all of the expenses. So we get a fee based on sales from Cardinal, which is designed to represent the estimated profitability of those sales that they're collecting on our behalf. And that number is what we included in the acquisition growth. So the organic growth does not include any impact from the Cardinal agency fee that we're receiving. Once integrated, so sometime during Q2 is the plan, we'll shift over to having those sales fulfilled through our distribution network, and we'll be taking the orders and doing all of the traditional distribution work. And at that time, we'll record the gross revenues again, which should be north of $300 million on a full year basis going forward."

Our pipeline on acquisitions is as full as ever. Wish we could close all the deals in the pipeline. It's not a matter of capital, it's a matter of capacity because integrations are something that goes along with every acquisition. So we don't have an issue finding acquisitions. I think we will have no issue in putting the capital to work that we've outlined, I think something like somewhere between 45% and 50% of our cash flow will go into acquisitions. We will continue with our formula of accretive acquisitions. And in fact, I think we are in a better position today to make acquisitions than ever before. Our track record is outstanding for keeping management where we make commitments upfront. Our suppliers are generally supportive of us because they've seen us enter markets and not disrupt markets but, in fact, add to the distribution capability and the Value-Added Services in the market, which generally gets better after we enter from a competitive landscape point of view. So I don't think there is any issue from that point of view. We have no problem in keeping the pipeline full. We will expand our geographic presence in our Dental and our Animal Health business. We will probably do that in Medical again at some point when we want to get the Cardinal integration behind us. It's a big opportunity. We have the right to sell the Cardinal products abroad, and we will do that. And I think you will see us adding much more in the Value-Added Service area, continues to be important to us across the board in all countries. And of course, the specialty area, there's lots and lots of opportunity. Meanwhile, we've become an important player in the specialty-only products. We're always an important player in selling general products, equipment consumables to specialists, but it was the specialty products, the implants, the bone regeneration, the wires and brackets and related products, and the endodontic-type specific products we're doing well growing that throughout the world inorganically, and of course, organically. So I don't think we'll have any issue in continuing to expand, and I don't think we'll be paying $0.01 more than we used to pay. We have a very good reputation in this area and are very good at integrating businesses once we acquire them."

It is clear that Asia and the developing world are growing at a much faster rate than the developed world and certainly faster than Europe. So -- and that there's a big market. There's at least 1/3 of the world's Dental business that's available in these developing world markets/Asia, and of course, Japan is not a developing -- Korea is now a developing world country. So we continue to expect to increase our presence. Having said that, at the moment, it's relatively small. And the entry to the Japanese market, for example, is not a consolidated entry acquisition, nor is the one in Brazil, nor is the one in South Africa. We are doing well in all of these businesses, but they're not material. China, we are not material. We are growing, but it's not profitable. The others are all profitable. And Thailand is profitable, although it was an issue for a couple of quarters because of the coup, but I think it's quite balanced today. We think we're going to have -- at least from an economic point view, things are looking better. So overall, I think these markets are all markets that are growing faster, even if you take into account some of the losses in China where we have a team much bigger than we need, a much more sophisticated team, an outstanding team, actually. We believe we have the best professional team in China of anyone, really, in our space. So overall, I think you will see that, from a profitability point of view, it's pretty good. We're particularly pleased, by the way, with Brazil, where our growth is really fantastic, and South Africa, too. And so I would say that these are opportunities that are doing very well for us except for China, which is growing nicely on the top line but is, at this stage, still requiring quite a bit of an investment."

Overall, we think we have an outstanding offering. A-dec adds to that, but we also believe that the offering we have from our existing suppliers is a good one. It's been an outstanding one. It's allowed us to become a very significant player in the equipment business. In fact, we believe we're the largest provider of equipment in the world, Dental equipment.

So when we issued guidance, and I'll just focus on the dollar to the euro, because that's our major currency, although there was a little bit of impact on some of the other currencies, too. But the euro to the dollar was $1.24 when we issued guidance. Right now, as of yesterday or today, it's probably $1.13. So assuming that the $1.13 stays for the entire year, which I'm not sure is a good or bad assumption, but we have to start with an assumption, that would have anywhere, versus our previous guidance, anywhere between an $0.08 to $0.10 EPS impact. And that's why on the conference call we said, while we're still comfortable with our range, we're really, at this point, saying the lower end of the range. There are a few offsets. Cardinal is a little bit of an offset to it. Actually, fuel prices are a little bit of an offset to it also but not significant. And again, we don't know which way fuel prices are going to go over the next 8 or 9 months. But I think we still feel like achieving our full year guidance is very doable. And obviously, if the dollar continues to strengthen, we'll look to see if we can continue to achieve the guidance by doing some other activities or not. But again, it's so hard to predict, and I really don't want to predict what I think the full year impact will be because I think it's too difficult. There are too many variables."

So I think -- and at the same time, if the euro stays low, our imports of products go down in price, not only in terms of products from Europe but also from Asia. So it's much too early, and I think Steven is correct to signal the lower end, but there's so many variables that could move in a positive direction as well. So -- but it's much too early to go much further than that."

Clearly, it was a distraction as it was for others in the marketplace. I don't know whether this quarter is indicative of the trends or not, but I will tell you that our Animal Health business is solid. We will do well in the diagnostic field. I'm quite convinced about that. We've had this type of issue so many times in our history, and we've always come out in the end quite strong. In fact, it's a welcome wake-up call because I think you'll see us investing much heavier in our software businesses, and so we will move towards this bidirectional integration that improves the quality of our systems, the use of the system today [ph]. And I think, overall, in the end, Henry Schein will be a better investment for our shareholders from this point of view. So I will say that also, and I think you've seen this from others who've reported traffic into the Animal Health space is okay. It's a great market. We're seeing lots of capital coming into this market, and we remain very bullish. We've invested heavily from a management point of view in Europe, in Australia/New Zealand. Our CEO of Animal Health business in the U.S. retired. He's still a consultant for the company. We've replaced Kevin with an outstanding new president who's presiding over an outstanding team. So we remain extremely excited about the third leg to Henry Schein that we added really about 4 or 5 years ago in a material way. It's a great investment and you'll see us making more investments not only on expanding our distribution but in Value-Added Services and advancing unique products in this area, a great market.

How are you tracking against that now 9 or 12 months later? And then, Steven, to an earlier question, I just want to make sure think about this correctly. If I estimate about a $40 million shortfall in North American Dental equipment because of the 179 delay, we should view that largely as a pickup from 4Q '14 to 4Q '15 as those accounts await sort of the reimplementation of 179 rather than trickling in throughout 2015?"

Q4, I think, when you look at how much market share we grew on CAD/CAM because of the reduced sales with tax incentives, I don't know if it's really indicative. But while saying that, we still had something in the high teens sales growth in CAD/CAM in North America. So we still had very strong growth. Maybe probably it would have been a lot stronger if the tax incentives were available, but they just weren't. With respect to the second part of your question, if nothing changes from where we are, we'll kind of have a normal year, I believe, for equipment because we did not get pull forward in 2014 -- in Q4 2014 from 2015. And if nothing changes, the tax incentives aren't increased, we probably won't get much pull forward at the end of 2015 pulling forward from 2016, so will be kind of a normal year, which would be good, I think. We're still hopeful, and I think there's still possibilities that the tax incentives could be reinstated at some point. But right now, we have to go with whatever the tax laws that exist. And it's only for the first $25,000 of capital expenditures, which is a relatively small amount. As you know, CAD/CAM is over $100,000. A lot of other equipment is expensive. So without that tax incentive, it doesn't give people the incentive to buy now, and they'll still buy, but they'll buy in due course rather than trying to accelerate it. So hopefully that answers your question."

Changes in currency exchange rates reduced our consolidated sales growth by 6% and reduced diluted EPS by $0.06 compared to last year. Steven will speak about this in greater detail during the call. 
In looking beyond currency exchange factors, the global markets we serve, we believe, continues to be healthy this quarter, we saw that the previous quarter.

So in a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent financial performance and business accomplishments. But first, Steven, can you review the quarterly financial results? Thank you."

I'm also pleased to report solid results for the first quarter of 2015. Before we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 first quarter results include restructuring cost of $6.9 million pretax or appr",1432,"Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to all. I'm also pleased to report solid results for the first quarter of 2015. Before we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 first quarter results include restructuring cost of $6.9 million pretax or approximately $0.06 per diluted share. We announced this restructuring on our third quarter 2014 conference call. 
Exhibit B to this morning's earnings news release reconciles our GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations. I will be discussing our results as reported and also excluding this restructuring cost as we believe the latter is more reflective of our performance.
Turning now to our Q1 results. The net sales for the quarter ended March 28, 2015, were $2.5 billion, reflecting a 1.4% increase compared with the first quarter of 2014. This consisted of 7.4% growth in local currencies and as Stanley just mentioned, a 6.0% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 4.8% and acquisition growth contributed 2.6%. Again, you could see the details of our sales growth in Exhibit A of our news release.
Operating margin for the fourth [ph] quarter of 2015 was 6.6% and expanded by 8 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2014. However, excluding the restructuring cost, which we believe is the most appropriate measure, our adjusted operating margin for the quarter -- for the first quarter of 2015 improved by 36 basis points to 6.8%. 
If you also exclude the impact of acquisitions completed in the past 12 months and related expenses, our margin expanded by 33 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2014. This expansion primarily resulted in improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of sales as we leveraged our global infrastructure across growing sales.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.8%. This is also on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes restructuring cost and compares with 31.2% for the first quarter of 2014. The lower tax rate is due to the implementation or continued implementation of tax planning strategies and higher earnings in countries with lower corporate tax rates. We expect that our effective tax rate continue to be in the 30% range for the remainder of the year.
Net income attributable to Henry Schein for the first quarter of 2015 was $103.4 million or $1.22 per diluted share. This represents growth of 1.3% and 3.4% compared with the first quarter of 2014. However again, excluding restructuring cost in the current quarter, net income attributable to Henry Schein was $108.4 million or $1.28 per diluted share. And that represents 6.2% and 8.5% respective growth compared with the first quarter of 2014. Again, as Stanley mentioned, foreign currency exchange did have a negative impact to us in the quarter, and it was about $0.06 of EPS for the quarter versus last year.
Let me now provide some detail on our sales results for the first quarter. Our Dental sales declined by 3.6% to $1.3 billion. This 3.6% decline consisted of 3.3% growth in local currencies and a 6.9% decline again related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales growth increased 2.7%, and our acquisition growth contributed an additional 0.6%. 
If we look at the 2.7% internal growth in local currencies, that consisted of 4.4% growth in North America and 0.2% internationally. If I give you some additional detail behind each of the North American and international businesses, the 4.4% growth in the North American business consisted of 4.4% growth the same number of Dental consumable merchandise as well as slightly higher or 4.5% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenue. 
If you look at the 0.2% internal growth in constant currency in our international business, that included a slight decline of 1.6% in Dental consumable merchandise and 5.4% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenue. The 1.6% decline in our Dental consumable merchandise was primarily reflected in 3 markets, the Australian market, the U.K. market and our German market. 
Turning to Animal Health. Our Animal Health sales were $684.3 million for the first quarter, which was an increase of 4.6%. This included growth of 12.4% in local currencies and 7.8% decline related to foreign currency. Our internal sales growth in local currencies was 4.5% and acquisitions contributed 7.9% to the growth. If we look at that 4.5% total worldwide growth, it included 1.3% growth in North America and 7.4% growth internationally.
The Animal Health growth rates reflect the impact of certain products that switch between agency and standard sales. This quarter, however, it was not material. It was less than a 1% impact but it also reflects changes in manufacturer relationships in the veterinary diagnostic category, which we discussed on previous conference calls. 
We normalize for both of those 2 situations, and when you normalize for that, the group's internal growth rate in constant currencies -- sorry, internal growth rate was 4.5% and in constant currencies was 10.1%. And the internal growth rate in North America goes to 13.6%. So we believe that these growth rates more accurately reflect the ongoing strength of the Animal Health business, and we will continue to report results of our Animal Health business on the same basis again to show the performance on a clearer basis. 
Our Medical sales were $443.5 million for the first quarter, an increase of 11.6%. This consisted of 12.5% growth in local currencies and a 0.9% decline related to foreign currency exchange. Internal sales growth in local currencies was 11.6% and acquisitions contributed to 0.9% to growth. The 11.6% internal growth in local currencies included North American growth of a strong 12.2%, led by large group practices and integrated delivery networks and growth of 1.5% internationally. 
This is our first quarter that we have results that include a full quarter of agency revenue resulting from our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health. And you should note that agency revenue under this agreement is running approximately $1.5 million per month, so approximately $4.5 million for the quarter. 
If we turn to our Technology and Value-Added Services sales, they were $85.7 million in the quarter, which was an increase of 5.4%. This included 8% growth in local currencies and a 2.6% decline related to foreign currency. In local currencies, we had internally generated sales growth of 7.9% and acquisition growth of 0.1%. That 7.9% internal growth in local currencies included 5.9% growth in North America and 17.3% growth internationally. 
We continue to repurchase common stock in the open market during the first quarter. Specifically, we repurchased approximately 542,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $139.67 per share, which translated to approximately $75.7 million. The impact of this repurchase in the first quarter was not material.
At the close of the quarter, we had approximately $224 million still authorized for future repurchases of common stock. And we remain committed to our goal of repurchasing between $200 million and $300 million of stock for 2015.
If we take a brief look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow for the quarter, the operating cash flow for the quarter was negative by $26.7 million but that compares to a negative $55.2 million in the prior year's first quarter. And as most people know, our first quarter is typically negative because of working capital movements. 
We continue to believe though for full year, we will have strong operating cash flow. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 41.2 days. That compared to 40.8 days in last year's first quarter. And inventory turns was 5.3 turns, which compares to 5.6 turns last year.
So finally, I'll conclude my remarks by affirming our 2015 financial guidance as follows: for 2015, we expected -- we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be $5.90 to $6 per share, which represents growth of 8% to 10% compared with our 2014 results. Again, assuming the strength of the U.S. dollar stays at current levels, we expect 2015 adjusted EPS to be towards the lower end of that range. 
Keep in mind that approximately 35% of our worldwide sales are based on currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and as you may know, we do not hedge against that exposure. Also, our 2015 guidance excludes restructuring costs related to the planned initiative to rationalize the company's operations and provide expense efficiencies. And it is also, as always, includes completed acquisitions or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions. 
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Stan."

So let me review our 4 business groups, starting with Dental. In North America, consumable merchandise sales growth of more than 4% in local currencies indicates that patient traffic to dental offices continues to be strong, although we do believe that we did pick up market share. Importantly, equipment sales and service revenue returned to healthy growth during the quarter, up 4.5%.
Looking at the international Dental, internal equipment sales and service remained solid at more than 5% in local currencies. As -- and by the way, the full impact of IDS is expected in the next quarter. As Steven mentioned, we saw a decline in consumable merchandise sales in our international businesses, but we remain confident about the long-term success of our international Dental strategy. 
The IDS, the biennial International Dental Show in Cologne in March, we did experience the typical slowdown of purchases before the show, leading up to the show, and that softness was offset by gains in other countries, including France and Spain. As always, IDS 2015 was an exciting gathering of dental professionals from across Europe, and many equipment manufacturers use the occasion to launch new products. We look forward to the positive impact of IDS during the next few quarters.
During the first quarter, we entered into a multinational distribution agreement to bring the latest 3D products from 3D Systems to our laboratory customers. These 2 products will -- the 2 products will be selling our leaders in the high-fidelity position 3D printing arena and will be part of our digital dental laboratory offering, which includes 3D scanners, software, installation of post-sales support. This agreement is yet another example of our commitment to complete an integrated digital dental solution in the and of course, in the lab.
Now on the Animal Health side, once again, this group posted double-digit growth in local currencies in both North America and internationally. We saw particular strength in United Kingdom and Australia as well as North America, except in the diagnostic category in North America. 
Just after the close of the quarter, we completed our acquisition of scil animal care, which I discussed at some length during our last quarterly conference call. In addition to fortifying our Animal Health equipment capabilities in North America and Europe, the scil animal health -- the scil animal care professionals will be expanding our diagnostic products category and working to gain market share for our Animal Health diagnostics partners, including, of course, Abaxis and Heska. 
We are pleased thus far with the Abaxis and Heska product lines. And we look forward to further market penetration and success with both of these excellent manufacturers. 
During last quarter's call, I mentioned a new software product called Axis-Q, which automates the workflow of diagnostic tests, eliminating the manual input of codes and automatically returning results to the electronic medical record in the vet office. We've made good advance -- we've made good progress here. This good advance [indiscernible] of this product, and we are on track to launch during the current quarter. So again, just like our Dental business, we are very excited about the progress that is unfolding in our Animal Health business, both in the United States and abroad. 
So on the Medical side, sales growth in this group was excellent and exceeded 12% in local currency. This reflects continued progress with large group practices and the IDN, the integrated delivery networks. Our [indiscernible] markets, that's the very large accounts in our mid-market, the midsize accounts. 
Growth also includes a full quarter of agency sales and our strategic agreement for Cardinal Health. Our collaboration with Cardinal Health is proceeding well. Our sales teams have continued to make customer presentations at a combined -- as a combined selling organization, and the reception has been very good generally. We just had our national sales meeting of the combined sales forces, and it was really -- the morale and excitement, enthusiasm was quite remarkable. And we expect to have the integration substantially completed this quarter in our second quarter as we originally planned. 
So let me conclude my business overview with some remarks on the Technology and the Value-Added Services groups. This group of businesses continues to perform very well. International Technology and Value-Added Services posted double-digit internal sales growth in local currencies as we have -- as has actually been the case every quarter for more than 2 years. The advanced technology products and services sold by this group, of course, also provide a platform for further enhancing sales opportunity to customers across all businesses, very profitable to Henry Schein but also in our stickiness to our relationship with customers on the consumable equipment, financial services and other business opportunities.
So before we open the call to questions, I'd like to highlight a few awards and rankings we recently received and really as a recognition to the terrific work our team has done. In February, Henry Schein ranked #1 on the Fortune list of the World's Most Admired Companies in the wholesalers section for health care -- in the health care industry category. This is the second consecutive #1 ranking for Henry Schein and the 14th consecutive year we have been named to this list. 
We also ranked first in all 9 [ph] subcategories within our industry. In March, we were named as the 2015 World's Most Ethical Company by [indiscernible] Institute. This was the fourth consecutive year Henry Schein has been chosen by and we are 1 of only 132 companies on it this year and the only honoree in the health care products category. 
In April, we were named as one of America's Best Employer Performance Magazine with the rank of 203 out of more than 3,500 companies considered. This is the first specialist from Forbes with rankings based on independent and anonymous employee surveys. We take great pride in this ranking as it is based on the field work with employees responding candidly about the employer. 
And yet perhaps from a financial point of view, the most exciting of all, effective March 17, Henry Schein was added to the S&P 500 Index. Inclusion in this iconic index is recognition of every Team Schein member's unwavering commitment to helping health care practitioners operate more efficient successful practices while delivering the highest quality of care. 
Collectively, I think these 4 prestigious yet very different recognitions send a powerful message to our team and our customers about the strength, integrity and accomplishments of Henry Schein and no doubt will continue to result in good returns to our investors.
So with that overview of our quarterly financial operating performance, I'd like to thank you for your attention this morning. I would also like to thank our over 18,000 Team Schein members across the globe for the hard work and diligent efforts during this quarter and the quarters before. And now operator, we're ready to take questions."

Germany was just a little bit of sluggishness during the quarter. There were some product movements in Australia, the U.K. that maybe also contributed. I think that what we believe is that there's no trends here, that we're looking for a bit of a pickup in international Dental merchandise for the balance of the year. And I just would like to be cautious for a bit of a pickup so will be a modest improvement, I think. But I think what we're really also happy with is the equipment side. Equipment, despite an IDS year, was very strong at a little over 5%, 5.4% growth. And while the typical markets, including Germany, is definitely impacted by the IDS market, we did see strong equipment growth in France and the U.K., in The Netherlands as well as Spain and Portugal. And at least the pipeline shows that it was a good IDS year, and we should expect good growth of equipment across the board in international for Q2 and beyond. So I don't think, Jeff, there's something that's a trend here. I just think sometimes you see a quarter that's particularly soft or strong, and it's just kind of the ebbs and flows of the markets."

And so out of those studies, we started to focus on certain sectors in the medical arena and also formed our Healthcare Services group, which was focused on IDNs, large group practices and these multiple locations under common management type entities. And I think our work has been recognized. I think it's clear in the marketplace that we are delivering well on our commitments with regard to these newer kinds of entities. And so we are picking up business and have been picking up business but now actually fulfilling the orders. From the time we picked up a larger account we actually fulfill the orders as much as 1 year or so, so we have been speaking for a while about us doing well with these larger accounts, the IDNs, the, as I mentioned, these different kinds of practices.

So first of all, Henry Schein's philosophy has been one of being committed to branded, national branded manufacturer. So essentially, the number today, Steven may have it, but well over 90% of our business is in branded products. Generally, we will come out with a private brand when the product is commoditized. Rarely are we the first to come out with a private brand work with the branded manufacturer. But I would say some of these group practices on the commodity type sales, technique sensitive type products in Dental are looking at the private brand. But I think our percentage of private brand sales in Dental has been quite static for a long time. The Medical side, there's a greater movement specifically on the commodity, the efficient control type products to the private brand. In this case, I think we're also a bit of a following in the marketplace. We generally work with a branded manufacturers, and so there's no option. And on the Animal Health side, there's some advancement in the area of generic drugs. But again, we tend to have very close relationships with the branded pharmaceutical companies. And the areas we're making progress on surgical type products, instruments, et cetera. At the same time, I think you know that we do have a number of exclusive products with the Colgate relationship with the U.S. and and other few countries, and these matters are driving -- these relationships are driving our sales quite nicely.

First of all, the makeup of the businesses we've owned to date have been largely companion animal except, as I mentioned, the countries -- Australia and a couple of other countries, New Zealand, Ireland, a few other. So that's where we've been. Those businesses are -- that book of business is generally very similar to our existing customers. These are practices, generally small, SME small, medium-size enterprises, made our customers, but they are a growing group of consolidators. But the consolidators generally are multiple locations, multiple smaller practices under common management. So that group of customers has all of that in common. Generally, on the agricultural side, it's not the small practitioner or the midsize practitioner that's buying the products. It is, to a large extent, that is these businesses that are buying the products, of course, pursuant very often to the prescription issued by a veterinarian. It's a different business. I'm not saying it's a bad business, it's a good business. I can tell you the business we're in, we're very happy with them, you see lots of runway. I think there are opportunities in the large animal space. Obviously, from a strategic point of view, we all know that there's going to be a greater demand for protein over time with the demand will be in this country or abroad different people have ideas. Obviously, the developing world presents of the biggest opportunity. So I would say there are opportunities in both markets, and we are very confident that we can continue to grow our companion animal business and make some entry into equine but also into select markets in the large animal production area.

It is a brand and we're bringing in an extensive offering, thousands of products. They have -- give you exact number, I don't have in front of me, but I know thousands and Steve can give you the exact number. So we will be promoting their brand, of course, not only in the Medical arena but also in the Dental and the Vet space. And we will be doing some purchasing from them on the generic drugs side, generic pharma side. So I think there's going to be quite a bit of opportunity for them to grow in sales to us and us to gain synergy on the purchasing side. The physician space, it's hard to get specific utilization data because it's not as -- somebody broken where does the hospital begin and where does it in and where it is at the begin and end. But generally, we believe we are well positioned to gain business in the ultimate care sector, the physician space, the smaller ambulatory care space and even the larger ambulatory care space and also areas such as retail clinics, and community centers, et cetera. So of course, will help us with the IDNs as they have many IDNs that they are either exclusive or relatively exclusive and I think they will bring us in over time. Having said that, we have a number of IDNs that we are active in unrelated to Cardinal. So I think our view that the physician space, the space presents runway for us is reaffirmed as we get more and more into our relationship with Cardinal. And at the same time, we are really excited about the entry they can gave us into IDNs that probably never heard of us or they have heard of us but didn't understand our capabilities. What I can tell you is the enthusiasm in our national sales meeting of the combined sales force was something I have not seen in a while. The Cardinal representatives, of course, love the company, but the company was really more focused on the acute care side. And we are focused on the physician side, and we have tools that they haven't had available to them. So generally, I think this has been an outstanding start. We actually go live this week actually and hope to have the inspiration completed this quarter. So we are very excited about the momentum, and I think the customer base is as well and obviously the salespeople."

Of course, the debate is who's going to pay for it. The taxpayers, government reducing cost in certain areas, et cetera, but that's not as important to us as more primary care practice in this country, in the United States. And so that is good for our business. And we can see that the primary care side is gearing up. Obviously, the cost for procedure reimbursement per procedure will go down. This is more about the outcomes as we move from care to health care. And we believe that this presents a huge opportunity for our Medical businesses, that's why we focus in this space. And we believe that some of those opportunities are already being harvested. And we expect that to continue in the future as wellness prevention becomes a bigger part of the whole health care focus.

Our first quarter financial results were solid, with quite strong internal growth in local currencies as we continued to gain market share in each of our 4 business groups. As detailed in the news release we issued this morning, the strength of the U.S. dollar impacted all of our international operations and, in particular, those in Europe. Changes in currency exchange rates reduced our consolidated sales growth by 6% and reduced diluted EPS by $0.06 compared to last year. Steven will speak about this in greater detail during the call. 
In looking beyond currency exchange factors, the global market we serve, we believe, continues to be healthy this quarter. We saw that the previous quarter. And despite some challenges in our International Dental business -- and this is quite selective, it's not a general issue, our bottom line results also were solid despite the impact of the strength in U.S. dollar. And we were pleased -- today, we are again -- once -- pleased today to be reaffirming our guidance range for the 2015 diluted EPS. 
So in a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent financial performance and business accomplishments.

I'm also pleased to report solid results for the first quarter of 2015. Before we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 first quarter results include restructuring costs of $6.9 million pretax or app",1433,"Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to all. I'm also pleased to report solid results for the first quarter of 2015. Before we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 first quarter results include restructuring costs of $6.9 million pretax or approximately $0.06 per diluted share. We announced this restructuring on our third quarter 2014 conference call. 
Exhibit B to this morning's earnings news release reconciles our GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations. I will be discussing our results as reported and also excluding these restructuring cost, as we believe the latter is more reflective of our performance.
Turning now to our Q1 results. The net sales for the quarter ended March 28, 2015 were $2.5 billion, reflecting a 1.4% increase compared with the first quarter of 2014. This consisted of 7.4% growth in local currencies and, as Stanley just mentioned, a 6.0% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 4.8% and acquisition growth contributed 2.6%. Again, you could see the details of our sales growth in Exhibit A of our news release.
Operating margin for the fourth (sic) [first] quarter of 2015 was 6.6% and expanded by 8 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2014. However, excluding the restructuring costs, which we believe is the most appropriate measure, our adjusted operating margin for the quarter -- for the first quarter of 2015 improved by 36 basis points to 6.8%. 
If you also exclude the impact of acquisitions completed in the past 12 months and related expenses, our margin expanded by 33 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2014. This expansion primarily resulted in improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of sales, as we leverage our global infrastructure across growing sales.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.8%. This is also on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes restructuring costs and compares with 31.2% for the first quarter of 2014. The lower tax rate is due to the implementation or continued implementation of tax planning strategies and higher earnings in countries with lower corporate tax rates. We expect that our effective tax rate continue to be in the 30% range for the remainder of the year.
Net income attributable to Henry Schein for the first quarter of 2015 was $103.4 million or $1.22 per diluted share. This represents growth of 1.3% and 3.4% compared with the first quarter of 2014. However, again, excluding restructuring costs in the current quarter, net income attributable to Henry Schein was $108.4 million or $1.28 per diluted share. And that represents 6.2% and 8.5% respective growth compared with the first quarter of 2014. Again, as Stanley mentioned, foreign currency exchange did have a negative impact to us in the quarter, and it was about $0.06 of EPS for the quarter versus last year.
Let me now provide some detail on our sales results for the first quarter. Our Dental sales declined by 3.6% to $1.3 billion. This 3.6% decline consisted of 3.3% growth in local currencies and a 6.9% decline, again, related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales growth increased 2.7%, and our acquisition growth contributed an additional 0.6%. 
If we look at the 2.7% internal growth in local currencies, that consisted of 4.4% growth in North America and 0.2% internationally. If I give you some additional detail behind each of the North American and International businesses, the 4.4% growth in the North American business consisted of 4.4% growth, the same number, of Dental consumable merchandise as well as slightly higher or 4.5% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenue. 
If you look at the 0.2% internal growth in constant currency in our International business, that included a slight decline of 1.6% in Dental consumable merchandise and 5.4% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenue. The 1.6% decline in our Dental consumable merchandise was primarily reflected in 3 markets, the Australian market, the U.K. market and our German market. 
Turning to Animal Health. Our Animal Health sales were $684.3 million for the first quarter, which was an increase of 4.6%. This included growth of 12.4% in local currencies and 7.8% decline related to foreign currency. Our internal sales growth in local currencies was 4.5% and acquisitions contributed 7.9% to the growth. If we look at that 4.5% total worldwide growth, it included 1.3% growth in North America and 7.4% growth internationally.
The Animal Health growth rates reflect the impact of certain products that switch between agency and standard sales. This quarter, however, it was not material. It was less than a 1% impact, but it also reflects changes in manufacturer relationships in the veterinary diagnostic category, which we've discussed on previous conference calls. 
We normalize for both of those 2 situations, and when you normalize for that, the group's internal growth rate in constant currencies -- sorry, internal growth rate was 4.5% and in constant currencies was 10.1%. And the internal growth rate in North America goes to 13.6%. So we believe that these growth rates more accurately reflect the ongoing strength of the Animal Health business, and we will continue to report results of our Animal Health business on the same basis, again, to show the performance on a clearer basis. 
 
Our Medical sales were $443.5 million for the first quarter, an increase of 11.6%. This consisted of 12.5% growth in local currencies and a 0.9% decline related to foreign currency exchange. Internal sales growth in local currencies was 11.6% and acquisitions contributed to 0.9% to growth. The 11.6% internal growth in local currencies included North American growth of a strong 12.2%, led by large group practices and integrated delivery networks and growth of 1.5% internationally. 
This is our first quarter that we have results that include a full quarter of agency revenue resulting from our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health. And you should note that agency revenue under this agreement is running approximately $1.5 million per month, so approximately $4.5 million for the quarter. 
If we turn to our Technology and Value-Added Services sales, they were $85.7 million in the quarter, which was an increase of 5.4%. This included 8% growth in local currencies and a 2.6% decline related to foreign currency. In local currencies, we had internally generated sales growth of 7.9% and acquisition growth of 0.1%. That 7.9% internal growth in local currencies included 5.9% growth in North America and 17.3% growth internationally. 
We continued to repurchase common stock in the open market during the first quarter. Specifically, we repurchased approximately 542,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $139.67 per share, which translated to approximately $75.7 million. The impact of this repurchase in the first quarter was not material.
At the close of the quarter, we had approximately $224 million still authorized for future repurchases of common stock. And we remain committed to our goal of repurchasing between $200 million and $300 million of stock for 2015.
If we take a brief look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow for the quarter, the operating cash flow for the quarter was negative by $26.7 million but that compares to a negative $55.2 million in the prior year's first quarter. And as most people know, our first quarter is typically negative because of working capital movements. 
We continue to believe, though, for our full year, we will have strong operating cash flow. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 41.2 days. That compares to 40.8 days in last year's first quarter. And inventory turns was 5.3 turns, which compares to 5.6 turns last year.
So finally, I'll conclude my remarks by affirming our 2015 financial guidance as follows: for 2015, we expected -- we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be $5.90 to $6 per share, which represents growth of 8% to 10% compared with our 2014 results. Again, assuming the strength of the U.S. dollar stays at current levels, we expect 2015 adjusted EPS to be towards the lower end of that range. 
Keep in mind that approximately 35% of our worldwide sales are based on currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as you may know, we do not hedge against that exposure. Also, our 2015 guidance excludes restructuring costs related to the planned initiative to rationalize the company's operations and provide expense efficiencies. And this also, as always, includes completed acquisitions or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions. 
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Stan."

So let me review our 4 business groups, starting with Dental.

So let me review our 4 business groups, starting with Dental. In North America, consumable merchandise sales growth of more than 4% in local currencies indicates that patient traffic to dental offices continues to be strong, although we do believe that we did pick up market share. Importantly, equipment sales and service revenue returned to healthy growth during the quarter, up 4.5%.
Looking at International Dental, internal equipment sales and service remained solid at more than 5% in local currencies. As -- and by the way, the full impact of IDS is expected in the next quarter. As Steven mentioned, we saw a decline in consumable merchandise sales in our International businesses, but we remain confident about the long-term success of our International Dental strategy. 
The IDS, the biennial International Dental Show in Cologne in March. We did experience the typical slowdown of purchases before the show, leading up to the show, and that softness was offset by gains in other countries, including France and Spain. As always, IDS 2015 was an exciting gathering of dental professionals from across Europe, and many equipment manufacturers used the occasion to launch new products. We look forward to the positive impact of IDS during the next few quarters.
During the first quarter, we entered into a multinational distribution agreement to bring the latest 3D printers from 3D Systems to our laboratory customers. These 2 products will -- the 2 products we'll be selling are leaders in the high-fidelity position 3D printing arena and will be part of our digital dental laboratory offering, which includes 3D scanners, software, installation of post-sales support. This agreement is yet another example of our commitment to complete -- to a complete and integrated digital dental solution in the operatory and, of course, in the lab.
Now on the Animal Health side. Once again, this group posted double-digit growth in local currencies in both North America and internationally. We saw particular strength in the United Kingdom and Australia as well as North America, except in the diagnostic category in North America. 
Just after the close of the quarter, we completed our acquisition of scil animal care, which I discussed at some length during our last quarterly conference call. In addition to fortifying our Animal Health equipment capabilities in North America and Europe, the scil animal health -- the scil animal care professionals will be expanding our diagnostic products category and working to gain market share for our Animal Health diagnostics partners, including, of course, Abaxis and Heska. 
We are pleased, thus far, with the Abaxis and Heska product lines. And we look forward to further market penetration and success with both of these excellent manufacturers. 
During last quarter's call, I mentioned a new software product called Axis-Q, which automates the workflow of diagnostic tests, eliminating the manual input of codes and automatically returning results to the electronic medical record in the vet office. We've made good advance -- we've made good progress here. There is good, advanced awareness of this product and we are on track to launch during the current quarter. So again, just like our Dental business, we are very excited about the progress that is unfolding in our Animal Health business, both in the United States and abroad. 
So on the Medical side, sales growth in this group was excellent and exceeded 12% in local currency. This reflects continued progress with large group practices and the IDN, the integrated delivery networks, at our up-markets, that's the very large accounts; and our mid-market, the midsized accounts. 
Growth also includes a full quarter of agency sales and our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health. Our collaboration with Cardinal Health is proceeding well. Our sales teams have continued to make customer presentations at a combined -- as a combined selling organization, and the reception has been very good generally. We just had our National Sales Meeting of the combined sales forces, and it was really -- the morale and excitement, enthusiasm was quite remarkable. And we expect to have the integration substantially completed this quarter, in our second quarter, as we originally planned. 
So let me conclude my business overview with some remarks on the Technology and the Value-Added Services groups. This group of businesses continues to perform very well. International Technology and Value-Added Services posted double-digit internal sales growth in local currencies as we have -- as has actually been the case every quarter for more than 2 years. The advanced technology products and services sold by this group, of course, also provide a platform for further enhancing sales opportunity to customers across all businesses, a very profitable sector of Henry Schein, but also lends enormous stickiness to our relationship with customers on the consumable equipment, Financial Services and other business opportunities.
So before we open the call to questions, I'd like to highlight a few awards and rankings we recently received and really as a recognition to the terrific work our team has done. In February, Henry Schein ranked #1 on the Fortune list of the World's Most Admired Companies in the Wholesalers section for Health Care --  the Health Care industry category. This is the second consecutive #1 ranking for Henry Schein and the 14th consecutive year we have been named to this list. 
We also ranked first in all 9 subcategories within our industry. In March, we were named as the 2015 World's Most Ethical Company by Ethisphere Institute. This was the fourth consecutive year Henry Schein has been chosen by Ethisphere, and we are 1 of only 132 companies on it this year, and the only honoree in the health care products category. 
In April, we were named as one of America's Best Employers by Forbes Magazine, with a rank of 203 out of more than 3,500 companies considered. This is the first special list from Forbes with rankings based on independent and anonymous employee surveys. We take great pride in this ranking as it is based on the field work, with employees responding candidly about the employer. 
And yet, perhaps, from a financial point of view, the most exciting of all, effective March 17, Henry Schein was added to the S&P 500 index. Inclusion in this iconic index is recognition of every Team Schein member's unwavering commitment to helping health care practitioners operate more efficient, successful practices while delivering the highest quality of care. 
Collectively, I think these 4 prestigious yet very different recognitions send a powerful message to our team and our customers about the strength, integrity and accomplishments of Henry Schein and, no doubt, will continue to result in good returns to our investors.
So with that overview of our quarterly financial operating performance, I'd like to thank you for your attention this morning. I would also like to thank our over 18,000 Team Schein members across the globe for their hard work and diligent efforts during this quarter and the quarters before. 
And now operator, we're ready to take questions."

In Germany was just a little bit of sluggishness during the quarter. There were some product movements in Australia and the U.K. that maybe also contributed. I think that what we believe is that there's no trends here that we're looking for a bit of a pickup in International Dental merchandise for the balance of the year. And I just would like to be cautious for a bit of a pickup. So it'll be a modest improvement, I think. But I think what we're really also happy with is the equipment side. Equipment, despite an IDS year, was very strong at a little over 5%, 5.4% growth. And while the typical markets, including Germany, is definitely impacted by the IDS market, we did see strong equipment growth in France and the U.K., in The Netherlands as well as Spain and Portugal. And at least the pipeline shows that it was a good IDS year, and we should expect good growth of equipment across the board in International for Q2 and beyond. So I don't think, Jeff, there's something that's a trend here. I just think, sometimes, you see a quarter that's particularly soft or strong, and it's just kind of the ebbs and flows of the markets."

And so out of those studies, we started to focus on certain sectors in the medical arena and also formed our healthcare services group, which was focused on IDN, large group practices and these multiple locations under common management-type entities. And I think that our work has been recognized. I think it's clear in the marketplace that we are delivering well on our commitments with regard to these newer kinds of entities. And so we are picking up business and have been picking up business, but now actually fulfilling the orders. From the time we pick up a large account to the time we actually fulfill the orders, it could be as much as 1 year or so. So we have been speaking for a while about us doing well with these larger accounts, the IDNs, the -- as I mentioned, these different kinds of practices. And I think this was where the underlying growth was coming from as well as the focus on certain specialties."

So first of all, Henry Schein's philosophy has been one of being committed to branded -- national branded manufacturers. So essentially -- I don't know the number today, Steven may have it, but well over 90% of our business is in branded products. Generally, we will come out with a private brand. When a product is commoditized, rarely are we the first to come out with a private brand. We'd rather work with the branded manufacturer. But I would say some of these group practices on the commodity-type sales, the less technique-sensitive type of products in Dental are looking at the private brand. But I think our percentage of private brand sales in Dental has been quite static for a long time. The Medical side, there is a greater movement specifically on the commodity, the efficient control-type products to the private brand. In this case, I think we're also a bit of a follower in the marketplace. We generally work with the branded manufacturers until there is no option. And on the Animal Health side, there's some advancement in the area of generic drugs. But again, we tend to have very close relationships with the branded pharmaceutical companies and the areas we're making progress on, surgical type products, instruments, et cetera. At the same time, I think you know that we do have a number of exclusive products with the Colgate relationship in the U.S. and a few other countries, and these products are driving our -- or these relationships are driving our sales quite nicely. Although we work with all the branded manufacturers generally in every market."

First of all, Glen, the makeup of the businesses we've owned to date have been largely companion animal except, as I mentioned, the countries -- at the countries, Australia and a couple of other countries: New Zealand, Ireland, a few other. So that's where we've been. Those businesses are -- that book of business is generally very similar to our existing customers. These are practices, generally small -- SME, small, medium-sized enterprises, mainly our customers, but they are a growing group of consolidators. But the consolidators generally are multiple locations, multiple smallish practices under common management. So that group of customers has all of that in common. Generally, on the agricultural side, it's not the small practitioner or the midsized practitioners buying the products. It is, to a large extent, that it's these businesses that are buying the products, of course, pursuant very often to a prescription issued by a veterinarian. It's a different business. I'm not saying it's a bad business, it's a good business. I can tell you the business we're in, we're very happy with them. We see lots of runway. I think there are opportunities in the large animal space. Obviously, from a strategic point of view, we all know that there's going to be a greater demand for protein over time. Whether the demand will be in this country or abroad, they think -- different people have ideas. Obviously, the developing world presents the biggest opportunity. So I would say there are opportunities in both markets, and we are very confident that we can continue to grow our companion animal business and make some entry into equine but also into select markets in the large animal production area. I think we do quite well... I think we do quite well outside the U.S., for example, in the dairy space. Go ahead, sorry."

There's always -- doesn't matter if they combine the most perfect company, great management, great systems, great outlook, there's still work in integrating. And I think that's what we've done so well over the decades, the last couple of decades. So we have a robust pipeline. We generally do not participate in books that are put out by banks. We have with both companies. But generally, the deals we do are where there's a personal relationship, where things have been worked out well in advance because a family would like us to buy out a percentage of the business, they want to keep one family member engaged, they want to keep some management engaged, they want to remain in the community. These kinds of deals are the kinds of deals we're the most comfortable with. We have no shortage. I think the pricing on some of these booked deals that have been put out have been very, very high. And there's no need to participate in that sector. We have, and when prices become very high, I think you'll see Henry Schein not participate. Having said that, when we do participate, generally, I think the community knows that we'd close on a deal. So I don't know if I can be any clearer than that.

We did not see a particular bump from any particular product category. I think part of that is when we look at CAD/CAM, we had such a strong Q4. We're also up against this quarter a very difficult comp on CAD/CAM because of upgrades that happened last year. So it really was across-the-board growth. It really wasn't any particular category that stood out. And we still feel very good about PlanScan/E4D. And when you look at internationally, I would say the same is true. I think it was weighted a little bit more towards traditional equipment in the international markets rather than high-tech, which is a good sign for the overall market, too, because people are buying traditional equipment. They, generally, are feeling good about how their practice is doing going forward."

It is a brand and we're bringing in an extensive offering, thousands of products. I'd be happy to give you the exact number, but I don't have it in front of me. But I know it's thousands, and Steve can give you the exact number. So we will be promoting their brand, of course, not only in the Medical arena but also in the Dental and the vet space. And we will be doing some purchasing from them on the generic drugs side, on the generic pharma side. So I think there's going to be quite a bit of opportunity for them to grow in sales to us and us to gain synergies on the purchasing side. The physician space, it's hard to get specific utilization data because it's not as -- somebody broken out and where does the hospital begin and where does in end and where does the ASC begin an end, but generally we believe we are well positioned to gain business in the ultimate care sector, the physician space, the smaller ambulatory care space and even the larger ambulatory care space and also areas such as retail clinics and community centers, et cetera. So they, of course, will help us with the IDNs, as they have many IDNs that they are either exclusive or relatively exclusive and I think they will bring us in over time. Having said that, we have a number of IDNs that we are active unrelated to Cardinal. So I think our view that the physician space, the orphan space presents runway for us, is reaffirmed as we get more and more into our relationship with Cardinal. And at the same time, we are really excited about the entry give us into IDNs that probably had never heard of us or if they have heard of us, didn't understand our capabilities. What I can tell you is the enthusiasm at our National Sales Meeting of the combined sales forces was something I have not been shining in a while. The Cardinal representatives, of course, loved the company, but the company was really more focused on the acute care side. And we are focused on the physician side, and we have tools that they didn't have available to them. So generally, I think this has been an outstanding start. We actually go live this week, actually, and hope to have the integration completed this quarter. So we're very excited about the momentum, and I think the customer base is as well and obviously the salespeople."

Middle-class and above have access to primary care physicians; very poor -- had it through the primary care physicians, through general insurance and through Medicare and the elderly of course. And then the very poor who had access to primary care physicians through Medicaid. But there's a whole group of people in the middle that didn't have access to a primary care physician. If these people were sick, they would go to the emergency room, but there was no real preventative programs for these people. Health care reform is about providing primary care. Of course, the debate is who's going to pay for it. The taxpayers, the government reducing cost in certain areas, et cetera, but that's not as important to us as more primary care will be practiced in this country, in the United States. And so that is good for our business. And we can see that the primary care side is gearing up. Obviously, the cost per procedure, reimbursement per procedure will go down. This is more about the outcomes as we move from sick care to health care. And we believe that this presents a huge opportunity for our Medical businesses. This is why we're focused in the space. And we believe that some of those opportunities are already being harvested. And we expect that to continue in the future as wellness -- prevention becomes a bigger part of the whole health care focus. So I can't give you specifics, but I can tell you why we are so enthusiastic about our medical group."

Our first quarter financial results were solid, with quite strong internal growth in local currencies as we continue to gain market share in each of our 4 business groups. As detailed in the news release we issued this morning, the strength of the U.S. dollar impacted all of our international operations and, in particular, those in Europe. Changes in currency exchange rates reduced our consolidated sales growth by 6% and reduced diluted EPS by $0.06 compared to last year. Steven will speak about this in greater detail during the call. 
In looking beyond currency exchange factors, the global market we serve, we believe, continues to be healthy this quarter. We saw that the previous quarter. And despite some challenges in our International Dental business -- and this is quite selective, it's not a general issue, our bottom line results also were solid despite the impact of the strength in U.S. dollar. And we were pleased -- today, we are again -- once -- pleased today to be reaffirming our guidance range for the 2015 diluted EPS. 
So in a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent financial performance and business accomplishments.

I'm also pleased to report solid results for the first quarter of 2015. Before we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 first quarter results include restructuring costs of $6.9 million pretax or app",1435,"Okay. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning to all. I'm also pleased to report solid results for the first quarter of 2015. Before we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 first quarter results include restructuring costs of $6.9 million pretax or approximately $0.06 per diluted share. We announced this restructuring on our third quarter 2014 conference call. 
Exhibit B to this morning's earnings news release reconciles our GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations. I will be discussing our results as reported and also excluding these restructuring costs, as we believe the latter is more reflective of our performance.
Turning now to our Q1 results. The net sales for the quarter ended March 28, 2015 were $2.5 billion, reflecting a 1.4% increase compared with the first quarter of 2014. This consisted of 7.4% growth in local currencies and, as Stanley just mentioned, a 6.0% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 4.8% and acquisition growth contributed 2.6%. Again, you can see the details of our sales growth in Exhibit A of our news release.
Operating margin for the fourth (sic) [first] quarter of 2015 was 6.6% and expanded by 8 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2014. However, excluding the restructuring costs, which we believe is the most appropriate measure, our adjusted operating margin for the quarter -- for the first quarter of 2015 improved by 36 basis points to 6.8%. 
If you also exclude the impact of acquisitions completed in the past 12 months and related expenses, our margin expanded by 33 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2014. This expansion primarily resulted in improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of sales, as we leverage our global infrastructure across growing sales.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.8%. This is also on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes restructuring costs and compares with 31.2% for the first quarter of 2014. The lower tax rate is due to the implementation or continued implementation of tax planning strategies and higher earnings in countries with lower corporate tax rates. We expect that our effective tax rate will continue to be in the 30% range for the remainder of the year.
Net income attributable to Henry Schein for the first quarter of 2015 was $103.4 million or $1.22 per diluted share. This represents growth of 1.3% and 3.4% compared with the first quarter of 2014. However, again, excluding restructuring costs in the current quarter, net income attributable to Henry Schein was $108.4 million or $1.28 per diluted share. And that represents 6.2% and 8.5% respective growth compared with the first quarter of 2014. Again, as Stanley mentioned, foreign currency exchange did have a negative impact to us in the quarter, and it was about $0.06 of EPS for the quarter versus last year.
Let me now provide some detail on our sales results for the first quarter. Our Dental sales declined by 3.6% to $1.3 billion. This 3.6% decline consisted of 3.3% growth in local currencies and a 6.9% decline, again, related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales growth increased 2.7%, and our acquisition growth contributed an additional 0.6%. 
If we look at the 2.7% internal growth in local currencies, that consisted of 4.4% growth in North America and 0.2% internationally. If I give you some additional detail behind each of the North American and International businesses, the 4.4% growth in the North American business consisted of 4.4% growth, the same number, of Dental consumable merchandise as well as slightly higher or 4.5% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenue. 
If you look at the 0.2% internal growth in constant currency in our International business, that included a slight decline of 1.6% in Dental consumable merchandise and 5.4% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenue. The 1.6% decline in our Dental consumable merchandise was primarily reflected in 3 markets, the Australian market, the U.K. market and our German market. 
Turning to Animal Health. Our Animal Health sales were $684.3 million for the first quarter, which was an increase of 4.6%. This included growth of 12.4% in local currencies and 7.8% decline related to foreign currency. Our internal sales growth in local currencies was 4.5% and acquisitions contributed 7.9% to the growth. If we look at that 4.5% total worldwide growth, it included 1.3% growth in North America and 7.4% growth internationally.
The Animal Health growth rates reflect the impact of certain products that switch between agency and standard sales. This quarter, however, it was not material. It was less than a 1% impact, but it also reflects changes in manufacturer relationships in the veterinary diagnostic category, which we've discussed on previous conference calls. 
We normalize for both of those 2 situations, and when you normalize for that, the group's internal growth rate in constant currencies -- sorry, internal growth rate was 4.5% and in constant currencies was 10.1%. And the internal growth rate in North America goes to 13.6%. So we believe that these growth rates more accurately reflect the ongoing strength of the Animal Health business, and we will continue to report results of our Animal Health business on the same basis, again, to show the performance on a clearer basis. 
 
Our Medical sales were $443.5 million for the first quarter, an increase of 11.6%. This consisted of 12.5% growth in local currencies and a 0.9% decline related to foreign currency exchange. Internal sales growth in local currencies was 11.6% and acquisitions contributed to 0.9% to growth. The 11.6% internal growth in local currencies included North American growth of a strong 12.2%, led by large group practices and integrated delivery networks and growth of 1.5% internationally. 
This is our first quarter that we have results that include a full quarter of agency revenue resulting from our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health. And you should note that agency revenue under this agreement is running approximately $1.5 million per month, so approximately $4.5 million for the quarter. 
If we turn to our Technology and Value-Added Services sales, they were $85.7 million in the quarter, which was an increase of 5.4%. This included 8% growth in local currencies and a 2.6% decline related to foreign currency. In local currencies, we had internally generated sales growth of 7.9% and acquisition growth of 0.1%. That 7.9% internal growth in local currencies included 5.9% growth in North America and 17.3% growth internationally. 
We continued to repurchase common stock in the open market during the first quarter. Specifically, we repurchased approximately 542,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $139.67 per share, which translated to approximately $75.7 million. The impact of this repurchase in the first quarter was not material.
At the close of the quarter, we had approximately $224 million still authorized for future repurchases of common stock. And we remain committed to our goal of repurchasing between $200 million and $300 million of stock for 2015.
If we take a brief look at some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow for the quarter, the operating cash flow for the quarter was negative by $26.7 million but that compares to a negative $55.2 million in the prior year's first quarter. And as most people know, our first quarter is typically negative because of working capital movements. 
We continue to believe, though, for our full year, we will have strong operating cash flow. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 41.2 days. That compares to 40.8 days in last year's first quarter. And inventory turns was 5.3 turns, which compares to 5.6 turns last year.
So finally, I'll conclude my remarks by affirming our 2015 financial guidance as follows: for 2015, we expected -- we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be $5.90 to $6 per share, which represents growth of 8% to 10% compared with our 2014 results. Again, assuming the strength of the U.S. dollar stays at current levels, we expect 2015 adjusted EPS to be towards the lower end of that range. 
Keep in mind that approximately 35% of our worldwide sales are based on currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as you may know, we do not hedge against that exposure. Also, our 2015 guidance excludes restructuring costs related to the planned initiative to rationalize the company's operations and provide expense efficiencies. And it is also, as always, includes completed acquisitions or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions. 
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Stan."

So let me review our 4 business groups, starting with Dental.

So let me review our 4 business groups, starting with Dental. In North America, consumable merchandise sales growth of more than 4% in local currencies indicates that patient traffic to dental offices continues to be strong, although we do believe that we did pick up market share. Importantly, equipment sales and service revenue returned to healthy growth during the quarter, up 4.5%.
Looking at International Dental, internal equipment sales and service remained solid at more than 5% in local currencies. As -- and by the way, the full impact of IDS is expected in the next quarter. As Steven mentioned, we saw a decline in consumable merchandise sales in our International businesses, but we remain confident about the long-term success of our International Dental strategy. 
The IDS, the biennial International Dental Show in Cologne in March. We did experience the typical slowdown of purchases before the show, leading up to the show, and that softness was offset by gains in other countries, including France and Spain. As always, IDS 2015 was an exciting gathering of dental professionals from across Europe, and many equipment manufacturers use the occasion to launch new products. We look forward to the positive impact of IDS during the next few quarters.
During the first quarter, we entered into a multinational distribution agreement to bring the latest 3D printers from 3D Systems to our laboratory customers. These 2 products will -- the 2 products we'll be selling are leaders in the high-fidelity position 3D printing arena and will be part of our digital dental laboratory offering, which includes 3D scanners, software, installation of post-sales support. This agreement is yet another example of our commitment to complete -- to a complete and integrated digital dental solution in the operatory and, of course, in the lab.
Now on the Animal Health side. Once again, this group posted double-digit growth in local currencies in both North America and internationally. We saw particular strength in the United Kingdom and Australia as well as North America, except in the diagnostic category in North America. 
Just after the close of the quarter, we completed our acquisition of scil animal care, which I discussed at some length during our last quarterly conference call. In addition to fortifying our Animal Health equipment capabilities in North America and Europe, the scil animal health -- the scil animal care professionals will be expanding our diagnostic products category and working to gain market share for our Animal Health diagnostics partners, including, of course, Abaxis and Heska. 
We are pleased, thus far, with the Abaxis and Heska product lines. And we look forward to further market penetration and success with both of these excellent manufacturers. 
During last quarter's call, I mentioned a new software product called Axis-Q, which automates the workflow of diagnostic tests, eliminating the manual input of codes and automatically returning results to the electronic medical record in the vet office. We've made good advance -- we've made good progress here. There is good, advanced awareness of this product and we are on track to launch during the current quarter. So again, just like our Dental business, we are very excited about the progress that is unfolding in our Animal Health business, both in the United States and abroad. 
So on the Medical side, sales growth in this group was excellent and exceeded 12% in local currency. This reflects continued progress with large group practices and the IDN, the integrated delivery networks, at our up-markets, that's the very large accounts; and our mid-market, the midsized accounts. 
Growth also includes a full quarter of agency sales under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health. Our collaboration with Cardinal Health is proceeding well. Our sales teams have continued to make customer presentations at a combined -- as a combined selling organization, and the reception has been very good generally. We just had our National Sales Meeting of the combined sales forces, and it was really -- the morale and excitement, enthusiasm was quite remarkable. And we expect to have the integration substantially completed this quarter, in our second quarter, as we originally planned. 
So let me conclude my business overview with some remarks on the Technology and the Value-Added Services groups. This group of businesses continues to perform very well. International Technology and Value-Added Services posted double-digit internal sales growth in local currencies as we have -- as has actually been the case every quarter for more than 2 years. The advanced technology products and services sold by this group, of course, also provide a platform for further enhancing sales opportunity to customers across all businesses, a very profitable sector of Schein that also lends enormous stickiness to our relationship with customers on the consumable equipment, Financial Services and other business opportunities.
So before we open the call to questions, I'd like to highlight a few awards and rankings we recently received and really as a recognition to the terrific work our team has done. In February, Henry Schein ranked #1 on the Fortune list of the World's Most Admired Companies in the Wholesalers section for Health Care --  the Health Care industry category. This is the second consecutive #1 ranking for Henry Schein and the 14th consecutive year we have been named to this list. 
We also ranked first in all 9 subcategories within our industry. In March, we were named as the 2015 World's Most Ethical Company by Ethisphere Institute. This was the fourth consecutive year Henry Schein has been chosen by Ethisphere, and we are 1 of only 132 companies on it this year, and the only honoree in the health care products category. 
In April, we were named as one of America's Best Employers by Forbes Magazine, with a rank of 203 out of more than 3,500 companies considered. This is the first special list from Forbes with rankings based on independent and anonymous employee surveys. We take great pride in this ranking as it is based on the field work, with employees responding candidly about the employer. 
And yet, perhaps, from a financial point of view, the most exciting of all, effective March 17, Henry Schein was added to the S&P 500 Index. Inclusion in this iconic index is recognition of every Team Schein member's unwavering commitment to helping health care practitioners operate more efficient, successful practices while delivering the highest quality of care. 
Collectively, I think these 4 prestigious yet very different recognitions send a powerful message to our team and our customers about the strength, integrity and accomplishments of Henry Schein and, no doubt, will continue to result in good returns to our investors.
So with that overview of our quarterly financial operating performance, I'd like to thank you for your attention this morning. I would also like to thank our over 18,000 Team Schein members across the globe for their hard work and diligent efforts during this quarter and the quarters before. 
And now operator, we're ready to take questions."

In Germany was just a little bit of sluggishness during the quarter. There were some product movements in Australia and the U.K. that maybe also contributed. I think that what we believe is that there's no trends here that we're looking for a bit of a pickup in International Dental merchandise for the balance of the year. And I just would like to be cautious for a bit of a pickup. So it'll be a modest improvement, I think. But I think what we're really also happy with is the equipment side. Equipment, despite an IDS year, was very strong at a little over 5%, 5.4% growth. And while the typical markets, including Germany, is definitely impacted by the IDS market, we did see strong equipment growth in France and the U.K., in The Netherlands as well as Spain and Portugal. And at least the pipeline shows that it was a good IDS year, and we should expect good growth of equipment across the board in International for Q2 and beyond. So I don't think, Jeff, there's something that's a trend here. I just think, sometimes, you see a quarter that's particularly soft or strong, and it's just kind of the ebbs and flows of the markets."

And so out of those studies, we decided to focus on certain sectors in the medical arena and also formed our healthcare services group, which was focused on IDN, large group practices and these multiple locations under common management-type entities. And I think that our work has been recognized. I think it's clear in the marketplace that we are delivering well on our commitments with regard to these newer kinds of entities. And so we are picking up business and have been picking up business, but now actually fulfilling the orders. From the time we pick up a large account to the time we actually fulfill the orders, it could be as much as 1 year or so. So we have been speaking for a while about us doing well with these larger accounts, the IDNs, the -- as I mentioned, these different kinds of practices.

So first of all, Henry Schein's philosophy has been one of being committed to branded -- national branded manufacturers. So essentially -- I don't know the number today, Steven may have it, but well over 90% of our business is in branded products. Generally, we will come out with a private brand when the product is commoditized, rarely are we the first to come out with a private brand. We'd rather work with the branded manufacturer. But I would say some of these group practices on the commodity-type sales, the less technique-sensitive type of products in Dental are looking at the private brand. But I think our percentage of private brand sales in Dental has been quite static for a long time. The Medical side, there is a greater movement specifically on the commodity, the efficient control-type products to the private brand. In this case, I think we're also a bit of a follower in the marketplace. We generally work with the branded manufacturers until there is no option. And on the Animal Health side, there's some advancement in the area of generic drugs. But again, we tend to have very close relationships with the branded pharmaceutical companies and the areas we're making progress on are surgical type products, instruments, et cetera. At the same time, I think you know that we do have a number of exclusive products with the Colgate relationship in the U.S. and a few other countries, and these products are driving our -- or these relationships are driving our sales quite nicely.

First of all, Glen, the makeup of the businesses we've owned to date have been largely companion animal except, as I mentioned, the countries -- at the countries, Australia and a couple of other countries: New Zealand, Ireland, a few other. So that's where we've been. Those businesses are -- that book of business is generally very similar to our existing customers. These are practices, generally small -- SME, small, medium-sized enterprises, mainly our customers, but they are a growing group of consolidators. But the consolidators generally are multiple locations, multiple smallish practices under common management. So that group of customers has all of that in common. Generally, on the agricultural side, it's not the small practitioner or the midsized practitioners buying the products. It is, to a large extent, that it's these businesses that are buying the products, of course, pursuant very often to a prescription issued by a veterinarian. It's a different business. I'm not saying it's a bad business, it's a good business. I can tell you the business we're in, we're very happy with them. We see lots of runway. I think there are opportunities in the large animal space. Obviously, from a strategic point of view, we all know that there's going to be a greater demand for protein over time. Whether the demand will be in this country or abroad -- different people have ideas. Obviously, the developing world presents the biggest opportunity. So I would say there are opportunities in both markets, and we are very confident that we can continue to grow our companion animal business and make some entry into equine but also into select markets in the large animal production area. I think we do quite well... I think we do quite well outside the U.S., for example, in the dairy space. Go ahead, sorry."

And I think that's what we've done so well over the decades, the last couple of decades. So we have a robust pipeline. We generally do not participate in books that are put out by banks. We have, we've bought companies. But generally, the deals we do are where there's a personal relationship, where things have been worked out well in advance because a family would like us to buy out a percentage of the business, they want to keep one family member engaged, they want to keep some management engaged, they want to remain in the community. These kinds of deals are the kinds of deals we're the most comfortable with. We have no shortage. I think the pricing on some of these book deals that have been put out have been very, very high. And there's no need to participate in that sector. We have, and when prices become very high, I think you'll see Henry Schein not participate.

We do believe that there's more opportunity for margin expansion. Certainly, the restructuring activities will help that, and it did help that a bit in Q1. And this was -- if you look at operating expenses. Operating expenses, when you back out again the acquisitions and the restructuring costs drove most of it, operating expenses as a percentage of sales. So it's something we want to keep pushing on because it's very important to us, it's very important to our model. And we think there's lots of opportunity to continue to improve that. So we're going to keep pushing for the balance of the year and thereafter to continue to get that margin expansion."

It really wasn't any particular category that stood out. And we still feel very good about PlanScan/E4D. And when you look at internationally, I would say the same is true.

It is a brand and we're bringing in an extensive offering, thousands of products. I'd be happy to give you the exact number, but I don't have it in front of me. But I know it's thousands, and Steve can give you the exact number. So we will be promoting their brand, of course, not only in the Medical arena but also in the Dental and the vet space. And we will be doing some purchasing from them on the generic drugs side, on the generic pharma side. So I think there's going to be quite a bit of opportunity for them to grow in sales to us and us to gain synergies on the purchasing side. The physician space, it's hard to get specific utilization data because it's not as -- typically broken out and where does the hospital begin and where does it end and where does the ASC begin and end.  But generally we believe we are well positioned to gain business in the ultimate care sector, the physician space, the smaller ambulatory care space and even the larger ambulatory care space and also areas such as retail clinics and community centers, et cetera. So they, of course, will help us with the IDNs, as they have many IDNs that they are either exclusive or relatively exclusive and I think they will bring us in over time. Having said that, we have a number of IDNs that we are active in unrelated to Cardinal. So I think our view that the physician space, the orphan space presents runway for us, is reaffirmed as we get more and more into our relationship with Cardinal. And at the same time, we are really excited about the entry they give us into IDNs that probably had never heard of us or if they had heard of us, didn't understand our capabilities. What I can tell you is the enthusiasm at our National Sales Meeting of the combined sales forces was something I have not seen at Schein in a while. The Cardinal representatives, of course, love the company, but the company was really more focused on the acute care side. And we are focused on the physician side, and we have tools that they didn't have available to them. So generally, I think this has been an outstanding start. We actually go live this week, actually, and hope to have the integration completed this quarter. So we're very excited about the momentum, and I think the customer base is as well and obviously the salespeople."

Middle-class and above have access to primary care physicians; very poor -- had it through the primary care physicians, through general insurance and through Medicare and the elderly of course. And then the very poor who had access to primary care physicians through Medicaid. But there's a whole group of people in the middle that didn't have access to a primary care physician. If these people were sick, they would go to the emergency room, but there was no real preventative programs for these people. Health care reform is about providing primary care. Of course, the debate is who's going to pay for it. The taxpayers, the government reducing cost in certain areas, et cetera, but that's not as important to us as more primary care will be practiced in this country, in the United States. And so that is good for our business. And we can see that the primary care side is gearing up. Obviously, the cost per procedure, reimbursement per procedure will go down as it is more about the outcomes as we move from sick care to health care. And we believe that this presents a huge opportunity for our Medical businesses. This is why we're focused in the space. And we believe that some of those opportunities are already being harvested. And we expect that to continue in the future as wellness -- prevention becomes a bigger part of the whole health care focus. So I can't give you specifics, but I can tell you why we are so enthusiastic about our medical group."

Our second quarter financial results were solid with internal sales growth in local currencies in each of our 4 business groups doing well.

For the second quarter, changes in currency exchange rates reduced our total sales growth by 7% and reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.07. That's $0.07 compared to the last year.

In a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent financial performance and business accomplishments, but I just would like to give you a little flavor on 2 meetings I just participated here in Paris. I'm in Paris, and Steven is in New York. 
I spent several hours with our international Animal Health team, and we'd like to let the shareholders know and investors know that this team is doing outstanding work as they execute on globalizing our Animal Health business and of course, at the same time, gaining market share and increasing the profitability of the business. 
Likewise, our practice solutions software team on the international side, Dental got together in Paris, too, and this is by coincidence. They were both the same city. So I decided to come over, and I can confirm also that this group is doing very well in executing our global practice solutions plan and of course, increasing profits in that sector, too. So in a 1-day period of time, I experienced some really exciting activity going on here at Henry Schein. 
So let me ask Steve to review our quarterly financial results with you, and then I'll come back and give you some comments on performance and business accomplishments in general. So Steve?"
339447,306835465,841033,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I am also pleased to report solid results for the second quarter of 2015. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 second quarter results include restructuring costs of $7.2 million pretax or $0.06",1461,"Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I am also pleased to report solid results for the second quarter of 2015. 
As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 second quarter results include restructuring costs of $7.2 million pretax or $0.06 per diluted share. We announced this restructuring on our third quarter 2014 conference call. As we mentioned then, this initiative is expected to continue throughout the remainder of 2015. 
You could look at Exhibit B to this morning's earnings news release, which reconciles our GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations. I will also be discussing our results as reported and excluding these restructuring costs as we believe the latter is more reflective of our ongoing performance. 
So now turning to our Q2 results. Net sales for the quarter ended June 27, 2015, were $2.6 billion, reflecting 0.5% increase compared with the second quarter of 2014. This consisted of 7.5% growth in local currencies and a 7% decline related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, our internally generated sales increased 3.9%, and acquisition growth was an additional 3.6%. You can note the details of sales growth that are contained in Exhibit A of today's earnings news release. 
Our operating margin for the second quarter of 2015 was 7.0%, which expanded by 5 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2014. However, excluding the restructuring costs, which we believe is the more meaningful measure, our adjusted operating margin for the quarter -- for the second quarter of 2015 improved by 32 basis points to 7.2%. 
When also excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during the past 12 months and related expenses, operating margin expanded by 45 basis points compared with the second quarter of last year. The expansion was primarily the result of an increase in sales mix towards higher-margin products. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.8%. This is on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the restructuring costs, and this compares with 30.8% last year. The slightly lower tax rate is due to the implementation of ongoing tax strategies as well as higher earnings in countries with lower tax rates. We continue to expect that the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in this 30% range. 
Turning to net income attributable to Henry Schein. For the second quarter of 2015, it was $117.9 million or $1.40 per diluted share. This represents growth of 1.5% and 3.7%, respectively, compared with the second quarter. 
Again, excluding restructuring cost in the current quarter, net income attributable to Henry Schein was $123.2 million or $1.46 per diluted share, and that represents increases of 6% and 8%, respectively, compared with last year's second quarter. 
Again as Stanley mentioned at the onset, our foreign currency exchange had a negative impact of a full $0.07 per share on the EPS for the current quarter. 
If we now look at some of the detail of our sales results for the second quarter, our Dental sales for the second quarter of 2015 declined 3.5% to $1.3 billion, but this 3.5% decline consisted of 4.5% growth in local currency and an 8% decline related against a foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, internally generated sales was 4.1%, and acquisition growth was an additional 0.4%. Of this 4.1% internal growth in local currencies, we saw 3.7% growth in North America and 4.6% growth internationally. 
I'll go through a little bit of detail behind each of these 2 figures. The 3.7% internal growth in local currencies from North America included a very strong 5.4% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and a 1.9% decline in Dental equipment sales and service revenues. 
In looking at North American Dental equipment results, you should recall that last year's second quarter internal growth in local currencies was 10.8%. That made for a difficult prior year comparison. 
If we now turn to the International business. The 4.6% internal growth in local currencies included 2% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and a strong 11.8% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenue. 
Of course, the growth in the international equipment business included a favorable impact on the equipment related to the IDS tradeshow. 
Animal Health sales was $748.6 million in the quarter, down 0.8%, but this included growth of 7.9% in local currencies and an 8.7% decline related to foreign currency exchange again. If we look at the internal sales growth in local currencies, they were 0.6% [indiscernible] contributed an additional 7.3% growth. 
I'll split now that 0.6% growth between North America and international. The North America included a 4.1% decline, and the international growth was a 4.8% increase. That 4.1% decline in internal sales in local currencies in the North American market was 5.2% growth when normalizing for the results to account for the impact of certain products switching between agency and direct sales as well as the changes to our veterinary diagnostic and manufacturer relationships. 
Again, we believe this normalized growth is a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North America and Animal Health business, and for the balance of the year until this annualizes, we will continue to review our results, both on a reported basis and on a normalized basis. 
Turning to our Medical sales. They were $470.5 million in the second quarter. That's an increase of 16.7%. This is 17.7% growth in local currencies and a 1% decline in foreign currency exchange. Internal sales in local currencies grew almost 10% at 9.9% while acquisitions contributed an additional 7.8% to growth. 
Our 9.9% internal growth in local currencies in North America was 10.4%, and it was led again by large group practices in IDN networks growth, and internationally, we saw an additional 1.3% growth. 
Acquisition growth during the second quarter included both agency revenue as well as direct sales growth under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health. I can say now that the majority of the Cardinal Health physician business customers that have been acquired have transitioned to Henry Schein, and we are recording substantially all of those sales under this agreement as direct sales. 
If you look at Technology and Value-Added Services sales, they were $89.5 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 0.4%, and this included 3.3% growth in local currencies and a decline of 2.9% again related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, we saw our internal growth of 2.9% and acquisition growth of 4%. That 2.9% growth, breaking it up between North America and international, was 2.6% growth in North America and 3.9% international. 
If we look at our stock repurchase program, we're continuing to repurchase common stock in the open market during the quarter. We repurchased approximately 267,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $140.58 per share. That was approximately $38 million, and that impact on our diluted EPS was immaterial. 
At the close of the quarter, we had an additional $187 million authorized for future repurchases, and we remain committed to our goal of repurchasing between $200 million and $300 million of stock for the full year. 
If we look at some highlights on our balance sheet and cash flow, operating cash flow for the quarter was $207.8 million, up from $199.2 million in last year's second quarter. We continue to believe that we'll have strong operating cash flow for the full year. 
Our accounts receivable days sales improved slightly to 39.3 days compared to 40.2 days last year, and inventory turns were slightly down, 5.8 turns this year, 6.0 turns last year. 
I'll conclude my remarks by reaffirming our 2015 financial guidance as follows. For the year 2015, we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be $5.90 to $6 per share, which represents growth of 8% to 10% compared with the 2014 results. 
Assuming the strength of the U.S. dollar stays at current levels, we expect -- we continue to expect that the adjusted EPS maybe at the lower end of this range as we mentioned last quarter. Keep in mind that approximately 35% of our worldwide sales are in currencies other than U.S. dollar, and year-to-date, we have experienced about $0.13 or $0.14 of negative impact in EPS directly related to the foreign exchange changes. 
Our 2015 guidance excludes restructuring costs, which are expected to be between $0.29 and $0.33 per share, and that's related, of course, to the planned corporate initiative to rationalize the company's operations and provide expense efficiencies. And as always, our guidance is for continuing -- current continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stan."
339447,306835465,841033,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steven.

In North America, consumable merchandise internal sales growth in local currencies was strong at 5.4%. This growth indicates that patient traffic to Dental offices continues to be solid. Indeed, for the past 4 quarters, consumable merchandise internal sales growth in North America have been consistently in the mid-4% to 5% range. 
Equipment sales and service revenue in local currencies in the second quarter declined 1.9%, however, against a difficult prior year comparison as Steven mentioned. We expect North American Dental equipment sales to accelerate in the second half of the year with a good backlog reported at this point. 
Looking at International Dental, consumable merchandise internal sales in local currency returned to positive growth of 2% for the quarter compared with a decline of 1.6% in the first quarter. 
Equipment sales and service internal growth in local currency was 11.8% was a multiyear high and included a favorable impact from the biannual international sales show, the IDS, which took place this past March in Germany. 
So now let's spend a few minutes or a minute actually on the Animal Health side. The growth of this group was aided by strategic acquisitions in North America and internationally. Our normalized internal sales growth in North America continue to be very solid. 
We recently announced 2 acquisitions in the Animal Health space that will expand our global direct presence while bringing market leaders to Henry Schein. First, we announced plans to acquire a majority interest in Jorgen Kruuse. KRUUSE is a leading distributor of veterinary suppliers to the northern countries with sales in 2014 of approximately $19 million (sic) ($90 million). KRUUSE will extend Henry Schein's direct presence in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. 
We expect this transaction will close later in the third quarter of 2015. KRUUSE offers a comprehensive portfolio of proprietary products and branded consumable merchandise as well as pet accessories, capital equipment and pet food to veterinary clinics and retail pet stores. We plan to expand the KRUUSE line of proprietary products in Animal Health customers across Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand as well as Asia. 
KRUUSE serves customers in more than 100 countries through a network of distribution partners. We are delighted to enter the Nordic Animal Health market with a well-recognized family company. KRUUSE enjoys deep customer loyalty and satisfaction as well as a reputation for quality products and strong brand awareness. 
Also during the second quarter, we acquired a 50% ownership investment in Maravet a leading Animal Health distributor in Romania. Maravet has annual sales of $23 million, and like KRUUSE, we purchased our interest from the founding family, which continues to own the balance of the company. 
Our investments in Maravet adds to our Eastern European presence, which we established in the Czech Republic in 2009 and later expanded to Poland with our acquisition of Medivet last year. 
With the recent acquisition of KRUUSE, Maravet and scil, our Animal Health business continued to strive while gaining market share through a combination of organic growth and of course, the strategic transactions. When the KRUUSE acquisition closes, Henry Schein Animal Health business will expand to 23 countries including the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, China, Malaysia and 17 other countries in Europe. 
Now let me talk a bit about the Medical business. Internal sales growth in our North American Medical business continued at a double-digit pace as we made further progress with large group practices and IDNs integrated delivery networks. 
During the quarter, we recorded sales under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health and agency sales and direct sales as we integrated the business. Our transaction with Cardinal continues on plant with the majority of Cardinal Health acquired customers now successfully transitioned to the Henry Schein platform. We remain optimistic about our ability to win new customers with Cardinal by being uniquely positioned to jointly serve the entire continuum arc of care. 
So let me conclude now with an overview of our Technology and Value-Added Services. Internal sales growth in this group in North America is 2.6% in local currencies and international -- internal growth rate was 3.9% in local currency. So North America, 2.6%; and internationally, 3.9% in local currency. 
The advanced technology products and services we offer support our commitment to the efficiency of delivery of health care services and a platform with further enhancement of sales opportunities across the entire business. The group also serves to differentiate Henry Schein from our competitors while deepening and strengthening our relationships with our customers. The software and value-added services component of this business fits very well, and we have some strong numbers that we were up against on our equipment side of the business. 
So overall, this business again continues to do very well. So before we open the call to questions, let me give some highlights and some recent news. As we continue to advance our strategic plan, we have made Peter McCarthy President of the Global Animal Health group. Peter has provided important leadership in the growth of our International Animal Health operations, most recently as President of our Animal Health international group. 
In addition, Henry Schein recently appointed Francis Dirksmeier, Fran, as President of Henry Schein Animal Health North America reporting to Peter. Fran brings more than 30 years of commercial leadership experience, most recently serving as General Manager of GE Healthcare in Global Asset Management and hospital operations. Fran's background, by the way, is significant distribution in health care and also software and the connection between distribution and software resulting in the Value-Added Services that have made a difference in the business that he's supporting over the years and now bringing that know-how to Henry Schein Animal Health as well. 
Now just a key component part of Henry Schein's success is our relationship with our constituents, our suppliers, our teams and our customers in the social outreach area. Through the second quarter, Henry Schein once again stepped up to support relief efforts for several disaster situations. Together with our supplier partners, we committed $0.5 million in product donations to support victims of a devastating earthquake that struck Nepal. And here in the U.S., we were active -- we activated our hotline to support customers affected by severe storms and flooding in South Central region of our country while also providing support to our nongovernmental organization partners and their need for health care products and system relief efforts. 
So these are but 2 examples but a key in driving morale, customer support, supplier support and of course, of course, the morale generally in the company and amongst all of our constituents. 
Educating future generation of dentists and supporting advanced technology are both ongoing commitments at Henry Schein. We combined these 2 passions, we're proudly announcing the creation of a Henry Schein digital center of excellence at the Kornberg School of Dentistry at Temple University in Philadelphia. We expect that over the next 12 months, this center will serve as a digital dentistry training hub with students, faculty and alumni and will be equipped with the latest innovations of digital technology from Henry Schein and our supplier partners. 
We are committed to advancing our position, our global position in digitalized dentistry and at the same time, combining that with closer relations with our customers and educational institutions that graduate customers in the Dental, Medical and veterinary space. 
In late June, we were honored to be selected as Corporation of the Year by the Association of Hispanic Healthcare executives, in recognition of our commitment to increase diversity and cultural competency in health care professions. 
And last, we continue to plan Fortune 500 list of America's largest company. We have been named in this list for the past 11 years and now ranked 287, up from 292 a year ago. Our inclusion in this list is testament to the shared commitment and value of the more than 18,000 Team Schein Members across the globe, all of whom are dedicated to helping practitioners improve the efficiency of the practice to provide quality care, and the fact that we were ranked and had been ranked really since we've been listed in the Fortune 500 companies as one of the Most Admired Companies in health care distribution being ranked #1 this past year again is really a testament to our team, our customers and our suppliers. 
So with that overview of our quarterly financial operating performance, Steve and I are ready to take questions."

Stan, just kind of curious about some of your comments on the Medical segment. It's clear the company continues to post pretty impressive growth there, and for a number of quarters, you highlighted the focus on large group practices and integrated delivery networks. I'm kind of curious can you maybe comment on the Cardinal Health relationship, and Steve, I don't know if there's any way to maybe roughly sort of quantify maybe how much of that added and we should think about as we think about modeling going forward, like when you may anniversary that benefit and just some overall sense for maybe how fast the market maybe growing organically."

On the first line of the equation is the fact that we have taken over distribution of Cardinal's product line and of course, its sales to customers that are small practitioners. Then on the other side is the IDNs, the large group practices, the large -- the multiple locations managed by IDNs as well as group practices, and that has also gone very, very well for us. That business is primarily a transition to us, but this is all built on a relationship when we are securing product, own brand product from Cardinal and doing some joint procurement, and that has also worked quite well for us. So the customer that are being serviced by Henry Schein, former Cardinal customers, I believe are very happy with the service we're providing and at the same time, will be benefiting from the Cardinal brand, and our pricing opportunities in this marketplace will also help our customers and help drive operating margin at Henry Schein side. I happen to also add that the internal growth from the Henry Schein core business, which is significantly now focused on IDN large group practices, is also performing very well when you exclude the impact of Cardinal, which in itself is also doing well."

So really Q2 was the first quarter that we recorded sales, direct sales from the transaction. Q1, we were recording effectively agency sales. But as we started the integration process during Q2, as we integrate sales onto our platform, we record direct sales. You can see that the acquisition sales growth was 4.6% for the quarter. It'll annualized. We're continuing to integrate. We would expect that the integration will continue probably through the better part of Q3. At that point, we should have all or virtually all of the sales on our platform. The run rate that I would use for modeling going forward is something north of maybe $250 million, but I don't have a more precise number at this time, and that'll get phased in starting with Q4, we'll probably be at that rate, and that's on all direct sales basis assuming that there's no more agency sales at that point. And they should be some growth as we continue to add product assortment, and we continue to drive growth to those customers."

Remember, we're going through a little bit of transition. We added the A-dec line. So there's a learning curve, and there's that, that we're focusing on in the U.S. I would say that if you look at the components, in North America, I think that the bright spots of the equipment was traditional equipment was the bright spot for us. We were a little bit soft on technology in a large part because PlanScan had upgrades last year, but still soft in technology despite that. But we're feeling good like equipment is going to be a good driver for us for the second half of the year."

So first of all, it would be 30 -- 33 countries now, and of course, we do service especially on the Dental side dentists throughout the world through I mentioned 33. We're actually on the ground distribution centers, call centers, field salespeople in 33 countries. I will say to you that Europe was a good opportunity. We're going to be going against lower comps as the year progresses, and I think we will be seeing some good growth in a couple of markets as the year progresses, and I think going into next year. So in Europe as a basket, we took a bit of a hit last year is I think recovering. As you saw, the German equipment numbers in general were pretty good, driven largely by Germany but not exclusively by Germany. So I think equipment appetite is good. I think there's a growing demand for digitalized dentistry, both in the dentist's office, chairside dentistry, chairside digitalized prosthetics and in the laboratory, which is not only interested in ensuring that the customers have scanners to submit the prosthetics but also within the lab, where there's a lot of opportunity for digitalized equipment. We're seeing this quite nicely coming out of the sales acquisition, but not only out of that acquisition, which in itself leads to blocks sales, where we see good margin and some unique opportunities for Henry Schein in that space. So that leads, of course, into consumables, and I think it's fair to say that although the markets in Europe are a little bit anemic, they're getting stronger, and Henry Schein, I think, will continue to gain market share. There's nice opportunity in Australia and New Zealand on the Dental side, and I would say on the Animal Health side, too. Let me just go back I think our European Animal Health business is also in very good shape. We've got good products, great management and some really good opportunity. And if you go around the world, I have to say that the Dental business in Australia presents really nice opportunity as well. I think we're quite optimistic about our business in Asia. There's a lot more work to be done in establishing a platform, and we're hopeful that over time, we'll be able to extend our presence in Japan and China. So we're quite optimistic about our International business."

I think the psychology in the Dental market in North America, the U.S. I'm referring to the whole of North America is a positive one, and I think dentists are realizing.

So if you look at some of the technology out there, which helps increase the efficiency of the practice improves on the workflow the resulting in a better experience for the customer and better productivity. You put the mindset together, the optimism the technology can bring to the practice and the ultimate efficiency and productivity. It needs to have good mindset in technology driven products, and so I think that's where we will see quite a bit of upside. In addition, I think dentists are feeling pretty good and should be in a position, we think, for the remainder of the year to invest in some of the traditional equipment. I think our expanded mine will help us in that regard from a purely Henry Schein point of view. So I think it's less to do with the specific uptake a couple of basis points here or there and more to do with the mindset, which is pretty good right now in dentistry.

One is the area that is likely part of health care that is likely to be moving the most rapidly, and we determined that to be the site and the physician provider because of the anticipated Health Care Reform implications, namely, wellness and prevention. So we decided to focus on the physician side of health care, and we said to ourselves as part of that what kind of physician providers and determined it's likely to be larger groups. So consolidation attractiveness into larger groups and at the same time, IDN, integrated delivery networks would be expanding their presence into this large group arena. So we set up our health care services group I think 7 years ago to focus on those part of the Medical business, and we focus very deeply on it. We are not distracted with acquisitions. There were some very large properties available that service the smaller practitioner groups and some of the single practitioners, the 1, 2, 3 practitioner. We focus on the large group practices and the IDNs through our health care services group, and that's done very well at the same time, we said to ourselves one specialties that are going to be the most productive from a sales point of view and more importantly, from a margin point of view, and we've turned with specialty we wanted to focus on, and we did that as well. You take the 2 together, it's resulting in top line growth, internal growth and of course, operating margin expansion in our Medical Group. You put that together with our cardinal alignment, and it's an acquisition of the sales in the space, but then you add to that the procurement opportunities that we had to procure products under their brand and to jointly advance better procurement between our 2 businesses, and the net result is top line growth and margin expansion for our Medical business."

So we believe that is an opportunity. Not sure if distribution of branded pharmaceuticals is necessary the best play in that space. It may be, but there's opportunity here for niche products with high margin, and so, for example, I think the KRUUSE opportunity will be very, very good for us. The scil opportunity will be very, very good for us on the equipment side, and the bending instrumentation offering in the instrument side will be very good for us. We're adding resource in that space, expect to add more products time, gain more margin and have a very profitable business that will be focused on the large animal side as well. But I'm just not sure it's a tonnage lots and lots of sales in branded pharmaceutical is the way to go and whether that's the place to put capital and certainly not the place, in our view, to put capital a very expensive cost to put that work -- that capital to work. We do seem opportunity this space, and we do business in a number of countries in the large animal space, dairy space in the various other areas and remain quite optimistic about that, but I think our play will be a little bit different given our strengths in the business today and the opportunities ahead of us. Just going back to the question on the diagnostics we were, of course, taken by surprise in this space, but I believe that our team has come together quite quickly in putting together an excellent offering, global offering of diagnostics. We're working very well with Abaxis and Heska and in combination with our practice solutions business, the Software business here in the United States and abroad and our big data opportunities, will I think have some really exciting opportunities for our customers and our suppliers going forward. So although we were quite surprised by what happened considering that we had we thought it was a good relationship with the supplier, we remain very, very optimistic specifically with our Axis-Q bidirectional integrated solution that includes workflow reduces missed patient opportunities in the practice. So we have added good resources in that area, have really good management good team in the diagnostics space, more to follow and remain very, very excited both in equipment arena and with the rapid test, it's amazing how many suppliers come to us from around the world and say now we see an opportunity for you in the space, but our anchor, of course, is Abaxis and Heska."

It's in the Value-Added Services and now particular case is we have 4,000 field sales consultants around the world that are specialists in practice management, understand how a practice should be run and help our customers operate a more efficient business so that they can provide better clinical care and that drives manufacturers moving towards us, and I believe that's the case in all 3 businesses.

Of course, we have challenges like every single business does, and in particular the biggest challenge we have right now is the relative exchange rate between the euro to dollar and the euro, and we are doing -- working very hard and expect to be successful in mitigating that conversion risk with other areas of increased profitability in the business. We are advancing our strategies in geographic expansion, market share growth, margin expansions through advancing products that present greater value to our customers, greater margin and are managing our expenses, expecting to reap some benefits from the restructuring that we announced last year.

Our second quarter financial results were solid, with internal sales growth in local currencies in each of our 4 business groups doing well. And as was also the case during the previous quarter, the strength of the U.S. dollar impacted all of our international operations and, of course, those particularly in Europe. 
For the second quarter, changes in currency exchange rates reduced our total sales growth by 7% and reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.07. That's $0.07 compared to the last year. Overall, the global markets we serve were healthy during the quarter, and we believe we continue to gain market share. 
We are pleased to reaffirm our guidance range for 2015 adjusted diluted EPS and expect that our restructuring activities will continue to favorably impact our ongoing results. 
In a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent financial performance and business accomplishments, but I just would like to give you a little flavor on 2 meetings I just participated in here in Paris. I'm in Paris, and Steven is in New York. I spent several hours with our international Animal Health team, and we'd like to let the shareholders know and investors know that this team is doing outstanding work as they execute on globalizing our Animal Health business and, of course, at the same time, gaining market share and increasing the profitability of the business. 
Likewise, our Practice Solutions software team, on the international side, Dental, got together in Paris, too, and this is by coincidence. They were both in the same city, so I decided to come over. And I can confirm also that this group is doing very well and executing our global practice solutions plan and, of course, increasing profits in that sector, too. So in a 1-day period of time, I experienced some really exciting activity going on here at Henry Schein. 
So let me ask Steve to review our quarterly financial results with you, and then I'll come back and give you some comments on performance and business accomplishments in general. So Steve?"

I am also pleased to report solid results for the second quarter of 2015. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 second quarter results include restructuring costs of $7.2 million pretax or $0.06",1462,"Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I am also pleased to report solid results for the second quarter of 2015. 
As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 second quarter results include restructuring costs of $7.2 million pretax or $0.06 per diluted share. We announced this restructuring on our third quarter 2014 conference call. As we mentioned then, this initiative is expected to continue throughout the remainder of 2015. 
You could look at exhibit B to this morning's earnings news release, which reconciles our GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations. I will also be discussing our results as reported and excluding these restructuring costs as we believe the latter is more reflective of our ongoing performance. 
So now turning to our Q2 results. Net sales for the quarter ended June 27, 2015, were $2.6 billion, reflecting 0.5% increase compared with the second quarter of 2014. This consisted of 7.5% growth in local currencies and a 7% decline related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, our internally generated sales increased 3.9%, and acquisition growth was an additional 3.6%. You can note the details of sales growth that are contained in exhibit A of today's earnings news release. 
Our operating margin for the second quarter of 2015 was 7.0%, which expanded by 5 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2014. However, excluding the restructuring costs, which we believe is the more meaningful measure, our adjusted operating margin for the quarter -- for the second quarter of 2015 improved by 32 basis points to 7.2%. 
When also excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during the past 12 months and related expenses, operating margin expanded by 45 basis points compared with the second quarter of last year. The expansion was primarily the result of an increase in sales mix towards higher-margin products. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.8%. This is on a non-GAAP basis excluding the restructuring costs, and this compares with 30.8% last year. The slightly lower tax rate is due to the implementation of ongoing tax strategies as well as higher earnings in countries with lower tax rates. We continue to expect the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in this 30% range. 
Turning to net income attributable to Henry Schein. For the second quarter of 2015, it was $117.9 million or $1.40 per diluted share. This represents growth of 1.5% and 3.7%, respectively, compared with the second quarter. 
Again, excluding restructuring costs in the current quarter, net income attributable to Henry Schein was $123.2 million or $1.46 per diluted share. And that represents increases of 6% and 8%, respectively, compared with last year's second quarter. 
Again, as Stanley mentioned at the onset, our foreign currency exchange had a negative impact of a full $0.07 per share on the EPS for the current quarter. 
If we now look at some of the detail of our sales results for the second quarter, our Dental sales for the second quarter of 2015 declined 3.5% to $1.3 billion, but this 3.5% decline consisted of 4.5% growth in local currency and an 8% decline related, again, to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, internally generated sales was 4.1%, and acquisition growth was an additional 0.4%. Of this 4.1% internal growth in local currencies, we saw 3.7% growth in North America and 4.6% growth internationally. I'll go through a little bit of detail behind each of these 2 figures. The 3.7% internal growth in local currencies from North America included a very strong 5.4% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and a 1.9% decline in Dental equipment sales and service revenues. 
In looking at North American Dental equipment results, you should recall that last year's second quarter internal growth in local currencies was 10.8%. That made for a difficult prior year comparison. 
If we now turn to the International business. The 4.6% internal growth in local currencies included 2% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and a strong 11.8% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenue. 
Of course, the growth in the international equipment business included a favorable impact on the equipment related to the IDS trade show. 
Animal Health sales was $748.6 million for the quarter, down 0.8%, but this included growth of 7.9% in local currencies and an 8.7% decline related to foreign currency exchange again. If we look at the internal sales growth in local currencies, they were 0.6%, and acquisitions [ph] contributed an additional 7.3% growth. 
I'll split now that 0.6% growth between North America and International. The North America included a 4.1% decline, and the International growth was a 4.8% increase. That 4.1% decline in internal sales in local currencies in the North American market was 5.2% growth when normalizing for the results to account for the impact of certain products switching between agency and direct sales as well as the changes to our veterinary diagnostic manufacturer relationships. 
Again, we believe this normalized growth is a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business. And for the balance of the year until this annualizes, we will continue to review our results both on a reported basis and on a normalized basis. 
Turning to our Medical sales. They were $470.5 million in the second quarter. That's an increase of 16.7%. This is 17.7% growth in local currencies and a 1% decline in foreign currency exchange. Internal sales in local currencies grew almost 10% at 9.9% while acquisitions contributed an additional 7.8% to growth. 
Our 9.9% internal growth in local currencies in North America was 10.4%, and it was led again by large group practices and IDN networks growth, and internationally, we saw an additional 1.3% growth. 
Acquisition growth during the second quarter included both agency revenue as well as direct sales growth under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health. I can say now that the majority of the Cardinal Health physician business customers that have been acquired have transitioned to Henry Schein, and we are recording substantially all of those sales under this agreement as direct sales. 
If you look at Technology and Value-Added Service sales, they were $89.5 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 0.4%, and this included 3.3% growth in local currencies and a decline of 2.9%, again, related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, we saw internal growth of 2.9% and acquisition growth of 4%. That 2.9% growth, breaking it up between North America and International, was 2.6% growth in North America and 3.9% internationally. 
If we look at our stock repurchase program, we're continuing to repurchase common stock in the open market during the quarter. We repurchased approximately 267,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $140.58 per share, and that was approximately $38 million. And that impact on our diluted EPS was immaterial. At the close of the quarter, we had an additional $187 million authorized for future repurchases, and we remain committed to our goal of repurchasing between $200 million and $300 million of stock for the full year. 
If we look at some highlights on our balance sheet and cash flow. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $207.8 million, up from $199.2 million in last year second quarter. We continue to believe that we'll have strong operating cash flow for the full year. 
Our accounts receivable days sales improved slightly to 39.3 days compared to 40.2 days last year, and inventory turns were slightly down, 5.8 turns this year, 6.0 turns last year. 
I'll conclude my remarks by reaffirming our 2015 financial guidance as follows. For the year 2015, we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be $5.90 to $6 per share, which represents growth of 8% to 10% compared with the 2014 results. 
Assuming the strength of the U.S. dollar stays at current levels, we expect -- we continue to expect that the adjusted EPS may be at the lower end of this range, as we mentioned last quarter. Keep in mind that approximately 35% of our worldwide sales are in currencies other than U.S. dollar, and year-to-date, we have experienced about $0.13 or $0.14 of negative impact in EPS directly related to the foreign exchange changes. 
Our 2015 guidance excludes restructuring costs, which are expected to be between $0.29 and $0.33 per share, and that's related, of course, to the planned corporate initiative to rationalize the company's operations and provide expense efficiencies. And as always, our guidance is for continuing -- current continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stan."

In North America, consumable merchandise internal sales growth in local currencies was strong at 5.4%. This growth indicates that patient traffic to Dental offices continues to be solid. Indeed, for the past 4 quarters, consumable merchandise internal sales growth in North America has been consistently in the mid-4% to 5% range. 
Equipment sales and service revenue in local currencies in the second quarter declined 1.9%. However, against the difficult prior year comparison that Steven mentioned, we expect North American Dental equipment sales and service growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, with a good backlog report at this point. 
Looking at International Dental, consumable merchandise internal sales in local currency returned to positive growth of 2% for the quarter compared with a decline of 1.6% in the first quarter. 
Equipment sales and service internal growth in local currency was 11.8%, was a multiyear high and included favorable impact from the biannual International Dental Show, the IDS, which took place this past March in Germany. 
So now let's spend a few minutes or a minute actually on the Animal Health side. With growth of this group that was aided by strategic acquisitions in North America and internationally, our normalized internal sales growth in North America continue to be very solid. 
We recently announced 2 acquisitions in the animal health space that will expand our global direct presence while bringing market leaders to Henry Schein. First, we announced plans to acquire a majority interest in Jorgen Kruuse. KRUUSE is a leading distributor of veterinary suppliers to the northern countries, with sales in 2014 of approximately $19 million (sic) ($90 million). KRUUSE will extend Henry Schein's direct presence in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. We expect this transaction will close later in the third quarter of 2015. 
KRUUSE offers a comprehensive portfolio of proprietary products and branded consumable merchandise as well as pet accessories, capital equipment and pet food to veterinary clinics and retail pet stores. We plan to expand the KRUUSE line of proprietary products in Animal Health customers across Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand as well as Asia. 
KRUUSE serves customers in more than 100 countries through a network of distribution partners. We are delighted to enter the Nordic animal health market with a well-recognized family company. KRUUSE enjoys deep customer loyalty and satisfaction as well as a reputation for quality products and strong brand awareness. 
Also during the second quarter, we acquired a 50% ownership investment in Maravet, a leading animal health distributor in Romania. Maravet has annual sales of $23 million, and like KRUUSE, we purchased our interest from the founding family, which continues to own the balance of the company. Our investment in Maravet adds to our Eastern European presence, which we established in the Czech Republic in 2009 and later expanded to Poland with our acquisition of Medivet last year. 
With the recent acquisition of KRUUSE, Maravet and scil, our Animal Health business continues to thrive while gaining market share through a combination of organic growth and, of course, the strategic transactions. When the KRUUSE acquisition closes, Henry Schein Animal Health business will expand to 23 countries, including the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, China, Malaysia and 17 other countries in Europe. 
Now let me talk a bit about the Medical business. Internal sales growth in our North American Medical business continued at a double-digit pace as we made further progress with large group practices and IDNs, the integrated delivery networks. 
During the quarter, we recorded sales under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health as agency sales and direct sales as we integrated the business. Our transaction with Cardinal continues on plan, with the majority of Cardinal Health acquired customers now successfully transitioned to the Henry Schein platform. We remain optimistic about our ability to win new customers with Cardinal by being uniquely positioned to jointly serve the entire continuum arc of care. 
So let me conclude now with an overview of our Technology and Value-Added Services. Internal sales growth in this group in North America is 2.6% in local currencies, and International internal growth rate was 3.9% in local currencies. So North America, 2.6%; and internationally, 3.9% in local currencies. 
The advanced technology products and services we offer support our commitment to the efficiency of delivery of health care services and a platform with further enhancement of sales opportunities across the entire business. The group also serves to differentiate Henry Schein from our competitors while deepening and strengthening our relationship with our customers. The software and value-added services component of this business fits very well, and we have some strong numbers that we were up against on our equipment side of this business. So overall, this business again continues to do very well. 
So before we open the call to questions, let me give some highlights and some recent news. As we continue to advance our strategic plan, we have made Peter McCarthy President of the Global Animal Health Group. Peter has provided important leadership in the growth of our International Animal Health operations, most recently as President of our Animal Health International Group. 
In addition, Henry Schein recently appointed Francis Dirksmeier, Fran, as President of Henry Schein Animal Health North America, reporting to Peter. Fran brings more than 30 years of commercial leadership experience, most recently serving as General Manager of GE Healthcare in global asset management and hospital operation. Fran's background, by the way, is significant distribution in health care and also software and the connection between distribution and software, resulting in the value-added Services that have made a difference in the businesses he supported over the years and now bringing that know-how to Henry Schein Animal Health as well. 
Now just a key component part of Henry Schein's success is our relationship with our constituents, our suppliers, our team and our customers in the social outreach area. Through the second quarter, Henry Schein once again stepped up to support relief efforts for several disaster situations. Together with our supplier partners, we committed $0.5 million in product donations to support victims of a devastating earthquake that struck Nepal. And here in the U.S., we were active -- we activated our Disaster Relief Hotline to support customers affected by severe storms and flooding in the South Central region of our country while also providing support to our nongovernmental organization partners and their need for health care products to assist in relief efforts. 
So these are but 2 examples but are key in driving morale, customer support, supplier support and, of course, the morale generally in the company and amongst all of our constituents. 
Educating future generations of dentists and supporting advanced technology are both ongoing commitments of Henry Schein. We combined these 2 passions, and we're proudly announcing the creation of a Henry Schein Digital Center of Excellence at the Kornberg School of Dentistry at Temple University in Philadelphia. I expect that over the next 12 months, this center will serve as a digital dentistry training hub for students, faculty and alumni and will be equipped with the latest innovations of digital technology from Henry Schein and our supplier partners. 
We are committed to advancing our position, our global position in digitalized dentistry and, at the same time, combining that with closer relations with our customers and educational institutions that graduate our customers in the dental, medical and veterinary space. 
In late June, we were honored to be selected as Corporation of the Year by the Association of Hispanic Healthcare Executives in recognition of our commitment to increase diversity and cultural competency in health care professions. 
And last, we continue to climb up the Fortune 500 list of America's largest companies. We have been named in this list for the past 11 years and now rank 287, up from 292 a year ago. Our inclusion in this prestigious listing is testament to the sheer commitment and value of the more than 18,000 Team Schein Members across the globe, all of whom are dedicated to helping practitioners improve the efficiency of the practice and provide quality care. And the fact that we were ranked and had been ranked really since we've been listed as a Fortune 500 company as one of the Most Admired Companies in health care distribution, being ranked #1 this past year again, is really a testament to our team, our customers and our suppliers. 
So with that overview of our quarterly financial operating performance, Steve and I are ready to take questions."

But the relationship, which is really a three-pronged relationship, has done quite well for Henry Schein and, I believe, for Cardinal as well. On the first line of the equation is the fact that we have taken over distribution of Cardinal's product line and, of course, its sales to customers that are small practitioners. Then on the other side is the IDNs, the large group practices, the large -- in multiple occasions, managed by IDNs as well as group practices. And that has also gone very, very well for us. That business is primarily a transition to us. But this is all built on a relationship when we are securing product, own brand product from Cardinal and doing some joint procurement, and that has also worked quite well for us. So the customers that are being serviced by Henry Schein, former Cardinal customers, I believe, are very happy with the service we're providing and, at the same time, will be benefiting from the Cardinal branded products. And our pricing opportunities in this marketplace will also help our customers and help drive operating margin on the Henry Schein side. I'm happy to also add that the internal growth from the Henry Schein core business, which is significantly now focused on IDNs and large group practices, is also performing very well when you exclude the impact of Cardinal, which in itself is also doing well."

Q1, we were recording effectively agency sales. But as we started the integration process during Q2, as we integrate sales onto our platform, we record direct sales. You can see that the acquisition sales growth was 4.6% for the quarter. It'll annualize. Now we're continuing to integrate. We would expect that the integration will continue probably through the better part of Q3. At that point, we should have all or virtually all of the sales on our platform. The run rate that I would use for modeling going forward is something north of maybe $250 million, but I don't have a more precise number at this time. And that would get phased in -- starting with Q4, we'll probably be at that rate, and that's on a all direct sales basis assuming that there's no more agency sales at that point. And there should be some growth to that, of course, as we continue to add product assortment, and we continue to drive growth to those customers."

So there's a learning curve, and there's that, that we're focusing on in the U.S. I would say that if you look at the components, in North America, I think that the bright spot of the equipment was -- traditional equipment was the bright spot for us.

And of course, we do service, especially on the Dental side, dentists throughout the world through -- and I mentioned 33. We're actually on the ground with distribution centers, call centers and field salespeople in 33 countries. I will say to you that Europe presents a good opportunity because we're going to be going against lower comps as the year progresses, and I think we will be seeing some good growth in a couple of markets as the year progresses and I think going into next year. So in Europe as a basket, we just took a bit of a hit last year, is, I think, recovering. But as you saw, the German equipment numbers were -- the equipment numbers in general were pretty good, driven largely by Germany but not exclusively by Germany. So -- and I think the equipment appetite is good. I think there's a growing demand for digitalized dentistry, both in the dentist office, chairside dentistry, chairside digitalized prosthetics and in the laboratory, which is not only interested in ensuring that the customers have scanners to submit the prosthetics but also within the lab where there's a lot of opportunity for digitalized equipment. We're seeing this quite nicely coming out of the Arseus  acquisition but not only out of that acquisition, which in itself leads to block sales, where we see good margin and some unique opportunities for Henry Schein in that space. So that leads, of course, into consumables. And I think it's fair to say that although the markets in Europe are a little bit anemic, they're getting stronger, and Henry Schein, I think, will continue to gain market share. There's nice opportunity in Australia and New Zealand on the Dental side and I would say on the Animal Health side, too. Let me just go back. I think our European Animal Health business is also in very good shape. We've got good products, great management and some really good opportunity. And if you go around the world, I have to say that the Dental business in Australia presents [indiscernible] really nice opportunity as well. If you go on longer, I think we're quite optimistic about our business in Asia. But there's a lot more work to be done in establishing a platform, and we're hopeful that over time, we'll be able to extend our presence in Japan and China.

But can you just reflect -- in the past, when that better consumable growth starts to seep into the mind of the dentists, they feel better, want some better efficiency in their practice, and then you see that reflected in the equipment numbers.

I think the psychology in the dental market in the -- in North America, especially the U.S., I'm referring to the whole of North America, is a positive one. And I think dentists are realizing it's a good place -- the practice is a good place to invest. So if you look at some of the technology out there, which helps increase the efficiency of the practice, improves on the workflow, resulting in a better experience for the customer and better productivity, you put the mindset together, the optimism the technology can bring to the practice and the ultimate efficiency and productivity, it leads to a good mindset in technology-driven products. And so I think that's where we will see quite a bit of upside. In addition, I think dentists are feeling pretty good and should be in a position, we think, for the remainder of the year to invest in some of the traditional equipment. I think our expanded line will help us in that regard from a pure Henry Schein point of view.

So in past calls, let me reemphasize it because it's working. 6 or 7 years ago, we commissioned 2 studies. One is the area that is likely -- the part of health care that is likely to be moving the most rapidly, and we determined that to be the alternate site and the physician provider because of the anticipated health care reform implications, namely, wellness and prevention. So we decided to focus on the physician side of health care. And we said to ourselves as part of that what kind of physician providers and determined it is likely to be larger groups, so consolidation of practices into larger groups. And at the same time, IDNs, integrated delivery networks, would be expanding their presence into this large group arena. So we set up a health care services group, I think, 7 years ago to focus on this part of the Medical business, and we focused very deeply on it. We were not distracted with acquisitions. There were some very large properties available that service the smaller practitioner groups and some of the single practitioners, the 1, 2, 3 practitioner. We focused on the large group practices and the IDNs through our health care services group, and that's done very well. At the same time, we said to ourselves, what are the specialties that are going to be the most productive from a sales point of view and more importantly, from a margin point of view? And we determined which specialties we'll have to focus on, and we built that as well. You take the 2 together, it's resulting in top line growth, internal growth and, of course, operating margin expansion in our Medical Group. And you put that together with our Cardinal alignment, and it's an acquisition of their sales in the space, but then you add into that the procurement opportunities that we have to procure products under their brand and to jointly advance better procurement between our 2 businesses, and the net result is top line growth and margin expansion for our Medical business."

We feel very good about this whole transition. Yes, but it does -- yes, I just want to be clear. This is a -- this is not a 1- or 2-quarter transition. Remember, as people -- especially with the diagnostic equipment, as people replace diagnostic equipment and as leases and other things come up over a multiple-year period, that's when you have an opportunity to convert customers. So only this is the second quarter out of the box, and when this initially came to light, I immediately said this is not a 1- or 2-quarter process. This is a 1- or 2-year process. So right now, in the early innings, if you will, we feel good about what we've accomplished, but there's still a lot more activity, and there's still a lot more that we need to accomplish."

So we believe the Animal Health business is a good business because of demographics, the elderly, the baby boomers spending more money on their pets. So that's one. And the middle traction or the rest of the world, developing world, et cetera, is growing, and that results also in pet advancement, but within there lies the demand for protein as well. So we believe that is an opportunity. Not sure if distribution of branded pharmaceuticals is necessarily the best play in that space. It may be, but there's opportunity for niche products with high margin. And so for example, I think the KRUUSE opportunity will be very, very good for us. The scil opportunity will be very, very good for us on the equipment side, and the Veterinary Instrumentation offering in the instrument side will be very good for us. We're adding resource in that space, expect to add more products time, gain more margin and have a very profitable business that will be focused on the large animal side as well. But I'm just not sure if the tonnage, lots and lots of sales in branded pharmaceutical is the way to go and whether that's the place to put capital and certainly not the place, in our view, to put capital as a very expensive cost to put that work -- that capital to work. But we do see opportunity in this space, and we do business in a number of countries in the large animal space, in the dairy space, in the various other areas, and remain quite optimistic about that. But I think our play will be a little bit different given our strengths in the business today and the opportunities ahead of us. Just going back to the question on the diagnostics, we were, of course, taken by surprise in this space. But I believe that our team has come together quite quickly in putting together an excellent offering, a global offering of diagnostics. We're working very well with Abaxis and Heska, and in combination with our Practice Solutions business, the software business here in the United States and abroad and our big data opportunities, we'll, I think, have some really exciting opportunities for our customers and our suppliers going forward. So although we were quite surprised by what happened, considering that we had -- we thought it was a good relationship with the supplier, we remain very, very optimistic and specifically with our Axis-Q bidirectional integrated solution that improves workflow and reduces missed patient opportunities in the practice. So we have added good resources in that area, have really good management, good team in the diagnostics space, more to follow and remain very, very excited both in the equipment arena and with the rapid test. It's amazing how many suppliers have come to us from around the world and say, ""Now we see an opportunity for you in the space,"" but our anchor, of course, is Abaxis and Heska."

It's a key driver in our success. We combine that data, of course, with telesales and field sales consultants and e-commerce marketing. Having said that, about a month ago, we actually launched our big data division to capitalize on the opportunity of the data we have in our practice management world but also in the Henry Schein data bank, our products and related services that we sell. So we brought on a very senior executive to manage that for us and are very excited with that opportunity on the Dental, Medical and vet side.

But generally, I think the smarter manufacturers understand the value that distribution brings. Of course, logistics, but that's not the area. It's in the value-added services, and in our particular case, because we have 4,000 field sales consultants around the world that are specialists in practice management, understand how a practice should be run and help our customers operate a more efficient business so that they can provide better clinical care, and that drives manufacturers moving towards us, and I believe that's the case in all 3 businesses.
Okay. So thank you, everyone, for calling. And I think you can get a feel that we're quite excited about our business.

Our second quarter financial results were solid, with internal sales growth in local currencies in each of our 4 business groups doing well. And as was also the case during the previous quarter, the strength of the U.S. dollar impacted all of our international operations and, of course, those particularly in Europe. 
For the second quarter, changes in currency exchange rates reduced our total sales growth by 7% and reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.07. That's $0.07 compared to the last year. Overall, the global markets we serve were healthy during the quarter, and we believe we continue to gain market share. 
We are pleased to reaffirm our guidance range for 2015 adjusted diluted EPS and expect that our restructuring activities will continue to favorably impact our ongoing results. 
In a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent financial performance and business accomplishments, but I just would like to give you a little flavor on 2 meetings I just participated in here in Paris. I'm in Paris, and Steven is in New York. I spent several hours with our international Animal Health team, and we'd like to let the shareholders know and investors know that this team is doing outstanding work as they execute on globalizing our Animal Health business and, of course, at the same time, gaining market share and increasing the profitability of the business. 
Likewise, our Practice Solutions software team, on the international side, Dental, got together in Paris, too, and this is by coincidence, they were both in the same city so I decided to come over. And I can confirm also that this group is doing very well and executing our global practice solutions plan and, of course, increasing profits in that sector, too. So in a 1-day period of time, I experienced some really exciting activity going on here at Henry Schein. 
So let me ask Steve to review our quarterly financial results with you, and then I'll come back and give you some comments on performance and business accomplishments in general. So Steve?"

I am also pleased to report solid results for the second quarter of 2015. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 second quarter results include restructuring costs of $7.2 million pretax or $0.06",1460,"Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I am also pleased to report solid results for the second quarter of 2015. 
As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 second quarter results include restructuring costs of $7.2 million pretax or $0.06 per diluted share. We announced this restructuring on our third quarter 2014 conference call. As we mentioned then, this initiative is expected to continue throughout the remainder of 2015. 
You could look at exhibit B to this morning's earnings news release, which reconciles our GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations. I will also be discussing our results as reported and excluding these restructuring costs as we believe the latter is more reflective of our ongoing performance. 
So now turning to our Q2 results. Net sales for the quarter ended June 27, 2015, were $2.6 billion, reflecting 0.5% increase compared with the second quarter of 2014. This consisted of 7.5% growth in local currencies and a 7% decline related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, our internally generated sales increased 3.9%, and acquisition growth was an additional 3.6%. You can note the details of sales growth that are contained in exhibit A of today's earnings news release. 
Our operating margin for the second quarter of 2015 was 7.0%, which expanded by 5 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2014. However, excluding the restructuring costs, which we believe is the more meaningful measure, our adjusted operating margin for the quarter -- for the second quarter of 2015 improved by 32 basis points to 7.2%. 
When also excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during the past 12 months and related expenses, operating margin expanded by 45 basis points compared with the second quarter of last year. The expansion was primarily the result of an increase in sales mix towards higher-margin products. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.8%. This is on a non-GAAP basis excluding the restructuring costs, and this compares with 30.8% last year. The slightly lower tax rate is due to the implementation of ongoing tax strategies as well as higher earnings in countries with lower tax rates. We continue to expect the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in this 30% range. 
Turning to net income attributable to Henry Schein. For the second quarter of 2015, it was $117.9 million or $1.40 per diluted share. This represents growth of 1.5% and 3.7%, respectively, compared with the second quarter. 
Again, excluding restructuring costs in the current quarter, net income attributable to Henry Schein was $123.2 million or $1.46 per diluted share. And that represents increases of 6% and 8%, respectively, compared with last year's second quarter. 
Again, as Stanley mentioned at the onset, our foreign currency exchange had a negative impact of a full $0.07 per share on the EPS for the current quarter. 
If we now look at some of the detail of our sales results for the second quarter, our Dental sales for the second quarter of 2015 declined 3.5% to $1.3 billion, but this 3.5% decline consisted of 4.5% growth in local currency and an 8% decline related, again, to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, internally generated sales was 4.1%, and acquisition growth was an additional 0.4%. Of this 4.1% internal growth in local currencies, we saw 3.7% growth in North America and 4.6% growth internationally. I'll go through a little bit of detail behind each of these 2 figures. The 3.7% internal growth in local currencies from North America included a very strong 5.4% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and a 1.9% decline in Dental equipment sales and service revenues. 
In looking at North American Dental equipment results, you should recall that last year's second quarter internal growth in local currencies was 10.8%. That made for a difficult prior year comparison. 
If we now turn to the International business. The 4.6% internal growth in local currencies included 2% growth in sales in Dental consumable merchandise and a strong 11.8% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenue. 
Of course, the growth in the international equipment business included a favorable impact on the equipment related to the IDS trade show. 
Animal Health sales was $748.6 million for the quarter, down 0.8%, but this included growth of 7.9% in local currencies and an 8.7% decline related to foreign currency exchange again. If we look at the internal sales growth in local currencies, they were 0.6%, and [indiscernible] contributed an additional 7.3% growth. 
I'll split now that 0.6% growth between North America and International. The North America included a 4.1% decline, and the International growth was a 4.8% increase. That 4.1% decline in internal sales in local currencies in the North American market was 5.2% growth when normalizing for the results to account for the impact of certain products switching between agency and direct sales as well as the changes to our veterinary diagnostic manufacturer relationships. 
Again, we believe this normalized growth is a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business. And for the balance of the year until this annualizes, we will continue to review our results both on a reported basis and on a normalized basis. 
Turning to our Medical sales. They were $470.5 million in the second quarter. That's an increase of 16.7%. This is 17.7% growth in local currencies and a 1% decline in foreign currency exchange. Internal sales in local currencies grew almost 10% at 9.9% while acquisitions contributed an additional 7.8% to growth. 
Our 9.9% internal growth in local currencies in North America was 10.4%, and it was led again by large group practices and IDN networks growth, and internationally, we saw an additional 1.3% growth. 
Acquisition growth during the second quarter included both agency revenue as well as direct sales growth under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health. I can say now that the majority of the Cardinal Health physician business customers that have been acquired have transitioned to Henry Schein, and we are recording substantially all of those sales under this agreement as direct sales. 
If you look at Technology and Value-Added Service sales, they were $89.5 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 0.4%, and this included 3.3% growth in local currencies and a decline of 2.9%, again, related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, we saw internal growth of 2.9% and acquisition growth of 4%. That 2.9% growth, breaking it up between North America and International, was 2.6% growth in North America and 3.9% internationally. 
If we look at our stock repurchase program, we're continuing to repurchase common stock in the open market during the quarter. We repurchased approximately 267,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $140.58 per share, that was approximately $38 million. And that impact on our diluted EPS was immaterial. At the close of the quarter, we had an additional $187 million authorized for future repurchases, and we remain committed to our goal of repurchasing between $200 million and $300 million of stock for the full year. 
If we look at some highlights on our balance sheet and cash flow. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $207.8 million, up from $199.2 million in last year second quarter. We continue to believe that we'll have strong operating cash flow for the full year. 
Our accounts receivable days sales improved slightly to 39.3 days compared to 40.2 days last year, and inventory turns were slightly down, 5.8 turns this year, 6.0 turns last year. 
I'll conclude my remarks by reaffirming our 2015 financial guidance as follows. For the year 2015, we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be $5.90 to $6 per share, which represents growth of 8% to 10% compared with the 2014 results. 
Assuming the strength of the U.S. dollar stays at current levels, we expect -- we continue to expect that the adjusted EPS may be at the lower end of this range, as we mentioned last quarter. Keep in mind that approximately 35% of our worldwide sales are in currencies other than U.S. dollar, and year-to-date, we have experienced about $0.13 or $0.14 of negative impact in EPS directly related to the foreign exchange changes. 
Our 2015 guidance excludes restructuring costs, which are expected to be between $0.29 and $0.33 per share, and that's related, of course, to the planned corporate initiative to rationalize the company's operations and provide expense efficiencies. And as always, our guidance is for continuing -- current continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stan."
339447,306835465,841563,"Henry Schein, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Henry Schein, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steven.

In North America, consumable merchandise internal sales growth in local currencies was strong at 5.4%. This growth indicates that patient traffic to Dental offices continues to be solid. Indeed, for the past 4 quarters, consumable merchandise internal sales growth in North America has been consistently in the mid-4% to 5% range. 
Equipment sales and service revenue in local currencies in the second quarter declined 1.9%. However, against the difficult prior year comparison that Steven mentioned, we expect North American Dental equipment sales and service growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, with a good backlog report at this point. 
Looking at International Dental, consumable merchandise internal sales in local currency returned to positive growth of 2% for the quarter compared with a decline of 1.6% in the first quarter. 
Equipment sales and service internal growth in local currency was 11.8%, it was a multiyear high and included favorable impact from the biannual International Dental Show, the IDS, which took place this past March in Germany. 
So now let's spend a few minutes, or a minute actually, on the Animal Health side. With growth of this group that was aided by strategic acquisitions in North America and internationally, our normalized internal sales growth in North America continued to be very solid. 
We recently announced 2 acquisitions in the animal health space that will expand our global direct presence while bringing market leaders to Henry Schein. First, we announced plans to acquire a majority interest in Jorgen Kruuse. KRUUSE is a leading distributor of veterinary supplies in the Nordic countries, with sales in 2014 of approximately $19 million (sic) ($90 million). KRUUSE will extend Henry Schein's direct presence in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. We expect this transaction will close later in the third quarter of 2015. 
KRUUSE offers a comprehensive portfolio of proprietary products and branded consumable merchandise as well as pet accessories, capital equipment and pet food to veterinary clinics and retail pet stores. We plan to expand the KRUUSE line of proprietary products in Animal Health customers across Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand as well as Asia. 
KRUUSE serves customers in more than 100 countries through a network of distribution partners. We are delighted to enter the Nordic animal health market with a well-recognized family company. KRUUSE enjoys deep customer loyalty and satisfaction as well as a reputation for quality products and strong brand awareness. 
Also during the second quarter, we acquired a 50% ownership investment in Maravet, a leading animal health distributor in Romania. Maravet has annual sales of $23 million, and like KRUUSE, we purchased our interest from the founding family, which continues to own the balance of the company. Our investment in Maravet adds to our Eastern European presence, which we established in the Czech Republic in 2009 and later expanded to Poland with our acquisition of Medivet last year. 
With the recent acquisition of KRUUSE, Maravet and scil, our Animal Health business continues to thrive while gaining market share through a combination of organic growth and, of course, the strategic transactions. When the KRUUSE acquisition closes, Henry Schein Animal Health business will expand to 23 countries, including the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, China, Malaysia and 17 other countries in Europe. 
Now let me talk a bit about the Medical business. Internal sales growth in our North American Medical business continued at a double-digit pace as we made further progress with large group practices and IDNs, the integrated delivery networks. 
During the quarter, we recorded sales under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health as agency sales and direct sales as we integrate the business. Our transaction with Cardinal continues on plan, with the majority of Cardinal Health acquired customers have now successfully transitioned to the Henry Schein platform. We remain optimistic about our ability to win new customers with Cardinal by being uniquely positioned to jointly serve the entire continuum arc of care. 
So let me conclude now with an overview of our Technology and Value-Added Services. Internal sales growth in this group in North America is 2.6% in local currencies, and International internal growth rate was 3.9% in local currencies. So North America, 2.6%; and internationally, 3.9% in local currencies. 
The advanced technology products and services we offer support our commitment to the efficiency of delivery of health care services and a platform for further enhancement of sales opportunities across the entire business. The group also serves to differentiate Henry Schein from our competitors while deepening and strengthening our relationship with our customers. The software and value-added services component of this business fits very well, and we have some strong numbers that we were up against on our equipment side of this business. So overall, this business again continues to do very well. 
So before we open the call to questions, let me give some highlights and some recent news. As we continue to advance our strategic plan, we have named Peter McCarthy President of the Global Animal Health Group. Peter has provided important leadership in the growth of our International Animal Health operations, most recently as President of our Animal Health International Group. 
In addition, Henry Schein recently appointed Francis Dirksmeier, Fran, as President of Henry Schein Animal Health North America, reporting to Peter. Fran brings more than 30 years of commercial leadership experience, most recently serving as General Manager of GE Healthcare in global asset management and hospital operation. Fran's background, by the way, is significant distribution in health care and also software and the connection between distribution and software, resulting in the value-added Services that have made a difference in the businesses he supported over the years and now bringing that know-how to Henry Schein Animal Health as well. 
Now just a key component part of Henry Schein's success is our relationship with our constituents, our suppliers, our team and our customers in the social outreach area. Through the second quarter, Henry Schein once again stepped up to support relief efforts for several disaster situations. Together with our supplier partners, we committed $0.5 million in product donations to support victims of the devastating earthquake that struck Nepal. And here in the U.S., we were active -- we activated our Disaster Relief Hotline to support customers affected by severe storms and flooding in the South Central region of our country while also providing support to our nongovernmental organization partners and their need for health care products to assist in relief efforts. 
So these are but 2 examples but are key in driving morale, customer support, supplier support and, of course, the morale generally in the company and amongst all of our constituents. 
Educating future generations of dentists and supporting advanced technology are both ongoing commitments of Henry Schein. We combined these 2 passions, and we're proudly announcing the creation of a Henry Schein Digital Center of Excellence at the Kornberg School of Dentistry at Temple University in Philadelphia. I expect that over the next 12 months, this center will serve as a digital dentistry training hub for students, faculty and alumni and will be equipped with the latest innovations of digital technology from Henry Schein and our supplier partners. 
We are committed to advancing our position, our global position, in digitalized dentistry and, at the same time, combining that with closer relations with our customers and educational institutions that graduate our customers in the dental, medical and veterinary space. 
In late June, we were honored to be selected as Corporation of the Year by the Association of Hispanic Healthcare Executives in recognition of our commitment to increase diversity and cultural competency in health care professions. 
And last, we continue to climb up the Fortune 500 list of America's largest companies. We have been named in this list for the past 11 years and now rank 287, up from 292 a year ago. Our inclusion in this prestigious listing is testament to the sheer commitment and value of the more than 18,000 Team Schein Members across the globe, all of whom are dedicated to helping practitioners improve the efficiency of their practice and provide quality care. And the fact that we were ranked and had been ranked really since we've been listed as a Fortune 500 company as one of the Most Admired Companies in health care distribution, being ranked #1 this past year again, is really a testament to our team, our customers and our suppliers. 
So with that overview of our quarterly financial operating performance, Steve and I are ready to take questions."

I'm kind of curious, can you maybe comment on the Cardinal Health relationship?

But the relationship, which is really a three-pronged relationship, has done quite well for Henry Schein and, I believe, for Cardinal as well. On the first line of the equation is the fact that we have taken over distribution of Cardinal's product line and, of course, its sales to customers that are small practitioners. Then on the other side is the IDNs, the large group practices, the large -- the multiple locations managed by IDNs as well as group practices. And that has also gone very, very well for us. That business is primarily -- transitioned to us. But this is all built on a relationship when we are securing product, own brand product from Cardinal and doing some joint procurement, and that has also worked quite well for us. So the customers that are being serviced by Henry Schein, former Cardinal customers, I believe, are very happy with the service we're providing and, at the same time, will be benefiting from the Cardinal branded products. And our pricing opportunities in this marketplace will also help our customers and help drive operating margin on the Henry Schein side. I'd hasten to also add that the internal growth from the Henry Schein core business, which is significantly now focused on IDNs and large group practices, is also performing very well when you exclude the impact of Cardinal, which in itself is also doing well."

At Q1, we were recording effectively agency sales. But as we started the integration process during Q2, as we integrate sales onto our platform, we record direct sales. You can see that the acquisition sales growth was 4.6% for the quarter. It'll annualize. Now we're continuing to integrate. We would expect that the integration will continue probably through the better part of Q3. At that point, we should have all or virtually all of the sales on our platform. The run rate that I would use for modeling going forward is something north of maybe $250 million, but I don't have a more precise number at this time. And that would get phased in -- starting with Q4, we'll probably be at that rate, and that's on a all direct sales basis assuming that there's no more agency sales at that point. And there should be some growth to that, of course, as we continue to add product assortment, and we continue to drive growth to those customers."

Remember, we're going through a little bit of transition. We added the A-dec line. So there's a learning curve, and there's that, that we're focusing on in the U.S. I would say that if you look at the components, in North America, I think that the bright spot of the equipment was -- traditional equipment, was the bright spot for us. We were a little bit soft on technology in a large part because PlanScan had upgrades last year, but still soft in technology despite that. But we're feeling good like equipment is going to be a good driver for us for the second half of the year."

And of course, we do service, especially on the Dental side, dentists throughout the world through -- and I mentioned 33. We're actually on the ground with distribution centers, call centers and field salespeople in 33 countries. I will say to you that Europe presents a good opportunity because we're going to be going against lower comps as the year progresses and I think we will be seeing some good growth in a couple of markets as the year progresses and I think going into next year. So in Europe as a basket, which just took a bit of a hit last year, is, I think, recovering. But as you saw, the German equipment numbers were -- the equipment numbers in general were pretty good, driven largely by Germany but not exclusively by Germany. So -- and I think the equipment appetite is good. I think there's a growing demand for digitalized dentistry, both in the dentist office, chairside dentistry, chairside digitalized prosthetics and in the laboratory, which is not only interested in ensuring that the customers have scanners to submit the prosthetics but also within the lab where there's a lot of opportunity for digitalized equipment. We're seeing this quite nicely coming out of the Arseus acquisition but not only out of that acquisition, which in itself leads to block sales, where we see good margin and some unique opportunities for Henry Schein in that space. So that leads, of course, into consumables. And I think it's fair to say that although the markets in Europe are a little bit anemic, they're getting stronger, and Henry Schein, I think, will continue to gain market share. There's nice opportunity in Australia and New Zealand on the Dental side and I would say on the Animal Health side, too, and let me just go back, I think our European Animal Health business is also in very good shape. We've got good products, great management and some really good opportunity. And if you're going around the world, I have to say that the Dental business in Australia, Belgium and Brazil, presents really nice opportunity as well. If you go out a little longer, I think we're quite optimistic about our business in Asia, although there's a lot more work to be done in establishing the platform, and we're hopeful that over time, we'll be able to extend our presence in Japan and China. So we're quite optimistic about our International business."

Obviously, there's a lot of adjustments, but I think you said the adjusted North American vet sales was, I believe, 5.2%. It's a solid number, but it is a notable stepdown versus, I think, what was the 13.6% adjustment last quarter. And clearly, the overall industry momentum seems to be continuing. So is there anything to call out North American vet? I just bring it up because we've heard chatter of overall in-clinic pricing pressure. Are you guys seeing that? Is that reflected in the stepdown in the growth rate? Or is this more just bouncing around in the volatility in the near term?"

So we're not reading anything into -- I agree it is a stepdown. We're not reading anything into the overall change. We still think the markets are healthy. We still think that we can see acceleration of the markets as the flea and tick season continues. So we're feeling like there's no major -- similar to what we talked about just a minute or 2 on Dental, and I said we saw Q3 -- Q1 where a couple of markets in Europe were down. We didn't think it was something market-related, and we -- the consumable merchandise in those 3 markets were up in Q2. So hopefully that's clear."

And then just to shift gears, Stanley, I might be asking this in a different way than Glen earlier, but you called out the solid consumable growth in North America now for a number of quarters, maybe arguably 4 quarters plus. It seems like you need some decent growth in the back half of the year to get to the low to mid-single digits. But can you just reflect -- in the past, when that better consumable growth starts to seep into the mind of the dentists, they feel better, want some better efficiency in their practice, and then you see that reflected in the equipment numbers. What sort of lag has that been historically? And can we see, as a result of that, a step up in equipment in North America in '16 and beyond?"

And I think dentists are realizing it's a good place -- their practice is a good place to invest. So if you look at some of the technology out there, which helps increase the efficiency of the practice, improves on the workflow, resulting in a better experience for the customer and better productivity, you put the mindset together, the optimism that technology can bring to the practice and the ultimate efficiency and productivity, it leads to a good mindset in technology-driven products. And so I think that's where we will see quite a bit of upside. In addition, I think dentists are feeling pretty good and should be in a position, we think, for the remainder of the year to invest in some of the traditional equipment. I think our expanded line will help us in that regard from a pure Henry Schein point of view. So I think it's less to do with a specific uptick, a couple of basis points here or there, and more to do with the mindset, which is pretty good right now in dentistry. Having said that, the traffic is improving, and I think from a pure Henry Schein point of view, we are gaining market share as well."

So in past calls, and let me reemphasize it because it's working, 6 or 7 years ago, we commissioned 2 studies. One is the area that is likely -- the part of health care that is likely to be moving the most rapidly, and we determined that to be the alternate site and the physician provider because of the anticipated health care reform implications, namely, wellness and prevention. So we decided to focus on the physician side of health care. And we said to ourselves, as part of that, what kind of physician providers and determined it is likely to be larger groups, so consolidation of practices into larger groups. And at the same time, IDNs, integrated delivery networks, would be expanding their presence into this large group arena. So we set up a health care services group, I think, 7 years ago to focus on this part of the Medical business, and we focused very deeply on it. We were not distracted with acquisitions. There were some very large properties available that service the smaller practitioner groups and some of the single practitioners, the 1, 2, 3 practitioner. We focused on the large group practices and the IDNs through our health care services group, and that's done very well. At the same time, we said to ourselves, what are the specialties that are going to be the most productive from a sales point of view and more importantly, from a margin point of view? And we determined which specialties we'll have to focus on, and we built that as well. You take the 2 together, it's resulting in top line growth, internal growth and, of course, operating margin expansion in our Medical Group. And you put that together with our Cardinal alignment, and it's an acquisition of their sales in the space, but then you add to that the procurement opportunities that we have to procure products under their brand and to jointly advance better procurement between our 2 businesses, and the net result is top line growth and margin expansion for our Medical business."

So we believe the Animal Health business is a good business because of demographics, the elderly, the baby boomers spending more money on their pets. So that's one. And the middle class and the rest of the world, developing world, et cetera, is growing, and that results also in pet advancement, but within there lies the demand for protein as well. So we believe that is an opportunity. Not sure if distribution of branded pharmaceuticals is necessarily the best play in that space. It may be, but there's opportunity for niche products with high margin. And so for example, I think the KRUUSE opportunity will be very, very good for us. The scil opportunity will be very, very good for us on the equipment side, and the Veterinary Instrumentation offering in the instrument side will be very good for us. We're adding resource in that space, expect to add more products over time, gain more margin and have a very profitable business that will be focused on the large animal side as well. But I'm just not sure if the tonnage, lots and lots of sales in branded pharmaceutical is the way to go and whether that's the place to put capital and certainly not the place, in our view, to put capital at a very expensive cost, to put that work -- that capital to work. But we do see opportunity in the space, and we do business in a number of countries in the large animal space, in the dairy space, in the various other areas, and remain quite optimistic about that. But I think our play will be a little bit different given our strengths in the business today and the opportunities ahead of us. Just going back to the question on the diagnostics, we were, of course, taken by surprise in this space. But I believe that our team has come together quite quickly in putting together an excellent offering, a global offering of diagnostics. We're working very well with Abaxis and Heska, and in combination with our Practice Solutions business, the software business here in the United States and abroad and our big data opportunities, we'll, I think, have some really exciting opportunities for our customers and our suppliers going forward. So although we were quite surprised by what happened, considering that we had -- what we thought was a good relationship with the supplier, we remain very, very optimistic and specifically with our Axis-Q bidirectional integrated solution that improves workflow and reduces missed patient opportunities in the practice. So we have added good resources in that area, have really good management, good team in the diagnostics space, more to follow and remain very, very excited both in the equipment arena and with the rapid tests. It's amazing how many suppliers have come to us from around the world and say, ""Now we see an opportunity for you in the space,"" but our anchor, of course, is Abaxis and Heska."

It's in the value-added services, and in our particular case, because we have 4,000 field sales consultants around the world that are specialists in practice management, understand how a practice should be run and help our customers operate a more efficient business so that they can provide better clinical care, and that drives manufacturers moving towards us, and I believe that's the case in all 3 businesses.
Okay. So thank you, everyone, for calling. I think you can get a feel that we're quite excited about our business. Of course, we have challenges like every single business does, and in particular, the biggest challenge we have right now is the relative exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro. And we are doing -- we're working very hard and expect to be successful in mitigating that conversion risk with other areas of increased profitability in the business. 
We are advancing our strategies in geographic expansion, market share growth, margin expansions through advancing products that present greater value to our customers, greater margin, and are managing our expenses, expecting to reap some benefits from the restructuring that we announced last year. So we remain optimistic about the business. 
And so thank you for calling. Again, if you have any questions, you can call Steve Paladino at (631) 843-5915 or Carolynne Borders at (631) 843..."

Our second quarter financial results were solid, with internal sales growth in local currencies in each of our 4 business groups doing well. And as was also the case during the previous quarter, the strength of the U.S. dollar impacted all of our international operations and, of course, those particularly in Europe. 
For the second quarter, changes in currency exchange rates reduced our total sales growth by 7% and reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.07. That's $0.07 compared to the last year. Overall, the global markets we serve were healthy during the quarter, and we believe we continue to gain market share. 
We are pleased to reaffirm our guidance range for 2015 adjusted diluted EPS and expect that our restructuring activities will continue to favorably impact our ongoing results. 
In a moment, I'll provide some additional commentary on our recent financial performance and business accomplishments, but I just would like to give you a little flavor on 2 meetings I just participated in here in Paris. I'm in Paris, and Steven is in New York. I spent several hours with our international Animal Health team, and we'd like to let the shareholders know and investors know that this team is doing outstanding work as they execute on globalizing our Animal Health business and, of course, at the same time, gaining market share and increasing the profitability of the business. 
Likewise, our Practice Solutions software team, on the international side, Dental, got together in Paris, too, and this is by coincidence, they were both in the same city so I decided to come over. And I can confirm also that this group is doing very well and executing our global practice solutions plan and, of course, increasing profits in that sector, too. So in a 1-day period of time, I experienced some really exciting activity going on here at Henry Schein. 
So let me ask Steve to review our quarterly financial results with you, and then I'll come back and give you some comments on performance and business accomplishments in general. So Steve?"

I am also pleased to report solid results for the second quarter of 2015. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 second quarter results include restructuring costs of $7.2 million pretax or $0.06",1460,"Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning to all. I am also pleased to report solid results for the second quarter of 2015. 
As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 second quarter results include restructuring costs of $7.2 million pretax or $0.06 per diluted share. We announced this restructuring on our third quarter 2014 conference call. As we mentioned then, this initiative is expected to continue throughout the remainder of 2015. 
You could look at exhibit B to this morning's earnings news release, which reconciles our GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations. I will also be discussing our results as reported and excluding these restructuring costs as we believe the latter is more reflective of our ongoing performance. 
So now turning to our Q2 results. Net sales for the quarter ended June 27, 2015, were $2.6 billion, reflecting 0.5% increase compared with the second quarter of 2014. This consisted of 7.5% growth in local currencies and a 7% decline related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, our internally generated sales increased 3.9%, and acquisition growth was an additional 3.6%. You can note the details of sales growth that are contained in exhibit A of today's earnings news release. 
Our operating margin for the second quarter of 2015 was 7.0%, which expanded by 5 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2014. However, excluding the restructuring costs, which we believe is the more meaningful measure, our adjusted operating margin for the quarter -- for the second quarter of 2015 improved by 32 basis points to 7.2%. 
When also excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during the past 12 months and related expenses, operating margin expanded by 45 basis points compared with the second quarter of last year. The expansion was primarily the result of an increase in sales mix towards higher-margin products. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.8%. This is on a non-GAAP basis excluding the restructuring costs, and this compares with 30.8% last year. The slightly lower tax rate is due to the implementation of ongoing tax strategies as well as higher earnings in countries with lower tax rates. We continue to expect the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in this 30% range. 
Turning to net income attributable to Henry Schein. For the second quarter of 2015, it was $117.9 million or $1.40 per diluted share. This represents growth of 1.5% and 3.7%, respectively, compared with the second quarter. 
Again, excluding restructuring costs in the current quarter, net income attributable to Henry Schein was $123.2 million or $1.46 per diluted share. And that represents increases of 6% and 8%, respectively, compared with last year's second quarter. 
Again, as Stanley mentioned at the onset, our foreign currency exchange had a negative impact of a full $0.07 per share on the EPS for the current quarter. 
If we now look at some of the detail of our sales results for the second quarter, our Dental sales for the second quarter of 2015 declined 3.5% to $1.3 billion, but this 3.5% decline consisted of 4.5% growth in local currency and an 8% decline related, again, to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, internally generated sales was 4.1%, and acquisition growth was an additional 0.4%. Of this 4.1% internal growth in local currencies, we saw 3.7% growth in North America and 4.6% growth internationally. I'll go through a little bit of detail behind each of these 2 figures. The 3.7% internal growth in local currencies from North America included a very strong 5.4% growth in sales of Dental consumable merchandise and a 1.9% decline in Dental equipment sales and service revenues. 
In looking at North American Dental equipment results, you should recall that last year's second quarter internal growth in local currencies was 10.8%. That made for a difficult prior year comparison. 
If we now turn to the International business. The 4.6% internal growth in local currencies included 2% growth in sales in Dental consumable merchandise and a strong 11.8% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenue. 
Of course, the growth in the international equipment business included a favorable impact on the equipment related to the IDS trade show. 
Animal Health sales was $748.6 million for the quarter, down 0.8%, but this included growth of 7.9% in local currencies and an 8.7% decline related to foreign currency exchange again. If we look at the internal sales growth in local currencies, they were 0.6%, and [indiscernible] contributed an additional 7.3% growth. 
I'll split now that 0.6% growth between North America and International. The North America included a 4.1% decline, and the International growth was a 4.8% increase. That 4.1% decline in internal sales in local currencies in the North American market was 5.2% growth when normalizing for the results to account for the impact of certain products switching between agency and direct sales as well as the changes to our veterinary diagnostic manufacturer relationships. 
Again, we believe this normalized growth is a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business. And for the balance of the year until this annualizes, we will continue to review our results both on a reported basis and on a normalized basis. 
Turning to our Medical sales. They were $470.5 million in the second quarter. That's an increase of 16.7%. This is 17.7% growth in local currencies and a 1% decline in foreign currency exchange. Internal sales in local currencies grew almost 10% at 9.9% while acquisitions contributed an additional 7.8% to growth. 
Our 9.9% internal growth in local currencies in North America was 10.4%, and it was led again by large group practices and IDN networks growth, and internationally, we saw an additional 1.3% growth. 
Acquisition growth during the second quarter included both agency revenue as well as direct sales growth under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health. I can say now that the majority of the Cardinal Health physician business customers that have been acquired have transitioned to Henry Schein, and we are recording substantially all of those sales under this agreement as direct sales. 
If you look at Technology and Value-Added Service sales, they were $89.5 million in the quarter. That's an increase of 0.4%, and this included 3.3% growth in local currencies and a decline of 2.9%, again, related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, we saw internal growth of 2.9% and acquisition growth of 4%. That 2.9% growth, breaking it up between North America and International, was 2.6% growth in North America and 3.9% internationally. 
If we look at our stock repurchase program, we're continuing to repurchase common stock in the open market during the quarter. We repurchased approximately 267,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $140.58 per share, that was approximately $38 million. And that impact on our diluted EPS was immaterial. At the close of the quarter, we had an additional $187 million authorized for future repurchases, and we remain committed to our goal of repurchasing between $200 million and $300 million of stock for the full year. 
If we look at some highlights on our balance sheet and cash flow. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $207.8 million, up from $199.2 million in last year second quarter. We continue to believe that we'll have strong operating cash flow for the full year. 
Our accounts receivable days sales improved slightly to 39.3 days compared to 40.2 days last year, and inventory turns were slightly down, 5.8 turns this year, 6.0 turns last year. 
I'll conclude my remarks by reaffirming our 2015 financial guidance as follows. For the year 2015, we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be $5.90 to $6 per share, which represents growth of 8% to 10% compared with the 2014 results. 
Assuming the strength of the U.S. dollar stays at current levels, we expect -- we continue to expect that the adjusted EPS may be at the lower end of this range, as we mentioned last quarter. Keep in mind that approximately 35% of our worldwide sales are in currencies other than U.S. dollar, and year-to-date, we have experienced about $0.13 or $0.14 of negative impact in EPS directly related to the foreign exchange changes. 
Our 2015 guidance excludes restructuring costs, which are expected to be between $0.29 and $0.33 per share, and that's related, of course, to the planned corporate initiative to rationalize the company's operations and provide expense efficiencies. And as always, our guidance is for continuing -- current continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stan."

In North America, consumable merchandise internal sales growth in local currencies was strong at 5.4%. This growth indicates that patient traffic to Dental offices continues to be solid. Indeed, for the past 4 quarters, consumable merchandise internal sales growth in North America has been consistently in the mid-4% to 5% range. 
Equipment sales and service revenue in local currencies in the second quarter declined 1.9%. However, against the difficult prior year comparison that Steven mentioned, we expect North American Dental equipment sales and service growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, with a good backlog report at this point. 
Looking at International Dental, consumable merchandise internal sales in local currency returned to positive growth of 2% for the quarter compared with a decline of 1.6% in the first quarter. 
Equipment sales and service internal growth in local currency was 11.8%, it was a multiyear high and included favorable impact from the biannual International Dental Show, the IDS, which took place this past March in Germany. 
So now let's spend a few minutes, or a minute actually, on the Animal Health side. With growth of this group that was aided by strategic acquisitions in North America and internationally, our normalized internal sales growth in North America continued to be very solid. 
We recently announced 2 acquisitions in the animal health space that will expand our global direct presence while bringing market leaders to Henry Schein. First, we announced plans to acquire a majority interest in Jorgen Kruuse. KRUUSE is a leading distributor of veterinary supplies in the Nordic countries, with sales in 2014 of approximately $19 million (sic) [ $90 million ]. KRUUSE will extend Henry Schein's direct presence in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. We expect this transaction will close later in the third quarter of 2015. 
KRUUSE offers a comprehensive portfolio of proprietary products and branded consumable merchandise as well as pet accessories, capital equipment and pet food to veterinary clinics and retail pet stores. We plan to expand the KRUUSE line of proprietary products in Animal Health customers across Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand as well as Asia. 
KRUUSE serves customers in more than 100 countries through a network of distribution partners. We are delighted to enter the Nordic animal health market with a well-recognized family company. KRUUSE enjoys deep customer loyalty and satisfaction as well as a reputation for quality products and strong brand awareness. 
Also during the second quarter, we acquired a 50% ownership investment in Maravet, a leading animal health distributor in Romania. Maravet has annual sales of $23 million, and like KRUUSE, we purchased our interest from the founding family, which continues to own the balance of the company. Our investment in Maravet adds to our Eastern European presence, which we established in the Czech Republic in 2009 and later expanded to Poland with our acquisition of Medivet last year. 
With the recent acquisition of KRUUSE, Maravet and scil, our Animal Health business continues to thrive while gaining market share through a combination of organic growth and, of course, the strategic transactions. When the KRUUSE acquisition closes, Henry Schein Animal Health business will expand to 23 countries, including the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, China, Malaysia and 17 other countries in Europe. 
Now let me talk a bit about the Medical business. Internal sales growth in our North American Medical business continued at a double-digit pace as we made further progress with large group practices and IDNs, the integrated delivery networks. 
During the quarter, we recorded sales under our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health as agency sales and direct sales as we integrate the business. Our transaction with Cardinal continues on plan, with the majority of Cardinal Health acquired customers have now successfully transitioned to the Henry Schein platform. We remain optimistic about our ability to win new customers with Cardinal by being uniquely positioned to jointly serve the entire continuum arc of care. 
So let me conclude now with an overview of our Technology and Value-Added Services. Internal sales growth in this group in North America is 2.6% in local currencies, and International internal growth rate was 3.9% in local currencies. So North America, 2.6%; and internationally, 3.9% in local currencies. 
The advanced technology products and services we offer support our commitment to the efficiency of delivery of health care services and a platform for further enhancement of sales opportunities across the entire business. The group also serves to differentiate Henry Schein from our competitors while deepening and strengthening our relationship with our customers. The software and value-added services component of this business fits very well, and we have some strong numbers that we were up against on our equipment side of this business. So overall, this business again continues to do very well. 
So before we open the call to questions, let me give some highlights and some recent news. As we continue to advance our strategic plan, we have named Peter McCarthy President of the Global Animal Health Group. Peter has provided important leadership in the growth of our International Animal Health operations, most recently as President of our Animal Health International Group. 
In addition, Henry Schein recently appointed Francis Dirksmeier, Fran, as President of Henry Schein Animal Health North America, reporting to Peter. Fran brings more than 30 years of commercial leadership experience, most recently serving as General Manager of GE Healthcare in global asset management and hospital operation. Fran's background, by the way, is significant distribution in health care and also software and the connection between distribution and software, resulting in the value-added Services that have made a difference in the businesses he supported over the years and now bringing that know-how to Henry Schein Animal Health as well. 
Now just a key component part of Henry Schein's success is our relationship with our constituents, our suppliers, our team and our customers in the social outreach area. Through the second quarter, Henry Schein once again stepped up to support relief efforts for several disaster situations. Together with our supplier partners, we committed $0.5 million in product donations to support victims of the devastating earthquake that struck Nepal. And here in the U.S., we were active -- we activated our Disaster Relief Hotline to support customers affected by severe storms and flooding in the South Central region of our country while also providing support to our nongovernmental organization partners and their need for health care products to assist in relief efforts. 
So these are but 2 examples but are key in driving morale, customer support, supplier support and, of course, the morale generally in the company and amongst all of our constituents. 
Educating future generations of dentists and supporting advanced technology are both ongoing commitments of Henry Schein. We combined these 2 passions, and we're proudly announcing the creation of a Henry Schein Digital Center of Excellence at the Kornberg School of Dentistry at Temple University in Philadelphia. I expect that over the next 12 months, this center will serve as a digital dentistry training hub for students, faculty and alumni and will be equipped with the latest innovations of digital technology from Henry Schein and our supplier partners. 
We are committed to advancing our position, our global position, in digitalized dentistry and, at the same time, combining that with closer relations with our customers and educational institutions that graduate our customers in the dental, medical and veterinary space. 
In late June, we were honored to be selected as Corporation of the Year by the Association of Hispanic Healthcare Executives in recognition of our commitment to increase diversity and cultural competency in health care professions. 
And last, we continue to climb up the Fortune 500 list of America's largest companies. We have been named in this list for the past 11 years and now rank 287, up from 292 a year ago. Our inclusion in this prestigious listing is testament to the sheer commitment and value of the more than 18,000 Team Schein Members across the globe, all of whom are dedicated to helping practitioners improve the efficiency of their practice and provide quality care. And the fact that we were ranked and had been ranked really since we've been listed as a Fortune 500 company as one of the Most Admired Companies in health care distribution, being ranked #1 this past year again, is really a testament to our team, our customers and our suppliers. 
So with that overview of our quarterly financial operating performance, Steve and I are ready to take questions."

But the relationship, which is really a three-pronged relationship, has done quite well for Henry Schein and, I believe, for Cardinal as well. On the first line of the equation is the fact that we have taken over distribution of Cardinal's product line and, of course, its sales to customers that are small practitioners. Then on the other side is the IDNs, the large group practices, the large -- the multiple locations managed by IDNs as well as group practices. And that has also gone very, very well for us. That business is primarily -- transitioned to us. But this is all built on a relationship when we are securing product, own brand product from Cardinal and doing some joint procurement, and that has also worked quite well for us. So the customers that are being serviced by Henry Schein, former Cardinal customers, I believe, are very happy with the service we're providing and, at the same time, will be benefiting from the Cardinal branded products. And our pricing opportunities in this marketplace will also help our customers and help drive operating margin on the Henry Schein side. I'd hasten to also add that the internal growth from the Henry Schein core business, which is significantly now focused on IDNs and large group practices, is also performing very well when you exclude the impact of Cardinal, which in itself is also doing well."

At Q1, we were recording effectively agency sales. But as we started the integration process during Q2, as we integrate sales onto our platform, we record direct sales. You can see that the acquisition sales growth was 4.6% for the quarter. It'll annualize. Now we're continuing to integrate. We would expect that the integration will continue probably through the better part of Q3. At that point, we should have all or virtually all of the sales on our platform. The run rate that I would use for modeling going forward is something north of maybe $250 million, but I don't have a more precise number at this time. And that would get phased in -- starting with Q4, we'll probably be at that rate, and that's on an all direct sales basis assuming that there's no more agency sales at that point. And there should be some growth to that, of course, as we continue to add product assortment, and we continue to drive growth to those customers."

Our backlog at the end of the quarter, both domestically and internationally, is up very nicely. So we feel good about that for our future growth, remember that backlog covers primarily traditional equipment, not the high-tech equipment, but that's a good indicator, the traditional equipment. Remember, we're going through a little bit of transition. We added the A-dec line. So there's a learning curve, and there's that, that we're focusing on in the U.S. I would say that if you look at the components, in North America, I think that the bright spot of the equipment was -- traditional equipment, was the bright spot for us. We were a little bit soft on technology in a large part because PlanScan had upgrades last year, but still soft in technology despite that. But we're feeling good like equipment is going to be a good driver for us for the second half of the year."

And of course, we do service, especially on the Dental side, dentists throughout the world through -- and I mentioned 33. We're actually on the ground with distribution centers, call centers and field salespeople in 33 countries. I will say to you that Europe presents a good opportunity because we're going to be going against lower comps as the year progresses and I think we will be seeing some good growth in a couple of markets as the year progresses and I think going into next year. So in Europe as a basket, which just took a bit of a hit last year, is, I think, recovering. But as you saw, the German equipment numbers were -- the equipment numbers in general were pretty good, driven largely by Germany but not exclusively by Germany. So -- and I think the equipment appetite is good. I think there's a growing demand for digitalized dentistry, both in the dentist office, chairside dentistry, chairside digitalized prosthetics and in the laboratory, which is not only interested in ensuring that the customers have scanners to submit the prosthetics but also within the lab where there's a lot of opportunity for digitalized equipment. We're seeing this quite nicely coming out of the Arseus acquisition but not only out of that acquisition, which in itself leads to block sales, where we see good margin and some unique opportunities for Henry Schein in that space. So that leads, of course, into consumables. And I think it's fair to say that although the markets in Europe are a little bit anemic, they're getting stronger, and Henry Schein, I think, will continue to gain market share. There's nice opportunity in Australia and New Zealand on the Dental side and I would say on the Animal Health side, too, and let me just go back, I think our European Animal Health business is also in very good shape. We've got good products, great management and some really good opportunity. And if you're going around the world, I have to say that the Dental business in Australia, Belgium and Brazil, presents really nice opportunity as well. If you go out a little longer, I think we're quite optimistic about our business in Asia, although there's a lot more work to be done in establishing the platform, and we're hopeful that over time, we'll be able to extend our presence in Japan and China. So we're quite optimistic about our International business."

It seems like you need some decent growth in the back half of the year to get to the low to mid-single digits. But can you just reflect -- in the past, when that better consumable growth starts to seep into the mind of the dentists, they feel better, want some better efficiency in their practice, and then you see that reflected in the equipment numbers. What sort of lag has that been historically? And can we see, as a result of that, a step up in equipment in North America in '16 and beyond?"

And I think dentists are realizing it's a good place -- their practice is a good place to invest. So if you look at some of the technology out there, which helps increase the efficiency of the practice, improves on the workflow, resulting in a better experience for the customer and better productivity, you put the mindset together, the optimism that technology can bring to the practice and the ultimate efficiency and productivity, it leads to a good mindset in technology-driven products. And so I think that's where we will see quite a bit of upside. In addition, I think dentists are feeling pretty good and should be in a position, we think, for the remainder of the year to invest in some of the traditional equipment. I think our expanded line will help us in that regard from a pure Henry Schein point of view. So I think it's less to do with a specific uptick, a couple of basis points here or there, and more to do with the mindset, which is pretty good right now in dentistry.

So in past calls, and let me reemphasize it because it's working, 6 or 7 years ago, we commissioned 2 studies. One is the area that is likely -- the part of health care that is likely to be moving the most rapidly, and we determined that to be the alternate site and the physician provider because of the anticipated health care reform implications, namely, wellness and prevention. So we decided to focus on the physician side of health care. And we said to ourselves, as part of that, what kind of physician providers and determined it is likely to be larger groups, so consolidation of practices into larger groups. And at the same time, IDNs, integrated delivery networks, would be expanding their presence into this large group arena. So we set up a health care services group, I think, 7 years ago to focus on this part of the Medical business, and we focused very deeply on it. We were not distracted with acquisitions. There were some very large properties available that service the smaller practitioner groups and some of the single practitioners, the 1, 2, 3 practitioner. We focused on the large group practices and the IDNs through our health care services group, and that's done very well. At the same time, we said to ourselves, what are the specialties that are going to be the most productive from a sales point of view and more importantly, from a margin point of view? And we determined which specialties we'll have to focus on, and we built that as well. You take the 2 together, it's resulting in top line growth, internal growth and, of course, operating margin expansion in our Medical Group. And you put that together with our Cardinal alignment, and it's an acquisition of their sales in the space, but then you add to that the procurement opportunities that we have to procure products under their brand and to jointly advance better procurement between our 2 businesses, and the net result is top line growth and margin expansion for our Medical business."

So we believe the Animal Health business is a good business because of demographics, the elderly, the baby boomers spending more money on their pets. So that's one. And the middle class and the rest of the world, developing world, et cetera, is growing, and that results also in pet advancement, but within there lies the demand for protein as well. So we believe that is an opportunity. Not sure if distribution of branded pharmaceuticals is necessarily the best play in that space. It may be, but there's opportunity for niche products with high margin. And so for example, I think the KRUUSE opportunity will be very, very good for us. The scil opportunity will be very, very good for us on the equipment side, and the Veterinary Instrumentation offering in the instrument side will be very good for us. We're adding resource in that space, expect to add more products over time, gain more margin and have a very profitable business that will be focused on the large animal side as well. But I'm just not sure if the tonnage, lots and lots of sales in branded pharmaceutical is the way to go and whether that's the place to put capital and certainly not the place, in our view, to put capital at a very expensive cost, to put that work -- that capital to work. But we do see opportunity in the space, and we do business in a number of countries in the large animal space, in the dairy space, in the various other areas, and remain quite optimistic about that. But I think our play will be a little bit different given our strengths in the business today and the opportunities ahead of us. Just going back to the question on the diagnostics, we were, of course, taken by surprise in this space. But I believe that our team has come together quite quickly in putting together an excellent offering, a global offering of diagnostics. We're working very well with Abaxis and Heska, and in combination with our Practice Solutions business, the software business here in the United States and abroad and our big data opportunities, we'll, I think, have some really exciting opportunities for our customers and our suppliers going forward. So although we were quite surprised by what happened, considering that we had -- what we thought was a good relationship with the supplier, we remain very, very optimistic and specifically with our Axis-Q bidirectional integrated solution that improves workflow and reduces missed patient opportunities in the practice. So we have added good resources in that area, have really good management, good team in the diagnostics space, more to follow and remain very, very excited both in the equipment arena and with the rapid tests. It's amazing how many suppliers have come to us from around the world and say, ""Now we see an opportunity for you in the space,"" but our anchor, of course, is Abaxis and Heska."

But generally, I think the smarter manufacturers understand the value that distribution brings. Of course, logistics, but that's not the area. It's in the value-added services, and in our particular case, because we have 4,000 field sales consultants around the world that are specialists in practice management, understand how a practice should be run and help our customers operate a more efficient business so that they can provide better clinical care, and that drives manufacturers moving towards us, and I believe that's the case in all 3 businesses.

As was also case during the first quarter, the first half actually of the year, strength of the U.S. dollar impacted all of our international operations during the third quarter and particularly those in Europe. For the quarter, changes in currency exchange reduced our total sales growth by nearly 6% and reduced EPS by $0.06, both compared with the previous year, with last year.

I am also pleased to report solid results for the third quarter of 2015. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 third quarter results include restructuring costs of $8.4 million pretax or $0.08 per dilu",1858,"Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning. I am also pleased to report solid results for the third quarter of 2015. 
As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 third quarter results include restructuring costs of $8.4 million pretax or $0.08 per diluted share. Our most recent estimate of restructuring costs to be recorded in 2015 has been reduced to $30 million to $35 million pretax or approximately $0.26 to $0.30 per diluted share. This is a reduction from our original estimate of $35 million to $40 million pretax, and this reduced estimate is the result of certain restructuring actions being deferred to 2016. 
As such, we expect to continue to record restructuring costs through the first half of 2016. Our Q3 results also include a onetime income tax benefit net of a noncontrolling interest of $3.8 million or $0.05 per diluted share, and that's related to a favorable tax ruling that we received during the third quarter. 
I will be discussing our results as reported and also on a non-GAAP basis, which will exclude both the restructuring costs and the impact of the tax benefit since we believe that the latter is more useful for comparative purposes. You can refer to Exhibit B of this morning's earnings news release, and that reconciles our GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations. 
Turning to our Q3 results. Our net sales for the quarter ended September 26, 2015, were $2.7 billion, reflecting a 2.4% increase compared with the third quarter of 2014. This consisted of an 8.3% growth in local currencies and a decline of 5.9% related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, or constant currencies, our internal generated sales growth was 4.8%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 3.5%. You can see the details of sales growth in Exhibit A of today's earnings news release. 
Our operating margin for the quarter was 7.0% and expanded by 40 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year. However, on a non-GAAP basis, which would exclude the restructuring costs, our adjusted operating margin for the third quarter of 2015 improved by 71 basis points and was 7.4%. This expansion, which was very strong for the quarter, was a result of both higher gross margin as well as a reduction of operating expenses as a percentage of sales. 
If you look to our effective tax rate for the quarter, it was 29.6% on a non-GAAP basis. Again, we're excluding the onetime tax benefit and the restructuring costs to show the non-GAAP effective tax rate, and that compares to 30.0% last year. Again, the lower tax rate is due to ongoing tax planning strategies as well as higher earnings in countries with lower corporate tax rates. We continue to expect that our non-GAAP effective tax rate will be in this 30% range for the remainder of the year as well as going forward into next year. 
Our net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. for the third quarter of 2015 was $127.7 million or $1.52 per diluted share. This represented growth of 11.3% and 13.4%, respectively, compared to the prior year. However, again on a non-GAAP basis, net income attributable to Henry Schein was higher or $130.6 million or $1.55 per diluted share, and that growth is 13.7% and 15.7%, respectively, again compared to the prior year. 
I think it's important to reiterate that the foreign currency exchange impact was not only negative $0.06 for the quarter on our EPS, but it's approximately $0.20 for the first 9 months of the year, and that's just converting foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at today's average rate versus last year's average rate. So it has been a big headwind for us in the current year. 
Let me now turn to our sales results and review some details there. Our Dental sales for the third quarter of 2015 declined by 2.5% to $1.3 billion, but again this is related to foreign currency. The 2.5% decline consisted of 4.6% growth in constant currency and 7.1% decline related to foreign currency. 
In local currencies, our internally generated sales was 4.1%, and acquisition growth contributed another 0.5%. Of that 4.1% internal growth in constant currencies, it consisted of 2 components: 4.4% growth in North America and 3.6% growth internationally. 
Let's look at some additional detail on each of those figures. First, the North American internal growth of 4.4% consists of 3.8% growth in Dental consumable merchandise sales and 6.4% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenue. 
Looking at the International business, the 3.6% constant-currency growth -- internal growth included 2.9% growth in Dental consumable merchandise and 5.3% growth in Dental equipment sales revenue. So across the board on global Dental, we showed solid sales growth, both in consumables and equipment domestically and internationally. 
Turning to Animal Health sales. They were $732.5 million in the third quarter, down 3.4%, but the components there is 4.5% local currency growth and a decline related to foreign currency exchange of 7.9%. 
Internal sales growth in constant currencies grew 0.5%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 4.0% to growth. That 0.5% internal growth in constant currencies included a 1.9% decline in North America and 2.7% growth internationally. 
Again as we've done for the first 2 quarters, we are normalizing our sales growth in international, and that 1.9% decline in internal sales in local currencies from North America actually reflects a 4.2% growth when you normalize both for the impact of product switching between agency and direct sales as well as excluding sales of diagnostic products, both in the current period and in the prior period due to changes of veterinary diagnostic manufacturing relationships. Again, we believe that this normalized growth rate is more meaningful and a better reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business, and we'll continue to show this normalized basis through the end of the year. 
Our Medical sales were $597.2 million for the third quarter, and that's an increase of 24.3%. It consists of 25.0% growth in local currencies and a small decline of 0.7% related to foreign currency exchange. Overall, internal sales growth in local currencies was 13.6%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 11.4%. 
As I think most people know, the bulk of our Medical business is in North America, and that 13%, 13.6% internal growth was led by North America, which was 14.1%, and that again was driven by large group practices and IDNs as well as a 1.3% growth internationally. This 14.1% growth in the North American Medical business was the highest level it's been in approximately 8 years. 
If we look at the component of our Medical sales, sales of seasonal influenza vaccines were $68.9 million for the third quarter of 2015, and that's up as a little bit favorable timing. It's up 12% over last year. We sold about 6.6 million doses of flu vaccine during the third quarter, and through yesterday, we sold a total of nearly 7.7 million doses. So we expect to sell for the whole year somewhere between 9 million and 10 million doses, and we're well on our way to achieving that. 
If you exclude the impact of flu vaccine sales in both periods, the overall Medical sales growth increased 26.2% and 27% in constant currency. 
Turning to Technology and Value-Added Service sales. They were $89.7 million in the quarter, which is a 3.0% increase. This included 5.8% growth in constant currency and a 2.8% decline related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, the internally generated sales increased by 5.2%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 0.6%. That global 5.2% internal growth in constant currencies includes 4.5% growth in North America and 8.4% growth internationally. 
If we turn to stock repurchase, we continued to repurchase our common stock in the open market during the third quarter. Specifically, we purchased approximately 261,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $144.11, which is just under $38 million of cash. 
This impact -- the impact of this during the quarter was not material to our EPS. At the close of the quarter, we still have about $149 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock, and we remain committed to our goal of buying between $200 million and $300 million of stock for the full year. 
If we take a brief look at some highlights from our balance sheet and cash flow, we had operating cash flow for the quarter of $107.4 million. That compares to $174 million last year. If you look at the details, the decrease was primarily driven by working capital and increases in accounts receivable and inventory although we continue to believe we'll have strong operating cash flow for the year. 
The days sales outstanding was favorable, 40.6 days in the current quarter versus 41.2 days last year, and inventory turns were slightly down to 5.7 turns versus 6 turns last year. 
But finally, I'll just conclude with going through guidance for 2015 and '16. I think it's important to remember that over the last 2 quarters, we noted on our past 2 conference calls that we expected to be at the low end of EPS guidance for the current year, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange. And as I said, for the first 9 months of 2015, foreign currency exchange translation had a negative impact again of approximately $0.20 on our EPS for the first 9 months. 
So because of that, we are now adjusting our EPS for the year to be in a range of $5.90 to $5.96, and that represents growth of 8% to 10% compared to the actual 2014 results. The 2015 guidance excludes restructuring costs, which are expected to be between $0.26 and $0.30 per diluted share for the year as well as the onetime $0.05 tax benefit that occurred in the third quarter. 
Also again, we now expect that these restructuring activities that were expected at the beginning of 2015 to be completed at the year will now a portion of them will roll over into 2016, and we now expect restructuring costs in 2016 to be $0.03 to $0.07 per diluted share and should continue through the first half of 2016. As always, our 2015 EPS guidance is for continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include any impact of potential future acquisitions should they occur. 
Turning to 2016 financial guidance. We're pleased to report that we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be in the range of $6.55 to $6.65, and that represents growth of 10% to 12% compared to the midpoint of our 2015 adjusted guidance range. Again, the guidance for 2016 is for continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions and also does not include the impact of the restructuring cost of again approximately $0.03 to $0.07. We also -- our guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates remain relatively consistent with the current levels. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Stan."

Let me begin my review by -- of our 4 business groups with Dental Group. In North America, we believe that consumable merchandise internal sales growth was, in local currencies, was in the 3.8% range and indicates continued solid patient flow to Dental offices. Equipment sales and service internal growth in local currencies was a solid 6.4% and was the highest in more than a year. 
I noted during our last quarter call that we expect the North American Dental sales service growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, and these numbers bear that out. We saw particular strength during the quarter in sales of what we internally call traditional equipment. 
With International Dental, consumable merchandise internal sales in local currencies grew at 2.9% during the third quarter. International equipment sales and service internal growth in local currencies was a solid 5.3%, and this follows double-digit gains in the preceding quarter, which was bolstered by the IDS, the International Dental Show growth. 
Before we move on to our Animal Health financial performance, I would like to highlight an expansion of our Dental operations in Italy. We just announced an agreement to make an investment in Dental Trey, a distributor of Dental consumable merchandise and equipment with sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2015, of approximately EUR 41 million. Dental Trey offers more than 33,000 branded products and a line of private label products to Dental practices in the region through a team of sales agents and e-commerce web -- and an e-commerce web portal. 
Dental Trey also sells proprietary Dental practice management software system with an installed base of more than 1,200 Dental offices. Dental Trey will complement our existing business in Italy with a solid product offering and long-standing customer relations. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of 2015. The acquisition is anticipated to be neutral to our 2016 diluted earnings per share and slightly accretive by less than $0.01 in 2017 and beyond. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on our Animal Health group. North America internal growth in local currency was 4.2% on a normalized basis. Growth in our Animal Health group continues to reflect the benefits of strategic acquisitions. During the quarter, we closed on our purchase of a majority interest in Jorgen Kruuse. Kruuse has sales -- had sales in 2014 of approximately $90 million, and this expanded our direct presence to Denmark, Norway and Sweden. We also expect and this is very important to introduce the Kruuse brand of products to additional markets and particularly through the Henry Schein businesses in the next year. 
So this business is, of course, strategic from a geographic point of view, geographic presence point of view but also important because of our unique Kruuse brand of products. 
We were very, very excited to -- about the agreement that we announced a couple of days ago to acquire 80.1% interest in another company named Vetstreet. Vetstreet is a leading provider of marketing solutions and health information analytics to veterinary clinics and Animal Health manufacturers. Vetstreet offers veterinary clinics a suite of products and services that address key issues, including communicating with pet owners once they leave a clinic and the lack of compliance with wellness visits and prescription regimen. 
When this transaction closes early next year, Vetstreet will be a meaningful complement to our U.S. Animal Health businesses and in particular, our Practice Management Software installed base, which is in about half the veterinarians of this country. And we expand our practice marketing and client communication solutions, provide tools for better enhancement of our supplier relations and connect us to veterinary clinics that are not current customers of Henry Schein Animal Health. The transaction, which is expected to close in early 2016, is anticipated to be neutral to 2016 diluted earnings per share and add $0.01 to $0.02 of accretion in 2017 and beyond. 
On the Medical side, we had also a very exciting quarter. Internal sales growth for our Medical Group in North America was 14.1%, an 8-year high as we made further progress with large group practices and IDNs, integrated delivery networks. This growth, this internal growth was bolstered by sales from our strategic agreement with Cardinal, and we are delighted with the continued successful transition of customers to the Henry Schein platform. 
The combination of internal growth plus the contribution from the Cardinal Health agreement results in 26% growth in North America for the quarter versus the prior year. The integration of the strategic agreement into Henry Schein is substantially complete with the many components to be integrated during the current fourth quarter. We remain optimistic about our ability to win new customers through our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health, being uniquely positioned to directly serve the entire continuum of health care. 
Now let me conclude with a short overview of our Technology and Value-Added segment. Internal sales growth in North America was 4.5% in local currencies, and international internal growth was 8.4% in local currencies with particular strength during the quarter in the electronic services and Value-Added Services arena. 
Henry Schein is committed to the efficient delivery in health services while supporting business successes of our customers. The advanced technology products and services we offer provide a platform for our sales opportunities across all of our businesses. 
So before we open the call to questions, I'd like to highlight some recent recognitions and initiatives. As you may know Henry Schein is committed to expanding access to care for the underserved throughout the world and to increasing diversity and cultural competency within the health care profession, each of the professions we serve for that matter. In August, we announced separation of Henry Schein Cares Medal, which will honor organizations whose work has been especially affected in bringing care to those in need. And at Gallivan next year, we will be awarding medals to organizations from the fields of oral health, Animal Health and medical health. 
And also in August, Henry Schein was awarded the corporate award by the Hispanic Dental Association. We received this in recognition for our decades of supporting initiatives to increase diversity and cultural competency in the Dental profession for the U.S. and global Hispanic communities as well as for our commitment to providing access to care and of course, health care equity worldwide. 
The Henry Schein GlobalCare corporate responsibility program was active during the third quarter. We launched our 2015 healthy lifestyles, healthy communities program, which this year expects to serve approximately 8,700 children and caregivers throughout the United States with free Medical and Dental services at 14 health care events. 
We again partnered with Integrated Medical Foundation and a large urology group practice association to help raise awareness nationwide about the importance of prostate cancer screenings, and we helped more than 5,000 children return to the classroom ready to succeed through our 18th annual Back to School program. 
We also launched our new initiative with organizations called Canine Companions for Independence, under which our puppy raiser care package are being delivered to veterinarians for the customers volunteered to raise assistance dogs for people with physical disabilities. 
On the academic side, we recently announced a partnership with the American College of Prosthodontics Education Foundation along with other Dental partners to develop a new CAD/CAM technology curriculum for predoctoral and postdoctoral programs. This curriculum is expected to be piloted by several Dental schools beginning in 2017. We believe that CAD/CAM technology enhances dentistry and want to make sure that Dental students are appropriately trained so they can improve process efficiency and ensure better patient outcomes. 
We are excited to be part of ensuring that the coming generation of Dental professionals has the training required to derive the benefits that digital technology has to offer their patients. So you will see Henry Schein has been successful in advancing our strategies by advancing the needs of our suppliers, our customers, our team, our investors and society in general. And it's the interplay between these 5 constituents that, at the end of the day, has provided Henry Schein with the opportunity to provide consistent earnings as we enter our 21st year as a public company. 
Yesterday was the 20th anniversary of Henry Schein IPO, and I think it is fair to say that our shareholders should be pleased with the consistent delivery of results, both in terms of earnings per share and in terms of taking earnings per share and turning them into cash. This was the direct result of the balancing of these 5 constituents. 
So with that overview of our quarterly financial operating performance, Steven and I are pleased to take questions you may have."

This has been the result of a strategic planning exercise we concluded about 7 years ago, in which we determined that there were 2 areas we wanted to focus on. One is the larger practices of the networks and what has morphed into what many referred to as the IDNs, integrated delivery networks and at the same time, focusing on certain specialty areas that I reported position all potentially geared towards wellness and prevention, which holds in line with the health care reform plans, in other words, wellness, health care versus sick care, moving procedures from the hospitals to the office to the care side. Our strategies are solid. We believe they are solid for many years to come, and we believe our Medical Group has been executing very well. Of course, the Cardinal, the acquisition of Cardinal positions business and integration of those sales representatives, including adding the Cardinal product offering to our Henry Schein offering have all contributed in one way or another to driving first, the internal growth and in addition, of course, the acquisition growth that came along with that acquisition."

It's hard to tell if there's future switches between agencies and direct sales, we really can't predict that but -- so it's not something I could say is going to end or not and because it seems to be every year a flip-flop from one manufacturer from one to the other, but we'll continue to call it out because I do think the best way of looking at our real growth is adjusting the impact of agency sales conversions for our sales."

We are actually quite pleased with the progress we are making on our diagnostic portfolio offering and in fact, training of our sales force to introduce these products. As you may recall, the switch from one manufacturer to this group of manufacturers came quite sudden. We were focused on a lot of other things at the time and reliance on that manufacturer. So about a year ago, we had to put our plans into place. Our plans contemplated adding software, middleware that would connect various manufacturers systems to our software our Practice Management Software, and about half the physicians in this country use our Practice Management Software and a fair number overseas use our Practice Management Software. So we developed this middleware, Axis-Q, which is pretty good. It's up and running. It's out of beta, and we're selling. Of course, our sales force needs to be trained and understand how the interface between the Axis-Q business, and there is a wide variety of systems out there there's no shortage of good technology out there, how we can connect that in the most effective way to our customers and Practice Management system orders also tying in reference labs to our Practice Management system. And all of this together with our acquisition of scale, which is a leading provider of laboratory diagnostics equipment software is working actually quite well, and we are pleased given the short amount of time that we've had to focus on this what the results. Now if you add the acquisition of Vetstreet to that, you will see that we are in a pretty good position to provide very good information to our customers to help them go out into their customer base to ensure that they are attracting traffic into the practitioner's office and provide solid data to those manufacturers that wish to work with us on the pet food side and on the pharma side. So we are very pleased with where we are considering what happened about a year ago, and I'm quite sure as has been the case in several times in Henry Schein's history, where a similar situation has emerged, that Henry Schein will thrive, and we will, in fact, be a significant provider of diagnostic equipment to veterinarians throughout the world."

So there were a number of items, and I'll go through a couple of them that were timing impacts that were favorable timing in Q3 that reverse, obviously, in Q4. They include things like flu vaccines year-over-year. Flu vaccine sales were much a stronger, up 12% Q3 this year versus last year. And as you know, flu vaccine is a good margin product for us. There's also timing of a number of expenses that were expected to hit and typically hit in Q3 that are now expected to hit in Q4. And if you add all those together, you may have $0.03, $0.04 or $0.05 of timing variances between Q3 and Q4. So while that reduces of a little bit the growth in Q3, obviously, it has the opposite impact in Q4.

The U.K. is a good market. I think we're doing okay there. Practices are a bit weak, but we are doing okay, because we are only the only international full-service dealer distributor in the U.K. and then if you look at Italy and Spain, we're doing okay, but the comparables are pretty low. And then the only other big market's Australia, where there are we're doing okay, we're getting some market share. But certainly, Australia economy is not doing as well as it was maybe because the commodities, but I think it seems to be a bit of a lackluster economy at this moment. It can turnaround quickly.

It is a longer sales cycle to convert people, not all veterinarians are eligible for conversion in the same year because of long-term commitments. So it is a multiyear project. So we're still negative on overall diagnostic sales but again long term, we feel as Stanley talked about in the previous question, optimistic about being successful in that category."

There are a couple of factors. First of all, there is definitely a movement from the acute care setting to the ultimate care setting, both in terms of decision physician practices, and I'm talking about GPs although in some areas the specialists, too, and the ambulatory care centers. So that's a fact, specific data, hard to get, but I think it's fair to say. I think as the Affordable Care Act kicks in, there'll be more people covered with the ability to go to a GP for a checkup or when they're feeling have a flu or something rather than we until there really sick to go to the emergency center at a hospital with people who do not have insurance would have been treated. I'm not dealing with the very low end, which is Medicaid nor the Medicare or those that are covered by insurance but this, I don't know, 50 million, 60 million, 70 million people that one way or another now will have some form of insurance, not fully kicked in but GPs in general are seeing more patients. They're not getting reimbursed, by the way, at the same rate per patient that they were before, but they need a glove, and they need a mask and they need solutions. I would also add that through not that many national distributors that could provide a complete solution to the altered care setting. I happen to think we do it better than anyone else, but I'm sure others will see if they do it well. So we are gaining recognition with the GPOs and their GPOs realize that it's the contract is put through signed they're not going to look too bad because we're going to execute well, and I think we execute extremely well to these large accounts, multiple locations under common management. So it's a little bit of trend, and it's a lot of execution and I think we have good momentum in this marketplace a lot of brand recognition that perhaps we didn't have 6 or 7 years ago amongst these large providers because 6 or 7 years ago, we were not into the doctors general mandate personally manage the practice rather than to the large group practice or the hospital or the IDN that is now our customer."

But if you think it through, is the last week of the year, which is the holiday week. So when you look at sales on consumables, sales tend to be very light that week because a lot of offices are closed, and there's not a lot of ordering going on that week. Equipment is a little different story, but at least on consumables, it's a very light week and a lot of expenses. And if you think of payroll and payroll related that represents at least 2/3 of our expense structure, you have a full week's worth of payroll and a partial week's worth of sales.

If we're growing faster in the specialty area, it's probably the reason is probably because we are underpenetrated.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are so pleased with our third quarter financial results, which reflected accelerated growth in adjusted diluted EPS as well as in worldwide sales despite the continued negative impact of the strength of the United States dollar. 
As was also case during the first quarter -- the first half actually of the year, the strength of the U.S. dollar impacted all of our international operation during the third quarter and particularly, those in Europe. For the quarter, changes in currency exchange reduced our total sales growth by nearly 6% and reduced EPS by $0.06, both compared with the previous year, with last year. Yet, overall, the global markets we serve continue to be stable. Through our long-standing strategy of organic growth complemented by strategic acquisitions, we believe we've continued to gain market share on an overall basis during the quarter, both in North America and internationally.

I am also pleased to report solid results for the third quarter of 2015. 
As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 third quarter results include restructuring costs of $8.4 million pretax or $0.08 per diluted share. Our most recent estimate of restructuring cost to be recorded in 2015 has been reduced to $30 million to $35 million pretax or approximately $0.26 to $0.30 per diluted share. This is a reduction from our original estimate of $35 million to $40 million pretax, and this reduced estimate is the result of certain restructuring actions being deferred to 2016. As such, we expect to continue to record restructuring costs through the first half of 2016. 
Our Q3 results also include a onetime income tax benefit net of a noncontrolling interest of $3.8 million or $0.05 per diluted share, and that's related to a favorable tax ruling that we received during the third quarter. 
I will be discussing our results as reported and also on a non-GAAP basis, which will exclude both the restructuring costs and the impact of the tax benefit since we believe that the latter is more useful for comparative purposes. You can refer to Exhibit B of this morning's earnings news release, and that reconciles our GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations. 
Turning to our Q3 results. Our net sales for the quarter ended September 26, 2015, were $2.7 billion, reflecting a 2.4% increase compared with the third quarter of 2014. This consisted of an 8.3% growth in local currencies and a decline of 5.9% related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, or constant currencies, our internal generated sales growth was 4.8%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 3.5%. You can see the details of sales growth in Exhibit A of today's earnings news release. 
Our operating margin for the quarter was 7.0% and expanded by 40 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year. However, on a non-GAAP basis, which would exclude the restructuring costs, our adjusted operating margin for the third quarter of 2015 improved by 71 basis points and was 7.4%. This expansion, which was very strong for the quarter, was a result of both high gross margin as well as a reduction of operating expenses as a percentage of sales. 
If you look to our effective tax rate for the quarter, it was 29.6% on a non-GAAP basis. Again, we're excluding the onetime tax benefit and the restructuring costs to show the non-GAAP effective tax rate, and that compares to 30.0% last year. Again, the lower tax rate is due to ongoing tax planning strategies as well as higher earnings in countries with lower corporate tax rate. We continue to expect that our non-GAAP effective tax rate will be in this 30% range for the remainder of the year as well as going forward into next year. 
Our net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. for the third quarter of 2015 was $127.7 million or $1.52 per diluted share. This represented growth of 11.3% and 13.4%, respectively, compared to the prior year. However, again, on a non-GAAP basis, net income attributable to Henry Schein was higher, or $130.6 million or $1.55 per diluted share, and that growth is 13.7% and 15.7%, respectively, again, compared to the prior year. 
I think it's important to reiterate that the foreign currency exchange impact was not only negative $0.06 for the quarter on our EPS. But it's approximately $0.20 for the first 9 months of the year, and that's just converting foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at today's average rate versus last year's average rate. So it has been a big headwind for us in the current year. 
Let me now turn to our sales results and review some details there. Our Dental sales for the third quarter of 2015 declined by 2.5% to $1.3 billion. But again, this is related to foreign currency. The 2.5% decline consisted of 4.6% growth in constant currency and 7.1% decline related to foreign currency. 
In local currencies, our internally generated sales was 4.1%, and acquisition growth contributed another 0.5%. Of that 4.1% internal growth in constant currencies, it consisted of 2 components: 4.4% growth in North America and 3.6% growth internationally. 
Let's look at some additional detail on each of those figures. First, the North American internal growth of 4.4% consist of 3.8% growth in Dental consumable merchandise sales and 6.4% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenue. 
Looking at the International business. The 3.6% constant-currency growth -- internal growth included 2.9% growth in Dental consumable merchandise and 5.3% growth in Dental equipment sales revenue. So across-the-board on Global Dental, we showed solid sales growth, both in consumables and equipment domestically and internationally. 
Turning to Animal Health sales. They were $732.5 million in the third quarter, down 3.4%. But the components there, there's 4.5% local currency growth and a decline related to foreign currency exchange of 7.9%. Internal sales growth in constant currencies grew 0.5%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 4.0% to growth. That 0.5% internal growth in constant currencies included a 1.9% decline in North America and 2.7% growth internationally. 
Again, as we've done for the first 2 quarters, we are normalizing our sales growth in international, and that 1.9% decline in internal sales in local currencies from North America actually reflects a 4.2% growth when you normalize both for the impact of product switching between agency and direct sales as well as excluding sales of diagnostic products, both in the current period and in the prior period due to changes of veterinary diagnostic manufacturing relationships. Again, we believe that this normalized growth rate is more meaningful and a better reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business, and we'll continue to show this normalized basis through the end of the year. 
Our Medical sales were $597.2 million for the third quarter, and that's an increase of 24.3%. It consists of 25.0% growth in local currencies and a small decline of 0.7% related to foreign currency exchange. Overall, internal sales growth in local currencies was 13.6%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 11.4%. 
As I think most people know, the bulk of our Medical business is in North America, and that 13% -- 13.6% internal growth was led by North America, which was 14.1%. And that, again, was driven by large group practices and IDNs as well as a 1.3% growth internationally. This 14.1% growth in the North American Medical business was the highest level it's been in approximately 8 years. 
If we look at the component of our Medical sales, sales of seasonal influenza vaccines were $68.9 million for the third quarter of 2015, and that's up -- there's a little bit favorable timing. It's up 12% over last year. We sold about 6.6 million doses of flu vaccine during the third quarter. And through yesterday, we sold a total of nearly 7.7 million doses. So we expect to sell for the whole year somewhere between 9 million and 10 million doses, and we're well on our way to achieving that. If you exclude the impact of flu vaccine sales in both periods, the overall Medical sales growth increased 26.2% and 27% in constant currency. 
Turning to Technology and Value-Added Service sales. They were $89.7 million in the quarter, which is a 3.0% increase. This included 5.8% growth in constant currency and a 2.8% decline related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, the internally generated sales increased by 5.2%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 0.6%. That global 5.2% internal growth in constant currencies includes 4.5% growth in North America and 8.4% growth internationally. 
If we turn to stock repurchase, we continued to repurchase our common stock in the open market during the third quarter. Specifically, we purchased approximately 261,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $144.11, which is just under $38 million of cash. This impact -- the impact of this during the quarter was not material to our EPS. At the close of the quarter, we still have about $149 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock, and we remain committed to our goal of buying between $200 million and $300 million of stock for the full year. 
If we take a brief look at both our -- some highlights from our balance sheet and cash flow, we had operating cash flow for the quarter of $107.4 million. That compares to $174 million last year. If you look at the details, there was -- the decrease was primarily driven by working capital and increases in accounts receivable and inventory, although we continue to believe we'll have strong operating cash flow for the year. 
The days sales outstanding was favorable, 40.6 days in the current quarter versus 41.2 days last year. And inventory turns were slightly down to 5.7 turns versus 6 turns last year. 
Finally, I'll just conclude with going through guidance for 2015 and '16. I think it's important to remember that over the last 2 quarters, we noted on our past 2 conference calls that we expected to be at the low end of EPS guidance for the current year, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange. And as I said, for the first 9 months of 2015, foreign currency exchange translation had a negative impact, again, of approximately $0.20 on our EPS for the first 9 months. So because of that, we are now adjusting our EPS for the year to be in the range of $5.90 to $5.96, and that represents growth of 8% to 10% compared to the actual 2014 results. The 2015 guidance excludes restructuring costs, which are expected to be between $0.26 and $0.30 per diluted share for the year, as well as the onetime $0.05 tax benefit that occurred in the third quarter. 
Also, again, we now expect that these restructuring activities that were expected at the beginning of 2015 to be completed at the year will now -- a portion of them will roll over into 2016, and we now expect the restructuring costs in 2016 to be $0.03 to $0.07 per diluted share and should continue through the first half of 2016. As always, our 2015 EPS guidance is for continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include any impact for potential future acquisitions should they occur. 
Turning to 2016 financial guidance. We're pleased to report that we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be in the range of $6.55 to $6.65, and that represents growth of 10% to 12% compared to the midpoint of our 2015 adjusted guidance range. Again, the guidance for 2016 is for continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions and also does not include the impact of the restructuring costs of, again, approximately $0.03 to $0.07. We also -- our guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates remain relatively consistent with current levels. 
So with that, I'd like to now turn the call back over to Stan."

Let me begin my review by -- of our 4 business groups with Dental Group.

Let me begin my review by -- of our 4 business groups with Dental Group. In North America, we believe that consumable merchandise internal sales growth was -- in local currencies was in the 3.8% range and indicates continued solid patient flow to dental offices. Equipment sales and service internal growth in local currencies was a solid 6.4% and was the highest in more than a year. 
I noted during our last quarter call that we expect the North America Dental sales service growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, and these numbers bear that out. We saw particular strength during the quarter in sales of what we internally call traditional equipment. 
With International Dental, consumable merchandise internal sales in local currencies grew 2.9% during the third quarter. International equipment sales and service internal growth in local currencies was a solid 5.3%, and this follows double-digit gains in the preceding quarter, which was bolstered by the IDS, the International Dental Show, growth. 
Before we move on to our Animal Health financial performance, I would like to highlight an expansion of our Dental operations in Italy. We just announced an agreement to make an investment in Dental Trey, a distributor of dental consumable merchandise and equipment with sales for 12 months ended June 30, 2015, of approximately EUR 41 million. Dental Trey offers more than 33,000 branded products and a line of private-label products to dental practicers in the region through a team of sales agents and e-commerce web -- and an e-commerce web portal. 
Dental Trey also sells proprietary dental practice management software system with an installed base of more than 1,200 dental offices. Dental Trey will complement our existing business in Italy with a solid product offering and long-standing customer relations. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of 2015. The acquisition is anticipated to be neutral to our 2016 diluted earnings per share and slightly accretive by less than $0.01 in 2017 and beyond. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on our Animal Health group. North America internal growth in local currencies was 4.2% on a normalized basis. Growth in our Animal Health group continues to reflect the benefits of strategic acquisitions. During the quarter, we closed on our purchase of a majority interest in Jorgen Kruuse A/S. Kruuse has sales -- had sales in 2014 of approximately $90 million, and this expanded our direct presence to Denmark, Norway and Sweden. We also expect -- and this is very important to introduce the Kruuse branded products to additional markets and particularly through the Henry Schein businesses in the next year. So this business is, of course, strategic from a geographic point of view -- geographic presence point of view, but also important because of the unique Kruuse brand of products. 
We were -- are very, very excited to -- about the agreement that we announced a couple of days ago to acquire 80.1% interest in another company named Vetstreet. Vetstreet is a leading provider of marketing solutions and health information analytics to veterinary clinics and animal health manufacturers. Vetstreet offers veterinary clinics a suite of products and services that address key issues, including communicating with pet owners once they leave the clinic and the lack of compliance with wellness visits and prescription regimens. When this transaction closes early next year, Vetstreet will be a meaningful complement to our U.S. Animal Health businesses and in particular, our Practice Management Software installed base, which is in about half the veterinarians of this country. It will expand our practice marketing and client communication solutions, provide tools for better enhancement of our supplier relations and connect us to veterinary clinics that are not current customers of Henry Schein Animal Health. The transaction, which is expected to close in early 2016, is anticipated to be neutral to 2016 diluted earnings per share and add $0.01 to $0.02 of accretion in 2017 and beyond. 
On the Medical side, we had also a very exciting quarter. Internal sales growth for our Medical Group in North America was 14.1%, an 8-year high, as we made further progress with large group practices and IDNs, integrated delivery networks. This growth -- this internal growth was bolstered by sales from our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health, and we are delighted with the continued successful transition of customers to the Henry Schein platform. The combination of internal growth plus the contribution from the Cardinal Health agreement results in 26% growth in North America for the quarter versus the prior year. The integration of the strategic agreement into Henry Schein is substantially complete with many components to be integrated during the current fourth quarter. We remain optimistic about our ability to win new customers through our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health by being uniquely positioned to directly serve the entire continuum of health care. 
Let me conclude with a short overview of our Technology and Value-Added segment. Internal sales growth in North America was 4.5% in local currencies, and international internal growth was 8.4% in local currencies with particular strength during the quarter in the electronic services and value-added services arena. 
Henry Schein is committed to the efficient delivery in health services while supporting business successes of our customers. The advanced technology products and services we offer provide a platform for our sales opportunities across all of our businesses. 
So before we open the call to questions, I'd like to highlight some recent recognitions and initiatives. As you may know, Henry Schein is committed to expanding access to care for the underserved throughout the world and to increasing diversity and cultural competency within the health care profession, each of the professions we serve for that matter. In August, we announced the creation of the Henry Schein Cares Medal, which will honor organizations whose work has been especially effective in bringing care to those in need. At a gala event next year, we will be awarding medals to organizations from the fields of oral health, animal health and medical health. 
And also in August, Henry Schein was awarded the Corporate Award by the Hispanic Dental Association. We received this in recognition for our decades of supporting initiatives to increase diversity and cultural competency in the dental profession for the U.S. and global Hispanic communities as well as for our commitment to promoting access to care and of course, health care equity worldwide. 
The Henry Schein global care corporate responsibility program was active during the third quarter. We launched our 2015 Healthy Lifestyles, Healthy Communities program, which, this year, expects to serve approximately 8,700 children and the caregivers throughout the United States with free medical and dental services at 14 health care events. 
We, again, partnered with the Integrated Medical Foundation and a large urology group practice association to help raise awareness nationwide about the importance of prostate cancer screenings. And we helped more than 5,000 children return to the classroom ready to succeed through our 18th annual Back to School program. 
We also launched our new initiative within organizations called Canine Companions for Independence, under which our Puppy Raiser Care Package are being delivered to veterinarians for their customers who volunteered to raise assistance dogs for people with physical disabilities. 
On the academic side, we recently announced a partnership with the American College of Prosthodontists Education Foundation along with other dental partners to develop a new CAD/CAM technology curriculum for predoctoral and postdoctoral programs. This curriculum is expected to be piloted by several dental schools beginning in 2017. We believe that CAD/CAM technology enhances dentistry and want to make sure that dental students are appropriately trained so they can prove practice efficiency and ensure better patient outcomes. We are excited to be part of ensuring that the coming generation of dental professionals has the training required to derive the benefits that digital technology has to offer their patients. 
So you will see, Henry Schein has been successful in advancing our strategies by advancing the needs of our suppliers, our customers, our team, our investors and society in general. And it's the interplay between these 5 constituents that, at the end of the day, has provided Henry Schein with the opportunity to provide consistent earnings as we enter our 21st year as a public company. Yesterday was the 20th anniversary of Henry Schein IPO, and I think it is fair to say that our shareholders should be pleased with the consistent delivery of results, both in terms of earnings per share and in terms of taking earnings per share and turning them into cash. This was the direct result of the balancing of these 5 constituents. 
So with that overview of our quarterly financial operating performance, Steven and I are pleased to take questions you may have."

And I think you've probably noticed that from the last 5 or 6 years, our Medical business has gained momentum. This has been the result of a strategic planning exercise we concluded about 7 years ago, in which we determined that there were 2 areas we wanted to focus on. One is the larger practices of the networks and what has morphed into what many referred to as the IDNs, integrated delivery networks, and at the same time, focusing on certain specialty areas that I reported [indiscernible], all potentially geared towards wellness and prevention, which falls in line with the health care reform plans, in other words, wellness, health care versus sick care, moving procedures from the hospital to the office to the alternate care side. Our strategies are solid. We believe they are solid for many years to come, and we believe our Medical Group has been executing very well. Of course, the Cardinal -- the acquisition of Cardinal positions the business and the integration of those sales representatives, including adding the Cardinal product offering to our Henry Schein offering, have all contributed in one way or another to driving: first, the internal growth; and in addition, of course, the acquisition growth that came along with that acquisition."

And virtually, I think it's all related to the Cardinal acquisition of the physician business. So we're able to track customer by customer and have a good split on that."

It's hard to tell if there's future switches between agencies and direct sales. We really can't predict that. But -- so it's not something I could say is going to end or not and -- because there seems to be every year a flip-flop from one manufacturer -- from one to the other. But we'll continue to call it out because I do think the best way of looking at our real growth is adjusting the impact of agency sales conversions for our sales."

We are actually quite pleased with the progress we are making on our diagnostic portfolio offering and in fact, training of our sales force to introduce these products. As you may recall, the switch from one manufacturer to this group of manufacturers came quite sudden. We were focused on a lot of other things at the time and reliance on that manufacturer. So about a year ago, we had to put our plans into place. Our plans contemplated adding software that will -- middleware that would connect various manufacturers' systems to our software, our Practice Management Software. And about half of the physicians in this country use our Practice Management Software, and a fair number overseas use our Practice Management Software. So we developed this middleware, Axis-Q, which is pretty good. It's up and running. It's out of beta, and we're selling. Of course, our sales force needs to be trained and understand how the interface between the Axis-Q business. And there was a wide variety of boxes and systems out there. There's no shortage of good technology out there, how we can connect that in the most effective way to our customers' practice management system, also tying in reference labs to our practice management system. And all of this, together with our acquisition of scil, which is a leading provider of laboratory diagnostic equipment software, is working actually quite well. And we're pleased, given the short amount of time that we've had to focus on this, with the results. Now if you add the acquisition of Vetstreet to that, you will see that we are in a pretty good position to provide very good information to our customers to help them go out into their customer base to ensure that they are attracting traffic into the practitioner's office and provide solid data to those manufacturers that wish to work with us on the pet food side and on the pharma side. So we are very pleased with where we are, considering what happened about a year ago. And I'm quite sure, as has been the case several times in Henry Schein's history, where a similar situation has emerged, that Henry Schein will thrive, and we will, in fact, be a significant provider of diagnostic equipment to veterinarians throughout the world."

I don't want to get into that level of specificity with specific margins per quarter, but let me try to help you in a different way. So there were a number of items, and I'll go through a couple of them, that were timing impacts that were favorable timing in Q3 that reversed, obviously, in Q4. They include things like flu vaccines year-over-year. Flu vaccine sales were much stronger, up 12%, Q3 this year versus last year. And as you know, flu vaccine is a good margin product for us. There's also timing of a number of expenses that were expected to hit and typically hit in Q3 that are now expected to hit in Q4. And if you add all those together, you may have $0.03, $0.04 or $0.05 of timing variances between Q3 and Q4. So while that reduces a little bit the growth in Q3, obviously, it has the opposite impact in Q4. And when you do that, I think you'll be able to understand really more the flow of our second half of the year. So hopefully, that's helpful."

Consumables are steady. The U.K. is a good market. I think we're doing okay there. Practice, a bit weak. But we are doing okay because we're really the only national full-service dealer distributor in the U.K. And then if you look at Italy and Spain, we're doing okay, but the comparables are pretty low. And then the only other big market is Australia, where there are -- we're doing okay. We're getting some market share. But the Australian economy is not doing as well as it was maybe because of the commodities, but I think it seems to be a bit of a lackluster economy. At this moment, it can turn around quickly. The rest of the markets, in aggregate, are not that material. So I want to remain quite positive about International Dental, also, if I might add.

There are a couple of factors. First of all, there is, definitely, a movement from the acute care setting to the alternate care setting, both in terms of physician practices, and I'm talking about GPs, although in some areas the specialists, too, and the ambulatory care centers. So that's a fact. Specific data, hard to get, but I think it's fair to say. I think as the Affordable Care Act kicks in, there'll be more people covered with the ability to go to a GP for a checkup or when they're feeling they have a flu or something rather than wait until they're really sick to go to the emergency center at a hospital with people who do not have insurance would have been treated. I'm not dealing with the very low end, which is Medicaid, nor with the Medicare or those that are covered by insurance. But there's still, I don't know, 50 million, 60 million, 70 million people that are in one way or another now will have some form of insurance. Not fully kicked in, but GPs, in general, are seeing more patients. They're not getting reimbursed, by the way, at the same rate per patient that they were before, but they need a glove, and they need a mask, and they need cleansing solutions. I would also add that there are not that many national distributors that can provide a complete solution to the alternate care setting. I'm happy to think we do it better than anyone else, but I'm sure others will say they do it well. So we are gaining name recognition with the GPOs. And the GPOs realize that if the contract is put through Schein, they're not going to look too bad because we're going to execute well. And I think we execute extremely well to these large accounts, multiple locations under common management. So it's a little bit of trend, and it's a lot of execution. And I think we have good momentum in this marketplace, a lot of brand recognition that, perhaps, we didn't have 6 or 7 years ago amongst these large providers because 6 or 7 years ago, we were not into the doctors general -- personally manage their practice rather than to the large group practice or the hospital or the IDN that is now our customer."

It really is not an economic hedge. It really -- if you want to hedge for a long-term period, it is expensive and you're just delaying the impact until when the hedge runs out. We do hedge our transaction exposure. So in countries where we're buying in currency A and selling in currency B, we're continuing to hedge. We actually increased the amount of hedges we do on transactions. We were typically hedging 70% plus of known activity. We're probably closer to 90% today.

And it may sound odd, right, because you may say, ""How do you have an extra week and not have more profitability?"" But if you think it through, it's the last week of the year, which is the holiday week. So when you look at sales on consumables, sales tend to be very light that week because a lot of offices are closed, and there's not a lot of ordering going on in that week. Equipment is a little different story. But at least on consumables, it's a very light week. And a lot of expenses. And if you think of payroll and payroll-related that represents at least 2/3 of our expense structure, you have a full week's worth of payroll and a partial week's worth of sales. So everyone thinks the extra week is very profitable for us. It really is marginally plus or minus depending on the business unit."

On Q3, on the Dental side, I think I would concur that the quarter -- but don't read too much into this. The quarter was stronger about the beginning of the quarter than the end of the quarter. But many, many times, you see those variations, and they really are just the ebbs and flow of purchasing patterns, of practices and other timing things, and they're not indicative of, really, any trend. But I do agree that it started strong in Q3 than the final month of the quarter."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are so pleased with our third quarter financial results, which reflected accelerated growth in adjusted diluted EPS as well as in worldwide sales despite the continued negative impact of the strength of the United States dollar. 
As was also the case during the first quarter -- the first half actually of the year, the strength of the U.S. dollar impacted all of our international operations during the third quarter and particularly, those in Europe. For the quarter, changes in currency exchange reduced our total sales growth by nearly 6% and reduced EPS by $0.06, both compared with the previous year, with last year. Yet, overall, the global markets we serve continue to be stable. Through our long-standing strategy of organic growth complemented by strategic acquisitions, we believe we've continued to gain market share on an overall basis during the quarter, both in North America and internationally. 
Today, we are pleased to introduce guidance with a 2016 adjusted diluted EPS that represents growth of 10% to 12% compared with a midpoint of our new adjusted 2015 guidance range.

I am also pleased to report solid results for the third quarter of 2015. As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 third quarter results include restructuring costs of $8.4 million pretax or $0.08 per dilu",1864,"Okay. Thank you, Stan, and good morning. I am also pleased to report solid results for the third quarter of 2015. 
As we begin, I'd like to point out that our 2015 third quarter results include restructuring costs of $8.4 million pretax or $0.08 per diluted share. Our most recent estimate of restructuring cost to be recorded in 2015 has been reduced to $30 million to $35 million pretax or approximately $0.26 to $0.30 per diluted share. This is a reduction from our original estimate of $35 million to $40 million pretax, and this reduced estimate is the result of certain restructuring actions being deferred to 2016. As such, we expect to continue to record restructuring costs through the first half of 2016. 
Our Q3 results also include a onetime income tax benefit net of a noncontrolling interest of $3.8 million or $0.05 per diluted share, and that's related to a favorable tax ruling that we received during the third quarter. 
I will be discussing our results as reported and also on a non-GAAP basis, which will exclude both the restructuring costs and the impact of the tax benefit since we believe that the latter is more useful for comparative purposes. You can refer to Exhibit B of this morning's earnings news release, and that reconciles our GAAP and non-GAAP income and EPS from continuing operations. 
Turning to our Q3 results. Our net sales for the quarter ended September 26, 2015, were $2.7 billion, reflecting a 2.4% increase compared with the third quarter of 2014. This consisted of an 8.3% growth in local currencies and a decline of 5.9% related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, or constant currencies, our internal generated sales growth was 4.8%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 3.5%. You can see the details of sales growth in Exhibit A of today's earnings news release. 
Our operating margin for the quarter was 7.0% and expanded by 40 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year. However, on a non-GAAP basis, which would exclude the restructuring costs, our adjusted operating margin for the third quarter of 2015 improved by 71 basis points and was 7.4%. This expansion, which was very strong for the quarter, was a result of both high gross margin as well as a reduction of operating expenses as a percentage of sales. 
If you look to our effective tax rate for the quarter, it was 29.6% on a non-GAAP basis. Again, we're excluding the onetime tax benefit and the restructuring costs to show the non-GAAP effective tax rate, and that compares to 30.0% last year. Again, the lower tax rate is due to ongoing tax planning strategies as well as higher earnings in countries with lower corporate tax rate. We continue to expect that our non-GAAP effective tax rate will be in this 30% range for the remainder of the year as well as going forward into next year. 
Our net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. for the third quarter of 2015 was $127.7 million or $1.52 per diluted share. This represented growth of 11.3% and 13.4%, respectively, compared to the prior year. However, again, on a non-GAAP basis, net income attributable to Henry Schein was higher, or $130.6 million or $1.55 per diluted share, and that growth is 13.7% and 15.7%, respectively, again, compared to the prior year. 
I think it's important to reiterate that the foreign currency exchange impact was not only negative $0.06 for the quarter on our EPS. But it's approximately $0.20 for the first 9 months of the year, and that's just converting foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at today's average rate versus last year's average rate. So it has been a big headwind for us in the current year. 
Let me now turn to our sales results and review some details there. Our Dental sales for the third quarter of 2015 declined by 2.5% to $1.3 billion. But again, this is related to foreign currency. The 2.5% decline consisted of 4.6% growth in constant currency and 7.1% decline related to foreign currency. 
In local currencies, our internally generated sales was 4.1%, and acquisition growth contributed another 0.5%. Of that 4.1% internal growth in constant currencies, it consisted of 2 components: 4.4% growth in North America and 3.6% growth internationally. 
Let's look at some additional detail on each of those figures. First, the North American internal growth of 4.4% consists of 3.8% growth in Dental consumable merchandise sales and 6.4% growth in Dental equipment sales and service revenue. 
Looking at the International business. The 3.6% constant-currency growth -- internal growth included 2.9% growth in Dental consumable merchandise and 5.3% growth in Dental equipment sales revenue. So across-the-board on Global Dental, we showed solid sales growth, both in consumables and equipment domestically and internationally. 
Turning to Animal Health sales. They were $732.5 million in the third quarter, down 3.4%. But the components there, there's 4.5% local currency growth and a decline related to foreign currency exchange of 7.9%. Internal sales growth in constant currencies grew 0.5%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 4.0% to growth. That 0.5% internal growth in constant currencies included a 1.9% decline in North America and 2.7% growth internationally. 
Again, as we've done for the first 2 quarters, we are normalizing our sales growth in international, and that 1.9% decline in internal sales in local currencies from North America actually reflects a 4.2% growth when you normalize both for the impact of product switching between agency and direct sales as well as excluding sales of diagnostic products, both in the current period and in the prior period due to changes of veterinary diagnostic manufacturing relationships. Again, we believe that this normalized growth rate is more meaningful and a better reflection of the ongoing performance of our North American Animal Health business, and we'll continue to show this normalized basis through the end of the year. 
Our Medical sales were $597.2 million for the third quarter, and that's an increase of 24.3%. It consists of 25.0% growth in local currencies and a small decline of 0.7% related to foreign currency exchange. Overall, internal sales growth in local currencies was 13.6%, and acquisitions contributed an additional 11.4%. 
As I think most people know, the bulk of our Medical business is in North America, and that 13% -- 13.6% internal growth was led by North America, which was 14.1%. And that, again, was driven by large group practices and IDNs as well as a 1.3% growth internationally. This 14.1% growth in the North American Medical business was the highest level it's been in approximately 8 years. 
If we look at a component of our Medical sales, sales of seasonal influenza vaccines were $68.9 million for the third quarter of 2015, and that's up -- there's a little bit favorable timing. It's up 12% over last year. We sold about 6.6 million doses of flu vaccine during the third quarter. And through yesterday, we sold a total of nearly 7.7 million doses. So we expect to sell for the whole year somewhere between 9 million and 10 million doses, and we're well on our way to achieving that. If you exclude the impact of flu vaccine sales in both periods, the overall Medical sales growth increased 26.2% and 27% in constant currency. 
Turning to Technology and Value-Added Service sales. They were $89.7 million in the quarter, which is a 3.0% increase. This included 5.8% growth in constant currency and a 2.8% decline related to foreign currency exchange. 
In local currencies, the internally generated sales increased by 5.2%, and acquisition growth contributed an additional 0.6%. That global 5.2% internal growth in constant currencies includes 4.5% growth in North America and 8.4% growth internationally. 
If we turn to stock repurchase, we continued to repurchase our common stock in the open market during the third quarter. Specifically, we purchased approximately 261,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $144.11, which is just under $38 million of cash. This impact -- the impact of this during the quarter was not material to our EPS. At the close of the quarter, we still have about $149 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock, and we remain committed to our goal of buying between $200 million and $300 million of stock for the full year. 
If we take a brief look at both our -- some highlights from our balance sheet and cash flow, we had operating cash flow for the quarter of $107.4 million. That compares to $174 million last year. If you look at the details, there was -- the decrease was primarily driven by working capital and increases in accounts receivable and inventory, although we continue to believe we'll have strong operating cash flow for the year. 
The days sales outstanding was favorable, 40.6 days in the current quarter versus 41.2 days last year. And inventory turns were slightly down to 5.7 turns versus 6 turns last year. 
Finally, I'll just conclude with going through guidance for 2015 and '16. I think it's important to remember that over the last 2 quarters, we noted on our past 2 conference calls that we expected to be at the low end of EPS guidance for the current year, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange. And as I said, for the first 9 months of 2015, foreign currency exchange translation had a negative impact, again, of approximately $0.20 on our EPS for the first 9 months. So because of that, we are now adjusting our EPS for the year to be in the range of $5.90 to $5.96, and that represents growth of 8% to 10% compared to the actual 2014 results. The 2015 guidance excludes restructuring costs, which are expected to be between $0.26 and $0.30 per diluted share for the year, as well as the onetime $0.05 tax benefit that occurred in the third quarter. 
Also, again, we now expect that these restructuring activities that were expected at the beginning of 2015 to be completed at the year will now -- a portion of them will roll over into 2016, and we now expect restructuring costs in 2016 to be $0.03 to $0.07 per diluted share and should continue through the first half of 2016. As always, our 2015 EPS guidance is for continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include any impact for potential future acquisitions should they occur. 
Turning to 2016 financial guidance. We're pleased to report that we expect adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be in the range of $6.55 to $6.65, and that represents growth of 10% to 12% compared to the midpoint of our 2015 adjusted guidance range. Again, the guidance for 2016 is for continuing operations as well as any completed or previously announced acquisitions, but does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions and also does not include the impact of the restructuring costs of, again, approximately $0.03 to $0.07. We also -- our guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates remain relatively consistent with current levels. 
So with that, I'd like to now turn the call back over to Stan."

Let me begin my review by -- of our 4 business groups with Dental Group. In North America, we believe that consumable merchandise internal sales growth was -- in local currencies was in the 3.8% range and indicates continued solid patie",1472,"Thank you, Steven. Let me begin my review by -- of our 4 business groups with Dental Group. In North America, we believe that consumable merchandise internal sales growth was -- in local currencies was in the 3.8% range and indicates continued solid patient flow to dental offices. Equipment sales and service internal growth in local currencies was a solid 6.4% and was the highest in more than a year. 
I noted during our last quarter call that we expect the North America Dental sales service growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, and these numbers bear that out. We saw particular strength during the quarter in sales of what we internally call traditional equipment. 
With International Dental, consumable merchandise internal sales in local currencies grew at 2.9% during the third quarter. International equipment sales and service internal growth in local currencies was a solid 5.3%, and this follows double-digit gains in the preceding quarter, which was bolstered by the IDS, the International Dental Show in Cologne. 
Before we move on to our Animal Health financial performance, I would like to highlight an expansion of our Dental operations in Italy. We just announced an agreement to make an investment in Dental Trey, a distributor of dental consumable merchandise and equipment with sales for 12 months ended June 30, 2015, of approximately EUR 41 million. Dental Trey offers more than 33,000 branded products and a line of private-label products to dental practices in the region through a team of sales agents and e-commerce web -- and an e-commerce web portal. 
Dental Trey also sells a proprietary dental practice management software system with an installed base of more than 1,200 dental offices. Dental Trey will complement our existing business in Italy with a solid product offering and long-standing customer relations. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of 2015. The acquisition is anticipated to be neutral to our 2016 diluted earnings per share and slightly accretive by less than $0.01 in 2017 and beyond. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on our Animal Health group. North America internal growth in local currencies was 4.2% on a normalized basis. Growth in our Animal Health group continues to reflect the benefits of strategic acquisitions. During the quarter, we closed on our purchase of a majority interest in Jorgen Kruuse A/S. Kruuse has sales -- had sales in 2014 of approximately $90 million, and this expanded our direct presence to Denmark, Norway and Sweden. We also expect -- and this is very important to introduce the Kruuse branded products to additional markets and particularly through the Henry Schein businesses in the next year. So this business is, of course, strategic from a geographic point of view -- geographic presence point of view, but also important because of the unique Kruuse brand of products. 
We were -- are very, very excited to -- about the agreement that we announced a couple of days ago to acquire an 80.1% interest in another company named Vetstreet. Vetstreet is a leading provider of marketing solutions and health information analytics to veterinary clinics and animal health manufacturers. Vetstreet offers veterinary clinics a suite of products and services that address key issues, including communicating with pet owners once they leave the clinic and the lack of compliance with wellness visits and prescription regimens. When this transaction closes early next year, Vetstreet will be a meaningful complement to our U.S. Animal Health businesses and in particular, our Practice Management Software installed base, which is in about half the veterinaries [ph] of this country. It will expand our practice marketing and client communication solutions, provide tools for better enhancement of our supplier relations and connect us to veterinary clinics that are not current customers of Henry Schein Animal Health. The transaction, which is expected to close in early 2016, is anticipated to be neutral to 2016 diluted earnings per share and add $0.01 to $0.02 of accretion in 2017 and beyond. 
On the Medical side, we had also a very exciting quarter. Internal sales growth for our Medical Group in North America was 14.1%, an 8-year high, as we made further progress with large group practices and IDNs, integrated delivery networks. This growth -- this internal growth was bolstered by sales from our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health, and we are delighted with the continued successful transition of customers to the Henry Schein platform. The combination of internal growth plus the contribution from the Cardinal Health agreement resulted in 26% growth in North America for the quarter versus the prior year. The integration of the strategic agreement into Henry Schein is substantially complete with many components to be integrated during the current fourth quarter. We remain optimistic about our ability to win new customers through our strategic agreement with Cardinal Health by being uniquely positioned to directly serve the entire continuum of health care. 
Let me conclude with a short overview of our Technology and Value-Added segments. Internal sales growth in North America was 4.5% in local currencies, and international internal growth was 8.4% in local currencies with particular strength during the quarter in the electronic services and value-added services arena. 
Henry Schein is committed to the efficient delivery in health care services while supporting the business successes of our customers. The advanced technology products and services we offer provide a platform for our sales opportunities across all of our businesses. 
So before we open the call to questions, I'd like to highlight some recent recognitions and initiatives. As you may know, Henry Schein is committed to expanding access to care for the underserved throughout the world and to increasing diversity and cultural competency within the health care profession, each of the professions we serve for that matter. In August, we announced the creation of the Henry Schein Cares Medal, which will honor organizations whose work has been especially effective in bringing care to those in need. At a gala event next year, we will be awarding medals to organizations from the fields of oral health, animal health and medical health. 
And also in August, Henry Schein was awarded the Corporate Award by the Hispanic Dental Association. We received this in recognition for our decades of supporting initiatives to increase diversity and cultural competency in the dental profession for the U.S. and global Hispanic communities as well as for our commitment to promoting access to care and of course, health care equity worldwide. 
The Henry Schein global Cares corporate responsibility program was active during the third quarter. We launched our 2015 Healthy Lifestyles, Healthy Communities program, which, this year, expects to serve approximately 8,700 children and their caregivers throughout the United States with free medical and dental services at 14 health fair events. 
We, again, partnered with the Integrated Medical Foundation, as a large urology group practice association, to help raise awareness nationwide about the importance of prostate cancer screenings. And we helped more than 5,000 children return to the classroom ready to succeed through our 18th annual Back to School program. 
We also launched our new initiative within organizations called Canine Companions for Independence, under which our Puppy Raiser Care Package are being delivered to veterinarians for their customers who volunteer to raise assistance dogs for people with physical disabilities. 
On the academic side, we recently announced a partnership with the American College of Prosthodontists Education Foundation along with other dental partners to develop a new CAD/CAM technology curriculum for predoctoral and postdoctoral programs. This curriculum is expected to be piloted by several dental schools beginning in 2017. We believe that CAD/CAM technology enhances dentistry and want to make sure that dental students are appropriately trained so they can improve practice efficiency and ensure better patient outcomes. We are excited to be part of ensuring that the coming generation of dental professionals has the training required to derive the benefits that digital technology has to offer their patients. 
So you will see, Henry Schein has been successful in advancing our strategies by advancing the needs of our suppliers, our customers, our team, our investors and society in general. And it's the interplay between these 5 constituents that, at the end of the day, has provided Henry Schein with the opportunity to provide consistent earnings as we enter our 21st year as a public company. Yesterday was the 20th anniversary of Henry Schein's IPO, and I think it is fair to say that our shareholders should be pleased with the consistent delivery of results, both in terms of earnings per share and in terms of taking those earnings per share and turning them into cash. This was the direct result of the balancing of these 5 constituents. 
So with that overview of our quarterly financial operating performance, Steven and I are pleased to take questions you may have."

And I think you've probably noticed that from the last 5 or 6 years, our Medical business has gained momentum. This has been the result of a strategic planning exercise we concluded about 7 years ago, in which we determined that there were 2 areas we wanted to focus on. One is the larger practices and the networks and what has morphed into what many refer to as the IDNs, integrated delivery networks, and at the same time, focusing on certain specialty areas that I reported [indiscernible], all potentially geared towards wellness and prevention, which falls in line with the health care reform plans, in other words, wellness, health care versus sick care, moving procedures from the hospital to the office to the alternate care side. Our strategies are solid. We believe they are solid for many years to come, and we believe our Medical Group has been executing very well. Of course, the Cardinal -- the acquisition of Cardinal physician business and the integration of those sales representatives, including adding the Cardinal product offering to our Henry Schein offering, have all contributed in one way or another to driving: first, the internal growth; and in addition, of course, the acquisition growth that came along with that acquisition."

It's hard to tell if there's future switches between agencies and direct sales. We really can't predict that.

We are actually quite pleased with the progress we are making on our diagnostic portfolio offering and, in fact, training of our sales force to introduce these products. As you may recall, the switch from one manufacturer to this group of manufacturers came quite sudden. We were focused on a lot of other things at the time and reliance on that manufacturer. So about a year ago, we had to put our plans into place. Our plans contemplated adding software that will -- middleware that would connect various manufacturers' systems to our software, our Practice Management Software. And about half of the physicians in this country use our Practice Management Software, and a fair number overseas use our Practice Management Software. So we developed this middleware, Axis-Q, which is pretty good. It's up and running. It's out of beta, and we're selling. Of course, our sales force needs to be trained and understand how the interface between the actual business [ph] and there was a wide variety of boxes and systems out there. There's no shortage of good technology out there, how we can connect that in the most effective way to our customers' practice management system, also tying in reference labs to our practice management system. And all of this, together with our acquisition of scil, which is a leading provider of laboratory diagnostic equipment software, is working actually quite well. And we're pleased, given the short amount of time that we've had to focus on this, with the results. Now if you add the acquisition of Vetstreet to that, you will see that we are in a pretty good position to provide very good information to our customers, to help them go out into their customer base, to ensure that they are attracting traffic into the practitioner's office and provide solid data to those manufacturers that wish to work with us on the pet food side and on the pharma side. So we are very pleased with where we are, considering what happened about a year ago. And I'm quite sure, as has been the case several times in Henry Schein's history, where a similar situation has emerged, that Henry Schein will thrive, and we will, in fact, be a significant provider of diagnostic equipment to veterinarians throughout the world."

So there were a number of items, and I'll go through a couple of them, that were timing impacts that were favorable timing in Q3 that reversed, obviously, in Q4. They include things like flu vaccines year-over-year. Flu vaccine sales were much stronger, up 12%, Q3 this year versus last year. And as you know, flu vaccine is a good margin product for us. There's also timing of a number of expenses that were expected to hit and typically hit in Q3 that are now expected to hit in Q4. And if you add all those together, you may have $0.03, $0.04 or $0.05 of timing variances between Q3 and Q4. So while that reduces a little bit the growth in Q3, obviously, it has the opposite impact in Q4. And when you do that, I think you'll be able to understand really more the flow of our second half of the year. So hopefully, that's helpful."

But we are doing okay because we're really the only national full-service dealer distributor in the U.K. And then if you look at Italy and Spain, we're doing okay, but the comparables are pretty low. And then the only other big market is Australia, where there are -- we're doing okay. We're gaining some market share. But the Australian economy is not doing as well as it was maybe because of the commodities, but I think it seems to be a bit of a lackluster economy. At this moment, it can turn around quickly.

There are a couple of factors. First of all, there is, definitely, a movement from the acute care setting to the alternate care setting, both in terms of physician practices, and I'm talking about GPs, although in some areas the specialists, too, and the ambulatory care centers. So that's a fact. Specific data, hard to get, but I think it's fair to say. I think as the Affordable Care Act kicks in, there'll be more people covered with the ability to go to a GP for a checkup or when they're feeling they have a flu or something rather than wait until they're really sick to go to the emergency center at a hospital with people who do not have insurance would have been treated. I'm not dealing with the very low end, which is Medicaid, nor with the Medicare or those that are covered by insurance. But there's still, I don't know, 50 million, 60 million, 70 million people that are -- in one way or another, now will have some form of insurance. Not fully kicked in, but GPs, in general, are seeing more patients. They're not getting reimbursed, by the way, at the same rate per patient that they were before, but they need a glove, and they need a mask, and they need cleansing solutions. I would also add that there are not that many national distributors that can provide a complete solution to the alternate care setting. I happen to think we do it better than anyone else, but I'm sure others will say they do it well. So we are gaining name recognition with the GPOs. And the GPOs realize that if the contract is put through Schein, they're not going to look too bad because we're going to execute well. And I think we execute extremely well to these large accounts, multiple locations under common management. So it's a little bit of trend, and it's a lot of execution. And I think we have good momentum in this marketplace, a lot of brand recognition that, perhaps, we didn't have 6 or 7 years ago amongst these large providers because 6 or 7 years ago, we were known to the doctors general -- the person who managed their practice, rather than to the large group practice or the hospital or the IDN that is now our customer."

We do hedge though transaction exposure. So in countries where we're buying in currency A and selling in currency B, we're continuing to hedge. We actually increased the amount of hedges we do on transactions. We were typically hedging 70% plus of known activity. We're probably closer to 90% today.

But if you think it through, it's the last week of the year, which is the holiday week. So when you look at sales on consumables, sales tend to be very light that week because a lot of offices are closed, and there's not a lot of ordering going on in that week. Equipment is a little different story. But at least on consumables, it's a very light week. And a lot of expenses. And if you think of payroll and payroll-related that represents at least 2/3 of our expense structure, you have a full week's worth of payroll and a partial week's worth of sales.

If you think about your U.S. Dental consumable growth rate of 3.8%, just hoping you can elaborate a little bit on any trends you might be seeing underneath that, for example, growth in the sort of specialty procedures like implants versus the more GP-oriented procedures. And related to that, are you starting to see any increasing shift of some of the more specialty procedures into the general dentist office or not really?"

Having said that, I do believe that more procedures are moving into the GP office. And that's why, by the way, we entered the endodontics space, the orthodontics space and implant oral surgery space in such a heavy way several years ago because our GP customers are performing these procedures. So I think that is correct. I don't think any particular results that we may have may be indicative of the change. If we're growing faster in the specialty area, it's probably -- the reason is probably because we're underpenetrated. So I would say, in our numbers, there's nothing that could indicate one way or the other, although, obviously, there's a movement from the small accounts to the midsize accounts and from the midsize accounts to the elite, the large ones, although we are experiencing, I think, the heaviest growth in the mid-market accounts. Those are practitioners that own a multiple of practices, 3, 4 practices."

On the technology side, that side has been a little weaker this year.

We are seeing on CAD/CAM a bigger increase in people electing at this time to just buy the scan-only product and not the full system. As I'm sure you know, we sell a few different brands on scan-only. And sometimes, that makes sense. I think that's, ultimately, the practice -- I think, will go for the full end-to-end solution, but sometimes, they just want to get started. And so we're seeing a lot more people doing scan-only than we've seen historically. We did have a difficult comp with upgrades and very strong sales last year in the CAD/CAM segment. But I still think if you look out a few quarters, this is going to be a very strong category. There's still very good technology. There's still very low penetration in the market. It's something that dentists just really will adopt over a period of time. And again, we all know dentists are a little slower adopters of technology than other practitioners may be, but I think we should stay very bullish on this category."

On Q3, on the Dental side, I think I would concur that the quarter -- but don't read too much into this. The quarter was stronger at the beginning of the quarter than the end of the quarter. But many, many times, you see those variations, and they really are just the ebbs and flow of purchasing patterns, of practices and other timing things, and they're not indicative of, really, any trend.
