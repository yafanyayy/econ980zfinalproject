I hope you have a chance to review our earnings press release we issued early this morning that highlights our results for the first quarter of 2015. 
This morning, I'll discuss our key performance highlights and accomplishments for the quarter, then Michael Geltzeiler will provide additional details on our financial and operational performance. 
As you can see from our results, we've continued the trends we saw in the second half of 2014, and we're off to a strong start to the new year, delivering another quarter of improved performance. 
Solid execution of our initiatives is driving stronger financial and operational results and the investments we continue to make in our business are positioning us for future profitable revenue growth. 
All of our key customer metrics continued to move in the right direction during the quarter as we take advantage of our industry-leading position and strong brand recognition. 
We remain excited about what we see in the business today and the evolution occurring in our industry that is creating even more opportunities for future growth. I'm proud of our team's performance this quarter, while recognizing the opportunity for an even brighter future. 
As we review our highlights for the quarter, I think it's important to look at our performance in the context of our strategy and against the backdrop of our rapidly evolving industry. We've made significant progress since becoming a standalone company a little over 2 years ago. This progress has accelerated over the past several quarters as we begun to benefit from the initiatives that we have pursued to enhance our operations and competitive position, resulting in improvements in our performance. 
This quarter, we continue to invest in growth and strengthening our leadership team, all in support of our strategy to achieve our vision for ADT. A vision that is rooted in extending our leadership position in the security, life safety and home automation markets, enhancing the values of ADT's services and executing on our initiatives to drive strong returns. 
A common thread running throughout every aspect of our vision is creating a superior customer experience. The results from the actions we've taken are continuing to shine through in our results, giving us confidence that we're on the right path. 
As I've discussed on previous calls, I view the recent activity in our industry in 2 distinct areas: Integrated professionally monitored security life safety and automation solutions, where ADT is traditionally focused currently serving about 20% of households; and unmonitored or self monitored standalone home automation solutions where many new entrants, large and small, are focusing their efforts on the remaining 80% of households. 
The majority of these efforts are targeting a wide range of home automation applications with only a small portion addressing security and life safety. 
While our traditional market is more competitive than it was 5 years ago, the environment has been relatively stable and we're continuing to win in this market, as evidenced by our improving operational and customer metrics and solid financial results. 
Slide 3 shows our strong performance over the past 12 months on 4 key metrics that are affected by the competitive environment. 
Over the past years, we have driven increases in gross adds in all lines of business and in our direct and dealer channels. Improved customer retention by 120 basis points increased the average price paid by newly added customers and reduced our creation multiple, or in other words, the cost we incurred to bring on a new customer.  I think this chart is the best evidence that we are winning in the market and our performance is accelerating. 
Specifically, for the first quarter, as highlighted on Slide 4, we drove double-digit gross subscriber growth with year-over-year increases on both our direct and authorized dealer channels for the first time since 2013, driven by stronger lead generation, increases in our self generated business and improved closed rates. 
Unit and revenue attrition continue to improve meaningfully versus prior year and sequentially as we reduced attrition to its lowest level since we became a public company. 
As a result of these improvements in gross adds and customer retention, we narrowed our net subscriber loss significantly and are focused on returning to growing net subscribers. 
From a financial perspective, our improved operational performance allowed us to deliver strong recurring revenue growth, increased EBITDA margins and bottom line results on a year-over-year basis. 
Because of the strong returns we drive in our business today and the many opportunities we see that generate profitable growth in the years ahead, we continue to invest in ADT's future as shown on Slide 5. 
We're investing to enhance the customer experience by implementing new technologies and processes, including the rollout of a new electronic order management platform and the deployment of our new wireless Total Security Panel.  We're expanding our presence in the midsize commercial market and making investments in products and distribution to generate future growth through our health service offerings. 
We also added a new key leader to run our combined business in Canada and appointed a new Board member from the technology sector, Chris Hylen of Citrix Systems. 
We're also continuing to invest in driving profitable growth through Pulse. Pulse continues to be an important driver behind our results, and in Q1, Pulse take rates increased as did Pulse upgrades. 
As you can see on Slide 6, over 53% of our total gross adds during the quarter were Pulse units, up from 51% last quarter and 37% a year ago. 
In our residential direct channel, the Pulse take rate for new and resale units was nearly 57%, up 15 percentage points over the same quarter last year and 71% of all new residential customers added via our direct sales channels were Pulse customers. 
In our small business channel, the Pulse take rate was 50%, up 14 percentage points over the first quarter of last year. 
In our dealer channel, the Pulse take rate ramped to 50% from about 40% -- 47% last quarter and 29% last year. 
In addition to new system sales of Pulse, we upgraded about 31,000 existing customers this quarter. This is nearly doubled the number we did in the same period last year. 
Our Pulse upgrade efforts allow us to provide additional functionality to our existing customers and yield higher ARPU. 
In addition, these upgrades allow us to enter into new contracts with these customers and enhance the customer experience. 
I'm happy with the progress we're making in our operations and with the investments that we're making in our future. 
Before turn I turn the call over to Mike, I want to share some of my thoughts on the evolving landscape in our industry and some observations from the Consumer Electronics Show that took place earlier this month. 
At CES this year, the connected home and Internet of Things continue to gain significant traction. In fact, there was an entire venue dedicated to the connected home and IoT innovations, where ADT was well represented and traffic was very robust. 
The conference showcased several new technology companies, along with many of the biggest names in the consumer electronics industry, offering point solutions for the connected world and smart home. 
ADT's prominent presence in the event featured several of our products with a primary focus on Pulse. In fact, Pulse was recognized by Time Magazine as one of the 6 Coolest Smart Home Innovations at the show. 
Pulse was also featured in a CES keynote addressed by Brian Krzanich, the CEO of Intel, who demonstrated the integration of Pulse with Intel Securities true key multifactor authentication to provide a new level of security and convenience for users. 
This jointly developed proof of concept was held by Brian as an example of how our IoT partnership can make a smart home also a safe home. 
At CES, we also showcased our new total security wireless panel for Pulse automation installations, which we rolled out last quarter and installed approximately 8,000 units during the quarter. 
What I saw at CES this year reinforced several thoughts on ADT's positioning for the future. 
First, much of the product innovation and many new point solutions are geared towards the 80% of the market, not reached or targeted by traditional professional installed and monitored security and automation solutions. The growing interest in this segment is raising the awareness of and the growth opportunity for monitored security and home automation. 
Second, these self monitored smart home solutions are not necessarily creating a safe home as notifying and seeing are not the same as monitoring. 
Additionally, customers are growing weary of the large and growing number of apps needed to manage all the disparate devices in their home. Most customers prefer to have a single platform with an easy and unified customer experience to manage their connected home. 
Finally, a primary driver of consumer interest in smart home applications is security. This was reinforced by recent research conducted by several third parties, including Lowe's and the Consumer Electronics Association. 
I believe ADT is well positioned to capture additional growth in the future given our large customer base, trusted brand, robust monitoring infrastructure, strong field sales and installation force and fully developed Pulse platform. ADT is viewed as a partner of choice by many well respected companies in the industry. 
I believe that ADT is in the right place, at the right time, with the right platform, services and products to capitalize on this opportunity to make homes and businesses both smart and safe. 
Now let me turn things over to Mike to provide some additional details on our financial and operational performance during the quarter."
184157327,281936271,749845,"The ADT Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2015",2015-01-28,"Earnings Calls","The ADT Security Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Naren.

As Naren mentioned, we're off to a strong start this year, delivering another quarter of improved financial and operational results. The metrics that drive our business are moving in the right direction, and we continue to invest in new growth opportunities in health and commercial security. We're working diligently on improving our customers' experience. 
While we're committed to delivering improved financial performance, as evidenced by the strong start to the year, we have an ambitious plan to invest and build on these results to create a better ADT for both our customers and shareholders. This includes investing to improve customer experience, automating and streamlining processes, opening our platform to partners, expanding our services and distribution and integrating our Canadian businesses. 
Over the next few slides, I'll review our Q1 performance and highlight our accomplishment during the quarter. 
Slide 8 provides an overview of our GAAP and non-GAAP results. Recurring revenue grew 6.5% to $825 million and accounted for 93% of our total revenue. Our total revenue rose 5.7%. 
When adjusting for the decline in the Canadian dollar, recurring revenue was up over 7% and total revenue increased by 6.4%. 
We remain focused on growing our business through a highly profitable recurring revenue model, continuing the trend you've seen in our historical results. We continue to integrate Protectron into our results as we recognize a full quarter of contribution in Q1. Protectron contributed over half of the recurring revenue growth in the period, but since it currently operates at the lower margin in the ADT Business, the consolidation had a dilutive impact to EBITDA margins, increased our D&A and was neutral on EPS. 
EBITDA before special items for the quarter was $453 million, up 6% or $27 million over prior year. The weak Canadian dollar diluted this growth by $1.5 million. This translated to an EBITDA margin of 51.1%, an increase of 30 basis points year-over-year. 
Excluding the dilutive impact of Protectron, EBITDA margins before special items increased by nearly 100 basis points from last year. 
Year-over-year, recurring revenue growth, combined with our cost efficiency initiatives, drove the increase in our margins. 
Cost to serve was up 6% due primarily to the consolidation of Protectron. However, without Protectron, cost-to-serve expenses were flat with last year despite a higher mix of Pulse subscribers, additional investments and customer experience and launching our customer business. 
GAAP EPS was $0.41 a share, which includes special items and a tax rate in the quarter of 33.3%. Excluding special items, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.51, up 19% from Q1 2014. 
Using our Q1 tax cash tax rate of 4.6%, our earnings per share before special items was $0.73 for the quarter, up 11% over last year. 
The chart also details our special items for the quarter. In Q1, we accelerated the conversion of 2G radio customers, successfully converting 113,000 customers, a portion of which we were able to up-sell to ADT Pulse. 
We also incurred a minor level of integration expenses related to Protectron acquisition, as well as some restructuring charges. 
Activity to integrate Protectron will accelerate following the recent appointment of a new President for our combined Canadian operations. Our 2G conversion program will continue through 2016. We are comfortably ahead of plan and are opportunistically balancing this program against resource availability and customer demand. 
Turning to the operating leverage. Slide 9 shows strong gross adds growth and increases in average revenue per unit for Q1 versus the prior year. 
Total company gross adds increased over 13% year-over-year, driven by improved performance in our direct and dealer channels, as well as across our residential business and health units. 
Gross adds in our direct channel were up 10%, marking the first time we've experienced year-over-year growth since 2013. The increase in gross additions with stronger lead generation, higher close rates and greater self-generated sales. 
Protectron accounted for about 20% of the growth rate in the direct channel. New subscriber growth was accomplished despite the headwinds caused by our fully implemented enhanced credit screening procedures, which management estimates filtered out about 4,000 potential sales. 
We expect this enhanced processed to improve further future attrition by filtering credit-challenged customers into different payment plans, which allows us to focus on profitable growth. 
Gross adds in our dealer channel rose 19% from last year as we experienced higher sales from existing dealers, added some new dealers and benefited from the dealer volume production of Protectron. 
Returning dealer volumes to growth was a 2014 priority, which we've accomplished in Q4. We are very pleased with our partners, delivering 100,000 customer ads for Q1, a 16,000 increase over Q1 2014. 
Our ability to grow ARPU shows that pricing remains healthy in our business. Our continued investment in ADT Pulse, combined with incremental service offerings like small business bundles and hosted video, have helped drive higher revenue per user. 
For the quarter, new and resale ARPU was $47.28, an increase of 5% over the prior year and ARPU for our overall customer base was $41.76, an increase of 2% year-over-year. 
As a reminder, Protectron generates lower ARPU than our traditional base in the U.S. which diluted the overall year-over-year growth figure as did the weaker Canadian dollar.  Excluding Protectron, ARPU rose 4% over last year. 
Over the course of the last year, we launched a number of initiatives designed to improve the customer experience and increase customer retention. Our results on Slide 10 show that these initiatives are paying off as we improve attrition for the third consecutive quarter and reduce it to its lowest level since becoming a public company. 
Q1 trailing 12-month net revenue attrition was 13.0%. The sequential improvement of 50 basis points and a significant reduction of 120 basis points versus Q1 prior year. 
Unit attrition, which measures customer attrition for just our residential and business customers, was 12.9% for the quarter, a 30-basis-point improvement versus Q4 and 70 basis points lower than last year. 
Our focus on enhancing the customer experience, reducing nonpaid disconnections and increasing resales, coupled with stable existing home sales, contributed to lower attrition. 
The key to driving higher recurring revenues is increasing average revenue per customer through new offerings, greater automation and price escalations, all of which we are executing well, as well as growing the subscriber base. 
For the past 2 years, we have grown our subscriber base primarily as a result of M&A. Organically, we reported a net subscriber loss of over 100,000 customers in 2014. 
As we progress our dual goals of growing gross adds and lowering attrition, we are positioning the company towards its ultimate objective of organic net subscriber growth. 
In the first quarter, we reported a decline in our customer base of 8,000 subscribers. However, this compares favorably to Q1 2014, where we lost 48,000 customers. This is a major step forward and bodes well for future revenue growth. 
Slide 11 shows recurring revenue margin in SAC. For the quarter, recurring revenue margin on our existing customer base was 66.4%, up 10 basis points versus prior year. The current quarter included investments in our commercial expansion and health business, the dilutive effect of consolidating Protectron and efficiency from the Tyco separation. 
Excluding Protectron, recurring revenue margins would have been 67%, an increase of 70 basis points. 
And as I mentioned earlier, cost-to-serve expenses flat with last year on higher revenues. 
We continue to make progress in driving down customer acquisition costs and lowering our overall net creation multiple despite higher Pulse take rates, which require a larger upfront investment. 
Excluding the impact of Pulse upgrades, our combined net creation multiple improved by 0.7x to 31.7 in Q1, while the net creation multiple in our direct channel fell to 31.9x, a 2.1x improvement from last year. 
As a reminder, the first quarter is historically our highest level of SAC mostly due to absorption issues, and it's the lowest quarter of volumes. 
Average net SAC, excluding upgrades for our direct channel, was about $,1,500 per unit, which was actually below the same figure last year despite the increased sales of more expense of Pulse and automation units. This was possible because of productivity improvements, marketing savings and hardware efficiency. 
In the quarter, we began deploying our new Total Security Panel from new Pulse automation customers, continued our implementation of electronic contracts and delivered on our cost efficiency programs. ADT Business has now rolled out e-contract nationally and Resi will do the same in February. 
As mentioned earlier, we are investing in our business, in customer growth, Pulse, commercial expansion, health and customer experience, all in order to build a stronger and more profitable subscriber base. 
On Slide 12, we detail the components of free cash flow for the quarter. Cash flow from operations, before special items, was up 14% from last year to $390 million. 
The increase in operating cash flow is driven by past investments, our improved financial and operational performance in the quarter and improvements in working capital management. This 14% growth is despite a $25 million year-over-year increase in cash interest expense, a large portion, of which rose from debt issued to buy back our shares. 
Of the interest burden at higher debt level impacts free cash flow, the company's cash flow are benefited by 27% fewer shares outstanding. 
Capital expenditures before special items for the quarter were $344 million, up from $274 million last year, of which 94% of the CapEx invested during the quarter was used for driving increases in new subscriber adds, including increases in Pulse customers and upgrades. 
Direct channel subscriber CapEx increased by 13%, reflecting a 10% increase in gross adds, higher Pulse penetration and Pulse upgrade increasing from 17,000 to 31,000 year-over-year. 
Our dealer channel saw CapEx increased by 33%, attributed to a 19% increase in gross adds, the inclusion of Protectron and significantly higher Pulse take rates. 
Factoring all of these, including the investment in new subscribers, free cash flow before special items for the quarter was $46 million. And as shown on the bottom of the chart, the improvement drivers of our businesses has led to stronger pre-SAC EBITDA resulting in steady-state free cash flow, increasing 14% to $893 million. 
With returns on invested capital on the teams in our subscriber investments, investing in growth make sense for the business and our shareholders. New customers are generating higher ARPU, and we believe will stay with us longer, generating higher future cash flows. 
Some of these investments are transitional such as higher Pulse take rates and Pulse upgrades. These will stabilize the decline over the few years, resulting in sizeable improvement in free cash flows. 
Slide 13 highlights our capital allocation and debt levels for the quarter. On a pro forma basis reflecting a full year for Protectron, leverage was 2.9x at quarter end. Q1 is a historically low cash flow period, and we reported -- repurchased, I'm sorry, 94 million of our shares during the quarter. The company raised $300 million of debt in the quarter, enabling us to pay down a portion of our revolving line of credit. Total debt increased by $158 million from year end. 
Overall, the company's total cost of borrowing was below 4% for the quarter, giving us the flexibility to invest in our business and customer growth, which continues to be the best use of capital for ADT. 
In Q1, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share, a 60% increase over last year and announced a 5% increase to our quarterly dividend effective with our next payments. 
We continue to be opportunistic with buying back shares and repurchased 2.9 million shares at an average price of $32.35 during the quarter, bringing the average diluted share count to 175 million. 
We have approximately $286 million remaining on the share buyback authorization, and we remain opportunistic when evaluating future buybacks. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Naren."

Our continued drive to increase gross adds in all of our channels and all of our lines of business; and two, is to continue to drive improvements in unit and revenue attrition but this is clearly more tied to the unit attrition. I hesitate to pick a specific quarter because you do get seasonality, both on the gross adds side, as well on the disconnect side. So all I would say is, yes, we're continuing to drive towards that. As you saw in the first quarter, we narrowed that gap dramatically and I think the trends in both gross adds and in attrition unit attrition are very favorable and I feel confident we're going to continue to move in the right direction there."

So it does not add to a variable cost that being allocated. So we have guided for SAC creation multiple, I should say, to be down for the year. We're down significantly in this quarter. Yes, we had a nice ride last year. Sequentially, we continue to improve but if you look at their results sequentially, has improved as you went on as well. So going from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, it's probably the one metric that sequentially this metric has ads. You can't really compare as well, fourth quarter to first quarter, but we are -- I think the key was SAC is we're really just scratching the surface on our SAC productivity initiatives. We talked about rolling out that TS Panel. We only rolled out 8000 of our 260,000 ads this quarter. We're on TS, okay? That go and accelerate and as we identify as labor savings. I talked about the e-contracts. We really started to roll that out small base or [indiscernible] and now it's being rolled out in the second quarter into as resi as well, there's efficiencies there. We have other hardware and peripherals savings too. So the initiatives that we have are on track had some benefit the first quarter. I think we'll have a bigger benefit as the year goes on.

But Jason, I think we're hearing from those customers is -- surveys as do our own research within tenders is there is a strong interest in security, they want better protection where the resistance is on long-term contracts and potentially very high monthly rates. So I think as we look at it, it would require potentially a different business model or some different economics for those customers in order to bring them into the category or a much stronger value proposition. Clearly, Pulse, we think, because of home automation and security brings in much higher volume proposition, but it still has a pretty high upfront costs, and we still, as an industry, require multi-year contracts. So I think those -- the demand and desires/need for security is very high and I referenced a couple of those that is I believe it was the low one, it was over 60%.

I mean, there's always going to be people moving from 1 household to the next. So we're always going to have disconnects either relocations. As we've discussed in the past, our goal was to recapture the house through resales and recapture that customer by doing a very good job of following them. I think we're making good progress there, but that doesn't necessarily impact the gross disconnect piece. The areas we can control is the voluntary and the nonpay. On the nonpay side, clearly, driving the incremental screening that we're doing will result in better quality customers who will stay with us longer and that continuing to drive at the buy very high percentage of our new customers coming on auto pay, some type of easy pay solutions there. So then it's really coming down to the voluntary. And we've got 2 pads that we're pursuing aggressively on that. One is driving the Pulse upgrades because as we talked about on this call and in the past, Pulse had a better attention characteristics because customers armor engaged with their system using it more frequently, and that's why we're pursuing both new Pulse customers, as well as upgrades. And the otherwise is just continuing to improve our service level. It's not as much on the monitoring side. I think when you look at our monitoring and response levels, they are very good. The percentage of calls that we -- the speed at which we answer calls our ability to work through the call list or dispatch immediately in life safety, it's more of the service side, making sure that we're staffed appropriately in our call centers, that we're driving more customers self-service on MyADT.com. So it's a whole portfolio programs that we're driving. And a piece of that is just a culture of transformation. And since we've been an independent company, we've been driving this mindset around customer obsessions and the metrics around customer obsessions in driving more recognition and reward around delivering that great customer experience. So again, I don't know that I can sit here and say what the endgame looks like because some of those other pieces are a little bit out of our control, but we still feel like we've got room ahead of us. We're going to continue to drive it aggressively."

The nice thing about TS, it's a standalone box. When people do leave us, we will be getting the boxes back so there's a possibility of getting some counter SAC as well.

I hope you had a chance to review our earnings press release we issued earlier this morning that highlights our results for the first quarter of 2015. This morning, I'll discuss our key performance highlights and accomplishments for the quarter, then Mike Geltzeiler will provide additional details on our financial and operational performance. 
As you can see from our results, we've continued the trends we saw in the second half of 2014, and we're off to a strong start to the new year, delivering another quarter of improved performance. Solid execution of our initiatives is driving stronger financial and operational results, and the investments we continue to make in our business are positioning us for future profitable revenue growth. All of our key customer metrics continued to move in the right direction during the quarter as we take advantage of our industry-leading position and strong brand recognition. 
We remain excited about what we see in the business today and the evolution occurring in our industry that is creating even more opportunities for future growth. I'm proud of our team's performance this quarter, while recognizing the opportunity for an even brighter future. 
As we review our highlights for the quarter, I think it's important to look at our performance in the context of our strategy and against the backdrop of our rapidly evolving industry. We've made significant progress since becoming a stand-alone company a little over 2 years ago. This progress has accelerated over the past several quarters as we've begun to benefit from the initiatives that we have pursued to enhance our operations and competitive position, resulting in improvements in our performance. 
This quarter, we continue to invest in growth and strengthening our leadership team, all in support of our strategy to achieve our vision for ADT, a vision that's rooted in extending our leadership position in the security, life safety and home automation markets, enhancing the values of ADT's services and executing on our initiatives to drive strong returns. A common thread running throughout every aspect of our vision is creating a superior customer experience. The results from the actions we've taken are continuing to shine through in our results, giving us confidence that we're on the right path. 
As I've discussed on previous calls, I view the recent activity in our industry in 2 distinct areas: integrated professionally monitored security life safety and automation solutions, where ADT is traditionally focused, currently serving about 20% of households; and unmonitored or self-monitored stand-alone home automation solutions, where many new entrants, large and small, are focusing their efforts on the remaining 80% of households. The majority of these efforts are targeting a wide range of home automation applications with only a small portion addressing security and life safety. While our traditional market is more competitive than it was 5 years ago, the environment has been relatively stable, and we're continuing to win in this market, as evidenced by our improving operational and customer metrics and solid financial results. 
Slide 3 shows our strong performance over the past 12 months on 4 key metrics that are affected by the competitive environment. Over the past years, we have driven increases in gross adds in all lines of business and in our direct and dealer channels, improved customer retention by 120 basis points, increased the average price paid by newly added customers and reduced our creation multiple, or in other words, the cost we incur to bring on a new customer. I think this chart is the best evidence that we are winning in the market and our performance is accelerating. 
Specifically, for the first quarter, as highlighted on Slide 4, we drove double-digit gross subscriber growth with year-over-year increases in both our direct and authorized dealer channels for the first time since 2013, driven by stronger lead generation, increases in our self-generated business and improved close rates. Unit and revenue attrition continue to improve meaningfully versus prior year and sequentially as we reduced attrition to its lowest level since we became a public company. As a result of these improvements in gross adds and customer retention, we narrowed our net subscriber loss significantly and are focused on returning to growing net subscribers. From a financial perspective, our improved operational performance allowed us to deliver strong recurring revenue growth, increased EBITDA margins and bottom line results on a year-over-year basis. 
Because of the strong returns we drive in our business today and the many opportunities we see to generate profitable growth in the years ahead, we continue to invest in ADT's future, as shown on Slide 5. 
We're investing to enhance the customer experience by implementing new technologies and processes, including the rollout of a new electronic order management platform and the deployment of our new wireless Total Security panel. We're expanding our presence in the midsize commercial market and making investments in products and distribution to generate future growth through our health service offerings. We also added a new key leader to run our combined business in Canada and appointed a new Board member from the technology sector, Chris Hylen of Citrix Systems. 
We're also continuing to invest in driving profitable growth through Pulse. Pulse continues to be an important driver behind our results. And in Q1, Pulse take rates increased as did Pulse upgrades. 
As you can see on Slide 6, over 53% of our total gross adds during the quarter were Pulse units, up from 51% last quarter and 37% a year ago. In our residential direct channel, the Pulse take rate for new and resale units was nearly 57%, up 15 percentage points over the same quarter last year. And 71% of all new residential customers added via our direct sales channel were Pulse customers. 
In our small business channel, the Pulse take rate was 50%, up 14 percentage points over the first quarter of last year. In our dealer channel, the Pulse take rate ramped to 50% from about 40% -- 47% last quarter and 29% last year. 
In addition to new system sales of Pulse, we upgraded about 31,000 existing customers this quarter. This is nearly double the number we did in the same period last year. Our Pulse upgrade efforts allow us to provide additional functionality to our existing customers and yield higher ARPU. 
In addition, these upgrades allow us to enter into new contracts with these customers and enhance the customer experience. I'm happy with the progress we're making in our operations and with the investments that we're making in our future. 
Before turn I turn the call over to Mike, I want to share some of my thoughts on the evolving landscape in our industry and some observations from the Consumer Electronics Show that took place earlier this month. 
At CES this year, the connected home and Internet of Things continue to gain significant traction. In fact, there was an entire venue dedicated to the connected home and IoT innovations, where ADT was well represented and traffic was very robust. The conference showcased several new technology companies, along with many of the biggest names in the consumer electronics industry, offering point solutions for the connected world and smart home. 
ADT's prominent presence at the event featured several of our products with a primary focus on Pulse. In fact, Pulse was recognized by Time Magazine as one of the 6 coolest smart home innovations at the show. 
Pulse was also featured in a CES keynote address by Brian Krzanich, the CEO of Intel, who demonstrated the integration of Pulse with Intel Securities' True Key multifactor authentication to provide a new level of security and convenience for users. This jointly developed proof of concept was hailed by Brian as an example of how our IoT partnership can make a smart home also a safe home. At CES, we also showcased our new Total Security wireless panel for Pulse automation installations, which we rolled out last quarter and installed approximately 8,000 units during the quarter.  
What I saw at CES this year reinforced several thoughts on ADT's positioning for the future. First, much of the product innovation and many new point solutions are geared towards the 80% of the market, not reached or targeted by traditional professional installed and monitored security and automation solutions. The growing interest in this segment is raising the awareness of and the growth opportunity for monitored security and home automation. 
Second, these self-monitored smart home solutions are not necessarily creating a safe home, as notifying and seeing are not the same as monitoring. Additionally, customers are growing wary of the large and growing number of apps needed to manage all the disparate devices in their home. Most customers prefer to have a single platform with an easy and unified customer experience to manage their connected home. 
Finally, a primary driver of consumer interest in smart home applications is security. This was reinforced by recent research conducted by several third parties, including Lowe's and the Consumer Electronics Association. I believe ADT is well positioned to capture additional growth in the future given our large customer base, trusted brand, robust monitoring infrastructure, strong field sales and installation force and fully developed Pulse platform. ADT is viewed as a partner of choice by many well-respected companies in the industry. I believe that ADT is in the right place, at the right time, with the right platform, services and products to capitalize on this opportunity to make homes and businesses both smart and safe. 
Now let me turn things over to Mike to provide some additional details on our financial and operational performance during the quarter."

As Naren mentioned, we're off to a strong start this year, delivering another quarter of improved financial and operational results. The metrics that drive our business are moving in the right direction, and we continue to invest in new growth opportunities in health and commercial security. We're working diligently on improving our customers' experience. 
While we're committed to delivering improved financial performance, as evidenced by the strong start to the year, we have an ambitious plan to invest and build on these results to create a better ADT for both our customers and shareholders. This includes investing to improve customer experience, automating and streamlining processes, opening our platform to partners, expanding our services and distribution and integrating our Canadian businesses. Over the next few slides, I'll review our Q1 performance and highlight our accomplishments during the quarter. 
Slide 8 provides an overview of our GAAP and non-GAAP results. Recurring revenue grew 6.5% to $825 million and accounted for 93% of our total revenue. Our total revenue rose 5.7%. When adjusting for the decline in the Canadian dollar, recurring revenue was up over 7% and total revenue increased by 6.4%. We remain focused on growing our business through a highly profitable recurring revenue model, continuing the trend you have seen in our historical results. 
We continue to integrate Protectron into our results as we recognized a full quarter of contribution in Q1. Protectron contributed over half of the recurring revenue growth in the period, but since it currently operates at a lower margin than the ADT business, the consolidation had a dilutive impact to EBITDA margins, increased our D&A and was neutral on EPS. 
EBITDA before special items for the quarter was $453 million, up 6% or $27 million over prior year. The weak Canadian dollar diluted this growth by $1.5 million. This translated to an EBITDA margin of 51.1%, an increase of 30 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the dilutive impact of Protectron, EBITDA margins before special items increased by nearly 100 basis points from last year. Year-over-year, recurring revenue growth, combined with our cost efficiency initiative, drove the increase in our margins. 
Cost to serve was up 6% due primarily to the consolidation of Protectron. However, without Protectron, cost-to-serve expenses were flat with last year despite a higher mix of Pulse subscribers, additional investments in customer experience and launching our commercial business. 
GAAP EPS was $0.41 a share, which includes special items and a tax rate in the quarter of 33.3%. Excluding special items, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.51, up 19% from Q1 2014. Using our Q1 tax cash tax rate of 4.6%, our earnings per share before special items was $0.73 for the quarter, up 11% over last year. 
The chart also details our special items for the quarter. In Q1, we accelerated the conversion of 2G radio customers, successfully converting 113,000 customers, a portion of which we were able to up-sell to ADT Pulse. We also incurred a minor level of integration expenses related to Protectron acquisition as well as some restructuring charges. 
Activity to integrate Protectron will accelerate following the recent appointment of a new President for our combined Canadian operations. Our 2G conversion program will continue through 2016. We are comfortably ahead of plan and are opportunistically balancing this program against resource availability and customer demand. 
Turning to the operating levers. Slide 9 shows strong gross add growth and increases in average revenue per unit for Q1 versus the prior year. Total company gross adds increased over 13% year-over-year, driven by improved performance in our direct and dealer channels as well as across our residential business and health units. 
Gross adds in our direct channel were up 10%, marking the first time we've experienced year-over-year growth since 2013. The increase in gross additions was due to stronger lead generation, higher close rates and greater self-generated sales. Protectron accounted for about 20% of the growth rate in the direct channel. 
New subscriber growth was accomplished despite the headwinds caused by our fully implemented enhanced credit screening procedures, which management estimates filtered out about 4,000 potential sales. We expect this enhanced processed to improve further -- future attrition by filtering credit-challenged customers into different payment plans, which allows us to focus on profitable growth. 
Gross adds in our dealer channel rose 19% from last year as we experienced higher sales from existing dealers, added some new dealers and benefited from the dealer volume production of Protectron. Returning dealer volumes to growth was a 2014 priority, which we accomplished in Q4. We are very pleased with our partners, delivering 100,000 customer adds for Q1, a 16,000 increase over Q1 2014. 
Our ability to grow ARPU shows that pricing remains healthy in our business. Our continued investment in ADT Pulse, combined with incremental service offerings, like small business bundles and hosted video, have helped drive higher revenue per user. 
For the quarter, new and resale ARPU was $47.28, an increase of 5% over the prior year, and ARPU for our overall customer base was $41.76, an increase of 2% year-over-year. As a reminder, Protectron generates lower ARPU than our traditional base in the U.S., which diluted the overall year-over-year growth figure as did the weaker Canadian dollar. Excluding Protectron, ARPU rose 4% over last year. 
Over the course of the last year, we launched a number of initiatives designed to improve the customer experience and increase customer retention. Our results on Slide 10 show that these initiatives are paying off as we improve attrition for the third consecutive quarter and reduce it to its lowest level since becoming a public company. 
Q1 trailing 12-month net revenue attrition was 13.0%, a sequential improvement of 50 basis points and a significant reduction of 120 basis points versus Q1 prior year. Unit attrition, which measures customer attrition for just our residential and business customers, was 12.9% for the quarter, a 30-basis-point improvement versus Q4 and 70 basis points lower than last year. Our focus on enhancing the customer experience, reducing non-pay disconnections and increasing resales, coupled with stable existing home sales, contributed to lower attrition. 
The key to driving higher recurring revenues is increasing average revenue per customer through new offerings, greater automation and price escalations, all of which we are executing well as well as growing the subscriber base. For the past 2 years, we have grown our subscriber base primarily as a result of M&A. Organically, we reported a net subscriber loss of over 100,000 customers in 2014. As we progress our dual goals of growing gross adds and lowering attrition, we are positioning the company towards its ultimate objective of organic net subscriber growth. 
In the first quarter, we reported a decline in our customer base of 8,000 subscribers. However, this compares favorably to Q1 2014, where we lost 48,000 customers. This is a major step forward and bodes well for future revenue growth. 
Slide 11 shows recurring revenue margin and SAC. For the quarter, recurring revenue margin on our existing customer base was 66.4%, up 10 basis points versus prior year. The current quarter included investments in our commercial expansion and health business, the dilutive effect of consolidating Protectron and inefficiencies from the Tyco separation. Excluding Protectron, recurring revenue margins would have been 67%, an increase of 70 basis points. As I mentioned earlier, cost-to-serve expense is flat with last year on higher revenues. 
We continue to make progress in driving down customer acquisition costs and lowering our overall net creation multiple despite higher Pulse take rates, which require a larger upfront investment. Excluding the impact of Pulse upgrades, our combined net creation multiple improved by 0.7x to 31.7 in Q1, while the net creation multiple in our direct channel fell to 31.9x, a 2.1x improvement from last year. As a reminder, the first quarter has historically been our highest level of SAC mostly due to absorption issues, and it's the lowest quarter of volumes. 
Average net SAC, excluding upgrades for our direct channel, was about $,1,500 per unit, which was actually below the same figure last year despite the increased sales of more expensive Pulse and automation units. This was possible because of productivity improvements, marketing savings and hardware efficiencies. 
In the quarter, we began deploying our new Total Security panel for new Pulse automation customers, continued our implementation of electronic contracts and delivered on our cost efficiency programs. ADT Business has now rolled out eContracts nationally and resi will do the same in February. 
As mentioned earlier, we are investing in our business, in customer growth, Pulse, commercial expansion, health and customer experience, all in order to build a stronger and more profitable subscriber base. On Slide 12, we detail the components of free cash flow for the quarter. Cash flow from operations, before special items, was up 14% from last year to $390 million. The increase in operating cash flow is driven by past investments, our improved financial and operational performance in the quarter and improvements in working capital management. This 14% growth is despite a $25 million year-over-year increase in cash interest expense, a large portion of which arose from debt issued to buy back our shares. While the interest burden at higher debt levels impact free cash flow, the company's cash flows are benefited by 27% fewer shares outstanding. 
Capital expenditures before special items for the quarter were $344 million, up from $274 million last year, of which 94% of the CapEx invested during the quarter was used for driving increases in new subscriber adds, including increases in Pulse customers and upgrades. Direct channel subscriber CapEx increased by 13%, reflecting a 10% increase in gross adds, higher Pulse penetration and Pulse upgrade increasing from 17,000 to 31,000 year-over-year. Our dealer channel saw CapEx increase by 33%, attributed to a 19% increase in gross adds, the inclusion of Protectron and significantly higher Pulse take rates. 
Factoring all of these, including the investment in new subscribers, free cash flow before special items for the quarter was $46 million. And as shown at the bottom of the chart, the improvement in the drivers of our businesses has led to stronger pre-SAC EBITDA, resulting in steady-state free cash flow increasing 14% to $893 million. 
With returns on invested capital in the teens on our subscriber investments, investing in growth makes sense for the business and our shareholders. New customers are generating higher ARPU, and we believe will stay with us longer, generating higher future cash flows. Some of these investments are transitional, such as higher Pulse take rates and Pulse upgrades. These will stabilize in decline over the few years, resulting in sizeable improvement in free cash flows. 
Slide 13 highlights our capital allocation and debt levels for the quarter. On a pro forma basis reflecting a full year for Protectron, leverage was 2.9x at quarter end. Q1 is a historically low cash flow period, and we reported -- repurchased, I'm sorry, 94 million of our shares during the quarter. The company raised $300 million of debt in the quarter, enabling us to pay down a portion of our revolving line of credit. Total debt increased by $158 million from year end. Overall, the company's total cost of borrowing was below 4% for the quarter, giving us the flexibility to invest in our business and customer growth, which continues to be the best use of capital for ADT. 
In Q1, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share, a 60% increase over last year, and announced a 5% increase to our quarterly dividend effective with our next payments. We continue to be opportunistic when buying back shares and repurchased 2.9 million shares at an average price of $32.35 during the quarter, bringing the average diluted share count to 175 million. We have approximately $286 million remaining on the share buyback authorization, and we remain opportunistic when evaluating future buybacks. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Naren."

We're excited about our strong start to the year and the progress we are making in achieving our goals for 2015. 
As shown on Slide 14, we're making solid progress towards achieving our goal for the coming year, with both our financial and operational results tracking well to our previously issued guidance. Rest assured that we are not resting on our laurels as we understand we need to continue to raise the bar and accelerate our efforts to innovate, grow, become more efficient, and most importantly, enhance the customer experience every day. Our entire leadership team is excited about the challenges and the opportunities that we see in this incredibly dynamic market, and I remain confident our best days are still ahead of us.

But this would clearly be more tied to the unit attrition. I hesitate to pick a specific quarter because you do get seasonality, both on the gross adds side as well on the disconnect side. So all I would say is that we're continuing to drive towards that. As you saw in the first quarter, we narrowed that gap dramatically and I think the trends in both gross adds and in attrition, unit attrition are very favorable.

I mean, I think we -- look, the first quarter of last year was not a strong quarter for SAC, but what we did indicate was it was also our lowest quarter for volumes. And there is an absorption issue in our business. When we take the cost in the organization that focuses on installing systems, that is part of SAC, so it's not a pure variable cost that's being allocated. So I think we have guided for SAC creation multiple, I should say, to be down for the year. We're down significantly in this quarter. Yes, we had a nice ride last year where sequentially, we continue to improve. But if you look at the results sequentially, adds improved as you went on as well. So going from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, this was probably the one metric that, sequentially, this metric has adds. You can't really compare as well, fourth quarter to first quarter, but we are -- I think the key with SAC is we're really just scratching the surface on our SAC productivity initiatives. 
We talked about rolling out the TS panel. We only rolled out 8,000 of our 260,000 adds this quarter. We're on TS, okay? That's going to accelerate and that, as we identified, had labor savings. 
I talked about the eContracts. We really just started to roll that out into small biz or into biz. And now it's being rolled out in the second quarter into resi as well. There's efficiencies there. We have other hardware and peripherals savings, too. 
So the initiatives that we have are on track had some benefit in the first quarter. I think we'll have a bigger benefit as the year goes on. And I think we feel that with the seasonality and all that stuff, we're off to a good start and feel go better our guidance that we can bring this down for the year."

But Jason, I think what we're hearing from those customers is -- and it's through surveys, as through our own research within tenders, is that there is a strong interest in security. They want better protection where the resistance is on long-term contracts and potentially very high monthly rates. So I think as we look at it, it would require potentially a different business model or some different economics for those customers in order to bring them into the category or a much stronger value proposition. Clearly, Pulse, we think, because of home automation and security, brings in much higher value proposition, but it still has a pretty high upfront cost, and we still, as an industry, require multiyear contracts. So I think those -- the demand and desires/need for security is very high, and I referenced a couple of those studies. I believe it was the Lowe's one. It was over 60%. So the primary driver for getting a home automation solution was security."

I mean, there's always going to be people moving from one household to the next. So we're always going to have disconnects tied to relocations. As we've discussed in the past, our goal was to recapture the house through resales and recapture that customer by doing a better job of following them. I think we're making good progress there, but that doesn't necessarily impact the gross disconnect piece. 
The areas we can control is the voluntary and the non-pay. On the non-pay side, clearly, driving the incremental screening that we're doing will result in better quality customers who will stay with us longer, and then continuing to drive where a very high percentage of our new customers coming on auto pay or some type of easy pay solution there. 
So then it really comes down to the voluntary. And we've got 2 paths that we're pursuing aggressively on that. One is driving the Pulse upgrades, because as we talked about on this call and in the past, Pulse had better attention characteristics because customers are more engaged with their system, using it more frequently. And that's why we're pursuing both new Pulse customers as well as upgrades. And the other one is just continuing to improve our service levels. 
It's not as much on the monitoring side. I think when you look at our monitoring and response levels, they are very good: we -- the percentage of calls that we -- the speed at which we answer calls, our ability to work through the call list or dispatch immediately in life safety. It's more on the service side, making sure that we're staffed appropriately in our call centers, that are -- we're driving more customer self service on myadt.com. So it's a whole portfolio of programs that we're driving. 
And a piece of that is just a cultural transformation. And since we've been an independent company, we've been driving this mindset around customer obsessions and the metrics around customer obsessions and driving more recognition and reward around delivering that great customer experience. So again, I don't know that I can sit here and say what the endgame looks like, because some of those other pieces are a little bit out of our control. But we still feel like we've got room ahead of us and we're going to continue to drive it aggressively."

I hope you had a chance to review our earnings press release we issued earlier this morning that highlights our results for the first quarter of 2015. This morning, I'll discuss our key performance highlights and accomplishments for the quarter, then Mike Geltzeiler will provide additional details on our financial and operational performance. 
As you can see from our results, we've continued the trends we saw in the second half of 2014, and we're off to a strong start to the new year, delivering another quarter of improved performance. Solid execution of our initiatives is driving stronger financial and operational results, and the investments we continue to make in our business are positioning us for future profitable revenue growth. All of our key customer metrics continued to move in the right direction during the quarter, as we take advantage of our industry-leading position and strong brand recognition. 
We remain excited about what we see in the business today and the evolution occurring in our industry that is creating even more opportunities for future growth. I'm proud of our team's performance this quarter, while recognizing the opportunity for an even brighter future. 
As we review our highlights for the quarter, I think it's important to look at our performance in the context of our strategy and against the backdrop of our rapidly evolving industry. We've made significant progress since becoming a stand-alone company a little over 2 years ago. This progress has accelerated over the past several quarters as we've begun to benefit from the initiatives that we have pursued to enhance our operations and competitive position, resulting in improvements in our performance. 
This quarter, we continued to invest in growth and strengthening our leadership team, all in support of our strategy to achieve our vision for ADT, a vision that's rooted in extending our leadership position in the security, life safety and home automation markets, enhancing the values of ADT's services and executing on our initiatives to drive strong returns. A common thread running throughout every aspect of our vision is creating a superior customer experience. The results from the actions we've taken are continuing to shine through in our results, giving us confidence that we're on the right path. 
As I've discussed on previous calls, I view the recent activity in our industry in 2 distinct areas: integrated professionally monitored security life safety and automation solutions, where ADT is traditionally focused, currently serving about 20% of households; and unmonitored or self-monitored stand-alone home automation solutions, where many new entrants, large and small, are focusing their efforts on the remaining 80% of households. The majority of these efforts are targeting a wide range of home automation applications with only a small portion addressing security and life safety. While our traditional market is more competitive than it was 5 years ago, the environment has been relatively stable, and we're continuing to win in this market, as evidenced by our improving operational and customer metrics and solid financial results. 
Slide 3 shows our strong performance over the past 12 months on 4 key metrics that are affected by the competitive environment. Over the past years, we have driven increases in gross adds in all lines of business and in our direct and dealer channels, improved customer retention by 120 basis points, increased the average price paid by newly added customers and reduced our creation multiple, or in other words, the cost we incur to bring on a new customer. I think this chart is the best evidence that we are winning in the market and our performance is accelerating. 
Specifically, for the first quarter, as highlighted on Slide 4, we drove double-digit gross subscriber growth with year-over-year increases in both our direct and authorized dealer channels for the first time since 2013, driven by stronger lead generation, increases in our self-generated business and improved close rates. Unit and revenue attrition continue to improve meaningfully versus prior year and sequentially as we reduced attrition to its lowest level since we became a public company. As a result of these improvements in gross adds and customer retention, we narrowed our net subscriber loss significantly and are focused on returning to growing net subscribers. From a financial perspective, our improved operational performance allowed us to deliver strong recurring revenue growth, increase EBITDA margins and bottom line results on a year-over-year basis. 
Because of the strong returns we drive in our business today and the many opportunities we see to generate profitable growth in the years ahead, we continue to invest in ADT's future, as shown on Slide 5. 
We're investing to enhance the customer experience by implementing new technologies and processes, including the rollout of a new electronic order management platform and the deployment of our new wireless Total Security panel. We're expanding our presence in the midsize commercial market and making investments in products and distribution to generate future growth through our health service offerings. We also added a new key leader to run our combined business in Canada and appointed a new board member from the technology sector, Chris Hylen of Citrix Systems. 
We're also continuing to invest in driving profitable growth through Pulse. Pulse continues to be an important driver behind our results. And in Q1, Pulse take rates increased as did Pulse upgrades. 
As you can see on Slide 6, over 53% of our total gross adds during the quarter were Pulse units, up from 51% last quarter and 37% a year ago. In our residential direct channel, the Pulse take rate for new and resale units was nearly 57%, up 15 percentage points over the same quarter last year. And 71% of all new residential customers added via our direct sales channel were Pulse customers. 
In our small business channel, the Pulse take rate was 50%, up 14 percentage points over the first quarter of last year. In our dealer channel, the Pulse take rate ramped to 50% from about 40% -- 47% last quarter and 29% last year. 
In addition to new system sales of Pulse, we upgraded about 31,000 existing customers this quarter. This is nearly double the number we did in the same period last year. Our Pulse upgrade efforts allow us to provide additional functionality to our existing customers and yield higher ARPU. 
In addition, these upgrades allow us to enter into new contracts with these customers and enhance the customer experience. I'm happy with the progress we're making in our operations and with the investments that we're making in our future. 
Before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to share some of my thoughts on the evolving landscape in our industry and some observations from the Consumer Electronics Show that took place earlier this month. 
At CES this year, the connected home and Internet of Things continued to gain significant traction. In fact, there was an entire venue dedicated to the connected home and IoT innovations, where ADT was well represented and traffic was very robust. The conference showcased several new technology companies, along with many of the biggest names in the consumer electronics industry, offering point solutions for the connected world and smart home. 
ADT's prominent presence at the event featured several of our products with a primary focus on Pulse. In fact, Pulse was recognized by Time Magazine as one of the 6 coolest smart home innovations at the show. 
Pulse was also featured in a CES keynote address by Brian Krzanich, the CEO of Intel, who demonstrated the integration of Pulse with Intel Security's True Key multifactor authentication to provide a new level of security and convenience for users. This jointly developed proof of concept was hailed by Brian as an example of how our IoT partnership can make a smart home also a safe home. At CES, we also showcased our new Total Security wireless panel for Pulse automation installations, which we rolled out last quarter and installed approximately 8,000 units during the quarter.  
What I saw at CES this year reinforced several thoughts on ADT's positioning for the future. First, much of the product innovation and many new point solutions are geared towards the 80% of the market, not reached or targeted by traditional professionally installed and monitored security and automation solutions. The growing interest in this segment is raising the awareness of and the growth opportunity for monitored security and home automation. 
Second, these self-monitored smart home solutions are not necessarily creating a safe home, as notifying and seeing are not the same as monitoring. Additionally, customers are growing wary of the large and growing number of apps needed to manage all the disparate devices in their home. Most customers prefer to have a single platform with an easy and unified customer experience to manage their connected home. 
Finally, a primary driver of consumer interest in smart home applications is security. This was reinforced by recent research conducted by several third parties, including Lowe's and the Consumer Electronics Association. I believe ADT is well positioned to capture additional growth in the future given our large customer base, trusted brand, robust monitoring infrastructure, strong field sales and installation force and fully developed Pulse platform. ADT is viewed as a partner of choice by many well-respected companies in the industry. I believe that ADT is in the right place, at the right time, with the right platform, services and products to capitalize on this opportunity to make homes and businesses both smart and safe. 
Now let me turn things over to Mike to provide some additional details on our financial and operational performance during the quarter."

As Naren mentioned, we're off to a strong start this year, delivering another quarter of improved financial and operational results. The metrics that drive our business are moving in the right direction, and we're continuing to invest in new growth opportunities in health and commercial security. We're working diligently on improving our customers' experience. 
While we're committed to delivering improved financial performance, as evidenced by the strong start to the year, we have an ambitious plan to invest and build on these results to create a better ADT for both our customers and shareholders. This includes investing to improve customer experience, automating and streamlining processes, opening our platform to partners, expanding our services and distribution and integrating our Canadian businesses. Over the next few slides, I'll review our Q1 performance and highlight our accomplishments during the quarter. 
Slide 8 provides an overview of our GAAP and non-GAAP results. Recurring revenue grew 6.5% to $825 million and accounted for 93% of our total revenue, while total revenue rose 5.7%. When adjusting for the decline in the Canadian dollar, recurring revenue was up over 7% and total revenue increased by 6.4%. We remain focused on growing our business through a highly profitable recurring revenue model, continuing the trend you have seen in our historical results. 
We continue to integrate Protectron into our results as we recognized a full quarter of contribution in Q1. Protectron contributed over half of the recurring revenue growth in the period, but since it currently operates at a lower margin than the ADT business, the consolidation had a dilutive impact to EBITDA margins, increased our D&A and was neutral on EPS. 
EBITDA, before special items for the quarter, was $453 million, up 6% or $27 million over prior year. The weak Canadian dollar diluted this growth by $1.5 million. This translated to an EBITDA margin of 51.1%, an increase of 30 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the dilutive impact of Protectron, EBITDA margins before special items increased by nearly 100 basis points from last year. Year-over-year recurring revenue growth, combined with our cost efficiency initiatives, drove the increase in our margins. 
Cost to serve was up 6% due primarily to the consolidation of Protectron. However, without Protectron, cost-to-serve expenses were flat with last year despite a higher mix of Pulse subscribers, additional investments in customer experience and launching our commercial business. 
GAAP EPS was $0.41 a share, which includes special items and a tax rate in the quarter of 33.3%. Excluding special items, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.51, up 19% from Q1 2014. Using our Q1 cash tax rate of 4.6%, our earnings per share before special items was $0.73 for the quarter, up 11% over last year. 
The chart also details our special items for the quarter. In Q1, we accelerated the conversion of 2G radio customers, successfully converting 113,000 customers, a portion of which we were able to up-sell to ADT Pulse. We also incurred a minor level of integration expenses related to Protectron acquisition as well as some restructuring charges. 
Activity to integrate Protectron will accelerate following the recent appointment of a new President for our combined Canadian operations. Our 2G conversion program will continue through 2016. We are comfortably ahead of plan and are opportunistically balancing this program against resource availability and customer demand. 
Turning to the operating levers. Slide 9 shows strong gross add growth and increases in average revenue per unit for Q1 versus the prior year. Total company gross adds increased over 13% year-over-year, driven by improved performance in our direct and dealer channels as well as across our residential business and health units. 
Gross adds in our direct channel were up 10%, marking the first time we've experienced year-over-year growth since 2013. The increase in gross additions was due to stronger lead generation, higher close rates and greater self-generated sales. Protectron accounted for about 20% of the growth rate in the direct channel. 
New subscriber growth was accomplished despite the headwinds caused by our fully implemented enhanced credit screening procedures, which management estimates filtered out about 4,000 potential sales. We expect this enhanced processed to improve further -- future attrition by filtering credit-challenged customers into different payment plans, which allows us to focus on profitable growth. 
Gross adds in our dealer channel rose 19% from last year as we experienced higher sales from existing dealers, added some new dealers and benefited from the dealer volume production of Protectron. Returning dealer volumes to growth was a 2014 priority, which we accomplished in Q4. We are very pleased with our partners, delivering 100,000 customer adds for Q1, a 16,000 increase over Q1 2014. 
Our ability to grow ARPU shows that pricing remains healthy in our business. Our continued investment in ADT Pulse, combined with incremental service offerings, like small business bundles and hosted video, have helped drive higher revenue per user. 
For the quarter, new and resale ARPU was $47.28, an increase of 5% over the prior year, and ARPU for our overall customer base was $41.76, an increase of 2% year-over-year. As a reminder, Protectron generates lower ARPU than our traditional base in the U.S., which diluted the overall year-over-year growth figure as did the weaker Canadian dollar. Excluding Protectron, ARPU rose 4% over last year. 
Over the course of the last year, we launched a number of initiatives designed to improve the customer experience and increase customer retention. Our results on Slide 10 show that these initiatives are paying off as we improved attrition for the third consecutive quarter and reduced it to its lowest level since becoming a public company. 
Q1 trailing 12-month net revenue attrition was 13.0%, a sequential improvement of 50 basis points and a significant reduction of 120 basis points versus Q1 prior year. Unit attrition, which measures customer attrition for just our residential and business customers, was 12.9% for the quarter, a 30-basis-point improvement versus Q4 and 70 basis points lower than last year. Our focus on enhancing the customer experience, reducing nonpay disconnections and increasing resales, coupled with stable existing home sales, contributed to lower attrition. 
The key to driving higher recurring revenues is increasing average revenue per customer through new offerings, greater automation and price escalations, all of which we are executing well, as well as growing the subscriber base. For the past 2 years, we have grown our subscriber base primarily as a result of M&A. Organically, we reported a net subscriber loss of over 100,000 customers in 2014. As we progress our dual goals of growing gross adds and lowering attrition, we are positioning the company towards its ultimate objective of organic net subscriber growth. 
In the first quarter, we reported a decline in our customer base of 8,000 subscribers. However, this compares favorably to Q1 2014, where we lost 48,000 customers. This is a major step forward and bodes well for future revenue growth. 
Slide 11 shows recurring revenue margin and SAC. For the quarter, recurring revenue margin on our existing customer base was 66.4%, up 10 basis points versus prior year. The current quarter included investments in our commercial expansion and health business, the dilutive effect of consolidating Protectron and inefficiency from the Tyco separation. Excluding Protectron, recurring revenue margins would have been 67%, an increase of 70 basis points. As I mentioned earlier, cost-to-serve expense is flat with last year on higher revenues. 
We continue to make progress in driving down customer acquisition costs and lowering our overall net creation multiple despite higher Pulse take rates, which require a larger upfront investment. Excluding the impact of Pulse upgrades, our combined net creation multiple improved by 0.7x to 31.7 in Q1, while the net creation multiple in our direct channel fell to 31.9x, a 2.1x improvement from last year. As a reminder, the first quarter has historically been our highest level of SAC, mostly due to absorption issues, and it's the lowest quarter of volumes. 
Average net SAC, excluding upgrades for our direct channel, was about $1,500 per unit, which was actually below the same figure last year despite the increased sales of more expensive Pulse and automation units. This was possible because of productivity improvements, marketing savings and hardware efficiencies. 
In the quarter, we began deploying our new Total Security panel for new Pulse automation customers, continued our implementation of electronic contracts and delivered on our cost efficiency programs. ADT Business has now rolled out eContracts nationally and resi will do the same in February. 
As mentioned earlier, we are investing in our business, in customer growth, Pulse, commercial expansion, health and customer experience, all in order to build a stronger and more profitable subscriber base. On Slide 12, we detail the components of free cash flow for the quarter. Cash flow from operations, before special items, was up 14% from last year to $390 million. The increase in operating cash flow is driven by past investments, our improved financial and operational performance in the quarter and improvements in working capital management. This 14% growth is despite a $25 million year-over-year increase in cash interest expense, a large portion of which arose from debt issued to buy back our shares. While the interest burden on higher debt levels impact free cash flow, the company's cash flows are benefited by 27% fewer shares outstanding. 
Capital expenditures before special items for the quarter were $344 million, up from $274 million last year, of which 94% of the CapEx invested during the quarter was used for driving increases in new subscriber adds, including increases in Pulse customers and upgrades. Direct channel subscriber CapEx increased by 13%, reflecting a 10% increase in gross adds, higher Pulse penetration and Pulse upgrade increasing from 17,000 to 31,000 year-over-year. Our dealer channel saw CapEx increase by 33%, attributed to a 19% increase in gross adds, the inclusion of Protectron and significantly higher Pulse take rates. 
Factoring all of this, including the investment in new subscribers, free cash flow before special items for the quarter was $46 million. And as shown at the bottom of the chart, the improvement in the drivers of our businesses has led to stronger pre-SAC EBITDA, resulting in steady-state free cash flow increasing 14% to $893 million. 
With returns on invested capital in the teens on our subscriber investments, investing in growth makes sense for the business and our shareholders. New customers are generating higher ARPU, and we believe will stay with us longer, generating higher future cash flows. Some of this investment is transitional, such as higher Pulse take rates and Pulse upgrades. These will stabilize or decline over the few years, resulting in sizeable improvement in free cash flows. 
Slide 13 highlights our capital allocation and debt levels for the quarter. On a pro forma basis reflecting a full year for Protectron, leverage was 2.9x at quarter end. Q1 is a historically low cash flow period, and we reported -- repurchased, I'm sorry, 94 million of our shares during the quarter. The company raised $300 million of debt in the quarter, enabling us to pay down a portion of our revolving line of credit. Total debt increased by $158 million from year end. Overall, the company's total cost of borrowing was below 4% for the quarter, giving us the flexibility to invest in our business and customer growth, which continues to be the best use of capital for ADT. 
In Q1, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share, a 60% increase over last year, and announced a 5% increase to our quarterly dividend, effective with our next payment. We continue to be opportunistic when buying back shares and repurchased 2.9 million shares at an average price of $32.35 during the quarter, bringing the average diluted share count to 175 million. We have approximately $286 million remaining on the share buyback authorization, and we remain opportunistic when evaluating future buybacks. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Naren."

But this would clearly be more tied to the unit attrition. I hesitate to pick a specific quarter because you do get seasonality, both on the gross adds side as well on the disconnect side. So all I will say is that we're continuing to drive towards that. As you saw in the first quarter, we've narrowed that gap dramatically and I think the trends in both gross adds and in attrition, unit attrition, are very favorable.

And finally, I think the Pulse platform that we've developed and continue to build out are the reasons why people are coming to us and interested. And I think the big change over the past couple of years is our willingness to open up that platform and integrate other partners into that platform."

I mean, I think we -- look, the first quarter last year was not a strong quarter for SAC, but what we did indicate was it was also our lowest quarter for volumes. And there is an absorption issue in our business. When we take the cost in the organization that focuses on installing systems, that is part of SAC, so it's not a pure variable cost that's being allocated. So I think we have guided for SAC creation multiple, I should say, to be down for the year. We're down significantly in this quarter. Yes, we had a nice ride last year where sequentially, we continued to improve. But if you look at the results, sequentially, adds improved as the year went on as well. So going from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, this was probably the one metric that, sequentially, this metric had adds. You can't really compare as well, fourth quarter to first quarter, but we are -- I think the key with SAC is we're really just scratching the surface on our SAC productivity initiatives. 
We talked about rolling out the TS panel. We only rolled out 8,000 of our 260,000 adds this quarter. We're on TS, okay? That's going to accelerate and that, as we identified, had labor savings. 
I talked about the eContracts. We really just started to roll that out into small biz -- or into biz. And now it's being rolled out in the second quarter into resi as well. There's efficiencies there. We have other hardware and peripherals savings, too. 
So the initiatives that we have on track had some benefit in the first quarter. I think it will have a bigger benefit as the year goes on. And I think we feel that with the seasonality and all that stuff, we're off to a good start and feel good or better, our guidance, that we can bring this down for the year."

So I think as we look at it, it would require potentially a different business model or some different economics for those customers in order to bring them into the category or a much stronger value proposition. Clearly, Pulse, we think, because of home automation and security, brings a much higher value proposition, but it still has a pretty high upfront cost, and we still, as an industry, require multiyear contracts.

I mean, there's always going to be people moving from one household to the next. So we're always going to have disconnects tied to relocations. As we've discussed in the past, our goal was to recapture the house through resales and recapture that customer by doing a better job of following them. And I think we're making good progress there, but that doesn't necessarily impact the gross disconnect piece. 
The areas we can control is the voluntary and the non-pay. On the non-pay side, clearly, driving the incremental screening that we're doing will result in better quality customers who will stay with us longer. And then continuing to drive, and we're at a very high percentage of our new customers coming on auto pay or some type of easy pay solution there. 
So then it really comes down to the voluntary. And we've got 2 paths that we're pursuing aggressively on that. One is driving the Pulse upgrades, because as we talked about on this call and in the past, Pulse had better retention characteristics because customers are more engaged with their system, using it more frequently. And that's why we're pursuing both new Pulse customers as well as upgrades. And the other one is just continuing to improve our service levels. 
It's not as much on the monitoring side. I think when you look at our monitoring and response levels, they are very good: we -- the percentage of calls that we -- the speed at which we answer calls, our ability to work through the call list or dispatch immediately in life safety. It's more on the service side, making sure that we're staffed appropriately in our call centers, that our -- that we're driving more customer self-service on myadt.com. So it's a whole portfolio of programs that we're driving. 
And a piece of that is just a cultural transformation. And since we've been an independent company, we've been driving this mind-set around customer obsessions and the metrics around customer obsessions and driving more recognition and reward around delivering that great customer experience. So again, I don't know that I can sit here and say what the endgame looks like, because some of those other pieces are a little bit out of our control. But we still feel like we've got room ahead of us and we're going to continue to drive it aggressively."

So the creation multiple isn't that much different as you go up a level, but the total SAC is.

I mean -- and then there is the potential. The nice thing about TS, it's a stand-alone box. And  when people do leave us, we will be getting the boxes back, so there's a possibility of getting some contra SAC as well, recovering some of the equipment, which today, we don't generally do when we lose a customer. So that's a benefit that's not reflected in our numbers, but it's something -- hopefully, we don't lose these customers who are buying TSs, but it's something down the road that could also help the cost position."

I hope you had a chance to review our earnings press release we issued earlier this morning that highlights our results for the first quarter of 2015. This morning, I'll discuss our key performance highlights and accomplishments for the quarter, then Mike Geltzeiler will provide additional details on our financial and operational performance. 
As you can see from our results, we've continued the trends we saw in the second half of 2014, and we're off to a strong start to the new year, delivering another quarter of improved performance. Solid execution of our initiatives is driving stronger financial and operational results, and the investments we continue to make in our business are positioning us for future profitable revenue growth. All of our key customer metrics continued to move in the right direction during the quarter, as we take advantage of our industry-leading position and strong brand recognition. 
We remain excited about what we see in the business today and the evolution occurring in our industry that is creating even more opportunities for future growth. I'm proud of our team's performance this quarter, while recognizing the opportunity for an even brighter future. 
As we review our highlights for the quarter, I think it's important to look at our performance in the context of our strategy and against the backdrop of our rapidly evolving industry. We've made significant progress since becoming a stand-alone company a little over 2 years ago. This progress has accelerated over the past several quarters as we've begun to benefit from the initiatives that we have pursued to enhance our operations and competitive position, resulting in improvements in our performance. 
This quarter, we continued to invest in growth and strengthening our leadership team, all in support of our strategy to achieve our vision for ADT, a vision that's rooted in extending our leadership position in the security, life safety and home automation markets, enhancing the values of ADT's services and executing on our initiatives to drive strong returns. A common thread running throughout every aspect of our vision is creating a superior customer experience. The results from the actions we've taken are continuing to shine through in our results, giving us confidence that we're on the right path. 
As I've discussed on previous calls, I view the recent activity in our industry in 2 distinct areas: integrated professionally monitored security life safety and automation solutions, where ADT is traditionally focused, currently serving about 20% of households; and unmonitored or self-monitored stand-alone home automation solutions, where many new entrants, large and small, are focusing their efforts on the remaining 80% of households. The majority of these efforts are targeting a wide range of home automation applications with only a small portion addressing security and life safety. While our traditional market is more competitive than it was 5 years ago, the environment has been relatively stable, and we're continuing to win in this market, as evidenced by our improving operational and customer metrics and solid financial results. 
Slide 3 shows our strong performance over the past 12 months on 4 key metrics that are affected by the competitive environment. Over the past years, we have driven increases in gross adds in all lines of business and in our direct and dealer channels, improved customer retention by 120 basis points, increased the average price paid by newly added customers and reduced our creation multiple, or in other words, the cost we incur to bring on a new customer. I think this chart is the best evidence that we are winning in the market and our performance is accelerating. 
Specifically, for the first quarter, as highlighted on Slide 4, we drove double-digit gross subscriber growth with year-over-year increases in both our direct and authorized dealer channels for the first time since 2013, driven by stronger lead generation, increases in our self-generated business and improved close rates. Unit and revenue attrition continue to improve meaningfully versus prior year and sequentially as we reduced attrition to its lowest level since we became a public company. As a result of these improvements in gross adds and customer retention, we narrowed our net subscriber loss significantly and are focused on returning to growing net subscribers. From a financial perspective, our improved operational performance allowed us to deliver strong recurring revenue growth, increase EBITDA margins and bottom line results on a year-over-year basis. 
Because of the strong returns we drive in our business today and the many opportunities we see to generate profitable growth in the years ahead, we continue to invest in ADT's future, as shown on Slide 5. 
We're investing to enhance the customer experience by implementing new technologies and processes, including the rollout of a new electronic order management platform and the deployment of our new wireless Total Security panel. We're expanding our presence in the midsize commercial market and making investments in products and distribution to generate future growth through our health service offerings. We also added a new key leader to run our combined business in Canada and appointed a new board member from the technology sector, Chris Hylen of Citrix Systems. 
We're also continuing to invest in driving profitable growth through Pulse. Pulse continues to be an important driver behind our results. And in Q1, Pulse take rates increased as did Pulse upgrades. 
As you can see on Slide 6, over 53% of our total gross adds during the quarter were Pulse units, up from 51% last quarter and 37% a year ago. In our residential direct channel, the Pulse take rate for new and resale units was nearly 57%, up 15 percentage points over the same quarter last year. And 71% of all new residential customers added via our direct sales channel were Pulse customers. 
In our small business channel, the Pulse take rate was 50%, up 14 percentage points over the first quarter of last year. In our dealer channel, the Pulse take rate ramped to 50% from about 40% -- 47% last quarter and 29% last year. 
In addition to new system sales of Pulse, we upgraded about 31,000 existing customers this quarter. This is nearly double the number we did in the same period last year. Our Pulse upgrade efforts allow us to provide additional functionality to our existing customers and yield higher ARPU. 
In addition, these upgrades allow us to enter into new contracts with these customers and enhance the customer experience. I'm happy with the progress we're making in our operations and with the investments that we're making in our future. 
Before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to share some of my thoughts on the evolving landscape in our industry and some observations from the Consumer Electronics Show that took place earlier this month. 
At CES this year, the connected home and Internet of Things continued to gain significant traction. In fact, there was an entire venue dedicated to the connected home and IoT innovations, where ADT was well represented and traffic was very robust. The conference showcased several new technology companies, along with many of the biggest names in the consumer electronics industry, offering point solutions for the connected world and smart home. 
ADT's prominent presence at the event featured several of our products with a primary focus on Pulse. In fact, Pulse was recognized by Time Magazine as one of the 6 coolest smart home innovations at the show. 
Pulse was also featured in a CES keynote address by Brian Krzanich, the CEO of Intel, who demonstrated the integration of Pulse with Intel Security's True Key multifactor authentication to provide a new level of security and convenience for users. This jointly developed proof of concept was hailed by Brian as an example of how our IoT partnership can make a smart home also a safe home. At CES, we also showcased our new Total Security wireless panel for Pulse automation installations, which we rolled out last quarter and installed approximately 8,000 units during the quarter. 
What I saw at CES this year reinforced several thoughts on ADT's positioning for the future. First, much of the product innovation and many new point solutions are geared towards the 80% of the market, not reached or targeted by traditional professionally installed and monitored security and automation solutions. The growing interest in this segment is raising the awareness of and the growth opportunity for monitored security and home automation. 
Second, these self-monitored smart home solutions are not necessarily creating a safe home, as notifying and seeing are not the same as monitoring. Additionally, customers are growing wary of the large and growing number of apps needed to manage all the disparate devices in their home. Most customers prefer to have a single platform with an easy and unified customer experience to manage their connected home. 
Finally, a primary driver of consumer interest in smart home applications is security. This was reinforced by recent research conducted by several third parties, including Lowe's and the Consumer Electronics Association. I believe ADT is well positioned to capture additional growth in the future given our large customer base, trusted brand, robust monitoring infrastructure, strong field sales and installation force and fully developed Pulse platform. ADT is viewed as a partner of choice by many well-respected companies in the industry. I believe that ADT is in the right place, at the right time, with the right platform, services and products to capitalize on this opportunity to make homes and businesses both smart and safe. 
Now let me turn things over to Mike to provide some additional details on our financial and operational performance during the quarter."

Over the next few slides, I'll review our Q1 performance and highlight our accomplishments during the quarter. 
Slide 8 provides an overview of our GAAP and non-GAAP results. Recurring revenue grew 6.5% to $825 million and accounted for 93% of our total revenue, while total revenue rose 5.7%. When adjusting for the decline in the Canadian dollar, recurring revenue was up over 7% and total revenue increased by 6.4%. We remain focused on growing our business through a highly profitable recurring revenue model, continuing the trend you have seen in our historical results. 
We continue to integrate Protectron into our results as we recognized a full quarter of contribution in Q1. Protectron contributed over half of the recurring revenue growth in the period, but since it currently operates at a lower margin than the ADT business, the consolidation had a dilutive impact to EBITDA margins, increased our D&A and was neutral on EPS. 
EBITDA, before special items for the quarter, was $453 million, up 6% or $27 million over prior year. The weak Canadian dollar diluted this growth by $1.5 million. This translated to an EBITDA margin of 51.1%, an increase of 30 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the dilutive impact of Protectron, EBITDA margins before special items increased by nearly 100 basis points from last year. Year-over-year recurring revenue growth, combined with our cost efficiency initiatives, drove the increase in our margins. 
Cost to serve was up 6% due primarily to the consolidation of Protectron. However, without Protectron, cost-to-serve expenses were flat with last year despite a higher mix of Pulse subscribers, additional investments in customer experience and launching our commercial business. 
GAAP EPS was $0.41 a share, which includes special items and a tax rate in the quarter of 33.3%. Excluding special items, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.51, up 19% from Q1 2014. Using our Q1 cash tax rate of 4.6%, our earnings per share before special items was $0.73 for the quarter, up 11% over last year. 
The chart also details our special items for the quarter. In Q1, we accelerated the conversion of 2G radio customers, successfully converting 113,000 customers, a portion of which we were able to up-sell to ADT Pulse. We also incurred a minor level of integration expenses related to Protectron acquisition as well as some restructuring charges. 
Activity to integrate Protectron will accelerate following the recent appointment of a new President for our combined Canadian operations. Our 2G conversion program will continue through 2016. We are comfortably ahead of plan and are opportunistically balancing this program against resource availability and customer demand. 
Turning to the operating levers. Slide 9 shows strong gross add growth and increases in average revenue per unit for Q1 versus the prior year. Total company gross adds increased over 13% year-over-year, driven by improved performance in our direct and dealer channels as well as across our residential business and health units. 
Gross adds in our direct channel were up 10%, marking the first time we've experienced year-over-year growth since 2013. The increase in gross additions was due to stronger lead generation, higher close rates and greater self-generated sales. Protectron accounted for about 20% of the growth rate in the direct channel. 
New subscriber growth was accomplished despite the headwinds caused by our fully implemented enhanced credit screening procedures, which management estimates filtered out about 4,000 potential sales. We expect this enhanced processed to improve further -- future attrition by filtering credit-challenged customers into different payment plans, which allows us to focus on profitable growth. 
Gross adds in our dealer channel rose 19% from last year as we experienced higher sales from existing dealers, added some new dealers and benefited from the dealer volume production of Protectron. Returning dealer volumes to growth was a 2014 priority, which we accomplished in Q4. We are very pleased with our partners, delivering 100,000 customer adds for Q1, a 16,000 increase over Q1 2014. 
Our ability to grow ARPU shows that pricing remains healthy in our business. Our continued investment in ADT Pulse, combined with incremental service offerings, like small business bundles and hosted video, have helped drive higher revenue per user. 
For the quarter, new and resale ARPU was $47.28, an increase of 5% over the prior year, and ARPU for our overall customer base was $41.76, an increase of 2% year-over-year. As a reminder, Protectron generates lower ARPU than our traditional base in the U.S., which diluted the overall year-over-year growth figure as did the weaker Canadian dollar. Excluding Protectron, ARPU rose 4% over last year. 
Over the course of the last year, we launched a number of initiatives designed to improve the customer experience and increase customer retention. Our results on Slide 10 show that these initiatives are paying off as we improved attrition for the third consecutive quarter and reduced it to its lowest level since becoming a public company. 
Q1 trailing 12-month net revenue attrition was 13.0%, a sequential improvement of 50 basis points and a significant reduction of 120 basis points versus Q1 prior year. Unit attrition, which measures customer attrition for just our residential and business customers, was 12.9% for the quarter, a 30-basis-point improvement versus Q4 and 70 basis points lower than last year. Our focus on enhancing the customer experience, reducing nonpay disconnections and increasing resales, coupled with stable existing home sales, contributed to lower attrition. 
The key to driving higher recurring revenues is increasing average revenue per customer through new offerings, greater automation and price escalations, all of which we are executing well, as well as growing the subscriber base. For the past 2 years, we have grown our subscriber base primarily as a result of M&A. Organically, we reported a net subscriber loss of over 100,000 customers in 2014. As we progress our dual goals of growing gross adds and lowering attrition, we are positioning the company towards its ultimate objective of organic net subscriber growth. 
In the first quarter, we reported a decline in our customer base of 8,000 subscribers. However, this compares favorably to Q1 2014, where we lost 48,000 customers. This is a major step forward and bodes well for future revenue growth. 
Slide 11 shows recurring revenue margin and SAC. For the quarter, recurring revenue margin on our existing customer base was 66.4%, up 10 basis points versus prior year. The current quarter included investments in our commercial expansion and health business, the dilutive effect of consolidating Protectron and inefficiency from the Tyco separation. Excluding Protectron, recurring revenue margins would have been 67%, an increase of 70 basis points. As I mentioned earlier, cost-to-serve expense is flat with last year on higher revenues. 
We continue to make progress in driving down customer acquisition costs and lowering our overall net creation multiple despite higher Pulse take rates, which require a larger upfront investment. Excluding the impact of Pulse upgrades, our combined net creation multiple improved by 0.7x to 31.7 in Q1, while the net creation multiple in our direct channel fell to 31.9x, a 2.1x improvement from last year. As a reminder, the first quarter has historically been our highest level of SAC, mostly due to absorption issues, and it's the lowest quarter of volumes. 
Average net SAC, excluding upgrades for our direct channel, was about $1,500 per unit, which was actually below the same figure last year despite the increased sales of more expensive Pulse and automation units. This was possible because of productivity improvements, marketing savings and hardware efficiencies. 
In the quarter, we began deploying our new Total Security panel for new Pulse automation customers, continued our implementation of electronic contracts and delivered on our cost efficiency programs. ADT Business has now rolled out eContracts nationally and resi will do the same in February. 
As mentioned earlier, we are investing in our business, in customer growth, Pulse, commercial expansion, health and customer experience, all in order to build a stronger and more profitable subscriber base. On Slide 12, we detail the components of free cash flow for the quarter. Cash flow from operations, before special items, was up 14% from last year to $390 million. The increase in operating cash flow is driven by past investments, our improved financial and operational performance in the quarter and improvements in working capital management. This 14% growth is despite a $25 million year-over-year increase in cash interest expense, a large portion of which arose from debt issued to buy back our shares. While the interest burden on higher debt levels impact free cash flow, the company's cash flows are benefited by 27% fewer shares outstanding. 
Capital expenditures before special items for the quarter were $344 million, up from $274 million last year, of which 94% of the CapEx invested during the quarter was used for driving increases in new subscriber adds, including increases in Pulse customers and upgrades. Direct channel subscriber CapEx increased by 13%, reflecting a 10% increase in gross adds, higher Pulse penetration and Pulse upgrade increasing from 17,000 to 31,000 year-over-year. Our dealer channel saw CapEx increase by 33%, attributed to a 19% increase in gross adds, the inclusion of Protectron and significantly higher Pulse take rates. 
Factoring all of this, including the investment in new subscribers, free cash flow before special items for the quarter was $46 million. And as shown at the bottom of the chart, the improvement in the drivers of our businesses has led to stronger pre-SAC EBITDA, resulting in steady-state free cash flow increasing 14% to $893 million. 
With returns on invested capital in the teens on our subscriber investments, investing in growth makes sense for the business and our shareholders. New customers are generating higher ARPU, and we believe will stay with us longer, generating higher future cash flows. Some of this investment is transitional, such as higher Pulse take rates and Pulse upgrades. These will stabilize or decline over the few years, resulting in sizeable improvement in free cash flows. 
Slide 13 highlights our capital allocation and debt levels for the quarter. On a pro forma basis reflecting a full year for Protectron, leverage was 2.9x at quarter end. Q1 is a historically low cash flow period, and we reported -- repurchased, I'm sorry, 94 million of our shares during the quarter. The company raised $300 million of debt in the quarter, enabling us to pay down a portion of our revolving line of credit. Total debt increased by $158 million from year end. Overall, the company's total cost of borrowing was below 4% for the quarter, giving us the flexibility to invest in our business and customer growth, which continues to be the best use of capital for ADT. 
In Q1, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share, a 60% increase over last year, and announced a 5% increase to our quarterly dividend, effective with our next payment. We continue to be opportunistic when buying back shares and repurchased 2.9 million shares at an average price of $32.35 during the quarter, bringing the average diluted share count to 175 million. We have approximately $286 million remaining on the share buyback authorization, and we remain opportunistic when evaluating future buybacks. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Naren."

Over the past year, there have been a lot of questions about ADT's ability to compete against a variety of new companies who have shown interest in the residential security and automation market.

We're excited about our strong start to the year and the progress we are making in achieving our goals for 2015. 
As shown on Slide 14, we're making solid progress towards achieving our goals for the coming year, with both our financial and operational results tracking well to our previously issued guidance. Rest assured that we are not resting on our laurels as we understand we need to continue to raise the bar and accelerate our efforts to innovate, grow, become more efficient, and most importantly, enhance the customer experience every day. Our entire leadership team is excited about the challenges and the opportunities that we see in this incredibly dynamic market, and I remain confident our best days are still ahead of us.

But this would clearly be more tied to the unit attrition. I hesitate to pick a specific quarter because you do get seasonality, both on the gross adds side as well on the disconnect side. So all I will say is that we're continuing to drive towards that. As you saw in the first quarter, we've narrowed that gap dramatically and I think the trends in both gross adds and in attrition, unit attrition, are very favorable.

And there is an absorption issue in our business. When we take the cost in the organization that focuses on installing systems, that is part of SAC, so it's not a pure variable cost that's being allocated. So I think we have guided for SAC creation multiple, I should say, to be down for the year. We're down significantly in this quarter. Yes, we had a nice ride last year where sequentially, we continued to improve. But if you look at the results, sequentially, adds improved as the year went on as well. So going from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, this was probably the one metric that, sequentially, this metric had adds. You can't really compare as well, fourth quarter to first quarter, but we are -- I think the key with SAC is we're really just scratching the surface on our SAC productivity initiatives. We talked about rolling out the TS panel. We only rolled out 8,000 of our 260,000 adds this quarter. We're on TS, okay? That's going to accelerate and that, as we identified, had labor savings. I talked about the eContracts. We really just started to roll that out into small biz -- or into biz. And now it's being rolled out in the second quarter into resi as well. There's efficiencies there. We have other hardware and peripherals savings, too. So the initiatives that we have on track had some benefit in the first quarter. I think it will have a bigger benefit as the year goes on.

I mean, we're referring back to kind of on average, it's in the teens. I think you're on the right track. I think as Naren said, we're trying to stay grounded here. But if Pulse, indeed, does help customers that, on average, stay with us 7 years move out to an eighth or ninth year, those returns would be probably in the 20s. So but we're not ready to call that yet, but we're comfortable to say that kind of using historic customer lives and customer experience, coupled with what we're investing and what it costs us to monitor, an on-average kind of consolidating the business, that mid-teens is the expression I use. But yes, again, I think that's something in the Investor Day we'll probably provide more detail on the various sources of customer adds. But you're absolutely correct, if attrition curves do turn out to be better for Pulse customers, that return will increase."

So I think as we look at it, it would require potentially a different business model or some different economics for those customers in order to bring them into the category or a much stronger value proposition. Clearly, Pulse, we think, because of home automation and security, brings a much higher value proposition, but it still has a pretty high upfront cost, and we still, as an industry, require multiyear contracts.

I mean, there's always going to be people moving from one household to the next. So we're always going to have disconnects tied to relocations. As we've discussed in the past, our goal was to recapture the house through resales and recapture that customer by doing a better job of following them. And I think we're making good progress there, but that doesn't necessarily impact the gross disconnect piece. The areas we can control is the voluntary and the non-pay. On the non-pay side, clearly, driving the incremental screening that we're doing will result in better quality customers who will stay with us longer. And then continuing to drive, and we're at a very high percentage of our new customers coming on auto pay or some type of easy pay solution there. So then it really comes down to the voluntary. And we've got 2 paths that we're pursuing aggressively on that. One is driving the Pulse upgrades, because as we talked about on this call and in the past, Pulse had better retention characteristics because customers are more engaged with their system, using it more frequently. And that's why we're pursuing both new Pulse customers as well as upgrades. And the other one is just continuing to improve our service levels. It's not as much on the monitoring side. I think when you look at our monitoring and response levels, they are very good: we -- the percentage of calls that we -- the speed at which we answer calls, our ability to work through the call list or dispatch immediately in life safety. It's more on the service side, making sure that we're staffed appropriately in our call centers, that our -- that we're driving more customer self-service on myadt.com. So it's a whole portfolio of programs that we're driving. And a piece of that is just a cultural transformation. And since we've been an independent company, we've been driving this mind-set around customer obsessions and the metrics around customer obsessions and driving more recognition and reward around delivering that great customer experience. So again, I don't know that I can sit here and say what the endgame looks like, because some of those other pieces are a little bit out of our control. But we still feel like we've got room ahead of us and we're going to continue to drive it aggressively."

Let me begin by reminding everyone that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future performance, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings release, which we filed to the SEC in an 8-K report, and in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 27, 2015, which we expect to file with the SEC later today.
In our second quarter 2015 earnings release and slides, which are now posted on our website at adt.com and on our Investor Relations app, we have provided a reconciliation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.

I hope you had a chance to review our earnings press release we issued earlier this morning that highlights our results for the second quarter of 2015. This morning, I'll discuss our key performance highlights and accomplishments for the quarter then Mike Geltzeiler will provide additional details on our financial and operational performance.
As you can see from our results, we continue to build on the trends that we have seen over the past year, delivering another quarter of improved year-over-year performance. Strong execution of our initiatives, along with our focus on quality growth, yield solid operational and financial results. We continue to drive gross add -- growth year-over-year in both our direct and dealer channels while our key customer metrics continue to move in the right direction, highlighted by a significant improvement in customer retention. 
We continue to make smart investments in our business, positioning us for future profitable revenue growth and free cash flow generation. Overall, our performance this quarter shows that we are widening the gap and extending our leadership position in the industry, an industry we believe is creating even more opportunities for future growth. As I have in the past, I will discuss our results in the context of our approach for achieving our vision for ADT. 
Our approach is focused on 3 areas: one, driving quality subscriber growth and improving the customer experience; two, executing on operational initiatives to deliver strong financial returns; and three, investing in our business to achieve profitable growth and strong free cash flow generation in the future. The results of these actions that we've taken are continuing to shine through in our results, reinforcing that we are on the right path and despite a market landscape that is more competitive than it was 5 years ago, we are continuing to win in the market.
Evidence of our competitive strength can be seen on Slide 3, which shows our performance over the past 12 months against 4 key metrics that are impacted by the competitive environment. Year-over-year, we have delivered increases in gross adds across all lines of business in both our direct and authorized dealer channels, improve customer retention by 170 basis points, increased the average price paid by newly added customers by nearly 5% and reduced our creation multiple, which reflects the payback period for newly generated accounts. I believe this chart provides the best evidence that we are extending our leadership position while improving business performance. 
Specifically for the second quarter as highlighted on Slide 4, we grew gross subscriber additions by 8% excluding bulks with year-over-year increases in both our direct and authorized dealer channels. We accomplished this despite a more stringent customer screening efforts in our direct sales channel, filtering out low-quality prospects. Continued solid lead generation increased self-generated business and strong close rates for phone and field sales all contributed to our growth. 
Our focus on quality customer growth and our investments in improving the customer experience have led to unit and revenue attrition once again reaching new lows since he became a public company. Unit revenue attrition both reached 12.5% in the quarter driven by declines in nonpay and voluntary disconnects and increases in resale activities. These improvements helped offset an increase in relocation disconnects, resulting from improvements in the housing market. 
As a result of the improvement in customer attention and solid gross ad performance, we narrowed our net customer loss significantly with a loss of less than 3,000 customers versus 30,000 a year ago, bringing us closer to our goal of returning to net subscriber growth. 
From a financial perspective, despite the impact of the weaker Canadian dollar, our improved operational performance allowed us to deliver strong year-over-year growth in recurring revenue and pre-SAC EBITDA before special items. Our EBITDA and EPS results for the quarter include about $11 million or $0.04 a share in incremental costs for the first half of the year related to a change in how we account for dealer payments for leads generated through a marketing efficiency program. Mike will provide more details on the accounting for this program in a few minutes. 
I would like to reinforce that this effort was part of a major initiative to dramatically improve the efficiency of our online lead generation efforts. ADT, in conjunction with a few of our dealers, have collectively reduced the cost per click in paid search by 80% through this program.
Moving onto Slide 5 because of the opportunity to drive strong returns in our business today and the additional opportunities we see to generate profitable growth in the years ahead, we continue to invest in ADT's future. We're investing to enhance the customer experience by implementing new technologies and processes, including the rollout of a new electronic order management platform and the deployment of our new wireless Total Security panel. In support of our customer service improvement efforts, this quarter, we invested to reduce the meantime to repair and install systems for our customers. We believe these investments will yield future improvements in customer satisfaction and ultimately result in better retention. 
We are also continuing to expand our presence in the small business and midsized commercial markets. Our small business channel continues to exhibit very strong growth as we're now pursuing a larger footprint opportunities in this market, as evidenced by nearly 10% recurring revenue growth year-over-year in the U.S. and a 13% increase in gross adds. In the commercial market, we've expanded our sales force and our product portfolio to position us to better serve midsized commercial customers, allowing us to close nearly 400 new sales including our first national account customers. 
In the health market, we launched new products and distribution channels to generate future growth. During the second quarter, we launched our new on-the-go mobile first product, an easy-to-use wearable device equipped with fall detection and GPS capabilities, which operates on a leading nation-wide cellular network, connecting customers to a specially trained team of ADT health employees in our monitoring centers. We also established new retail distribution channels to drive future growth. As a result, our health channel has begun to exhibit accelerated growth with gross adds up nearly 20% and new customer ARPU up 12% during the quarter. 
We're also continuing to invest in Pulse, our interactive service platform. Pulse continues to be an important driver between -- behind our results and in Q2, Pulse take rates and Pulse upgrades both increased year-over-year.
On Slide 6, you can see that over 55% of our total gross ads during the quarter were Pulse units up from 43% a year ago. In our residential direct channel, the Pulse take rate for new and resale units was 60%, while 73% of all new residential customers added via this channel were Pulse customers. In our dealer channel, the Pulse take rate ramped up to 52% from about 36% last year and in our small business channel, the Pulse take rate was 47%, up nearly 10 percentage points over the second quarter of last year. In addition to new system sales of Pulse, we upgraded about 32,000 existing customers this summer, which is in line with previous quarter and up from 18,000 last year. Pulse upgrades allow us to provide additional services to our existing customers and yield higher ARPU. In addition, these upgrades allow us to enhance the customer experience and enter into new contracts. We now have approximately 1.2 million Pulse customers representing about 19% of ADT's customer base at quarter-end.
I'm happy with the progress we're making in our operations and the investments we're making in the future, and look forward to sharing more details with you during our Analyst and Investor Day meeting, scheduled for May 14 in Fort Lauderdale Florida.
Now let me turn things over to Mike to provide some additional details on our financial and operational performance during the quarter."

As Naren mentioned, we delivered another quarter of improved financial and operational results. This is our formula for success. Execute on the 5 operating leverage in our core businesses to drive higher recurring revenue and pre-SAC EBITDA, while at the same time, reinvest a portion of our cash flows and profits and improving customer experience, launching new businesses like commercial and new services and health, increasing Pulse penetration and adding new products and services, all of which will generate future cash flows and incremental profitability, benefiting both our customers and shareholders. 
We also remain committed to delivering against our 2015 guidance. I'm pleased to report that we are updating our guidance favorably versus earlier guidance, which I will address later in my remarks. As we look towards the second half of the year, we will continue to invest in creating new partnerships as we open our platform to expand our services to target the large market opportunity that currently doesn't purchase home security and automation services, expand our health and commercial businesses as well as integrate our Canadian businesses. Over the next few slides I will review our Q2 performance and highlight our accomplishments during the quarter.
Slide 7 provides an overview of our GAAP and non-GAAP results. Recurring revenue, which accounts for 93% of our total revenue, grew 7.2% to $829 million while total revenue increased by 6.3%. When adjusting for the Canadian dollar, which declined by 11% versus last year, recurring revenue was up 7.8% and total revenue increased by 6.8%. We report the FX impact only on ADT Canada since Protectron was not in the portfolio this time last year. However, including Protectron, Canada represents almost 10% of our total company revenues and the currency impact versus the start of this year when we gave guidance at nearly 13%.
Our business remains strong and we are focused on growing to a highly profitable recurring revenue model, continuing the trend you have seen in our historical results. The best metrics to gauge this growth are recurring revenue, pre-SAC EBITDA and steady-state free cash flow. Despite lower SAC, we still incur investment when adding new customers during the first year and dilutive to EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow before turning favorable beginning in year 2.
In Q2, Protectron contributed slightly more than half of the recurring revenue growth. Protectron currently operates at a lower margin on ADT, so the consolidation had a dilutive impact on our financial results. EBITDA before special items for the quarter was $444 million, up 3% or $13 million over prior year, excluding a $2 million impact from the weak Canadian dollar, and resulting EBITDA margins before special items for the quarter of 49.9%. Second quarter EBITDA before special items includes a negative impact of approximately $11 million pretax related to a change in how we account for dealer payments for lead generated marketing efficiency program. Roughly half of this amount is related to the first quarter.
With this accounting change and the addition of Protectron, EBITDA margins compressed 160 basis points relative to last year. However, otherwise it would've been flat on prior year at 51.5%. Cost-to-serve was up 10% due primarily to the consolidation of Protectron as well as plan spending increases to improve customer service levels and investments to launch our commercial business. Excluding Protectron, cost-to-serve expenses were less than 5% over last year despite the higher mix of Pulse customers. 
GAAP EPS was up nearly 18% to $0.40 a share including special items, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.47, which also includes the impact of $0.04 per share related to the incremental cost recognizing the income statement associated with the change in how we're accounting for dealer payments for leads through the marketing efficiency program. Using our Q2 cash tax rate of 4%, our diluted earnings per share before special items was $0.67 for the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 33%.
The chart also details our special items for the quarter. In Q2, we continue to make progress on our 2G radio conversion project, upgrading 82,000 customers, a portion of which we were able to upsell to ADT Pulse. As we have previously communicated, this project will continue through 2016 and we are comfortably ahead of our plan. We also incurred $2 million of restructuring charges.
Now I'd like to give you some additional color on the marketing efficiency program we discussed and the impact of the change in the way we are accounting for this effort. As part of our cost efficiency program, we initiated an effort with selected dealers to significantly optimize our paid search activities. This included centralizing paid search lead generation efforts at ADT and illuminating the scenario in which we would essentially bid up the search prices with our dealers.
Participating dealers pay a fee to ADT for their share of the leads. The program has been a huge success, saving tens of millions of dollars in search fees and reducing the cost per click by over 80%. We previously reported the fees we received from the dealers as a marketing expense, mitigating the incremental marketing expense incurred by ADT. However in Q2, we began to account for these payments as an offset to the amounts we paid dealers for customer accounts. 
The impact of the change resulted in an increase in marketing expense that we recognized in the income statement with an offsetting reduction in the capital expenditures incurred for dealer generated customer accounts. The exchange does not affect SAC, net creation multiples pre-SAC EBITDA, future returns or cash flow. What this does affect is the timing of expense recognition as marketing expenses are period costs whereby customer acquisition costs phase into the P&L over time. Therefore with this change, in the quarter, we recognize approximately $11 million pretax or $0.04 per share in EPS terms of additional expense in the income statement of which about half is attributable to Q1. 
Accordingly, we also recognize lower capital spending for dealer accounts on the same amount. This program will continue in the future due to its success. In the second half of the year, we expect to recognize approximately $30 million of incremental marketing expenses on this initiative with a corresponding offsetting in capital spending for dealer accounts and a modest improvement in D&A.
Turning to the operating leverage, Slide 8 shows another quarter of strong year-over-year growth in both gross ads and revenue per unit. Total company gross ads, excluding bulk purchase last year increased over 8% year-over-year, driven by improved performance across our residential, business and health channels. Our gross ads in our direct channel were up 9% despite the headwinds caused by our enhanced credit screening, which management estimates filtered out about 5,000 potential sales. We expect this enhanced process to continue to favorably impact attrition by filtering out credit challenge customers. 
Gross ads in our dealer channel, excluding bulks, rose 7% from last year as we experienced higher sales from existing dealers and benefited from Protectron dealer channel production. We are also -- we are pleased with the performance of our dealer channel year-to-date as they have now delivered year-over-year growth for the third consecutive quarter. Pricing remains healthy as demonstrated by our ability to continue to grow ARPU. The success of Pulse expanded service offerings in our business channel and the launch of our premium priced on-the-go emergency response system in our health channels, have all helped drive higher revenue per user over the past year. 
For the quarter, new and resale ARPU was $48.18, an increase of nearly 5% over the prior year and ARPU for our overall customer base was $41.98, up nearly 2%. Adjusting for Protectron's lower average ARPU, the average ARPU was actually up 4%. Our priority over the past year has been to improve the customer experience and increase customer retention. We have launched several initiatives to reduce attrition and the results on Slide 9 show that these initiatives are paying off. We improved attrition for the fourth consecutive quarter and are operating considerably below our guidance of less than 13%. 
Q2 trailing 12-month net revenue attrition was 12.5%, sequential improvement of 50 basis points and a significant reduction of 170 basis points versus Q2 of last year. Unit attrition, which measures customer attrition for just our residential and business customers, was 12.5% for the quarter, a 40% -- a 40 basis point improvement versus Q1 and 120 basis points lower than last year. We remain focused on enhancing the customer experience, reducing nonpaid disconnections and increasing resales, which all contribute to reducing attrition. 
As Naren mentioned, for Q2, we reported a decline in our customer base of less than 3,000 subscribers, which compares favorably to last year when we lost 30,000 customers. For the first half of the year, we had a net subscriber churn of just over 10,000 customers versus nearly 80,000 in the first half of last year. We grew subscribers in ADT Business and in health by reporting only a modest decline in residential customers.
Moving onto Slide 10, which shows our quarterly results for the current revenue margin SAC. For the quarter, recurring revenue margin on our existing customer base was 65.7% down 90 basis points versus prior year, driven by increased spent to improve our customer service levels, growth investments and the impact of Protectron. The dilutive effect of consolidating Protectron alone impact the recurring revenue margins by 50 basis points versus last year. Despite higher Pulse take rates which exceeds 55% and require a large upfront investment, we continue to reduce customer acquisition costs and lower net creation multiples. 
Excluding the impact of Pulse upgrades, our combined net ratio multiple improved by 0.9x to 31.2x in Q2, while the net creation multiple in our direct channel fell to 31.5x at 2.4x improvement from last year. Dealer net creation multiples were 30.6x. Excluding the impact of upgrades, net SAC in our direct channel was 1500 -- $1,519 per installed, lower by just over $40 per unit from last year despite the increase in Pulse mix. This reduction is a clear indication of our success with the launch of several productivity initiatives such as our new e-contract platform and implementation of new hardware such as the TS panel to drive efficiency during the installation process. In the quarter, we installed about 26,000 TS panels in our direct channel.
In a recurring revenue subscription business like ours, the best long-term measure for cash flow is steady-state free cash flow, as this calculation measures the free cash flow generated by maintaining the recurring revenue from our existing customer base and excludes the incremental investment required to grow -- from adding new subscribers. One of the key drivers in this calculation is the SAC per customer required to replace lost RMR due to attrition. As you can see, the initiatives we implemented had allowed us to begin stabilizing our creation multiples and the net investment to acquire new customer is now approximately $1,500 in our direct channel. The actual SAC per subscriber is declining. 
When you combine the reduction in SAC with our improvement in attrition, yon gain a sense of the levels of cash that we could generate by simply maintaining our current recurring revenue. Steady-state free cash flow for Q2 was $940 million, up nearly 20% over prior year. The improvement is attributed to 170 basis point reduction in attrition, lower SAC and higher pre-SAC EBITDA. 
On Slide 12, we detailed the components of free cash flow for the quarter. In order to highlight the value drivers of our business, we developed this chart to segment our free cash flow and to the cash we generate from existing customers and the cash we attributed to new subscriber acquisition. As I mentioned, pre-SAC EBITDA was up driven by the strong operational performance in the past investments we made in adding high-paying Pulse customers. This was somewhat offset this quarter by some timing issues and working capital mostly from the prior quarter. 
Our results also include a 10% year-over-year increase in cash interest expense driven by the debt issued to fund our share buyback program, which is reduced shares outstanding by 26% since its inception. All in, our pre-SAC free cash flow from existing customers was $501 million in the quarter, up $13 million compared to the previous year. Investing in subscriber growth is the main driver behind our ability to generate free cash flow as our spend in acquiring new customers impacts both our P&L and cash flow statement. 94% of our total CapEx spend this quarter was driven by our investments in new customers. 
In Q2, our SAC spending before special items was $402 million, up about 10% on prior year, which includes both the P&L cost like marketing and capital spending on account acquisition. The largest driver of the increased SAC spending was a 7-plus-percent growth in new subscriber adds as well as an increase in Pulse upgrades from 18,000 to 32,000 year-over-year. Our dealer channel saw CapEx increase as well, however, driven by 7% increase in gross ads, inclusion of Protectron and significantly higher Pulse take rates. Dealer CapEx was favorably impacted, $11 million by the accounting change. 
Factoring in all of this, free cash flow before special items for the quarter was $99 million versus $46 million in the first quarter and $121 million a year ago. We will discuss cash flow trends in our upcoming Investor Day. We are optimistic that free cash flow will increase despite further investments in the business, as we benefit from higher new customer ARPU, favorable attrition trends and productivity improvements in hardware and installation. Investment drivers due to higher Pulse take rates and Pulse upgrades are transitional, which we expect to stabilize a decline over the next few years.
Slide 13 highlights our capital allocation and debt levels for the quarter. Trailing 12-month leverage was 2.9x. Overall, the company fell across the bar, remain below 4% for Q2, giving us the flexibility to invest in our business and customer growth, which continues to be the best use of capital for ADT. We also paid a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share, a 5% increase over last year. In addition to paying a higher dividend, we continue to be opportunistic on our share buybacks and repurchased 1.3 million shares for $44 million, increasing our year-to-date repurchases to 4.2 million shares at an average price of $32.91 per share. For 2014 and 2015 combined, our average purchase price on 39 million shares was $37.90 per share. The repurchases this quarter help us bring the average diluted share count to 172 million, a 26% reduction from inception. We have approximately $243 million remaining on the share buyback authorization and we remain opportunistic when evaluating future buybacks.
Slide 14 shows our updated guidance. When we gave recurring revenue and EBITDA guidance at the end of fiscal 2014, the Canadian dollar stood at $0.91. We ended the quarter sub $0.80, a drop of about 13%. That said, we are increasing our guidance for recurring revenue and providing both a reported and constant dollar view. Even despite the negative FX, we have increased the range to the high-end of our guidance on a reported basis, which includes the current exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, we believe our recurring revenue growth will exceed 6%.
We're introducing pre-SAC EBITDA guidance -- as a guidance measure because as discussed earlier, we believe it is a more accurate measure to evaluate our performance. A portion of SAC that is expense versus capitalized varies dramatically based on the source of a new customer. This is highlighted by the impact discussed earlier on the accounts acquired from our dealers that participate in the marketing efficiency program. By focusing on pre-SAC EBITDA, we removed this variability and provide better insight into the business. 
On a reported basis, we believe pre-SAC EBITDA growth will be in a range of $80 million to $100 million and over $100 million on a constant currency basis. In adding pre-SAC EBITDA guidance, we made a decision to have this replace EBITDA guidance. We, of course, will continue to report EBITDA throughout the year, but will no longer be providing guidance to this result. To date this year, without the impact of the accounting change we discussed earlier, EBITDA is up $71 million -- $51 million and progressing well despite the negative currency towards our prior guidance.
In terms of attrition, we are currently favorable to our year-end goal of sub 13% net unit of attrition. We now expect year-end attrition to be in the mid-12% range. Lastly, we confirm guidance of steady-state free cash flow on an exchange neutral basis will be above $1 billion by year-end.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Naren."

So I think that answers the question. We think we can get to subscriber growth on an annualized basis because we are growing ads and we think in the 12% attrition level, we can get to subscriber growth and we're not predicting per se that's going to happen next quarter or the quarter after, but going forward, as we continue to grow ads and we can keep attrition even at these levels, we think we can get this revenue, it wouldn't go lower and lead to more growth."

A customer is paying a $48 in both channels on average, so the cash on cash returns are the same, the ROI is the same, he knows the economics we got to be focusing on and that's why pre-sac EBITDA is really the cleanest and it's used by a lot of people in our industry because it really takes out all the SAC. We were taking out much of the SAC, but not the marketing cost of the SAC by using EBITDA. Now we're taking it all. By the way, we're going to continue to report EBITDA so we're not, not reporting EBITDA, but I think pre-sac EBITDA is a better figure to guide on."

And so on the service side, we want to make sure that if you got a service need we can one, do as much of the fix remotely and while that helps us from a productivity perspective, it also helps the customers so that waiting for a service text. So a lot more self-service there, for example, batteries will ship them to you, you can install them yourself. And then when you do need to roll a truck, we want to make sure we can get a truck there in a timely manner. So some of the investments that we made this quarter, were to get to our mean time to repair down to what we felt was an appropriate level. We think it got a little bit higher than where we wanted it to be and we made a one-time investment to get them back in line, so like with attrition, Jeff, there's no single silver bullet that drives the customer experience.

I think when we're looking at the burglar alarm, which is where many of the false alarms tend to be, again, there's a lot of best practices across the industry, many led by ADT, but looking for multiple technologies. People who do have Pulse can get that earlier alarm signal on their own because there's no delay built into the panel by code. You can get early notification and make and react to make those changes in parallel with us, and we are looking at video verification. We're looking more on the commercial side right now because I think we're still getting a lot of customer resistance about others being able to look into their cameras and things like that. So I think Jeff, we're staying on top of both the technology trends as well as the policy trends.

We've rolled out on the ADT side a little later in Canada than we did in the U.S., so we're still playing a little bit of catch-up there.

Thank you for joining our call today. I hope you had a chance to review our earnings press release we issued earlier this morning that highlights our results for the second quarter of 2015.

I hope you had a chance to review our earnings press release we issued earlier this morning that highlights our results for the second quarter of 2015. This morning, I'll discuss our key performance highlights and accomplishments for the quarter, then Mike Geltzeiler will provide additional details on our financial and operational performance.
As you can see from our results, we continue to build on the trends that we have seen over the past year, delivering another quarter of improved year-over-year performance. Strong execution of our initiatives, along with our focus on quality growth, yielded solid operational and financial results. We continue to drive gross add growth year-over-year in both our direct and dealer channels, while our key customer metrics continue to move in the right direction, highlighted by a significant improvement in customer retention.
We continue to make smart investments in our business, positioning us for future profitable revenue growth and free cash flow generation. Overall, our performance this quarter shows that we are widening the gap and extending our leadership position in the industry, an industry we believe is creating even more opportunities for future growth. As I have in the past, I will discuss our results in the context of our approach for achieving our vision for ADT.
Our approach is focused on 3 areas: One, driving quality subscriber growth and improving the customer experience; two, executing on operational initiatives to deliver strong financial returns; and three, investing in our business to achieve profitable growth and strong free cash flow generation in the future. The results of these actions that we've taken are continuing to shine through in our results, reinforcing that we are on the right path. And despite a market landscape that is more competitive than it was 5 years ago, we are continuing to win in the market.
Evidence of our competitive strength can be seen on Slide 3, which shows our performance over the past 12 months against 4 key metrics that are impacted by the competitive environment. Year-over-year, we have delivered increases in gross adds across all lines of business in both our direct and authorized dealer channels, improved customer retention by 170 basis points, increased the average price paid by newly added customers by nearly 5% and reduced our creation multiple, which reflects the payback period for newly generated accounts. I believe this chart provides the best evidence that we are extending our leadership position while improving business performance.
Specifically for the second quarter, as highlighted on Slide 4, we grew gross add -- gross subscriber additions by 8%, excluding bulks, with year-over-year increases in both our direct and authorized dealer channels. We accomplished this despite more stringent customer screening efforts in our direct sales channel, filtering out low-quality prospects. Continued solid lead generation, increased self-generated business and strong close rates for phone and field sales all contributed to our growth.
Our focus on quality customer growth and our investments in improving the customer experience have led to unit and revenue attrition, once again reaching new lows since we became a public company. Unit and revenue attrition both reached 12.5% in the quarter, driven by declines in nonpay and voluntary disconnects and increases in resale activities. These improvements helped offset an increase in relocation disconnects resulting from improvements in the housing market.
As a result of the improvement in customer retention and solid gross add performance, we narrowed our net customer loss significantly with a loss of less than 3,000 customers versus 30,000 a year ago, bringing us closer to our goal of returning to net subscriber growth.
From a financial perspective, despite the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar, our improved operational performance allowed us to deliver strong year-over-year growth in recurring revenue and pre-SAC EBITDA before special items. Our EBITDA and EPS results for the quarter include about $11 million or $0.04 a share in incremental costs for the first half of the year related to a change in how we account for dealer payments for leads generated through a marketing efficiency program. Mike will provide more details on the accounting for this program in a few minutes.
I would like to reinforce that this effort was part of a major initiative to dramatically improve the efficiency of our online lead generation efforts. ADT, in conjunction with a few of our dealers, have collectively reduced the cost per click in paid search by 80% through this program.
Moving on to Slide 5. Because of the opportunity to drive strong returns in our business today and the additional opportunities we see to generate profitable growth in the years ahead, we continue to invest in ADT's future. We're investing to enhance the customer experience by implementing new technologies and processes, including the rollout of a new electronic order management platform and the deployment of our new wireless Total Security panel.
In support of our customer service improvement efforts, this quarter, we invested to reduce the mean time to repair and install systems for our customers. We believe these investments will yield future improvements in customer satisfaction and ultimately result in better retention.
We are also continuing to expand our presence in the small business and midsize commercial markets. Our small business channel continues to exhibit very strong growth as we're now pursuing the larger footprint opportunities in this market, as evidenced by nearly 10% recurring revenue growth year-over-year in the U.S. and a 13% increase in gross adds. In the commercial market, we've expanded our sales force and our product portfolio to position us to better serve midsize commercial customers, allowing us to close nearly 400 new sales, including our first national account customer.
In the health market, we launched new products and distribution channels to generate future growth. During the second quarter, we launched our new on-the-go mobile PERS product, an easy-to-use wearable device equipped with fall detection and GPS capabilities, which operates on a leading nationwide cellular network, connecting customers to a specially trained team of ADT health employees in our monitoring centers.
We also established new retail distribution channels to drive future growth. As a result, our health channel has begun to exhibit accelerated growth, with gross adds up nearly 20% and new customer ARPU up 12% during the quarter.
We're also continuing to invest in Pulse, our interactive service platform. Pulse continues to be an important driver between -- behind our results. And in Q2, Pulse take rates and Pulse upgrades both increased year-over-year.
On Slide 6, you can see that over 55% of our total gross adds during the quarter were Pulse units, up from 43% a year ago. In our residential direct channel, the Pulse take rate for new and resale units was 60%, while 73% of all new residential customers added via this channel were Pulse customers. In our dealer channel, the Pulse take rate ramped up to 52% from about 36% last year. And in our small business channel, the Pulse take rate was 47%, up nearly 10 percentage points over the second quarter of last year.
In addition to new system sales of Pulse, we upgraded about 32,000 existing customers this summer, which is in line with previous quarter and up from 18,000 last year. Pulse upgrades allow us to provide additional services to our existing customers and yield higher ARPU. In addition, these upgrades allow us to enhance the customer experience and enter into new contracts. We now have approximately 1.2 million Pulse customers, representing about 19% of ADT's customer base at quarter end.
I'm happy with the progress we are making in our operations and with the investments we're making in the future and look forward to sharing more details with you during our Analyst and Investor Day Meeting, scheduled for May 14 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
Now let me turn things over to Mike to provide some additional details on our financial and operational performance during the quarter."

As Naren mentioned, we delivered another quarter of improved financial and operational results.

As Naren mentioned, we delivered another quarter of improved financial and operational results. This is our formula for success: Execute on the 5 operating leverage in our core businesses to drive higher recurring revenue and pre-SAC EBITDA while at the same time, reinvest a portion of our cash flows and profits and improving customer experience, launching new businesses like commercial and new services and health, increasing Pulse penetration and adding new products and services, all of which will generate future cash flows and incremental profitability, benefiting both our customers and shareholders.
We also remain committed to delivering against our 2015 guidance. I'm pleased to report that we are updating our guidance favorably versus earlier guidance, which I will address later in my remarks. As we look towards the second half of the year, we will continue to invest in creating new partnerships as we open our platform to expand our services to target the large market opportunity that currently doesn't purchase home security and automation services, expand our health and commercial businesses as well as integrate our Canadian businesses. Over the next few slides, I'll review our Q2 performance and highlight our accomplishments during the quarter.
Slide 7 provides an overview of our GAAP and non-GAAP results. Recurring revenue, which accounts for 93% of our total revenue, grew 7.2% to $829 million, while total revenue increased by 6.3%. When adjusting for the Canadian dollar, which declined by 11% versus last year, recurring revenue was up 7.8% and total revenue increased by 6.8%. We report the FX impact only on ADT Canada since Protectron was not in the portfolio this time last year. However, including Protectron, Canada represents almost 10% of our total company revenues and the currency impact versus the start of this year when we gave guidance at nearly 13%.
Our business remains strong and we are focused on growing to a highly profitable recurring revenue model, continuing the trend you have seen in our historical results. The best metrics to gauge this growth are recurring revenue, pre-SAC EBITDA and steady-state free cash flow. Despite lower SAC, we still incur an investment when adding new customers during the first year and a dilutive to EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow before turning favorable beginning in year 2.
In Q2, Protectron contributed slightly more than half of the recurring revenue growth. Protectron currently operates at a lower margin at ADT, so the consolidation had a dilutive impact on our financial results. EBITDA before special items for the quarter was $444 million, up 3% or $13 million over prior year, excluding a $2 million impact from the weak Canadian dollar, and resulting in EBITDA margins before special items for the quarter of 49.9%. Second quarter EBITDA before special items includes a negative impact of approximately $11 million pretax related to a change in how we account for dealer payments for lead generated through a marketing efficiency program. Roughly half of this amount is related to the first quarter.
With this accounting change and the addition of Protectron, EBITDA margins compressed 160 basis points relative to last year. However, otherwise, it would've been flat on prior year at 51.5%. Cost-to-serve was up 10% due primarily to the consolidation of Protectron as well as planned spending increases to improve customer service levels and investments to launch our commercial business. Excluding Protectron, cost-to-serve expenses were less than 5% over last year despite the higher mix of Pulse customers.
GAAP EPS was up nearly 18% to $0.40 a share. Including special items, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.47, which also includes the impact of $0.04 per share related to the incremental cost, recognizing the income statement associated with the change in how we're accounting for dealer payments for leads through the marketing efficiency program. Using our Q2 cash tax rate of 4%, our diluted earnings per share before special items was $0.67 for the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 33%.
The chart also details our special items for the quarter. In Q2, we continue to make progress on our 2G radio conversion project, upgrading 82,000 customers, a portion of which we were able to upsell to ADT Pulse. As we have previously communicated, this project will continue through 2016 and we are comfortably ahead of our plan. We also incurred $2 million of restructuring charges.
Now I'd like to give you some additional color on the marketing efficiency program we discussed and the impact of the change in the way we are accounting for this effort. As part of our cost efficiency program, we initiated an effort with selected dealers to significantly optimize our paid search activities. This included centralizing paid search lead generation efforts at ADT and eliminating the scenario in which we would essentially bid up the search prices with our dealers.
The participating dealers pay a fee to ADT for their share of the leads. The program has been a huge success, saving tens of millions of dollars in search fees and reducing the cost per click by over 80%. We previously reported the fees we received from the dealers as a counter [ph] marketing expense, mitigating the incremental marketing expense incurred by ADT. However, in Q2, we began to account for these payments as an offset to the amounts we paid dealers for customer accounts.
The impact of this change resulted in an increase in marketing expense that we recognize in the income statement, with an offset and reduction in the capital expenditures incurred for dealer-generated customer accounts. This change does not affect SAC, net creation multiples, pre-SAC EBITDA, future returns or cash flow. What this does affect is the timing of expense recognition as marketing expenses are period costs whereby customer acquisition costs phase into the P&L over time. Therefore, with this change, in the quarter, we recognized approximately $11 million pretax or $0.04 per share in EPS terms of additional expense in the income statement, of which about half is attributable to Q1.
Accordingly, we also recognize lower capital spending for dealer accounts on the same amount. This program will continue in the future due to its success. In the second half of the year, we expect to recognize approximately $30 million of incremental marketing expenses from this initiative, with a corresponding offset in capital spending for dealer accounts and a modest improvement in D&A.
Turning to the operating levers. Slide 8 shows another quarter of strong year-over-year growth in both gross adds and revenue per unit. Total company gross adds, excluding a bulk purchase last year, increased over 8% year-over-year, driven by improved performance across our residential, business and health channels.
Our gross adds in our direct channel were up 9% despite the headwinds caused by our enhanced credit screening, which management estimates filtered out about 5,000 potential sales. We expect this enhanced process to continue to favorably impact attrition by filtering out credit-challenged customers.
Gross adds in our dealer channel, excluding bulks, rose 7% from last year as we experienced higher sales from existing dealers and benefited from Protectron's dealer channel production. We are also -- we are pleased with the performance of our dealer channel year-to-date as they have now delivered year-over-year growth for the third consecutive quarter.
Pricing remains healthy as demonstrated by our ability to continue to grow ARPU. The success of Pulse, expanded service offerings in our business channel and the launch of our premium-priced on-the-go emergency response system in our health channel have all helped drive higher revenue per user over the past year. For the quarter, new and resale ARPU was $48.18, an increase of nearly 5% over the prior year, and ARPU for our overall customer base was $41.98, up nearly 2%. Adjusting for Protectron's lower average ARPU, the average ARPU was actually up 4%.
Our priority over the past year has been to improve the customer experience and increase customer retention. We have launched several initiatives to reduce attrition, and the results on Slide 9 show that these initiatives are paying off. We improved attrition for the fourth consecutive quarter and are operating considerably below our guidance of less than 13%.
Q2 trailing 12-month net revenue attrition was 12.5%, a sequential improvement of 50 basis points and a significant reduction of 170 basis points versus Q2 of last year. Unit attrition, which measures customer attrition for just our residential and business customers, was 12.5% for the quarter, a 40% -- a 40 basis point improvement versus Q1 and 120 basis points lower than last year. We remain focused on enhancing the customer experience, reducing nonpay disconnections and increasing resales, which all contribute to reducing attrition.
As Naren mentioned, for Q2, we reported a decline in our customer base of less than 3,000 subscribers, which compares favorably to last year when we lost 30,000 customers. For the first half of the year, we had a net subscriber churn of just over 10,000 customers versus nearly 80,000 in the first half of last year. We grew subscribers in ADT Business and in Health by reporting only a modest decline in residential customers.
Moving on to Slide 10, which shows our quarterly results for recurring revenue margin and SAC. For the quarter, recurring revenue margin on our existing customer base was 65.7%, down 90 basis points versus prior year, driven by increased spend to improve our customer service levels, growth investments and the impact of Protectron. The dilutive effect of consolidating Protectron alone impact the recurring revenue margins by 50 basis points versus last year.
Despite higher Pulse take rates, which exceeds 55% and require a large upfront investment, we continue to reduce customer acquisition costs and lower net creation multiples. Excluding the impact of Pulse upgrades, our combined net creation multiple improved by 0.9x to 31.2x in Q2, while the net creation multiple on our direct channel fell to 31.5x, a 2.4x improvement from last year. Dealer net creation multiples were 30.6x.
Excluding the impact of upgrades, net SAC in our direct channel was $1,519 per install, lower by just over $40 per unit from last year despite the increase in Pulse mix. This reduction is a clear indication of our success with the launch of several productivity initiatives such as our new eContract platform and implementation of new hardware such as the TS panel to drive efficiencies during the installation process. In the quarter, we installed about 26,000 TS panels in our direct channel.
In a recurring revenue subscription business like ours, the best long-term measure for cash flow is steady-state free cash flow, as this calculation measures the free cash flow generated by maintaining the recurring revenue from our existing customer base and excludes the incremental investment required to grow -- from adding new subscribers.
One of the key drivers in this calculation is the SAC per customer required to replace lost RMR due to attrition. As you can see, the initiatives we implemented had allowed us to begin stabilizing our creation multiples, and the net investment to acquire a new customer is now approximately $1,500 in our direct channel. The actual SAC per subscriber is declining.
When you combine the reduction in SAC with our improvement in attrition, you gain a sense of the levels of cash flow that we could generate by simply maintaining our current recurring revenue. Steady-state free cash flow for Q2 was $940 million, up nearly 20% over prior year. The improvement is attributed to 170 basis point reduction in attrition, lower SAC and higher pre-SAC EBITDA.
On Slide 12, we detail the components of free cash flow for the quarter. In order to highlight the value drivers of our business, we developed this chart to segment our free cash flow and to the cash we generate from existing customers and the cash we attributed to new subscriber acquisition. As I mentioned, pre-SAC EBITDA was up driven by the strong operational performance and the past investments we've made in adding high-paying Pulse customers. This was somewhat offset this quarter by some timing issues and working capital mostly from the prior quarter.
Our results also include a 10% year-over-year increase in cash interest expense driven by the debt issued to fund our share buyback program, which has reduced shares outstanding by 26% since its inception. All in, our pre-SAC free cash flow from existing customers was $501 million in the quarter, up $13 million compared to the previous year.
Investing in subscriber growth is the main driver behind our ability to generate free cash flow as our spend in acquiring new customers impacts both our P&L and cash flow statement. 94% of our total CapEx spend this quarter was driven by our investments in new customers.
In Q2, our SAC spending before special items was $402 million, up about 10% on prior year, which includes both the P&L cost like marketing and capital spending on account acquisition. The largest driver of the increased SAC spending was a 7-plus percent growth in new subscriber adds as well as an increase in Pulse upgrades from 18,000 to 32,000 year-over-year.
Our dealer channel saw CapEx increase as well, however, driven by 7% increase in gross adds, the inclusion of Protectron and significantly higher Pulse take rates. Dealer CapEx was favorably impacted $11 million by the accounting change.
Factoring in all of this, free cash flow before special items for the quarter was $99 million versus $46 million in the first quarter and $121 million a year ago. We will discuss cash flow trends more in our upcoming Investor Day. We are optimistic that free cash flow will increase despite further investments in the business as we will benefit from higher new customer ARPU, favorable attrition trends and productivity improvements in hardware and installation. Investment drivers due to higher Pulse take rates and Pulse upgrades are transitional, which we expect to stabilize the decline over the next few years.
Slide 13 highlights our capital allocation and debt levels for the quarter. Trailing 12-month leverage was 2.9x. Overall, the company fell [ph] across the bar and remain below 4% for Q2, giving us the flexibility to invest in our business and customer growth, which continues to be the best use of capital for ADT. We also paid a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share, a 5% increase over last year.
In addition to paying a higher dividend, we continue to be opportunistic on our share buybacks and repurchased 1.3 million shares for $44 million, increasing our year-to-date repurchases to 4.2 million shares at an average price of $32.91 per share. For 2014 and 2015 combined, our average purchase price on 39 million shares was $37.90 per share. The repurchases this quarter helped us bring the average diluted share count to 172 million, a 26% reduction from inception. We have approximately $243 million remaining on the share buyback authorization, and we remain opportunistic when evaluating future buybacks.
Slide 14 shows our updated guidance. When we gave recurring revenue and EBITDA guidance at the end of fiscal 2014, the Canadian dollar stood at $0.91. We ended the quarter sub $0.80, a drop of about 13%. That said, we are increasing our guidance for recurring revenue and providing both a reported and constant dollar view. Even despite the negative FX, we have increased the range to the high end of our guidance on a reported basis, which includes the current exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, we believe our recurring revenue growth will exceed 6%.
We are introducing pre-SAC EBITDA guidance as a guidance measure because as discussed earlier, we believe it is a more accurate measure to evaluate our performance. The portion of SAC that is expense versus capitalized varies dramatically based on the source of the new customer. This is highlighted by the impact discussed earlier on the accounts acquired from our dealers that participate in the marketing efficiency program. By focusing on pre-SAC EBITDA, we remove this variability and provide better insight into the business.
On a reported basis, we believe pre-SAC EBITDA growth will be in a range of $80 million to $100 million and over $100 million on a constant currency basis. In adding pre-SAC EBITDA guidance, we made the decision to have this replace EBITDA guidance. We, of course, will continue to report EBITDA throughout the year but will no longer be providing guidance to this result. To date, this year, without the impact of the accounting change we discussed earlier, EBITDA is up $71 million -- I'm sorry, $51 million and progressing well despite the negative currency towards our prior guidance.
In terms of attrition, we are currently favorable to our year-end goal of sub 13% net unit attrition. We now expect year-end attrition to be in the mid-12% range. Lastly, we confirm guidance of steady-state free cash flow on an exchange neutral basis will be above $1 billion by year-end.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Naren."

So I think if you guided to what Naren said, there's a different mix of each and we're not anticipating anything here. But it -- what really counts is whether it's dealer or direct, it's about $1,500 SAC to bring a customer in. A customer is paying $48 in both channels on average, so the cash on cash returns are the same, the ROI is the same, and those are the economics we got to be focusing on. And that's why pre-SAC EBITDA is really the cleanest and it's used by a lot of people in our industry because it really takes out all the SAC. We were taking out much of the SAC but not the marketing cost of the SAC by using EBITDA. Now we're taking it all. By the way, we're going to continue to report EBITDA so we're not reporting EBITDA, but I think pre-SAC EBITDA is a better figure to guide on."

You can get early notification and make -- and react and make those changes in parallel with us. And we are looking at video verification.

Jeff, we haven't provided guidance nor do we intend to for any of the individual kind of lines of business within the portfolio. I would say directionally, we've got goals of the synergies that we want the business team to achieve as we bring these 2 businesses together. But clearly, it was more than just cost synergies. We felt good about the retention characteristics that we saw on the Protectron side, and we're already seeing nice improvements on the ADT side there, coming closer to where we wanted to be. So we're seeing good progress there. And I think both of the businesses, the ADT business and the Protectron business or the combined business, moving forward, we want to see Pulse take rates continue to drive. We rolled out on the ADT side a little later in Canada than we did in the U.S., so they're still playing a little bit of catch-up there. We also have some language capabilities we need to embed into the platform as we go into Quebec and places like that. But again, I expect over time to see, I'd say, take rates that are comparable to what we see in the U.S. business. There's no reason that should be different."

I think we'll start to lose the distinction between ADT Canada and Protectron. But for now, we're trying to give you the transparency of this impact. But even with ADT Canada, some of the metrics, their SAC is lower, their attrition is better, but their ARPU is lower, so it's not just Protectron. We haven't really pointed it out, we're only pointing Protectron out because it's in this year's results and not in last year's results. But I think it's, as you suggested and as already mentioned, there's definitely upside down the road as we move into higher automation, leverage some of the best practices in the U.S., so we're very excited about that."

So when you look at our direct CapEx, you can probably take $10 million of the variance year-over-year, it's attributed to this, to upgrades. But I think as I mentioned in my statements, it's really over the next couple of years. I mean, part of the upgrades are being driven by the 2G conversions as well. That's going to finish up in' 16.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings release, which we filed to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 27, 2015, which we expect to file at the SEC later today.

Thank you for joining our call today. I hope you had a chance to review our earnings press release we issued earlier this morning that highlights our results for the second quarter of 2015.

I hope you had a chance to review our earnings press release we issued earlier this morning that highlights our results for the second quarter of 2015. This morning, I'll discuss our key performance highlights and accomplishments for the quarter, then Mike Geltzeiler will provide additional details on our financial and operational performance.
As you can see from our results, we continued to build on the trends that we have seen over the past year, delivering another quarter of improved year-over-year performance. Strong execution of our initiatives, along with our focus on quality growth, yielded solid operational and financial results. We continued to drive gross add growth year-over-year in both our direct and dealer channels, while our key customer metrics continue to move in the right direction, highlighted by a significant improvement in customer retention.
We continued to make smart investments in our business, positioning us for future profitable revenue growth and free cash flow generation. Overall, our performance this quarter shows that we are widening the gap and extending our leadership position in the industry, an industry we believe is creating even more opportunities for future growth. As I have in the past, I will discuss our results in the context of our approach for achieving our vision for ADT.
Our approach is focused on 3 areas: One, driving quality subscriber growth and improving the customer experience; two, executing on operational initiatives to deliver strong financial returns; and three, investing in our business to achieve profitable growth and strong free cash flow generation in the future. The results of these actions that we've taken are continuing to shine through in our results, reinforcing that we are on the right path. And despite a market landscape that is more competitive than it was 5 years ago, we are continuing to win in the market.
Evidence of our competitive strength can be seen on Slide 3, which shows our performance over the past 12 months against 4 key metrics that are impacted by the competitive environment. Year-over-year, we have delivered increases in gross adds across all lines of business in both our direct and authorized dealer channels, improved customer retention by 170 basis points, increased the average price paid by newly added customers by nearly 5% and reduced our creation multiple, which reflects the payback period for newly generated accounts. I believe this chart provides the best evidence that we are extending our leadership position while improving business performance.
Specifically for the second quarter, as highlighted on Slide 4, we grew gross add -- gross subscriber additions by 8%, excluding bulks, with year-over-year increases in both our direct and authorized dealer channels. We accomplished this despite more stringent customer screening efforts in our direct sales channel, filtering out low-quality prospects. Continued solid lead generation, increased self-generated business and strong close rates for phone and field sales all contributed to our growth.
Our focus on quality customer growth and our investments in improving the customer experience have led to unit and revenue attrition, once again reaching new lows since we became a public company. Unit and revenue attrition both reached 12.5% in the quarter, driven by declines in nonpay and voluntary disconnects and increases in resale activities. These improvements helped offset an increase in relocation disconnects resulting from improvements in the housing market.
As a result of the improvement in customer retention and solid gross add performance, we narrowed our net customer loss significantly with a loss of less than 3,000 customers versus 30,000 a year ago, bringing us closer to our goal of returning to net subscriber growth.
From a financial perspective, despite the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar, our improved operational performance allowed us to deliver strong year-over-year growth in recurring revenue and pre-SAC EBITDA before special items. Our EBITDA and EPS results for the quarter include about $11 million or $0.04 a share in incremental costs for the first half of the year related to a change in how we account for dealer payments for leads generated through a marketing efficiency program. Mike will provide more details on the accounting for this program in a few minutes.
I would like to reinforce that this effort was part of a major initiative to dramatically improve the efficiency of our online lead generation efforts. ADT, in conjunction with a few of our dealers, have collectively reduced the cost per click in paid search by 80% through this program.
Moving on to Slide 5. Because of the opportunity to drive strong returns in our business today and the additional opportunities we see to generate profitable growth in the years ahead, we continue to invest in ADT's future. We're investing to enhance the customer experience by implementing new technologies and processes, including the rollout of a new electronic order management platform and the deployment of our new wireless Total Security panel.
In support of our customer service improvement efforts, this quarter, we invested to reduce the mean time to repair and install systems for our customers. We believe these investments will yield future improvements in customer satisfaction and ultimately result in better retention.
We are also continuing to expand our presence in the small business and midsize commercial markets. Our small business channel continues to exhibit very strong growth as we're now pursuing the larger footprint opportunities in this market, as evidenced by nearly 10% recurring revenue growth year-over-year in the U.S. and a 13% increase in gross adds. In the commercial market, we've expanded our sales force and our product portfolio to position us to better serve midsize commercial customers, allowing us to close nearly 400 new sales, including our first national account customer.
In the health market, we launched new products and distribution channels to generate future growth. During the second quarter, we launched our new on-the-go mobile PERS product, an easy-to-use wearable device equipped with fall detection and GPS capabilities, which operates on a leading nationwide cellular network, connecting customers to a specially trained team of ADT health employees in our monitoring centers.
We also established new retail distribution channels to drive future growth. As a result, our health channel has begun to exhibit accelerated growth, with gross adds up nearly 20% and new customer ARPU up 12% during the quarter.
We're also continuing to invest in Pulse, our interactive service platform. Pulse continues to be an important driver between -- behind our results. And in Q2, Pulse take rates and Pulse upgrades both increased year-over-year.
On Slide 6, you can see that over 55% of our total gross adds during the quarter were Pulse units, up from 43% a year ago. In our residential direct channel, the Pulse take rate for new and resale units was 60%, while 73% of all new residential customers added via this channel were Pulse customers. In our dealer channel, the Pulse take rate ramped up to 52% from about 36% last year. And in our small business channel, the Pulse take rate was 47%, up nearly 10 percentage points over the second quarter of last year.
In addition to new system sales of Pulse, we upgraded about 32,000 existing customers this summer, which is in line with previous quarter and up from 18,000 last year. Pulse upgrades allow us to provide additional services to our existing customers and yield higher ARPU. In addition, these upgrades allow us to enhance the customer experience and enter into new contracts. We now have approximately 1.2 million Pulse customers, representing about 19% of ADT's customer base at quarter end.
I'm happy with the progress we are making in our operations and with the investments we're making in the future and look forward to sharing more details with you during our Analyst and Investor Day Meeting, scheduled for May 14 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
Now let me turn things over to Mike to provide some additional details on our financial and operational performance during the quarter."

As Naren mentioned, we delivered another quarter of improved financial and operational results. This is our formula for success: Execute on the 5 operating leverage in our core businesses to drive higher recurring revenue and pre-SAC EBITDA while at the same time, reinvest a portion of our cash flows and profits in improving customer experience, launching new businesses like commercial and new services in health, increasing Pulse penetration and adding new products and services, all of which will generate future cash flows and incremental profitability, benefiting both our customers and shareholders.
We also remain committed to delivering against our 2015 guidance. I'm pleased to report that we are updating our guidance favorably versus earlier guidance, which I will address later in my remarks. As we look towards the second half of the year, we will continue to invest in creating new partnerships as we open our platform to expand our services to target the large market opportunity that currently doesn't purchase home security and automation services, expand our health and commercial businesses as well as integrate our Canadian businesses. Over the next few slides, I'll review our Q2 performance and highlight our accomplishments during the quarter.
Slide 7 provides an overview of our GAAP and non-GAAP results. Recurring revenue, which accounts for 93% of our total revenue, grew 7.2% to $829 million, while total revenue increased by 6.3%. When adjusting for the Canadian dollar, which declined by 11% versus last year, recurring revenue was up 7.8% and total revenue increased by 6.8%. We report the FX impact only on ADT Canada since Protectron was not in the portfolio this time last year. However, including Protectron, Canada represents almost 10% of our total company revenues and the currency impact versus the start of this year when we gave guidance is nearly 13%.
Our business remains strong and we are focused on growing to a highly profitable recurring revenue model, continuing the trend you have seen in our historical results. The best metrics to gauge this growth are recurring revenue, pre-SAC EBITDA and steady-state free cash flow. Despite lower SAC, we still incur an investment when adding new customers during the first year and a dilutive to EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow before turning favorable beginning in year 2.
In Q2, Protectron contributed slightly more than half of the recurring revenue growth. Protectron currently operates at a lower margin than ADT, so the consolidation had a dilutive impact on our financial results. EBITDA before special items for the quarter was $444 million, up 3% or $13 million over prior year, excluding a $2 million impact from the weak Canadian dollar, and resulting in EBITDA margins before special items for the quarter of 49.9%. Second quarter EBITDA before special items includes a negative impact of approximately $11 million pretax related to a change in how we account for dealer payments for lead generated through a marketing efficiency program. Roughly half of this amount is related to the first quarter.
With this accounting change and the addition of Protectron, EBITDA margins compressed 160 basis points relative to last year. However, otherwise, it would've been flat on prior year at 51.5%. Cost-to-serve was up 10% due primarily to the consolidation of Protectron as well as planned spending increases to improve customer service levels and investments to launch our commercial business. Excluding Protectron, cost-to-serve expenses were less than 5% over last year despite the higher mix of Pulse customers.
GAAP EPS was up nearly 18% to $0.40 a share. Including special items, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.47, which also includes the impact of $0.04 per share related to the incremental cost, recognizing the income statement associated with the change in how we're accounting for dealer payments for leads through the marketing efficiency program. Using our Q2 cash tax rate of 4%, our diluted earnings per share before special items was $0.67 for the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 33%.
The chart also details our special items for the quarter. In Q2, we continue to make progress on our 2G radio conversion project, upgrading 82,000 customers, a portion of which we were able to upsell to ADT Pulse. As we have previously communicated, this project will continue through 2016 and we are comfortably ahead of our plan. We also incurred $2 million of restructuring charges.
Now I'd like to give you some additional color on the marketing efficiency program we discussed and the impact of the change in the way we are accounting for this effort. As part of our cost efficiency program, we initiated an effort with selected dealers to significantly optimize our paid search activities. This included centralizing paid search lead generation efforts at ADT and eliminating the scenario in which we would essentially bid up the search prices with our dealers.
The participating dealers pay a fee to ADT for their share of the leads. The program has been a huge success, saving tens of millions of dollars in search fees and reducing the cost per click by over 80%. We previously reported the fees we received from the dealers as a contra marketing expense, mitigating the incremental marketing expense incurred by ADT. However, in Q2, we began to account for these payments as an offset to the amounts we paid dealers for customer accounts.
The impact of this change resulted in an increase in marketing expense that we recognize in the income statement, with an offsetting reduction in the capital expenditures incurred for dealer-generated customer accounts. This change does not affect SAC, net creation multiples, pre-SAC EBITDA, future returns or cash flow. What this does affect is the timing of expense recognition as marketing expenses are period costs whereby customer acquisition costs phase into the P&L over time. Therefore, with this change, in the quarter, we recognized approximately $11 million pretax or $0.04 per share in EPS terms of additional expense in the income statement, of which about half is attributable to Q1.
Accordingly, we also recognize lower capital spending for dealer accounts by the same amount. This program will continue in the future due to its success. In the second half of the year, we expect to recognize approximately $13 million of incremental marketing expenses from this initiative, with a corresponding offset in capital spending for dealer accounts and a modest improvement in D&A.
Turning to the operating levers. Slide 8 shows another quarter of strong year-over-year growth in both gross adds and revenue per unit. Total company gross adds, excluding a bulk purchase last year, increased over 8% year-over-year, driven by improved performance across our residential, business and health channels.
Our gross adds in our direct channel were up 9% despite the headwinds caused by our enhanced credit screening, which management estimates filtered out about 5,000 potential sales. We expect this enhanced process to continue to favorably impact attrition by filtering out credit-challenged customers.
Gross adds in our dealer channel, excluding bulks, rose 7% from last year as we experienced higher sales from existing dealers and benefited from Protectron's dealer channel production. We are also -- we are pleased with the performance of our dealer channel year-to-date as they have now delivered year-over-year growth for the third consecutive quarter.
Pricing remains healthy as demonstrated by our ability to continue to grow ARPU. The success of Pulse, expanded service offerings in our business channel and the launch of our premium-priced on-the-go emergency response system in our health channel have all helped drive higher revenue per user over the past year. For the quarter, new and resale ARPU was $48.18, an increase of nearly 5% over the prior year, and ARPU for our overall customer base was $41.98, up nearly 2%. Adjusting for Protectron's lower average ARPU, the average ARPU was actually up 4%.
Our priority over the past year has been to improve the customer experience and increase customer retention. We have launched several initiatives to reduce attrition, and the results on Slide 9 show that these initiatives are paying off. We improved attrition for the fourth consecutive quarter and are operating considerably below our guidance of less than 13%.
Q2 trailing 12-month net revenue attrition was 12.5%, a sequential improvement of 50 basis points and a significant reduction of 170 basis points versus Q2 of last year. Unit attrition, which measures customer attrition for just our residential and business customers, was 12.5% for the quarter, a 40% -- a 40 basis point improvement versus Q1 and 120 basis points lower than last year. We remain focused on enhancing the customer experience, reducing nonpay disconnections and increasing resales, which all contribute to reducing attrition.
As Naren mentioned, for Q2, we reported a decline in our customer base of less than 3,000 subscribers, which compares favorably to last year when we lost 30,000 customers. For the first half of the year, we had a net subscriber churn of just over 10,000 customers versus nearly 80,000 in the first half of last year. We grew subscribers in ADT Business and in Health by reporting only a modest decline in residential customers.
Moving on to Slide 10, which shows our quarterly results for recurring revenue margin and SAC. For the quarter, recurring revenue margin on our existing customer base was 65.7%, down 90 basis points versus prior year, driven by increased spend to improve our customer service levels, growth investments and the impact of Protectron. The dilutive effect of consolidating Protectron alone impacted recurring revenue margins by 50 basis points versus last year.
Despite higher Pulse take rates, which exceeds 55% and require a large upfront investment, we continue to reduce customer acquisition costs and lower net creation multiples. Excluding the impact of Pulse upgrades, our combined net creation multiple improved by 0.9x to 31.2x in Q2, while the net creation multiple on our direct channel fell to 31.5x, a 2.4x improvement from last year. Dealer net creation multiples were 30.6x.
Excluding the impact of upgrades, net SAC in our direct channel was $1,519 per install, lower by just over $40 per unit from last year despite the increase in Pulse mix. This reduction is a clear indication of our success with the launch of several productivity initiatives such as our new eContract platform and implementation of new hardware such as the TS panel to drive efficiencies during the installation process. In the quarter, we installed about 26,000 TS panels in our direct channel.
In a recurring revenue subscription business like ours, the best long-term measure for cash flow is steady-state free cash flow, as this calculation measures the free cash flow generated by maintaining the recurring revenue from our existing customer base and excludes the incremental investment required to grow -- from adding new subscribers.
One of the key drivers in this calculation is the SAC per customer required to replace lost RMR due to attrition. As you can see, the initiatives we implemented have allowed us to begin stabilizing our creation multiples, and the net investment to acquire a new customer is now approximately $1,500 in our direct channel. The actual SAC per subscriber is declining.
When you combine the reduction in SAC with our improvement in attrition, you gain a sense of the levels of cash flow that we could generate by simply maintaining our current recurring revenue. Steady-state free cash flow for Q2 was $940 million, up nearly 20% over prior year. The improvement is attributed to 170 basis point reduction in attrition, lower SAC and higher pre-SAC EBITDA.
On Slide 12, we detail the components of free cash flow for the quarter. In order to highlight the value drivers of our business, we developed this chart to segment our free cash flow into the cash we generate from existing customers and the cash we attributed to new subscriber acquisition. As I mentioned, pre-SAC EBITDA was up driven by the strong operational performance and the past investments we've made in adding high-paying Pulse customers. This was somewhat offset this quarter by some timing issues in working capital mostly from the prior quarter.
Our results also include a 10% year-over-year increase in cash interest expense driven by the debt issued to fund our share buyback program, which has reduced shares outstanding by 26% since its inception. All in, our pre-SAC free cash flow from existing customers was $501 million in the quarter, up $13 million compared to the previous year.
Investing in subscriber growth is the main driver behind our ability to generate free cash flow as our spend in acquiring new customers impacts both our P&L and cash flow statement. 94% of our total CapEx spend this quarter was driven by our investments in new customers.
In Q2, our SAC spending before special items was $402 million, up about 10% on prior year, which includes both the P&L costs like marketing and capital spending on account acquisition. The largest driver of the increased SAC spending was a 7-plus percent growth in new subscriber adds as well as an increase in Pulse upgrades from 18,000 to 32,000 year-over-year.
Our dealer channel saw CapEx increase as well, however, driven by 7% increase in gross adds, the inclusion of Protectron and significantly higher Pulse take rates. Dealer CapEx was favorably impacted $11 million by the accounting change.
Factoring in all of this, free cash flow before special items for the quarter was $99 million versus $46 million in the first quarter and $121 million a year ago. We will discuss cash flow trends more in our upcoming Investor Day. We are optimistic that free cash flow will increase despite further investments in the business as we will benefit from higher new customer ARPU, favorable attrition trends and productivity improvements in hardware and installation. Investment drivers due to higher Pulse take rates and Pulse upgrades are transitional, which we expect to stabilize the decline over the next few years.
Slide 13 highlights our capital allocation and debt levels for the quarter. Trailing 12-month leverage was 2.9x. Overall, the company saw the cost of borrowing remain below 4% for Q2, giving us the flexibility to invest in our business and customer growth, which continues to be the best use of capital for ADT. We also paid a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share, a 5% increase over last year.
In addition to paying a higher dividend, we continued to be opportunistic on our share buybacks and repurchased 1.3 million shares for $44 million, increasing our year-to-date repurchases to 4.2 million shares at an average price of $32.91 per share. For 2014 and 2015 combined, our average purchase price on 39 million shares was $37.90 per share. The repurchases this quarter helped us bring the average diluted share count to 172 million, a 26% reduction from inception. We have approximately $243 million remaining on the share buyback authorization, and we remain opportunistic when evaluating future buybacks.
Slide 14 shows our updated guidance. When we gave recurring revenue and EBITDA guidance at the end of fiscal 2014, the Canadian dollar stood at $0.91. We ended the quarter sub $0.80, a drop of about 13%. That said, we are increasing our guidance for recurring revenue and providing both a reported and constant dollar view. Even despite the negative FX, we have increased the range to the high end of our guidance on a reported basis, which includes the current exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, we believe our recurring revenue growth will exceed 6%.
We are introducing pre-SAC EBITDA guidance as a guidance measure because as discussed earlier, we believe it is a more accurate measure to evaluate our performance. The portion of SAC that is expense versus capitalized varies dramatically based on the source of the new customer. This is highlighted by the impact discussed earlier on the accounts acquired from our dealers that participated in the marketing efficiency program. By focusing on pre-SAC EBITDA, we remove this variability and provide better insight into the business.
On a reported basis, we believe pre-SAC EBITDA growth will be in a range of $80 million to $100 million and over $100 million on a constant currency basis. In adding pre-SAC EBITDA guidance, we made the decision to have this replace EBITDA guidance. We, of course, will continue to report EBITDA throughout the year but will no longer be providing guidance to this result. To date, this year, without the impact of the accounting change we discussed earlier, EBITDA is up $71 million -- I'm sorry, $51 million and progressing well despite the negative currency towards our prior guidance.
In terms of attrition, we are currently favorable to our year-end goal of sub 13% net unit attrition. We now expect year-end attrition to be in the mid-12% range. Lastly, we confirm guidance of steady-state free cash flow on an exchange neutral basis will be above $1 billion by year-end.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Naren."

And therefore, you're trying to make the adjustment and trying to make us look at it from that perspective, or is there anything else that you're seeing that really drove the motivation of this move?"

In the past, we were simply trying to forecast mix between dealer and direct and because of the accounting differences that Mike talked about between those channels. With this new kind of category of lead-sharing dealers with some -- a kind of a mixed accounting model in there, it really puts us in a position where we have to predict mix across 3 channels. And I'm just not sure that, that's a productive use of our time or your time to provide that level of granularity. Again, the economics on all of our channels are very good. We want to grow wherever we see the opportunities, and I don't want to have to be put in a position where we're trying to manage the growth of the different channels when all of them give us very attractive returns."

Dealer sales don't impact the EBITDA. It would actually create a higher EBITDA, direct sales would create a lower EBITDA and dealers in the efficiency program in the middle. So I think if you guided to what Naren said, there's a different mix of each and we're not anticipating anything here. But it -- what really counts is whether it's dealer or direct, it's about $1,500 SAC to bring a customer in. A customer is paying $48 in both channels on average, so the cash on cash returns are the same, the ROI is the same, and those are the economics we've got to be focusing on. And that's why pre-SAC EBITDA is really the cleanest and it's used by a lot of people in our industry because it really takes out all the SAC. We were taking out much of the SAC but not the marketing cost of the SAC by using EBITDA. Now we're taking it all. By the way, we're going to continue to report EBITDA so we're not, not reporting EBITDA, but I think pre-SAC EBITDA is a better figure to guide on."

From a product perspective, we're continuing to invest in the product to make sure we've got new features, new capabilities, not just hardware, Jeff, but also the software, how you interact with the system, making it more intuitive, making it easier with the Pulse app, as well as the Pulse platform itself. And on the service side, we want to make sure that if you've got a service need, we can, one, do as much of the fix remotely. And while that helps us from a productivity perspective, it also helps the customers so they are not waiting for a service tech, so a lot more self-service there. Or for example, batteries, we'll ship them to you. You can install them yourself. And then when you do need to roll a truck, we want to make sure we can get a truck there in a timely manner. So some of the investments that we made this quarter were to get to our mean time to repair down to what we felt was an appropriate level. We think it got a little bit higher than where we wanted it to be, and we made a onetime investment to get them back in line. So like with attrition, Jeff, there's no single silver bullet that drives the customer experience. It's a culture, it's a series of processes and it's also the product itself, hardware and software."

We're going through the call list, but we're dispatching immediately on those. And that's all about speed because we have the confidence that those are real events. I think when we're looking at the burglar alarm, which is where many of the false alarms tend to be, again, there's a lot of best practices across the industry, many led by ADT, but looking for multiple technologies. People who do have Pulse can get that earlier alarm signal on their own because there's no delay built into the panel by code. You can get early notification and they can react and make those changes in parallel with us. And we are looking at video verification. We're looking more on the commercial side right now because I think we're still getting a lot of customer resistance about others being able to look into their cameras and things like that. So I think, Jeff, we're staying on top of both the technology trends as well as the policy trends. We're influencing them where it makes sense for us to do so, and we want to work with the responders to reduce the level of false alarms. It's bad for them and it's bad for us as an industry."

We felt good about the retention characteristics that we saw on the Protectron side, and we're already seeing nice improvements on the ADT side there, coming closer to where we wanted to be. So we're seeing good progress there. And I think both of the businesses, the ADT business and the Protectron business or the combined business, moving forward, we want to see Pulse take rates continue to drive. We rolled out on the ADT side a little later in Canada than we did in the U.S., so they're still playing a little bit of catch-up there. We also have some language capabilities we need to embed into the platform as we go into Quebec and places like that. But again, I expect over time to see, I'd say, take rates that are comparable to what we see in the U.S. business. There's no reason that should be different."

As well, we're spending on incrementally, it's about $10 million year-over-year. So when you look at our direct CapEx, you can probably take $10 million of the variance year-over-year, it's attributed to this, to upgrades. But I think as I mentioned in my statements, it's really over the next couple of years. I mean, part of the upgrades are being driven by the 2G conversions as well. That's going to finish up in '16. So again, we want to be there if the customer wants to stay with ADT but wants the benefit of automation. We rather they do that with us instead of somebody else. But -- and over time, we'll have more and more of our customer base on Pulse and there clearly will be less upgrade. So it'll flatten out now and eventually decline."

I have had a chance to briefly review our earnings press release we issued a little while ago and highlights our results for the third quarter of 2015. This morning, I will discuss our key performance highlights for the quarter and the progress that we're making on our initiatives to drive future profitable growth. Then Mike will provide additional details on our financial and operational performance.
As you can see from our results, we delivered another quarter of improved operational performance, drove solid financial results and made progress on our plans for future growth. We drove quality gross adds growth and delivered strong revenue in the quarter. And our key operational metrics once again moved in the right direction, highlighted by another quarter of improved attrition.
We further strengthened our foundation for the future by making smart investments to improve our customer experience and fund our growth initiatives, which are targeted at the midsize commercial, health and unpenetrated residential markets. We also established some exciting new partnership, which will allow us to bring new services to our existing customers and better enable us to pursue customers in these new market segments.
Overall, our performance this quarter reinforced our market leadership position and moved us further down the road towards achieving our longer-term goals.
Before I get into more details on the quarter, I'd like to discuss our performance in the context of our strategy and share with you my thoughts on the current status of our industry. First on the industry. The market for home security and automation services continues to be very dynamic, creating exciting new growth opportunities for ADT. As I highlighted on previous calls and during our recent Investor Day, the growing interest in the smart home and Internet of Things has been one of the key drivers of market growth. And security remains at the top of the list of reasons, consumers are buying smart home devices and associated services. In fact, a survey conducted by a major retailer indicated that over 60% of Americans cited security and home monitoring as that top beneficial reason to own a smart home solution. Needless to say, this is great news for ADT.
The evolution of the smart home and Internet of Things coupled with the changing needs of consumers in an always on connected world, are opening up new market segments for ADT. This definition of security is evolving as consumers want to be safe and connected at all times with a simple and secure way to interact with their families and their homes.
And as the industry evolves, ADT is also evolving to meet the needs of the market. With our Smart Security approach that provide higher engagement through differentiated and flexible service offerings. These changing market dynamics in the residential market, combined with the investments we're making to help us pursue new customers in the commercial and health markets, result in a very large playing field for ADT.
In total, we expect our addressable market for residential business and health to nearly triple over the next 5 years to over 70 million potential customers. From a competitive standpoint, our traditional market continues to be relatively stable. The evidence of this is in our sustained improvement in operating performance. We're continuing to drive year-over-year increases in gross adds, while attrition in the voluntary and lost competition category was lower than it was a year ago. New and resale revenue per user continues to rise, driven by higher Pulse stake rates, while average revenue per user base benefits from pulse mix and price escalation. All of these indicate that price competition remains stable and that we're able to demonstrate the value of our services to customers.
In addition, we remain focused on improving the efficiency of bringing on new customers and our improvement in SAC creation multiples proves we can attract new customers with favorable economics. Overall, market dynamics remain positive for ADT, and we believe we are in the best position to capture the growing opportunities today and in the future. No one else in our industry has the scale, brand recognition and installation sales, service and monitoring capabilities that ADT has to take advantage of these expanding opportunities.
As shown on Slide 3, our strategy for creating shareholder value is relatively simple. First, we're growing our traditional business by improving customer retention and adding quality new customers to our existing base.
Our focus on improving the customer experience has yielded steady improvements in customer retention. In addition, we're enhancing our Pulse platform, which had better retention characteristics than traditional offerings, by opening up our Pulse ecosystem to partners like Nest Labs. This allows us to give our customers the security and monitoring they needed to protect their most important assets, along with the smart home and automation technologies they desire. Second, we're expanding into national adjacencies, leveraging our competitive advantages in the business and health channels. In our business channel, not only are we pursuing larger footprints, small businesses and national accounts, we also started to target midsize commercial target businesses with security and fire protection service. This expanded focus dramatically increases the addressable market in our business channels, growing from about $2.5 billion to about $24 billion, as we roll out our capabilities across our footprint.
Lastly, later this year, we'll be introducing new solutions to target a portion of the residential market that hasn't been reached by traditional security services. This is what I'll refer to in the past as the other 80% of the market that does not have a monitored security solution. This market has tremendous potential for ADT. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we partnered with the major consumer electronics manufacturer to develop an attractive all-in-one security device that will be supported with many of the monitoring and response services, our current 6.6 billion customers receive us today. We are coupling these growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and management's focus on optimizing our capital structure and capital allocation. We're continuing to reinvest cash to grow our core business, remain disciplined in our strategic M&A activities and our returning excess capital to our shareholders via dividends and opportunistic share buybacks.
Of course, underpinning all of this is a relentless focus on the operating leverage that drive our business. And as you will see on the next slide, it is clear that we are continuing to execute on our plan and are on the right path.
Slide 4 shows our performance over the last 12 months against 4 operating leverages that are impacted by the competitive environment. Year-over-year, we've delivered increases in gross adds across all lines of business, improved customer retention by 150 basis points, increased new and resale ARPU by about 2.5% and reduced our direct sales channel creation multiple, which is the cash payback period for newly generated accounts in this channel. I view this chart as evidence that we're extending our market leadership position while improving business performance.
Touching on a few operational highlights for the third quarter, as shown on Slide 5. We grew gross subscribers additions by about 5%, with year-over-year increases in both our direct and authorized dealer channels. We accomplish this despite more stringent customer screening efforts in our direct sales channels, which filtered out about 4,000 lower quality prospects in the quarter. Continued strong close rates in phone sals, which were up about 12% year-over-year, contributed to our growth.
Our focus on quality customer growth and our investments in improving customer experience have led to unit and revenue attrition once again reaching new lows since we became a public company.
We lowered revenue attrition to 12.4%, 150 basis point improvement versus last year. And we reduced unit attrition to 12.3%, 120 basis point year-over-year improvement. While our improvement initiatives allowed us to offset the effects of a more active housing market, the normal seasonal impact of summer movers drove higher disconnects in gross adds resulting in a loss of about 28,000 customers in the period. This is a meaningful improvement over the loss of 39,000 customers in the third quarter of last year, and we remain committed to turning to net add positive during 2016.
Moving on to our growth initiatives. Starting on Slide 6, I'd like to highlight our team's progress and our business and health channels. First in our business channels. We are continuing to see strong momentum in our small business and commercial expansion efforts. Our small business channels continues to exhibit very strong growth, as we've improved sales execution and are now pursuing the larger footprint opportunities in this market. In total, business gross adds were up over 15%, while new and resale ARPU increased over 6% compared to last year. In the commercial market, we're continuing to invest in our product portfolio and expanding our sales force to position us to better serve midsize commercial customers. Our commercial efforts continue to gain traction, growing total revenue to $1.6 million during the quarter, a sequential increase of nearly 75%.
In the health market, we're continuing to capitalize on new product introductions from late last year and earlier this year and new distribution channels to generate growth. Our new on-the-go mobile Pulse product and new distribution channels have led to a 29% increase in gross additions and a 10% increase in ARPU. We are also evaluating new partners and distribution channels to accelerate future growth.
Turning to Slide 7, we are continuing to invest to enhance our customer experience, which will further reduce attrition. Not only by driving new Pulse sales and upgrades, but also by introducing new technologies and processes. These include rolling out our new electronic order management platform, which we have now fully adopted in our small business channel and is nearing completion across our residential channel. We're also continuing to deploy our new wireless Total Security panel in our Pulse automation installation. These new tools and products yield both productivity -- operational productivity and a better customer experience. In future support of our customer service improvement efforts, this quarter we continue to invest to reduce the mean time to repair and install systems for our customers. As you likely saw in our press release last week, we announced the initial roll out of a partnership with Nest Labs and the launch of our new Pulse mobile app. I'll talk more about these on the next slide.
As shown on Slide 8. We have expanded the service options and enhanced the experience for our customers, as our Pulse platform now supports the Nest Learning Thermostat. A critical part of our Smart Security approach involves combining best-in-class smart home security and energy management technology, providing our customers the security and monitoring they need, along with the smart home and automation technologies they desire.
We are now offering the Nest Thermostat as part of certain Pulse automation packages in Atlanta, Chicago, Denver and Miami and expect to expand nationwide by the end of the year.
This partnership with Nest is an example of our efforts to deliver advanced technology and differentiated solutions to enhance the experience and choice for our customers. Our Nest Labs partnership adds to a growing list of home automation partners for ADT. We expect to continue to collaborate with other players in the security and home automation industry, as we have recently developed an API architecture to accelerate the integration of the innovative products within our pulse platform.
Last week, we also announced the release of our new Pulse app, significantly enhancing the mobile space for our Pulse customers. The app features are more intuitive and user-friendly experience, making managing home automating security more simpler and more affective. The new Pulse app also supports our open API strategy, allowing for future integration for other best-in-class third-party solutions. The app is available for download for all Pulse customers via the Apple App Store and Google Play.
Another key component of our efforts to improve the customer experience and reduce churn is our continued investment in Pulse, our primary interactive services platform. Pulse continues to be an important driver behind our results, and in Q3, Pulse take rates again increased year-over-year.
On Slide 9, you can see that over 57% of our total grass adds during the quarter where Pulse units, up from 49% a year ago. And in our residential direct channel, the Pulse take rate for new and resale units were 63%, while more than 75% of our new residential customers added via the sales channel were Pulse customers. In our dealer channel, the tran1 take rate ramped to 54% from about 43% last year, and in our small business channel, the Pulse take rate was 40%.
In addition to new system sales of Pulse, we also updated about 30,000 existing customers this quarter. Pulse update allows us to provide additional services to our existing customers and via higher ARPU. In addition, these upgrades allow us to enhance customer experience and enter into new contracts. We now have approximately 1.4 million Pulse customers with total interactive customers now comprising about 21% of ADT's customer base.
As we highlighted during our Investor Day presentation back in May, Pulse customers continue to demonstrate better retention characteristics than traditional security customers. Our analysis shows that Pulse customers overall have better retention stats and retention further improves when customer choose automation features. Pulse automation customers, those use Pulse to control devices in their home, like door locks, thermostats or cameras have significantly lower attrition. Equally important, our initial data shows that the resale rate, the rate at which we sign up a new customer, who moves into a home or automation is already installed, is higher as compared to non-Pulse customers. As I previously mentioned, another important component of our strategy to pursue customer growth in nontraditional residential market, previously not served by ADT or other traditional monitored security service providers.
During the third quarter, we announced a new partnership and a new product and service bundle designed to target customers in this segment. 
Turning to Slide 10, at our Investor Day in May, we announced that we are working with LG Electronics to launch a new all-in-one security device with ADT services for this unpenetrated market. This market represents a significant component of the 70 million plus addressable market available ADT in the future. The new offering is a plug-and-play solution with no installation required. You simply plug it in, download the app, connect it to your Wi-Fi network and you're off and running. It has all you need from a basic security perspective, and it can connect with many other home automation devices, allowing you to control these devices through the app. All you need is power and an Internet action.
ADT will be offering service bundles, which include professional monitoring video storage and attributable, a very robust interactive platforms and many of the other services that we provide our current customers. Needless to say, we're very excited about this opportunity. What differentiate this from other offerings in the marketplace is that it's secured by ADT. With a direct connection to ADT's monitoring center and associated response team, along with many of the other services that are 6.6 million customers enjoy today. The initial target market, our customers, who need smaller premises, renters and frequent movers will look for flexible security solutions with no long-term contracts. The device also has an incredibly simple and intuitive global user interface. We received positive response from our retail validation process and we are targeting making this new product and service available later this year, as we enter the holiday season.
As we get closer to launch, we'll provide more details on the go-to-market strategy, price and other details. However, we can't say that this will be a low to no SAC product and a recurring revenue model for monitoring and video storage. Now let me turn things over to Mike to provide some additional details on our financial and operational performance during the quarter."

We delivered another quarter of solid operational and financial results. The focus remains the same as it's been the entire year. One, improve the key customer facing levers and drive long-term value and grow our customer base, which adds attrition and ARPU. Two, improve operating efficiencies in both cost to serve in SAC. And three, reinvest some of these efficiencies to enhancing the customer experience and our growth initiatives as discussed earlier by Naren. Medium term, this plan drive higher levels of profitability, free cash flow and net customer gains. In the quarter, we made improvements in our key operating leverage and drove higher recurring revenue, pre-SAC EBITDA and free cash flow. Some of our investment in the initiatives have immediate or veryh short paybacks, while others such as the expansion of our commercial business and our DIY efforts will take more time to develop, but represent large material opportunities. We are excited about the future for ADT and the opportunity to create value for shareholders.
Over the next few slides, I'll review our Q3 performance and highlight our accomplishments during the quarter. Slide 11 summarizes our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter. In Q3, recurring revenue, which accounts for approximately 93% of our total revenue, grew 6.2% to $834 million, and total revenue increased by 5.8% to $898 million. When adjusting for the decline in the Canadian dollar, recurring revenue was up 6.8% and total revenue increased by 6.2%. We are reporting the FX impact only on ADT Canada, since Protectron was not part of our business at this time last year. However, our total Canadian operation, including Protectron, represents almost 50% of our total company revenue. Canadian dollar is now worth $0.76, which is approximately 16% lower than we gave guidance. In Q3, reported operating expenses before special items were up 11% over the last year with D&A increasing 9%.
The increase in total expense was driven, primarily, by the attrition of Protectron and the change in accounting for dealer payments. Excluding Protectron and the impact of the marketing efficiency programs, total operating expenses before special items were up 5.8% from last year. Most of the increase related to investments such as enhancing the customer experience, entering the commercial business, expanding our health channel, rolling out the new Pulse mobile app and developing new all-in-one product at the DIY market. Excluding Protectron, DNA before special items rose by 5.8%. We continue to make progress in SAC and in the creation cost to acquire new customers. As a subscriber base business, we incurred investment and we added new customers during the first year with diluted EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow. And we typically begin to see the benefit of new customer addition in our financial results until year 2. This impact is more evident when we generate high levels of new customer additions as we have done all year.
When you adjust for the expenses incurred to acquire new customers, you get a better sense of our company's operating results. In Q3, we grew pre-SAC EBITDA before special items by $16 million to $560 million, a 3% increase versus last year. Pre-SAC EBITDA margin was 66%. Protectron operates at a lower margin at ADT, so the consolidation of its results has a diluted impact our total company margins when compared to prior year. This impact and this quarter as we approach the one-year anniversary of Protectron in July. EBITDA before special items for the quarter was $451 million. Teh year-over-year EBITDA comparable was negatively impacted $2 million from the weak Canadian dollar and $6 million related to the change in accounting for our marketing efficiency programs as well as from our growth investments and efforts to improve customer service levels.
We expect these items to be negatively dragged with EBITDA growth in Q4 as well. At Investor Day, we indicated that 2G spending will be reduced in the third quarter, as we evaluate some alternatives us to extend the conversion period. We continue to pursue these efforts, but are less optimistic than a month ago, and we'll be accelerating our efforts to convert and upgrade the relevant customer base, by calendar 2016 year end.
GAAP EPS was $0.44 a share. Excluding special items non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.49, which includes the impact of $0.02 per share related to the change in how we account the dealer payment for release to the marketing efficiency program. This compares to non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.55 a share in 2014. Using our Q3 tax rate of 4.5%, our diluted earnings per share before special items were $0.68 per share.
Our effective tax rate was slightly below 33%. We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year in both gross adds and revenue per unit, which can be seen on Slide 12. Total company gross adds increased by nearly 5% year-over-year, driven by improved performance across both channels and in business and health.
Gross adds in our direct channel were up nearly 4%, despite the headwinds caused by our in-house credit screening, which management estimates filtered out about 4,000 potential sales. We have seen the attrition benefits from the credit screening and expect this benefit to increase. Gross adds at our dealer channel rose more than 6% from last year, as we experienced higher sales from existing dealers and benefited from project around dealer channel protection. We worked diligently to optimize our dealer channel and are pleased with the results and we have delivered year-over-year growth for the fourth conservative quarter. Average and new and resale ARPU both grew again this quarter, as it benefited from more favorable mix of both customers in our base and higher Pulse rates. Success of Pulse expanded service offerings to our business channel and launch of our premium price on-the-go emergency response system and our health channel, have all help drive higher revenue per user over the past year.
For the quarter, new and resale ARPU was 48,000 19 cents, an increase of nearly 2.5% over the prior year. And ARPU for overall customer base was 42 50, up nearly 1%. Adjusting for an Protection, which is at different price points, and the impact of weaker Canadian dollar. New and resale ARPU was up nearly 4%, while average ARPU was up 3.6%.
Increasing retention remains our top priority. This is being driven by improvement through the customer experience and higher levels of resale to former customers or new owners of ex 83 customer homes.
Slide 18 shows these initiatives are paying off, as we improve the attrition through the fifth consecutive quarter. Q3 trailing 12 months net revenue attrition was 12.4%, a sequential improvement of 10 basis points and a significant reduction of 150 basis points versus last year. Unit attrition, which measured customer attrition for just our residential and business customers was 12.3% for the quarter, a 20 basis improvement versus Q2 and 120 basis points lower than Q3 last year. Although, we guided our a head of Investor Day for attrition to stabilize over the summer months, we're internally targeting considerably lower levels of attrition over the next few years.
As discussed during our Investor Day meeting, the summer months are a time of increased relocation disconnections, which offset the higher amount of customer additions we generate during the same period. Compared to last year, we reduced our net customer losses by more than 30% in Q3. The growth disconnections offset our new customer additions by 28,000. We've made tremendous progress in our year-to-date customer losses, reducing the organic loss figure year-over-year by over 80,000 customers. We remain committed to reporting net subscriber growth in fiscal 2016.
Moving on to Slide 14, we shows our quarterly results for recurring revenue margins in SAC multiples. For the quarter, recurring revenue margin on existing customer base was about 66%, below the abnormally high 68% in Q3 last year. The decrease in margin is due to the consolidation of Protectron, which impacted our current revenue margins by 50 basis points, investments in launching new products and efforts to establish commercial channel.
Increased spending to improve our customer service levels, such as reducing meantime to repair, has also impacted margins, but has had a positive impact in enhancing the positive customer experience in improving attrition. We reported lower subscriber acquisition cost versus prior quarter and lower net creation multiples versus prior year, despite higher Pulse take rates. Excluding pearls upgrades, our combined net creation multiples improved by 0.3x to 30.7x in Q3, while the net creation multiple in our direct channel fell to 30.7x, a 0.4x improvement from last year. Dealer net recreational multiples also improved from last year and were [ph] 3.6x. Net SAC in our dealer channel and our direct channel, sorry, fell below $1500 to $1477 per install. Greater sales efficiency, the introduction of our new TS Panel and lowest cost combined with the implementation of electronic contracts, all help to reduce SAC and increase efficiency in the installation process.
Slide 15 details the Q3 component of free cash flow, as cash regenerated from existing customers and the cash associated with new subscriber acquisitions. For the third quarter, free cash flow was $99 million, up slightly versus last year, despite a 5% increase in gross adds. Free cash flow before special items for the first 9 months was $244 million. This is already above the $240 million we base line for full year 2015 in our Investor Day presentation.
As I mentioned earlier, the growth in pre-SAC EBITDA before special items was driven by our operational improvements, cost reduction initiatives and our growth in Pulse customers. Pre-SAC free cash flow for special items this quarter was $530 million, up $33 million from last year. Investing in subscriber growth is the main driver of our ability to generate future free cash flow. In Q3, our total capital expenditures were $336 million, and over 92% of that amount was used to generate new customer additions. For the quarter, total SAC before special items was $415 million, up about 8% versus prior year.
The largest driver of the increased SAC spending was 5% growth in new subscriber adds as well as an increase in Pulse upgrades from 20,000 to 30,000 year-over-year. We are targeting free cash flow growth in fiscal 2016, despite expected further investments in the business, as we grow subscriber base to increase gross adds and lower attrition.
Slide 16 details -- provides details of our steady-state free cash flow. We continue to make improvements in this long-term evaluation metric, which allows us to measure the free cash flow generated by maintaining the current revenue from our existing customer base before investing in new subscriber growth. The key drivers to this metrics, pre-SAC EBITDA, SAC multiples and attrition are all moving in the right direction. This is somewhat offset by a lower level of pricing excavation as the more tactically deploy this initiative as part of our attrition reduction program. For Q3, steady-state free cash flow before special items ended at $936 million, up slightly versus prior year.
Slide 17 highlights our capital allocation and debt levels for the quarter. Trailing 12-month leverage was 2.9x EBITDA and trailing 12-month net to pre-SAC EBITDA was 2.3x. We've added the second leverage ratio to report a harmonized view similar to how most, if not all our security competitors before leverage and to reflect that EBITDA was lower at about $80 million for the first 9 months, as a result of the change in how we report the market efficiency program. Our long-term guidance remains 3x EBITDA, debt-to-EBITDA. Our total cost of borrowing remains slow and was below 4% in Q3. Having a low cost to borrowing allows us to continue investing in growth and to return capital to our shareholders. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share, a 5% increase over the last year and continue to be optimistic on our share repurchases.
We also used a portion of our cash to invest in what we believe is the best investment in the security industry, and we purchased approximately 45 million of shares in Q3, contributing to the total $51 million or share repurchases since Q2. Year-to-date repurchases were approximately 5.6 million shares at an average price of $33.53 per share. Repurchases this quarter helped us bring the average diluted share count to $170 million, a 27% reduction from our share count and spin. In July, we also announced that our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program, authorizing us to purchase $1 billion of common stock throughout the next 3 years. The new share repurchase program expires on July 17, 2018, and is incremental to $192 million remaining in the currency of share repurchase program, which expires on November 26, 2015.
Now I would like to turn the call back over to Naren."

I think, once you get that baseline, all the assumptions really build up at baseline. So I don't want to continue to update that model. I think that was a scenario that when we report the full year results, we give appropriate guidance for 2016.
Suffice to say that, there is more cash in this business.

Okay. Jeff, I'm sorry, about that Jeff. We're not doing well with technology this morning. We've got a lot of initiatives under way in our monitoring centers. I'll highlight a couple of them. First of all, we maintained very good local relationships with the local and we're working very closely with them. I'll highlight one, if you look at our Pulse Solution, you actually will get a notification on your cell phone or mobile device or via e-mail even before the signal would go to our monitoring center because the required delay in the panel, that gives the customer the opportunity to cancel an alarm if it's a false alarm and really gives us that chance to reduce those false alarms by having customers know earlier that alarm and that was in their home. In some cases, they can even look in their cameras. So that is 1 particular example that we continue to work through the call list. And we're looking at multiple technologies, for example, a motion detector plus a glass break or door and window contact breach to verity that it is a true alarm effect.

We're doing a lot of data analytics than we've ever done before to identify customers proactively reaching out to those customers where it's appropriately or at least rounding those calls to more experienced representatives in our customer care organization that are capable of dealing with more complex issues. As Mike and I both mentioned in our comments, we continue to make investments in our service infrastructure to reduce the mean time to repair as well as the meantime to install and to our customer survey activity we're seeing steady improvements in that initial installed customer satisfaction as well as the anniversary survey. So again, there is no one silver bullet. This one, there is lots of work on the ground. And Mike just commented, big part of that is changing the culture of the organization.

This morning, I'll discuss our key performance highlights for the quarter and the progress that we're making on our initiatives to drive future profitable growth. Then Mike will provide additional details on our financial and operational performance.
As you can see from our results, we delivered another quarter of improved operational performance, drove solid financial results and made progress on our plans for future growth. We drove quality gross-add growth and delivered strong revenue in the quarter. And our key operational metrics once again moved in the right direction, highlighted by another quarter of improved attrition.
We further strengthened our foundation for the future by making smart investments to improve our customer experience and fund our growth initiatives, which are targeted at the midsize commercial, health and unpenetrated residential markets. We also established some exciting new partnerships, which will allow us to bring new services to our existing customers and better enable us to pursue customers in these new market segments.
Overall, our performance this quarter reinforced our market leadership position and moved us further down the road towards achieving our longer-term goals.
Before I get into more details on the quarter, I'd like to discuss our performance in the context of our strategy and share with you my thoughts on the current status of our industry. First on the industry. The market for home security and automation services continues to be very dynamic, creating exciting new growth opportunities for ADT. As I've highlighted on previous calls and during our recent Investor Day, the growing interest in the smart home and Internet of Things has been one of the key drivers of market growth. And security remains at the top of the list of reasons, consumers are buying smart home devices and associated services. In fact, a survey conducted by a major retailer indicated that over 60% of Americans cited security and home monitoring as the top beneficial reason to own a smart home solution. Needless to say, this is great news for ADT.
The evolution of the smart home and Internet of Things coupled with the changing needs of consumers in an always-on connected world are opening up new market segments for ADT. This definition of security is evolving as consumers want to be safe and connected at all times, with a simple and secure way to interact with their families and their homes.
And as the industry evolves, ADT is also evolving to meet the needs of the market with our Smart Security approach that provides higher engagement through differentiated and flexible service offerings. These changing market dynamics in the residential market, combined with the investments we're making to help us pursue new customers in the commercial and health markets, result in a very large playing field for ADT.
In total, we expect our addressable market for residential business and health to nearly triple over the next 5 years to over 70 million potential customers. From a competitive standpoint, our traditional market continues to be relatively stable. The evidence of this is in our sustained improvement in operating performance. We're continuing to drive year-over-year increases in gross adds, while attrition in the voluntary and lost-to-competition category is lower than it was a year ago. New and resale revenue per user continues to rise, driven by higher Pulse take rates, while average revenue per user for the base benefits from Pulse mix and price escalations. All of these indicate that price competition remains stable and we are able to demonstrate the value of our services to customers.
In addition, we remain focused on improving the efficiency of bringing on new customers and our improvement in SAC creation multiples proves we can attract new customers with favorable economics. Overall, market dynamics remain positive for ADT, and we believe we are in the best position to capture the growing opportunities today and in the future. No one else in our industry has the scale, brand recognition and installation sales, service and monitoring capabilities that ADT has to take advantage of these expanding opportunities.
As shown on Slide 3, our strategy for creating shareholder value is relatively simple. First, we're growing our traditional business by improving customer retention and adding quality new customers to our existing base.
Our focus on improving the customer experience has yielded steady improvements in customer retention. In addition, we're enhancing our Pulse platform, which has better retention characteristics than traditional offerings, by opening up our Pulse ecosystem to partners like Nest Labs. This allows us to give our customers the security and monitoring they need to protect their most important assets, along with the smart home and automation technologies they desire. Second, we're expanding into natural adjacencies, leveraging our competitive advantages in the business and health channels. In our business channel, not only are we pursuing larger footprints, small businesses and national accounts, we've also started to target midsize commercial businesses with security and fire protection service. This expanded focus dramatically increases the addressable market in our business channel, going from about $2.5 billion to about $24 billion, as we roll out our capabilities across our footprint.
Lastly, later this year, we'll be introducing new solutions to target a portion of the residential market that hasn't been reached by traditional security services. This is what I've referred to in the past as the other 80% of the market that does not have a monitored security solution. This market has tremendous potential for ADT. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we partner with a major consumer electronics manufacturer to develop an attractive all-in-one security device that will be supported with many of the monitoring and response services our current 6.6 billion customers receive today. We are coupling these growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and management's focus on optimizing our capital structure and capital allocation. We're continuing to reinvest cash to grow our core business, remain disciplined in our strategic M&A activities and are returning excess capital to our shareholders via dividends and opportunistic share buybacks.
Of course, underpinning all of this is a relentless focus on the operating levers that drive our business. And as you will see on the next slide, it is clear that we are continuing to execute on our plan and are on the right path.
Slide 4 shows our performance over the past 12 months against 4 operating levers that are impacted by the competitive environment. Year-over-year, we've delivered increases in gross adds across all lines of business, improved customer retention by 150 basis points, increased new and resale ARPU by about 2.5% and reduced our direct sales channel creation multiple, which is the cash payback period for newly generated accounts in this channel. I view this chart as evidence that we're extending our market leadership position while improving business performance.
Touching on a few operational highlights for the third quarter, as shown on Slide 5. We grew gross subscriber additions by about 5%, with year-over-year increases in both our direct and authorized dealer channels. We accomplished this despite more stringent customer screening efforts in our direct sales channel, which filtered out about 4,000 lower quality prospects in the quarter. Continued strong close rates in phone sales, which were up about 12% year-over-year, contributed to our growth.
Our focus on quality customer growth and our investments in improving customer experience have led to unit and revenue attrition once again reaching new lows, since we became a public company.
We lowered revenue attrition to 12.4%, a 150 basis point improvement versus last year. And we reduced unit attrition to 12.3%, a 120 basis point year-over-year improvement. While our improvement initiatives allowed us to offset the effects of a more active housing market, the normal seasonal impact of summer movers drove higher disconnects in gross adds resulting in a loss of about 28,000 customers in the period. This is a meaningful improvement over the loss of 39,000 customers in the third quarter of last year, and we remain committed to turning to net add positive during 2016.
Moving on to our growth initiatives. Starting on Slide 6, I'd like to highlight our team's progress in our business and health channels. First, in our business channel, we're continuing to see strong momentum in our small business and commercial expansion efforts. Our small business channel continues to exhibit very strong growth, as we've improved sales execution and are now pursuing the larger footprint opportunities in this market. In total, business gross adds were up over 15%, while new and resale ARPU increased over 6% compared to last year. In the commercial market, we're continuing to invest in our product portfolio and expanding our sales force to position us to better serve midsize commercial customers. Our commercial efforts continue to gain traction, growing total revenue to $1.6 million during the quarter, a sequential increase of nearly 75%.
In the health market, we're continuing to capitalize on the new product introductions from late last year and earlier this year and new distribution channels to generate growth. Our new on-the-go mobile PERS product and new distribution channels have led to a 29% increase in gross additions and a 10% increase in ARPU. We are also evaluating new partners and distribution channels to accelerate future growth.
Turning to Slide 7, we are continuing to invest to enhance our customer experience, which will further reduce attrition, not only by driving new Pulse sales and upgrades, but also by introducing new technologies and processes. These include rolling out our new electronic order management platform, which we have now fully adopted in our small business channel and is nearing completion across our residential channel. We're also continuing to deploy the new wireless Total Security panel in our Pulse automation installation. These new tools and products yield both productivity -- operational productivity and a better customer experience. In future support of our customer service improvement efforts, this quarter we continue to invest to reduce the mean time to repair and install systems for our customers. As you likely -- and as you likely saw in our press release last week, we announced the initial rollout of a partnership with Nest Labs and the launch of our new Pulse mobile app. I'll talk more about these on the next slide.
As shown on Slide 8. We have expanded the service options and enhanced the experience for our customers, as our Pulse platform now supports the Nest Learning Thermostat. A critical part of our Smart Security approach involves combining best-in-class smart home security and energy management technology, providing our customers the security and monitoring they need, along with the smart home and automation technologies they desire.
We are now offering the Nest Thermostat as part of certain Pulse automation packages in Atlanta, Chicago, Denver and Miami and expect to expand nationwide by the end of the year.
This partnership with Nest is an example of our efforts to deliver advanced technology and differentiated solutions to enhance the experience and choice for our customers. Our Nest Labs partnership adds to a growing list of home automation partners for ADT. We expect to continue to collaborate with other players in the security and home automation industry, as we have recently developed an API architecture to accelerate the integration of innovative products within our Pulse platform.
Last week, we also announced the release of our new Pulse app, significantly enhancing the mobile experience for our Pulse customers. The app features a more intuitive and user-friendly experience, making managing home automation security simpler and more effective. The new Pulse app also supports our open API strategy, allowing for future integration for other best-in-class third-party solutions. The app is available for download for all Pulse customers via the Apple App Store and Google Play.
Another key component of our efforts to improve the customer experience and reduce churn is our continued investment in Pulse, our primary interactive services platform. Pulse continues to be an important driver behind our results, and in Q3, Pulse take rates again increased year-over-year.
On Slide 9, you can see that over 57% of our total gross adds during the quarter were Pulse units, up from 49% a year ago. And in our residential direct channel, the Pulse take rate for new and resale units was 63%, while more than 75% of our new residential customers added via this sales channel were Pulse customers. In our dealer channel, the Pulse take rate ramped to 54% from about 43% last year, and in our small business channel, the Pulse take rate was 40%.
In addition to new system sales of Pulse, we also upgraded about 30,000 existing customers this quarter. Pulse upgrades allow us to provide additional services to our existing customers and yield higher ARPU. In addition, these upgrades allow us to enhance the customer experience and enter into new contracts. We now have approximately 1.4 million Pulse customers with total interactive customers now comprising about 21% of ADT's customer base.
As we highlighted during our Investor Day presentation back in May, Pulse customers continue to demonstrate better retention characteristics than traditional security customers. Our analysis shows that Pulse customers overall have better retention stats, and retention further improves when customer choose automation features. Pulse automation customers, those using Pulse to control devices in their home, like door locks, thermostats or cameras, have significantly lower attrition. Equally important, our initial data shows that the resale rate, the rate at which we sign up a new customer who moves into a home where Pulse automation is already installed, is higher as compared to non-Pulse customers. As I previously mentioned, another important component of our strategy is to pursue customer growth in the nontraditional residential market, previously not served by ADT or other traditional monitored security service providers.
During the third quarter, we announced a new partnership and a new product and service bundle designed to target customers in this segment. 
Turning to Slide 10, at our Investor Day in May, we announced that we are working with LG Electronics to launch a new all-in-one security device with ADT services for this unpenetrated market. This market represents a significant component of the 70 million plus addressable market available at ADT in the future. The new offering is a plug-and-play solution with no installation required. You simply plug it in, download the app, connect it to your Wi-Fi network, and you're off and running. It has all you need from a basic security perspective, and it can connect with many other home automation devices, allowing you to control these devices through the app. All you need is power and an Internet action.
ADT will be offering service bundles, which include professional monitoring [indiscernible], video storage and retrievable, a very robust interactive platform and many of the other services that we provide to our current customers. Needless to say, we're very excited about this opportunity. What differentiates this from other offerings in the marketplace is that it's secured by ADT, with a direct connection to ADT's monitoring centers and associated response team, along with many of the other services that our 6.6 million customers enjoy today. The initial target market are customers who need smaller premises, renters and frequent movers, who need a flexible security solutions with no long-term contracts. The device also has an incredibly simple and intuitive global user interface. We've received positive response from our retail validation process, and we are targeting making this new product and service available later this year, as we enter the holiday season.
As we get closer to the launch, we'll provide more details on the go-to-market strategy, pricing and other details. However, we can say that this will be a low-to-no SAC product and a recurring revenue model for monitoring and video storage. Now let me turn things over to Mike to provide some additional details on our financial and operational performance during the quarter."
184157327,306632312,841193,"The ADT Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","The ADT Security Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Naren. We delivered another quarter of solid operational and financial results. The focus remains the same, as it's been the entire year. One, improve the key customer-facing levers and drive long-term value and grow our customer base, gross adds,",2152,"Thanks, Naren. We delivered another quarter of solid operational and financial results. The focus remains the same, as it's been the entire year. One, improve the key customer-facing levers and drive long-term value and grow our customer base, gross adds, attrition and ARPU. Two, improve operating efficiencies in both cost to serve and SAC. And three, reinvest some of these efficiencies to enhancing the customer experience and our growth initiatives, as discussed earlier by Naren. Medium term, this plan will drive higher levels of profitability, free cash flow and net customer gains. In the quarter, we made improvements in our key operating leverage and drove higher recurring revenue, pre-SAC EBITDA and free cash flow. Some of our investment initiatives have immediate or very short paybacks, while others such as the expansion of our commercial business in our DIY efforts will take more time to develop, but represent large material opportunities. We are excited about the future for ADT and the opportunity to create value for shareholders.
Over the next few slides, I'll review our Q3 performance and highlight our accomplishments during the quarter. Slide 11 summarizes our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter. In Q3, recurring revenue, which accounts for approximately 93% of our total revenue, grew 6.2% to $834 million, and total revenue increased by 5.8% to $898 million. When adjusting for the decline in the Canadian dollar, recurring revenue was up 6.8% and total revenue increased by 6.2%. We are reporting the FX impact only on ADT Canada, since Protectron was not part of our business at this time last year. However, our total Canadian operation, including Protectron, represents almost 10% of our total company revenues. Canadian dollar is now worth $0.76, which is approximately 16% lower than we gave guidance. In Q3, reported operating expenses before special items were up 11% over the last year with D&A increasing 9%.
The increase in total expense was driven primarily by the addition of Protectron and the change in accounting for dealer payments. Excluding Protectron and the impact of the marketing efficiency program, total operating expenses before special items were up 5.8% from last year. Most of the increase is related to investments such as enhancing the customer experience, entering the commercial business, expanding our health channel, rolling out the new Pulse mobile app and developing a new all-in-one product targeted at the DIY market. Excluding Protectron, D&A before special items rose by 5.8%. We continue to make progress in SAC and in the creation cost to acquire a new customer. As a subscriber-based business, we incur an investment when adding new customers during the first year as dilutive to EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow. And we typically don't begin to see the benefit of a new customer addition in our financial results until year 2. This impact is more evident when we generate higher levels of new customer additions, as we have done all year.
When you adjust for the expenses incurred to acquire new customers, you get a better sense of our company's operating results. In Q3, we grew pre-SAC EBITDA before special items by $16 million to $560 million, a 3% increase versus last year. Pre-SAC EBITDA margin was 66%. Protectron operates at a lower margin to ADT, so the consolidation of its results has had a dilutive impact to our total company margins when compared to prior year. This impact ends this quarter as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the Protectron acquisition in July. EBITDA before special items for the quarter was $451 million. The year-over-year EBITDA comparable was negatively impacted $2 million from the weak Canadian dollar and $6 million related to the change in accounting for our marketing efficiency program as well as from our growth investments and efforts to improve customer service levels.
We expect these items to be negative drags at EBITDA growth in Q4 as well. At Investor Day, we indicated that 2G spending will be reduced in the third quarter, as we evaluate some alternatives to extend the conversion period. We continue to pursue these efforts, but are less optimistic than a month ago, and we'll be accelerating our efforts to convert and upgrade the relevant customer base by calendar 2016 year-end.
GAAP EPS was $0.44 a share. Excluding special items, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.49, which includes the impact of $0.02 per share related to the change in how we account for the dealer payments for leads through the marketing efficiency program. This compares to non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.55 a share in 2014. Using our Q3 cash tax rate of 4.5%, our diluted earnings per share before special items was $0.68 for the quarter.
Our effective tax rate was slightly below 33%. We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in both gross adds and revenue per unit, which can be seen on Slide 12. Total company gross adds increased by nearly 5% year-over-year, driven by improved performance across both channels and in resi, business and health.
Gross adds in our direct channel were up nearly 4%, despite the headwinds caused by our enhanced credit screening, which management estimates filtered out about 4,000 potential sales. We have seen the attrition benefit from the credit screening and expect this benefit to increase. Gross adds at our dealer channel rose more than 6% from last year, as we experienced higher sales from existing dealers and benefited from Protectron's dealer channel production. We have worked diligently to optimize our dealer channel and are pleased with the results that they have now delivered year-over-year growth for the fourth conservative quarter. Average new and resale ARPU, both grew again this quarter, as we benefited from a more favorable mix of Pulse customers in our base and higher Pulse take rates. Success of Pulse expanded service offerings in our business channel and the launch of our premium price on-the-go emergency response system in our health channel, have all helped drive higher revenue per user over the past year.
For the quarter, new and resale ARPU was $48.19 cents, an increase of nearly 2.5% over the prior year. And ARPU for our overall customer base was $42.50, up nearly 1%. Adjusting for Protectron, which sells at different price points, and the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar, new and resale ARPU was up nearly 4%, while average ARPU was up 3.6%.
Increasing retention remains our top priority. This is being driven by improvements to the customer experience and higher levels of resales to former customers or new owners of ex-ADT customer homes.
Slide 13 shows these initiatives are paying off, as we improved attrition for the fifth consecutive quarter. Q3 trailing 12 month net revenue attrition was 12.4%, a sequential improvement of 10 basis points and a significant reduction of 150 basis points versus last year. Unit attrition, which measures customer attrition for just our residential and business customers, was 12.3% for the quarter, a 20 basis improvement versus Q2 and 120 basis point lower than Q3 last year. Although we guided at our Investor Day for attrition to stabilize over the summer months, we are internally targeting considerably lower levels of attrition over the next few years.
As discussed during our Investor Day meeting, the summer months are a time of increased relocation disconnections, which offset the higher amount of customer additions we generate during the same period. Compared to last year, we reduced our net customer losses by more than 30% in Q3. The gross disconnections offset our new customer additions by 28,000. We've made tremendous progress in our year-to-date net customer losses, reducing the organic loss figure year-over-year by over 80,000 customers. We remain committed to reporting net subscriber growth in fiscal 2016.
Moving on to Slide 14, which shows our quarterly results for recurring revenue margin and SAC creation multiples. For the quarter, recurring revenue margin on our existing customer base was about 66%, below the abnormally high 68% in Q3 last year. The decrease in margin is due to the consolidation of Protectron, which impacted our recurring revenue margins by 50 basis points, investments in launching new products and efforts to establish a commercial channel.
Increased spending to improve our customer service levels, such as reducing mean time to repair, has also impacted margins, but has had a positive impact in enhancing the customer experience and improving attrition. We reported lower subscriber acquisition cost versus prior quarter and lower net creation multiples versus prior year, despite higher Pulse take rates. Excluding Pulse upgrades, our combined net creation multiple improved by 0.3x to 30.7x in Q3, while the net creation multiple in our direct channel fell to 30.7x, a 0.4x improvement from last year. Dealer net recreational multiples also improved from last year and were 30.6x. Net SAC in our dealer channel -- in our direct channel, sorry, fell below $1500 to $1477 per install. Greater sales efficiency, the introduction of our new TS Panel and lower cost [indiscernible] combined with the implementation of electronic contracts, all helped reduce SAC and increased efficiency in the installation process.
Slide 15 details the Q3 components of free cash flow, as cash regenerated from existing customers and the cash associated with new subscriber acquisitions. For the third quarter, free cash flow was $99 million, up slightly versus last year, despite a 5% increase in gross adds. Free cash flow before special items for the first 9 months was $244 million. This is already above the $240 million we baselined for full year 2015 in our Investor Day presentation.
As I mentioned earlier, the growth in pre-SAC EBITDA before special items was driven by our operational improvements, cost reduction initiatives and our growth in Pulse customers. Pre-SAC free cash flow before special items this quarter was $513 million, up $33 million from last year. Investing in subscriber growth is the main driver of our ability to generate future free cash flow. In Q3, our total capital expenditures were $336 million, and over 92% of that amount was used to generate new customer additions. For the quarter, total SAC before special items was $414 million, up about 8% versus prior year.
The largest driver of the increased SAC spending was 5% growth in new subscriber adds as well as an increase in Pulse upgrades from 20,000 to 30,000 year-over-year. We are targeting free cash flow growth in fiscal 2016, despite expected further investments in the business, as we grow our subscriber base to increase gross adds and lower attrition.
Slide 16 details -- provides details of our steady-state free cash flow. We continue to make improvements in this long-term evaluation metric, which allows us to measure the free cash flow generated by maintaining recurring revenue from our existing customer base before investing in new subscriber growth. The key drivers to this metric, pre-SAC EBITDA, SAC creation multiples and attrition, are all moving in the right direction. This was somewhat offset by lower levels of pricing escalations, as we more tactically deploy this initiative as part of our attrition reduction program. For Q3, steady-state free cash flow before special items ended at $936 million, up slightly versus prior year.
Slide 17 highlights our capital allocation and debt levels for the quarter. Trailing 12-month leverage was 2.9x EBITDA and trailing 12-month debt-to-pre-SAC EBITDA was 2.3x. We've added the second leverage ratio to report a harmonized view similar to how most, if not all, of our security competitors report leverage and to reflect that EBITDA was low at about $80 million for the first 9 months, as a result of the change in how we reported the market efficiency program. Our long-term guidance remains 3x EBITDA, debt-to-EBITDA. Our total cost of borrowing remains low and was below 4% in Q3. Having a low cost to borrowing allows us to continue investing in growth and to return capital to our shareholders. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share, a 5% increase over last year and continue to be opportunistic on our share repurchases.
We also used a portion of our cash to invest in what we believe is the best investment in the security industry, and repurchased approximately $45 million of our own shares in Q3, contributing to the total $51 million in share repurchases since Q2. Year-to-date repurchases were approximately 5.6 million shares at an average price of $33.53 per share. Repurchases this quarter helped us bring the average diluted share count to $171 million, a 27% reduction from our share count and spin. In July, we also announced that our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program, authorizing us to purchase $1 billion of common stock throughout the next 3 years. The new share repurchase program expires on July 17, 2018, and is incremental to the $192 million remaining in the current share repurchase program, which expires on November 26, 2015.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Naren."

I think, once you get that baseline, all the assumptions really build up that baseline. So I don't want to continue to update that model. I think that was a scenario that when we report the full year results, we will give appropriate guidance for 2016.
Suffice to say that, there is definitely more cash in this business.

I'll highlight one, if you look at our Pulse solution, you actually will get a notification on your cell phone or mobile device or via email even before the signal would go to our monitoring center because of the required delays in the panel. That gives the customer the opportunity to cancel an alarm if it's a false alarm and really gives us that chance to reduce those false alarms by having the customer know earlier that alarm event was in their home. In some cases, they can even look in on cameras. So that's one particular example. We continue to work through the call list.

So again, there is no one silver bullet. This one, this is lots of work on the ground. And Mike just commented, big part of that is changing the culture of the organization.

Thank you for joining our call today.

Thank you for joining our call today. I hope you had a chance to at least briefly skim our earnings press release which was issued a little bit -- a little while ago and highlights our results for the third quarter of 2015. This morning, I'll discuss our key performance highlights for the quarter and the progress that we're making on our initiatives to drive future profitable growth. Then Mike will provide additional details on our financial and operational performance.
As you can see from our results, we delivered another quarter of improved operational performance, drove solid financial results and made progress on our plans for future growth. We drove quality gross-add growth and delivered strong revenue in the quarter. And our key operational metrics once again moved in the right direction, highlighted by another quarter of improved attrition.
We further strengthened our foundation for the future by making smart investments to improve our customer experience and fund our growth initiatives, which are targeted at the midsize commercial, health and unpenetrated residential markets. We also established some exciting new partnerships, which will allow us to bring new services to our existing customers and better enable us to pursue customers in these new market segments.
Overall, our performance this quarter reinforced our market leadership position and moved us further down the road towards achieving our longer-term goals.
Before I get into more details on the quarter, I'd like to discuss our performance in the context of our strategy and share with you my thoughts on the current status of our industry. First on the industry. The market for home security and automation services continues to be very dynamic, creating exciting new growth opportunities for ADT. As I've highlighted on previous calls and during our recent Investor Day, the growing interest in the smart home and Internet of Things has been one of the key drivers of market growth. And security remains at the top of the list of reasons consumers are buying smart home devices and associated services. In fact, a survey conducted by a major retailer indicated that over 60% of Americans cited security and home monitoring as the top beneficial reason to own a smart home solution. Needless to say, this is great news for ADT.
The evolution of the smart home and Internet of Things coupled with the changing needs of consumers in an always-on, connected world are opening up new market segments for ADT. This definition of security is evolving as consumers want to be safe and connected at all times, with a simple and secure way to interact with their families and their homes.
And as the industry evolves, ADT is also evolving to meet the needs of the market with our Smart Security approach that provides higher engagement through differentiated and flexible service offerings. These changing market dynamics in the residential market, combined with the investments we're making to help us pursue new customers in the commercial and health markets, result in a very large playing field for ADT.
In total, we expect our addressable market for residential, business and health to nearly triple over the next 5 years to over 70 million potential customers. From a competitive standpoint, our traditional market continues to be relatively stable. The evidence of this is in our sustained improvement in operating performance. We're continuing to drive year-over-year increases in gross adds, while attrition in the voluntary and lost-to-competition category is lower than it was a year ago. New and resale revenue per user continues to rise, driven by higher Pulse take rates, while average revenue per user for the base benefits from Pulse mix and price escalations. All of these indicate that price competition remains stable and we are able to demonstrate the value of our services to customers.
In addition, we remain focused on improving the efficiency of bringing on new customers and our improvement in SAC creation multiples proves we can attract new customers with favorable economics. Overall, market dynamics remain positive for ADT, and we believe we are in the best position to capture the growing opportunities today and in the future. No one else in our industry has the scale, brand recognition and installation sales, service and monitoring capabilities that ADT has to take advantage of these expanding opportunities.
As shown on Slide 3, our strategy for creating shareholder value is relatively simple. First, we're growing our traditional business by improving customer retention and adding quality new customers to our existing base.
Our focus on improving the customer experience has yielded steady improvements in customer retention. In addition, we're enhancing our Pulse platform, which has better retention characteristics than traditional offerings, by opening up our Pulse ecosystem to partners like Nest Labs. This allows us to give our customers the security and monitoring they need to protect their most important assets, along with the smart home and automation technologies they desire. Second, we're expanding into natural adjacencies, leveraging our competitive advantages in the business and health channels. In our business channel, not only are we pursuing larger footprints, small businesses and national accounts, we've also started to target midsize commercial businesses with security and fire protection service. This expanded focus dramatically increases the addressable market in our business channel, going from about $2.5 billion to about $24 billion, as we roll out our capabilities across our footprint.
Lastly, later this year, we'll be introducing new solutions to target a portion of the residential market that hasn't been reached by traditional security services. This is what I've referred to in the past as the other 80% of the market that does not have a monitored security solution. This market has tremendous potential for ADT. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we partner with a major consumer electronics manufacturer to develop an attractive all-in-one security device that will be supported with many of the monitoring and response services our current 6.6 million customers receive today. We are coupling these growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and management's focus on optimizing our capital structure and capital allocation. We're continuing to reinvest cash to grow our core business, remain disciplined in our strategic M&A activities and are returning excess capital to our shareholders via dividends and opportunistic share buybacks.
Of course, underpinning all of this is a relentless focus on the operating levers that drive our business. And as you will see on the next slide, it is clear that we are continuing to execute on our plan and are on the right path.
Slide 4 shows our performance over the past 12 months against 4 operating levers that are impacted by the competitive environment. Year-over-year, we've delivered increases in gross adds across all lines of business, improved customer retention by 150 basis points, increased new and resale ARPU by about 2.5% and reduced our direct sales channel creation multiple, which is the cash payback period for newly generated accounts in this channel. I view this chart as evidence that we're extending our market leadership position while improving business performance.
Touching on a few operational highlights for the third quarter, as shown on Slide 5. We grew gross subscriber additions by about 5%, with year-over-year increases in both our direct and authorized dealer channels. We accomplished this despite more stringent customer screening efforts in our direct sales channel, which filtered out about 4,000 lower quality prospects in the quarter. Continued strong close rates in phone sales, which were up about 12% year-over-year, contributed to our growth.
Our focus on quality customer growth and our investments in improving customer experience have led to unit and revenue attrition once again reaching new lows, since we became a public company.
We lowered revenue attrition to 12.4%, a 150 basis point improvement versus last year. And we reduced unit attrition to 12.3%, a 120 basis point year-over-year improvement. While our improvement initiatives allowed us to offset the effects of a more active housing market, the normal seasonal impact of summer movers drove higher disconnects in gross adds resulting in a loss of about 28,000 customers in the period. This is a meaningful improvement over the loss of 39,000 customers in the third quarter of last year, and we remain committed to turning to net add positive during 2016.
Moving on to our growth initiatives. Starting on Slide 6, I'd like to highlight our team's progress in our business and health channels. First, in our business channel, we're continuing to see strong momentum in our small business and commercial expansion efforts. Our small business channel continues to exhibit very strong growth, as we've improved sales execution and are now pursuing the larger footprint opportunities in this market. In total, business gross adds were up over 15%, while new and resale ARPU increased over 6% compared to last year. In the commercial market, we're continuing to invest in our product portfolio and expanding our sales force to position us to better serve midsize commercial customers. Our commercial efforts continue to gain traction, growing total revenue to $1.6 million during the quarter, a sequential increase of nearly 75%.
In the health market, we're continuing to capitalize on the new product introductions from late last year and earlier this year and new distribution channels to generate growth. Our new on-the-go mobile PERS product and new distribution channels have led to a 29% increase in gross additions and a 10% increase in ARPU. We are also evaluating new partners and distribution channels to accelerate future growth.
Turning to Slide 7, we are continuing to invest to enhance our customer experience, which will further reduce attrition, not only by driving new Pulse sales and upgrades, but also by introducing new technologies and processes. These include rolling out our new electronic order management platform, which we have now fully adopted in our small business channel and is nearing completion across our residential channel. We're also continuing to deploy the new wireless Total Security panel in our Pulse automation installation. These new tools and products yield both productivity -- operational productivity and a better customer experience. In future support of our customer service improvement efforts, this quarter we continue to invest to reduce the mean time to repair and install systems for our customers. As you likely -- and as you likely saw in our press release last week, we announced the initial rollout of a partnership with Nest Labs and the launch of our new Pulse mobile app. I'll talk more about these on the next slide.
As shown on Slide 8. We have expanded the service options and enhanced the experience for our customers, as our Pulse platform now supports the Nest Learning Thermostat. A critical part of our Smart Security approach involves combining best-in-class smart home security and energy management technology, providing our customers the security and monitoring they need, along with the smart home and automation technologies they desire.
We are now offering the Nest Thermostat as part of certain Pulse automation packages in Atlanta, Chicago, Denver and Miami and expect to expand nationwide by the end of the year.
This partnership with Nest is an example of our efforts to deliver advanced technology and differentiated solutions to enhance the experience and choice for our customers. Our Nest Labs partnership adds to a growing list of home automation partners for ADT. We expect to continue to collaborate with other players in the security and home automation industry, as we have recently developed an API architecture to accelerate the integration of innovative products within our Pulse platform.
Last week, we also announced the release of our new Pulse app, significantly enhancing the mobile experience for our Pulse customers. The app features a more intuitive and user-friendly experience, making managing home automation security simpler and more effective. The new Pulse app also supports our open API strategy, allowing for future integration for other best-in-class third-party solutions. The app is available for download for all Pulse customers via the Apple App Store and Google Play.
Another key component of our efforts to improve the customer experience and reduce churn is our continued investment in Pulse, our primary interactive services platform. Pulse continues to be an important driver behind our results, and in Q3, Pulse take rates again increased year-over-year.
On Slide 9, you can see that over 57% of our total gross adds during the quarter were Pulse units, up from 49% a year ago. And in our residential direct channel, the Pulse take rate for new and resale units was 63%, while more than 75% of all new residential customers added via this sales channel were Pulse customers. In our dealer channel, the Pulse take rate ramped to 54% from about 43% last year, and in our small business channel, the Pulse take rate was 40%.
In addition to new system sales of Pulse, we also upgraded about 30,000 existing customers this quarter. Pulse upgrades allow us to provide additional services to our existing customers and yield higher ARPU. In addition, these upgrades allow us to enhance the customer experience and enter into new contracts. We now have approximately 1.4 million Pulse customers with total interactive customers now comprising about 21% of ADT's customer base.
As we highlighted during our Investor Day presentation back in May, Pulse customers continue to demonstrate better retention characteristics than traditional security customers. Our analysis shows that Pulse customers overall have better retention stats, and retention further improves when customer choose automation features. Pulse automation customers, those using Pulse to control devices in their home, like door locks, thermostats or cameras, have significantly lower attrition. Equally important, our initial data shows that the resale rate, the rate at which we sign up a new customer who moves into a home where Pulse automation is already installed, is higher as compared to non-Pulse customers. As I previously mentioned, another important component of our strategy is to pursue customer growth in the nontraditional residential market, previously not served by ADT or other traditional monitored security service providers.
During the third quarter, we announced a new partnership and a new product and service bundle designed to target customers in this segment. 
Turning to Slide 10, at our Investor Day in May, we announced that we are working with LG Electronics to launch a new all-in-one security device with ADT services for this unpenetrated market. This market represents a significant component of the 70 million-plus addressable market available at ADT in the future. The new offering is a plug-and-play solution with no installation required. You simply plug it in, download the app, connect it to your Wi-Fi network, and you're off and running. It has all you need from a basic security perspective, and it can connect with many other home automation devices, allowing you to control these devices through the app. All you need is power and an Internet connection.
ADT will be offering service bundles, which include professional monitoring [indiscernible], video storage and retrievable, a very robust interactive platform and many of the other services that we provide to our current customers. Needless to say, we're very excited about this opportunity. What differentiates this from other offerings in the marketplace is that it's secured by ADT, with a direct connection to ADT's monitoring centers and associated response team, along with many of the other services that our 6.6 million customers enjoy today. The initial target market are customers who need smaller premises, renters and frequent movers, who need a flexible security solutions with no long-term contracts. The device also has an incredibly simple and intuitive mobile user interface. We've received positive response from our retail validation process, and we are targeting making this new product and service available later this year, as we enter the holiday season.
As we get closer to the launch, we'll provide more details on the go-to-market strategy, pricing and other details. However, we can say that this will be a low-to-no SAC product and a recurring revenue model for monitoring and video storage. Now let me turn things over to Mike to provide some additional details on our financial and operational performance during the quarter."

We delivered another quarter of solid operational and financial results. The focus remains the same, as it's been the entire year. One, improve the key customer-facing levers that drive long-term value and grow our customer base, gross adds, attrition and ARPU. Two, improve operating efficiencies in both cost to serve and SAC. And three, reinvest some of these efficiencies to enhancing the customer experience and our growth initiatives, as discussed earlier by Naren. Medium term, this plan will drive higher levels of profitability, free cash flow and net customer gains. In the quarter, we made improvements in our key operating levers and drove higher recurring revenue, pre-SAC EBITDA and free cash flow. Some of our investment initiatives have immediate or very short paybacks, while others such as the expansion of our commercial business in our DIY efforts will take more time to develop, but represent large material opportunities. We are excited about the future for ADT and the opportunity to create value for shareholders.
Over the next few slides, I'll review our Q3 performance and highlight our accomplishments during the quarter. Slide 11 summarizes our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter. In Q3, recurring revenue, which accounts for approximately 93% of our total revenue, grew 6.2% to $834 million, and total revenue increased by 5.8% to $898 million. When adjusting for the decline in the Canadian dollar, recurring revenue was up 6.8% and total revenue increased by 6.2%. We are reporting the FX impact only on ADT Canada, since Protectron was not part of our business at this time last year. However, our total Canadian operation, including Protectron, represents almost 10% of our total company revenues. Canadian dollar is now worth $0.76, which is approximately 16% lower than we gave guidance. In Q3, reported operating expenses before special items were up 11% over the last year with D&A increasing 9%.
The increase in total expense was driven primarily by the addition of Protectron and the change in accounting [ph] for dealer payments. Excluding Protectron and the impact of the marketing efficiency program, total operating expenses before special items were up 5.8% from last year. Most of the increase is related to investments such as enhancing the customer experience, entering the commercial business, expanding our health channel, rolling out the new Pulse mobile app and developing a new all-in-one product targeted at the DIY market. Excluding Protectron, D&A before special items rose by 5.8%. We continue to make progress in SAC and in the creation cost to acquire a new customer. As a subscriber-based business, we incur an investment when adding new customers during the first year as dilutive to EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow. And we typically don't begin to see the benefit of a new customer addition in our financial results until year 2. This impact is more evident when we generate higher levels of new customer additions, as we have done all year.
When you adjust for the expenses incurred to acquire new customers, you get a better sense of our company's operating results. In Q3, we grew pre-SAC EBITDA before special items by $16 million to $560 million, a 3% increase versus last year. Pre-SAC EBITDA margin was 66%. Protectron operates at a lower margin to ADT, so the consolidation of its results has had a dilutive impact to our total company margins when compared to prior year. This impact ends this quarter as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the Protectron acquisition in July. EBITDA before special items for the quarter was $451 million. The year-over-year EBITDA comparable was negatively impacted $2 million from the weak Canadian dollar and $6 million related to the change in accounting for our marketing efficiency program as well as from our growth investments and efforts to improve customer service levels.
We expect these items to be negative drags on EBITDA growth in Q4 as well. At Investor Day, we indicated that 2G spending will be reduced in the third quarter, as we evaluate some alternatives to extend the conversion period. We continue to pursue these efforts, but are less optimistic than a month ago, and we'll be accelerating our efforts to convert and upgrade the relevant customer base by calendar 2016 year-end.
GAAP EPS was $0.44 a share. Excluding special items, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.49, which includes the impact of $0.02 per share related to the change in how we account for the dealer payments for leads through the marketing efficiency program. This compares to non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.55 a share in 2014. Using our Q3 cash tax rate of 4.5%, our diluted earnings per share before special items was $0.68 for the quarter.
Our effective tax rate was slightly below 33%. We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in both gross adds and revenue per unit, which can be seen on Slide 12. Total company gross adds increased by nearly 5% year-over-year, driven by improved performance across both channels and in resi, business and health.
Gross adds in our direct channel were up nearly 4%, despite the headwinds caused by our enhanced credit screening, which management estimates filtered out about 4,000 potential sales. We have seen the attrition benefit from the credit screening and expect this benefit to increase. Gross adds at our dealer channel rose more than 6% from last year, as we experienced higher sales from existing dealers and benefited from Protectron's dealer channel production. We have worked diligently to optimize our dealer channel and are pleased with the results as they have now delivered year-over-year growth for the fourth conservative quarter. Average new and resale ARPU, both grew again this quarter, as we benefited from a more favorable mix of Pulse customers in our base and higher Pulse take rates. Success of Pulse expanded service offerings in our business channel and the launch of our premium price on-the-go emergency response system in our health channel, have all helped drive higher revenue per user over the past year.
For the quarter, new and resale ARPU was $48.19, an increase of nearly 2.5% over the prior year. And ARPU for our overall customer base was $42.50, up nearly 1%. Adjusting for Protectron, which sells at different price points, and the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar, new and resale ARPU was up nearly 4%, while average ARPU was up 3.6%.
Increasing retention remains our top priority. This is being driven by improvements to the customer experience and higher levels of resales to former customers or new owners of ex-ADT customer homes.
Slide 13 shows these initiatives are paying off, as we improved attrition for the fifth consecutive quarter. Q3 trailing 12 month net revenue attrition was 12.4%, a sequential improvement of 10 basis points and a significant reduction of 150 basis points versus last year. Unit attrition, which measures customer attrition for just our residential and business customers, was 12.3% for the quarter, a 20 basis improvement versus Q2 and 120 basis point lower than Q3 last year. Although we guided at our Investor Day for attrition to stabilize over the summer months, we are internally targeting considerably lower levels of attrition over the next few years.
As discussed during our Investor Day meeting, the summer months are a time of increased relocation disconnections, which offset the higher amount of customer additions we generate during the same period. Compared to last year, we reduced our net customer losses by more than 30% in Q3. The gross disconnections offset our new customer additions by 28,000. We've made tremendous progress in our year-to-date net customer losses, reducing the organic loss figure year-over-year by over 80,000 customers. We remain committed to reporting net subscriber growth in fiscal 2016.
Moving on to Slide 14, which shows our quarterly results for recurring revenue margin and SAC creation multiples. For the quarter, recurring revenue margin on our existing customer base was about 66%, below the abnormally high 68% in Q3 last year. The decrease in margin is due to the consolidation of Protectron, which impacted our recurring revenue margins by 50 basis points, investments in launching new products and efforts to establish a commercial channel.
Increased spending to improve our customer service levels, such as reducing mean time to repair, has also impacted margins, but has had a positive impact in enhancing the customer experience and improving attrition. We reported lower subscriber acquisition cost versus prior quarter and lower net creation multiples versus prior year, despite higher Pulse take rates. Excluding Pulse upgrades, our combined net creation multiple improved by 0.3x to 30.7x in Q3, while the net creation multiple in our direct channel fell to 30.7x, a 0.4x improvement from last year. Dealer net creation multiples also improved from last year and were 30.6x. Net SAC in our dealer channel -- in our direct channel, sorry, fell below $1,500 to $1,477 per install. Greater sales efficiency, the introduction of our new TS Panel and lower cost peripherals combined with the implementation of electronic contracts, all helped reduce SAC and increased efficiency in the installation process.
Slide 15 details the Q3 components of free cash flow, as cash regenerated from existing customers and the cash associated with new subscriber acquisitions. For the third quarter, free cash flow was $99 million, up slightly versus last year, despite a 5% increase in gross adds. Free cash flow before special items for the first 9 months was $244 million. This is already above the $240 million we baselined for full year 2015 in our Investor Day presentation.
As I mentioned earlier, the growth in pre-SAC EBITDA before special items was driven by our operational improvements, cost reduction initiatives and our growth in Pulse customers. Pre-SAC free cash flow before special items this quarter was $513 million, up $33 million from last year. Investing in subscriber growth is the main driver of our ability to generate future free cash flow. In Q3, our total capital expenditures were $336 million, and over 92% of that amount was used to generate new customer additions. For the quarter, total SAC before special items was $414 million, up about 8% versus prior year.
The largest driver of the increased SAC spending was 5% growth in new subscriber adds as well as an increase in Pulse upgrades from 20,000 to 30,000 year-over-year. We are targeting free cash flow growth in fiscal 2016, despite expected further investments in the business, as we grow our subscriber base through increase gross adds and lower attrition.
Slide 16 details -- provides details of our steady-state free cash flow. We continue to make improvements in this long-term evaluation metric, which allows us to measure the free cash flow generated by maintaining recurring revenue from our existing customer base before investing in new subscriber growth. The key drivers to this metric, pre-SAC EBITDA, SAC creation multiples and attrition, are all moving in the right direction. This was somewhat offset by lower levels of pricing escalations, as we more tactically deploy this initiative as part of our attrition reduction program. For Q3, steady-state free cash flow before special items ended at $936 million, up slightly versus prior year.
Slide 17 highlights our capital allocation and debt levels for the quarter. Trailing 12-month leverage was 2.9x EBITDA and trailing 12-month debt-to-pre-SAC EBITDA was 2.3x. We've added the second leverage ratio to report a harmonized view similar to how most, if not all, of our security competitors report leverage and to reflect that EBITDA was lowered about $18 million for the first 9 months, as a result of the change in how we reported the market efficiency program. Our long-term guidance remains 3x EBITDA, debt-to-EBITDA. Our total cost of borrowing remains low and was below 4% in Q3. Having a low cost to borrowing allows us to continue investing in growth and to return capital to our shareholders. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share, a 5% increase over last year and continue to be opportunistic on our share repurchases.
We also used a portion of our cash to invest in what we believe is the best investment in the security industry, and repurchased approximately $45 million of our own shares in Q3, contributing to the total $51 million in share repurchases since Q2. Year-to-date repurchases were approximately 5.6 million shares at an average price of $33.53 per share. Repurchases this quarter helped us bring the average diluted share count to $171 million, a 27% reduction from our share count and spin. In July, we also announced that our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program, authorizing us to purchase $1 billion of common stock throughout the next 3 years. The new share repurchase program expires on July 17, 2018, and is incremental to the $192 million remaining in the current share repurchase program, which expires on November 26, 2015.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Naren."

So I think, basically, what we're saying is clearly we expect to generate cash flow in the fourth quarter. So we're just indicating that the cash flows are pretty strong this quarter and now we're in -- with the $99 million we did report, we happen to be above that baseline. So you could probably take it as -- I don't want to add another forward-looking projection, but we are very confident that we're going to exceed those estimates we did. I think, once you get that baseline, all the assumptions really build up that baseline. So I don't want to continue to update that model. I think that was a scenario that when we report the full year results, we will give appropriate guidance for 2016.
Suffice to say that, there is definitely more cash in this business. And I think as we continue to report higher cash flows from our existing customer base, offset by investments we make in new customer additions. And I think what it really shows you is that was a model and a scenario. I think, we took everything in that number as being a very concrete 3-year projection, where I think I like to believe that our intentions are to do better than what we projected at the Investor Day and that was just really a sensitivity analysis and a scenario."

I'll highlight one, if you look at our Pulse solution, you actually will get a notification on your cell phone or mobile device or via email even before the signal would go to our monitoring center because of the required delays in the panel. That gives the customer the opportunity to cancel an alarm if it's a false alarm and really gives us that chance to reduce those false alarms by having the customer know earlier that alarm event was in their home. In some cases, they can even look in on cameras. So that's one particular example. We continue to work through the call list.

As Mike and I both mentioned in our comments, we continue to make investments in our service infrastructure to reduce the mean time to repair as well as mean time to install and through our customer survey activity we're seeing steady improvements in that initial install customer satisfaction as well as the anniversary survey. So again, there is no one silver bullet. This one, this is lots of work on the ground. And Mike just commented, big part of that is changing the culture of the organization. We've had a, historically, a sales, gross add-driven culture. And over the last 3 years, we've really been working to change that culture and get everybody focused on customer retention in addition to gross adds, not in lieu of."

Okay, albeit, it's our dot com [ph] services, but they are selling interactive services and it's at a higher level than they were selling before. ADT continues to move up the take rates well in Canada. So you're absolutely right, selling more Pulse, selling more interactive systems in Canada is another opportunity.

We hope you had a chance to review our previously issued earnings press release that highlights our results for the fourth quarter and our full fiscal year 2015. 
This morning, I will discuss our key performance highlights and accomplishments for the quarter and year, than our CFO, Mike Geltzeiler, will provide additional details on our financial and operational performance as well as our outlook for 2016. 
2015 was a pivotal year for ADT. We met or exceeded all of our major financial and operational goals and made further progress towards building a foundation for future profitable growth. 
Our continued focus on customer retention and quality growth resulted in our key metric moving in the right direction again in the fourth quarter, reinforcing that we're pursuing the right strategies and priorities. 
We continue to make smart investments in our business and establish new partnerships, positioning us well to execute upon our growth strategies. Many of the initiatives that fueled our performance in 2015 were launched in 2014 when we refocused our organization on improving customer retention by enhancing all aspects of the customer experience, attracting high-quality new customers in both our direct and dealer channels, selectively expanding into adjacent markets and exploring opportunities previously underpenetrated markets. 
As a result of our team's improved execution, the impact of these efforts first began to show through in our improved performance in the second half of 2014 and have continued to carry through in our results this past year.  We're proud of what we've accomplished and remain confident that our best years are still in front of us. 
The next 3 slides in the presentation deck reflect our report card for 2015. 
I'll begin with the key operating levers that drive our results. Slide 3 shows our performance over the past year on the 4 operating levers that are affected by the competitive environment. 
As you can see, we've delivered strong improvements in all 4 of these important levers. We increased gross adds across all lines of business and channels, improved customer retention by 130 basis points, increased new and resale ARPU by nearly 4% and reduced our direct channel creation multiple, which reflects the cash payback period for newly generated accounts. 
This chart is evidence that we remain competitively strong and are extending our market leadership position, while improving overall business performance. 
These operating lovers fueled our improved performance in 2015. As shown on Slide 4, which highlight some of our key accomplishments, we delivered solid recurring revenue growth and improved financial results throughout the year. Customer adds increased by more than 6% over last year despite enhanced customer screening and other new customer onboarding requirements. 
We also focused a portion of our sales and marketing activities on Pulse upgrades, which rose 63% for the year. 
Operationally, our primary focus continues to be on improved customer retention. For the year, we reduced attrition significantly, closing the year at 12.2% unit and revenue attrition, which is the lowest we have seen since the spin. This helped us reduce customer losses in 2015 and positions us well for net that growth in the future. 
We also further reduced the cost of adding new customers to the ADT family, resulting in our lowest creation multiples since we became a public company despite a steady increase in Pulse take rates. 
And speaking of Pulse, we increased total Pulse customers by 50% during the year, reaching 1.5 million customers. 
As I stated previously, Pulse was a standalone company, it would be the second largest residential security company in North America, only behind ADT. 
On the strategic front, we further strengthened our competitive position and paved the way for future profitable growth by expanding into new market segments and entering into key partnerships to improve our product portfolio. 
This year, we launched ADT Business, supporting our expansion in the small business channel and entry into the mid-sized commercial market. 
Our business channel delivered double-digit year-over-year new customer growth this year, and we're still in the early stages of our commercial expansion. 
We also enhanced our health business with the launch of our mobile PERS solution with full detection and added new distribution channels. 
We've opened up our Pulse ecosystem and partnered with innovative companies like Nest Labs to allow ADT customers to integrate with best-of-breed product like the Nest Learning Thermostat. 
After successful launch in 4 pilot markets, we're now making this integration available for our Pulse automation customers nationwide. 
We also launched the new ADT owned Pulse mobile app with more intuitive and easier navigation for our Pulse customers. 
And lastly, I n collaboration with LG, we announced a new all-in-one security device with ADT monitoring services to target the unpenetrated North American residential market, including renters and frequent movers. 
We've made significant progress on the product, associated services and retail distribution strategy, and we are now targeting the first calendar quarter of 2016 for our launch. We're very excited about what this means for our business in the future. 
On Slide #5, you can see our overall performance was strong as we met or exceeded our guidance for 2015 on a constant-currency basis. 
And on Slide #6, you can see some of our achievements for the fourth quarter. Mike will cover the quarter in greater detail, but I wanted to mention a couple items. 
Overall, our operating metrics continued to move in the right direction, highlighted by another drop in net unit attrition, which improved 100 basis points year-over-year and net revenue attrition, which improved 130 basis points from last year. Both ended the year at 12.2%. 
We generated 278,000 gross adds, about flat with prior year, excluding both account purchases as we continue to focus on quality customer additions that will provide longer tenure and higher financial returns. 
These strong operating metrics fueled growth in revenues, EBITDA and free cash flow on a year-over-year basis. 
Although we've shared Slide #7 before, I want to spend a minute on our strategy to create shareholder value as, I think, this reflects our strategic priorities very well. Our strategy is focused on 3 areas: Growing our traditional business, selectively expanding it to near adjacencies and partnering that to target the nontraditional residential market. 
The dynamic in the industry continues to be positive creating a tremendous opportunity for ADT. A key driver of our opportunity continues to be growing consumer interest in smart home and Internet of Things devices, along with their desire to be in control and safe and security remains at the top of the list of reasons for this consumer interest, which is great news for ADT. These changing market dynamics in the residential market, combined with the investments we're making in commercial and health, resulted in very large market opportunity for ADT. 
In total, we expect our addressable market to nearly triple over the next 5 years to over 70 billion potential customers. 
We're coupling this growth activities with our strong balance sheet and are focused on optimizing our capital structure and capital allocation. We continue to reinvest cash to support this organic growth, remain disciplined in our strategic M&A activities and are returning excess capital to our shareholders via dividends and opportunistic share buybacks. 
At the heart of our strategy is our focus on customer retention. As shown on Slide 8, we are continuing to strengthen and refine our focus on improving customer retention by doing 3 basic things: One, bringing on the right customer; two, onboarding them in the right way; and three, providing them a great customer experience. 
Doing these 3 things right is the key to further reductions in attrition and the right formula for improving customer economics and generating higher free cash flow. 
We've made much progress over the past 2 years in improving these areas, which is why we've seen a significant improvements in retention and net add performance. However, with new tools and analytics now at our disposal giving us better insights for the customer behavior and tendencies, we will make further improvements in the future. 
We started last year with enhanced tenure screening to target higher quality customers upfront before we spend money to add them into our network. This effort alone is still nearly 16,000 potential customer adds in the year and has contributed to a significant drop in attrition in the non-pay category. 
With the additional insights into customer behavior and the new tools such as our electronic order management platform, we are continuing to refine our approach and putting in place new customer requirements that will result in more engaged and longer tenured customers. 
Improving the customer experience is at the core of our strategy and Pulse customers continue to exhibit better economics and retention. 
On Slide #9, you can see that over 59% of our total gross adds during the quarter were Pulse units, up from 51% a year ago. 
In our residential direct channel, the Pulse take rate for new and resale units was 65% or more than 75% of all new residential customers added via this channel were Pulse customers. 
In our dealer channel, the Pulse take rate ramped up to 57% from about 47% last year and in our small business channel, the Pulse take rate was 41%. 
In addition to new Pulse sales, we also upgraded about 39,000 existing customers this quarter. Pulse upgrades allow us to provide additional service to our existing customers and yield higher RPU. 
In addition, these upgrades allow us to enhance the customer experience and enter into new contracts. We now have approximately 1.5 million Pulse customers with total interactive customers now comp -- comprising about 23% of our customer base. 
As we discussed during our Investor Day, Pulse customers continue to demonstrate better retention characteristics than traditional security customers. 
Our analysis also shows that retention further improves when customers choose automation features such as thermostats, light switches, door lock and cameras. 
Equally as important, our initial data also shows that the resale rate, the rate at which we sign up a new customer who moves into a home where Pulse automation is already installed is higher as compared to non-Pulse customers. 
Now let me turn things over to Mike to provide some additional details and financial and operational performance for the quarter and the year."

In our core operations, this means a disciplined, more acute focus on customer economics and return on invested capital. Hence, the term smart growth, quality growth and profitable growth describing our business objectives. 
As Naren said, by enhancing the customer experience and using data analytics to drive our customer acquisition practices, we believe we can attract the right customers with the right offerings and the appropriate SAC, and ensure that these customers remain with us longer. This approach does put some topline pressure on gross ad growth with a dividend and customer retention, lower SAC, higher margins and increased free cash flow. As we look ahead to 2016, we expect more to stay. I will discuss 2016 guidance later in my remarks. 
First, I'll review our Q4 and full year performance. Slide 10 summarizes our GAAP and non-GAAP financial results for the quarter. In Q4, recurring revenue, which accounts for approximately 93% of our total revenue, grew 2% to $835 million and total revenue increased by 1.8% to $899 million. 
Recurring revenue growth outpaced total revenue growth as we continue to add different products and services to our portfolio that generate recurring revenue in place of lower-margin onetime sales. 
For example, late in 2014, our business channel began to offer hosted video services that generate recurring revenue in place of onetime DVR sales. 
All this being said, in 2016, we will have the opportunity to grow nonrecurring revenue as our commercial channel continue to gain traction, and we broadened our service capabilities and product offerings. 
When adjusting for the Canadian dollar, which impacts approximately 10% of our total revenues and has declined significantly versus prior year, recurring revenue was up 3.4% and total revenue increased by 3.3%. 
In Q4, we put operating expenses before special items were up 3.9% over the last year, including a 5% increase in depreciation and amortization. 
Excluding the $8 million impact of the marketing efficiency program, total operating expense before special items were up just 2.7% in the quarter. 
Besides depreciation, the increased total expenses was driven by the growth of Pulse, investments in our commercial expansion and development of our new Pulse app and all in one DIY product as well as investments we have made to improve our service levels. 
EBITDA before special items was $460 million, which includes a negative impact of approximately $8 million related to the previously disclosed change in the way we account for our marketing efficiency program as well as a negative impact of approximately $5 million due to the decline in Canadian dollar. 
Adjusting for these 2 items, EBITDA was $50 million favorable to the prior year. EBITDA margin for the quarter was 51.2%, 100 basis point improvement from Q3.  Improvement reflects continued execution of our cost efficiency program. 
Excluding special items, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.51, which includes the impact of $0.03 per share related to the prior mentioned marketing efficiency program. This compares to non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.55 per share last year. 
Using our Q4 cash tax rate, diluted earnings per share before special items was $0.73 for the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 30.8% compared with 24.8% last year. 
Slide 10 also details our special items for the quarter. In Q4, we continue to make progress on our 2G radio conversion program, upgrading or converting nearly 40,000 customers in the quarter for a total of approximately 276,000 for the year. 
We have made significant progress since we started this project and have about 500,000 customers left we either need to upgrade or convert into new radio. We plan to complete most of these conversions in fiscal 2016 and finalize the program in our first quarter of fiscal 2017. 
Turning to the operating levers. Slide 11 shows gross adds and average revenue per unit for Q4. Overall, total company gross adds, excluding Pulse acquisitions were 278,000, the highest level of 2015 of flat versus last year. 
Our company's focused on quality growth combined with enhanced tenure screening created some slight headwinds to overall year-over-year growth but resulted in better financial results. Gross adds in our direct channel were up slightly, offset by dealer gross addition, which were nearly flat last year. 
Gross adds for ADT Business were up 17% and health adds were higher by 27%. 
Pricing continue to be an area of strength as both average and new and resale ARPU continue to grow in the fourth quarter. 
Overall, pricing remains healthy in our business as we continue to drive higher Pulse take rates with greater automation and grow our business channel, which has the higher ARPU. 
For the quarter, new and resale ARPU was $48.40, an increase of 3.4% over the prior year. Our RPU for the overall customer base was $42.65, an increase of nearly 3% year-over-year. 
When adjusting for the Canadian FX, RPU was up by 4% over last year. 
As I indicated earlier, the company is committed to pursuing profitable growth and enhancing customer expense, which leads to greater customer retention and loyalty. Slide 12 shows the progress we've made on customer retention. Attrition has improved for 6 consecutive quarters, reaching a new low in Q4. Net revenue attrition was 12.2%, sequential improvement of 20 basis points and a significant reduction of 130 basis points versus last year. Unit attrition, which measures customer attrition for just our residential and business customers, was also 12.2% for the quarter and 10 basis point improvement versus Q3 and 100 basis points lower than last year. 
Improvements was led by the progress we've made in gross attrition throughout 2015 as we reduced non-pay voluntary and lost the competition disconnection, combined with a 21% year-over-year increase in resales. 
Relocations skewed higher this quarter is the housing market improved but this is more than offset by attrition improvement elsewhere and by the higher resales. 
We are pleased with the progress we've made this year as our attrition results are materially favorable to both our guidance and prior year results. However, we see ample opportunity to perform better and are targeting further improvement in 2016. 
Slide 13 shows our quarterly results for recurring revenue margin and SAC creation multiples. For the quarter, recurring revenue margin in our existing customer base was about 66.6% compared to 67.5% in last year. And the recurring revenue margin is down versus last year, it increased sequentially by 70 basis points in Q4. 
Margins throughout the year have been pressured by our investments to expand into commercial, development of our new Pulse app and costs associated with the launch of our all in 1 DIY product. 
Additionally, increased spending to improve customer service levels and respond times have negatively impacted margins but contributed to improvements in customer experience and attrition. 
SAC is another favorable story for 2015. We've consistently lowered SAC in 2015 through marketing efficiencies, sales effectiveness and the installation processes by implementing electronic contracts, Total Security panel and lower cost equipment. 
Our combined net creation multiple improved by 0.8x to 29.8x in Q4, while the net creation multiple in our direct channel fell to 29.1x, a onetime improvement versus last year. 
Net SAC in our direct channel fell to nearly $1,400, below the average SAC levels in Q4 2014. 
We have lowered both total and direct channel creation multiples, excluding upgrade in every quarter this year, while also increasing Pulse take rates. 
Slide 14 details the components of our fourth quarter free cash flow results. The charts aggregate cash flow into cash generated from existing customers and cash invested to secure a newer upgrading system customers. 
Free cash flow before special items was $77 million in Q4, up $23 million or 43% versus last year. It's the second consecutive quarter of free cash flow growth, enabling us to finish 2015 with free cash flow before special items of $321 million, which is about 30% higher than the 2015 figure we baselined at our Investor Day in May. 
Pre-SAC free cash flow before special items was driven by lower attrition, operational improvements and growth in Pulse customers. 
For the quarter, pre-SAC free cash flow before special items increased by 5.6% to $510 million, up $27 million from last year. 
Investing in new customer growth is the main driver behind our ability to generate feature free cash flow and our quality growth initiatives enable us to focus on the customers, which we feel are most likely to meet our return criteria. 
Total SAC before special items for the quarter was $433 million, marginally above the $429 million in Q4 last year. 
For the year, free cash flow from our existing customers increased $116 million to almost $2 billion. This was partially offset by a $1.7 billion investment in new customers. 
This investment represents an increase of about 8%, driven by a 6% growth in gross adds and about 50,000 more Pulse upgrades. 
Slide 15 highlights the improvements we've made in our steady-state free cash flow results over last year. Steady-state free cash flow is a long-term valuation metric, which allows us to measure the free cash flow, generated by maintaining the recurring revenue from our existing customer base before investing in new subscriber growth. 
The key drivers to this symmetric, pre-SAC EBITDA, SAC creation multiples and attrition are all continuing to move in the right direction, which allowed us to improve our results over last year. 
Steady-state free cash flow before special items was $996 million, up $30 million versus prior year. When analyzing results in constant currency, steady-state free cash flow exceeded our guidance of $1 billion. 
Slide 16 highlights our capital allocation and debt levels for the quarter. Trailing 12-month leverage reached 3x EBITDA, and trailing 12 months debt to pre-SAC EBITDA was 2.4x. 
As a reminder, we began reporting pre-SAC leverage ratio to provide a harmonized view similar to how most if not all our security competitors report leverage by removing the expense investment in new subscribers. 
In addition, our EBITDA results were negatively impacted by about $25 million in 2015 as a result of the noncash change on how we report the marketing efficiency program. Our long-term leverage target remains 3x EBITDA. 
Our total cost of borrowing was below 4% in Q4 and our debt continues to trade at favorable levels. Having a low cost of borrowing provides us the flexibility to invest in growth and return capital to our shareholders. 
In the fourth quarter, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share or 5% increase over last year. 
In Q4, we also repurchased 4.3 million shares at an average price of $32.70 per share, contributing to the total of 9.8 million shares for $324 million of repurchases for fiscal 2015. 
With our cash flow increasing, our business payable and our growth initiatives adequately funded, we continue to view share repurchases at current price level as the preferred vehicle for excess cash. 
We have now reduced the diluted ending share count to 167 million, a 29% reduction from our share count and spend.  We currently have more than $1 billion available in our share repurchase program. 
Our company has significantly improved its operating and financial results since going public in 2012. We have a challenging first quarter 2014. We've improved our performance since then, meeting or exceeding our guidance again in 2015. 
On Slide 17, we highlight the quarterly trends for key financial and operational metrics for ADT. 
When analyzing in last 8 quarters, it's clear that our commitment to driving improvements in the 5 operating levers has been successful. Pre-SAC EBITDA and recurring revenue margins before special items has steadily improving throughout the year, ending their at their highest points since Q4. Steady-state free cash flow also had a new high this year, and we delivered 6% growth in gross adds for the year as we grew sequentially throughout 2015. Most important driver of our business is attrition, the improvements we have made over the last 6 quarters are significant as we improve attrition by 230 basis points. 
And last but not least, we've consistently lowered our direct SAC creation multiples throughout 2015 despite increases in automation take rates. 
We expect our focus on quality growth to continue to drive improvements to these metrics in 2016. 
So let's move to Slide 18 and address our 2016 guidance. We feel optimistic about the upcoming year due to the progress we've made in 2015 and initiatives we have underway and in the pipeline. 
We expect 2016 to be a year of improved operating metrics and financial growth, driven by an even greater focus on improving customer retention. This should drive better comp metrics, increased profitability and higher levels of free cash flow growth before special charges. 
The chart details our 5 primary financial and operating metric guidance for 2016. All growth levels are assumed to occur at constant exchange rates for prior year. 
Number one, we're calling for total revenue to grow between 3.5% and 4.5%. Most of this growth will come from increases in recurring revenue, although we also expect nonrecurring revenues to grow as we extend our commercial activities. 
We expect expansion activities in ADT Business and health to grow at accelerated rates. We also expect a modest level of recurring revenues in the launch of the LG all in one product. 
Two, we are targeting EBITDA before special items to grow in the range of $75 million to $90 million. Higher-quality sales by key leverage cost efficiencies, and synergies from the acquisition are expected to increase EBITDA margins for 2016. 
We'll also continue to invest in growth as we look to improve the customer experience, accelerate our expansion into the commercial market and launch our security offering targeted at the DIY marketplace. 
The EBITDA growth would have been higher if not for the estimated $12 million negative impact expected from the 53rd week we experienced in 2016. I will address this more in a moment. 
After finishing 2015 on a favorable note with $321 million of free cash flow before special items, we are guiding free cash flow to be higher for 2016. 
Better customer retention and more favorable mix of Pulse customers, higher ARPU and margins will drive at least 5% increase in free cash flow from operations. 
Somewhat mitigating this improvement is an expected increase in short-term interest rates. 
On the SAC side, we expect further improvements creation multiples resulting in capital spending increases, driven primarily by increasing gross adds and incremental Pulse upgrades. We do expect Pulse upgrades to temporarily increase in 2016 as we make a push to convert the remaining 2G customers to Pulse versus just replacing the radios. 
Four, improving the customer retention will continue to be our top priority in 2016. We are targeting net unit attrition to fall below 12% versus the Q4 rate of 12.2%. This will be driven by smarter customer acquisition, a retention program and higher account resales, particularly on relocation disconnects. 
And finally, we're targeting to increase our customer base in 2016 from our current position of 6.6 million costumers. 
In 2015, we lost about 70,000 customers, a 50% improvement over 2014. 
For 2016, we expect to grow gross adds, reduce customer disconnects and attract new customers via small opportunistic account acquisition at appropriate price levels. 
Two last points on guidance before I turn the call back to Naren for concluding comments. First, we're targeting the step up completion to 2G conversion program in the course of 2016. Technically, we have until calendar year end 2016 to complete this conversion. We'll be actively seeking to upgrade 2G customers to Pulse, but those who want, we'll just have to replace the radios. 
As is the case in 2015, we will report a special charge for the radio replacement cost. 
Lastly, I referred earlier to the 53rd week we report in 2016. Dating back to the Tyco period, ADT has utilized a 4 5 4 weekly calendar for reporting its quarterly earnings. 
This necessitates that once every 6 years or so, you have a 53rd week. 2016 is the year we have this extra week. 
As previously reported, our management and board have decided to use this timing to convert ADT to a traditional calendar month end period for reporting results beginning in 2016. 
Although this does not eliminate the 53rd week for 2016, it does ensure that this will not happen again and also aligns our reporting more appropriately with how we run the business. 
6 of this extra 7 days will occur in the first quarter as our reporting period begin on September 26 and ends December 31. 
Most of our revenues are monthly recurring revenues, so there is little impact to revenues as a result of the extra days. However, certain costs are negatively impacted such as hourly labor, desirable cost and marketing spend. 
For Q1, we expect the extra week to negatively impact EBITDA by $10 million EPS about $0.04. This impact this cash neutral and 1 time in nature. We expect Q1, 2017, to be incrementally favorable in 2016 by this onetime expense before factoring in any business improvement. 
Statistically, this will not affect our major operating metrics, only gross adds and gross disconnects will be affected by the extra days. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Naren."

As I reflect on our first 3 years as a public company, I'm very proud of what our team has accomplished despite some bumps in the road. We completed a very complex separation from Tyco, which included over 100 shared IT systems, hundreds of co-located field offices and over 2 million customers monitoring lines, which needed to be moved between the 2 companies monitoring centers. During this time period, we also significantly strengthened our focus on enhancing the customer experience through adding more automation capabilities to our Pulse platform, improving customer service levels and screening out prospective customers who do not have the potential to become customers for life. 
These improvements resulted in 150 basis point improvement in customer retention. 
In addition, we continue to position ourselves for future profitable growth by investing in Pulse, expanding our business activities into the mid-sized commercial market, completing 2 acquisitions to bring new capabilities and increase our scale and coverage in the Canadian market and establishing new partnerships and solutions that will allow us to enter previously unpenetrated segments of the residential market. 
As a result of these investments, we've been able to grow Pulse customer base to over 1.5 billion customers, increase recurring revenue by nearly 15% and expand our customer base by 279,000 subscribers during our first 3 years as a standalone company. 
As I look forward over the next few years, I'm even more excited about the potential to further improve business performance and deliver profitable growth. 
Our focus on quality growth and enhancing the customer experience should allow us to bring customer attrition down to historic low levels for ADT, below 11%. This will put us on a path for consistent annual net ad growth organically. 
Our continued investment in and customer preference towards Pulse should result in Pulse growing to at least half of our customer base over the next few years. And I expect our new business platforms to continue to grow with our business and health channels growing double digits annually for the foreseeable future as a result of organic initiatives and some small acquisitions while our efforts in the previously unpenetrated residential market could attract up to 1 million new customers over the next several years. 
This growth should allow us to continue to improve our profitability and position us to deliver over $500 million worth of free cash flow annually, which will be used to further invest in the business or reward our shareholders with higher dividends and/or share repurchases. Needless to say, this is a very exciting path for ADT as we work hard to build on our market-leading position in the security and automation market. 
With that, we can open up the call for questions. Stephanie, can you provide the instructions for dialers to ask a question?"

We're $64 million to the quarter so nonrecurring revenues is revenue we record everyday. We have 7 more days to realize nonrecurring revenue. So that is the only impact. So the reason it will not affect regular revenue is the best way to kind of describe that is describe it on a monthly basis. If the month of February, a customer pays $45 for their services, whether it's 88 in that month or 30 days or 31, we charged a monthly fee, we don't charge a per day fee. So we are booking -- we're  charging customers who are going to pay 1/12 of those, where they're going to pay annual amount divided by 12. So recurring revenues has been -- is not affected by this extra week. We still will have the same amount of months as we have last year so really only affects. And that's true, a lot of our fixed cost in our salaries aren't affected other. It's really the hourly cost and the district variable cost like marketing as well as nonrecurring revenue. So revenues are not affected by this. The customer will still pay 12x their monthly amount, it will be years worth regardless of how many days and a month."

So you can use it on-the-go. Similarly both for our wireless product and our mobile product, we added fall detection. So that gives you fall, you don't have to reach out and hit the button to call our monitoring center, our monitoring center, the product will text that and our monitoring center will call the individual to reach out through that to that bracelet. So we have changed and added the products and those makeup more than 50% of our sales these days. Good take rates on the fall detection as well. From a channel perspective, it is more looking at the bulk sales, looking out nursing homes or other organizations that may have large versus a traditional residential model, where you're looking at individual consumers. We're continuing to sell through individuals consumers, but we're also looking at more of those bigger account opportunities, and we've retooled the sales force, brought in new sales leader to pursue those kinds of opportunities.

As far as the quality growth piece, Jeff, again, I think what's happening is our ability to segment the data and segment customers better through our analytics is what's helping us just be a little bit more surgical than our approach. I think when you look at the economics on our portfolio basis, they've always been very good. We've talked about what the IRRs are. Now what we can do is -- we can ""remove"" some of those less attractive customers within a tranche and focus on the more attractive customers.

Thank you for joining our call today. We hope you had a chance to review our previously issued earnings press release that highlights our results for the fourth quarter and our full fiscal year 2015.
This morning, I will discuss our key performance highlights and accomplishments for the quarter and year. Then our CFO, Mike Geltzeiler, will provide additional details on our financial and operational performance as well as our outlook for 2016.
2015 was a pivotal year for ADT. We met or exceeded all of our major financial and operational goals and made further progress towards building a foundation for future profitable growth.
Our continued focus on customer retention and quality growth resulted in our key metric moving in the right direction again in the fourth quarter, reinforcing that we're pursuing the right strategies and priorities.
We continue to make smart investments in our business and establish new partnerships, positioning us well to execute upon our growth strategy. Many of the initiatives that fueled our performance in 2015 were launched in 2014 when we refocused our organization on improving customer retention by enhancing all aspects of the customer experience, attracting high-quality new customers in both our direct and dealer channels, selectively expanding into adjacent markets and exploring opportunities in previously unpenetrated markets.
As a result of our team's improved execution, the impact of these efforts first began to show through in our improved performance in the second half of 2014 and have continued to carry through in our results this past year. We're proud of what we've accomplished and remain confident that our best years are still in front of us.
The next 3 slides in the presentation deck reflect our report card for 2015.
I'll begin with the key operating levers that drive our results. Slide 3 shows our performance over the past year on the 4 operating levers that are affected by the competitive environment.
As you can see, we've delivered strong improvements in all 4 of these important levers. We increased gross adds across all lines of business and channels, improved customer retention by 130 basis points, increased new and resale ARPU by nearly 4% and reduced our direct channel creation multiple, which reflects the cash payback period for newly generated accounts.
This chart is evidence that we remain competitively strong and are extending our market leadership position, while improving overall business performance.
These operating levers fueled our improved performance in 2015. As shown on Slide 4, which highlight some of our key accomplishments, we delivered solid recurring revenue growth and improved financial results throughout the year. Customer adds increased by more than 6% over last year despite enhanced customer screening and other new customer onboarding requirements. We also focused a portion of our sales and marketing activities on Pulse upgrades, which rose 63% for the year.
Operationally, our primary focus continues to be on improved customer retention. For the year, we reduced attrition significantly, closing the year at 12.2% unit and revenue attrition, which is the lowest we have seen since the spin. This helped us reduce customer losses in 2015 and positions us well for net add growth in the future.
We also further reduced the cost of adding new customers to the ADT family, resulting in our lowest creation multiples since we became a public company despite a steady increase in Pulse take rates. And speaking of Pulse, we increased total Pulse customers by 50% during the year, reaching 1.5 million customers.
As I stated previously, Pulse was a standalone company, it would be the second largest residential security company in North America, only behind ADT. On the strategic front, we further strengthened our competitive position and paved the way for future profitable growth by expanding into new market segments and entering into key partnerships to improve our product portfolio.
This year, we launched ADT Business, supporting our expansion in the small business channel and entry into the mid-size commercial market. Our business channel delivered double-digit year-over-year new customer growth this year, and we're still in the early stages of our commercial expansion.
We also enhanced our health business with a launch of our Mobile PERS solution with fall detection and added new distribution channels. We've opened up our Pulse ecosystem and partnered with innovative companies like Nest Labs to allow ADT customers to integrate with best-of-breed products, like the Nest Learning Thermostat. After a successful launch in 4 pilot markets, we're now making this integration available for our Pulse automation customers nationwide.
We also launched the new ADT owned Pulse mobile app with more intuitive and easier navigation for our Pulse customers.
And lastly, in collaboration with LG, we announced a new all-in-one security device with ADT monitoring services to target the unpenetrated North America residential market, including renters and frequent movers.
We've made significant progress on the product, associated services and retail distribution strategy, and we are now targeting the first calendar quarter of 2016 for our launch. We're very excited about what this means for our business in the future.
On Slide #5, you can see our overall performance was strong, as we met or exceeded our guidance for 2015 on a constant-currency basis. And on Slide #6, you can see some of our achievements for the fourth quarter. Mike will cover the quarter in greater detail, but I wanted to mention a couple items. 
Overall, our operating metrics continued to move in the right direction, highlighted by another drop in net unit attrition, which improved 100 basis points year-over-year and net revenue attrition, which improved 130 basis points from last year. Both ended the year at 12.2%.
We generated 278,000 gross adds, about flat with prior year excluding bulk account purchases, as we continue to focus on quality customer additions that will provide longer tenure and higher financial returns.
These strong operating metrics fueled growth in revenues, EBITDA and free cash flow on a year-over-year basis.
Although we've shared Slide #7 before, I want to spend a minute on our strategy to create shareholder value as I think this reflects our strategic priorities very well. Our strategy is focused on 3 areas: growing our traditional business, selectively expanding it to near adjacencies and partnering to target the nontraditional residential market.
The dynamics of our industry continue to be positive creating a tremendous opportunity for ADT. A key driver of our opportunity continues to be growing consumer interest in smart home and Internet of Things devices, along with their desire to be in control and safe. And security remains at the top of the list of reasons for this consumer interest, which is great news for ADT. These changing market dynamics in the residential market, combined with the investments we're making in commercial and health, result in a very large market opportunity for ADT.
In total, we expect our addressable market to nearly triple over the next 5 years to over 70 million potential customers. We're coupling these growth activities with our strong balance sheet and are focused on optimizing our capital structure and capital allocation. We continue to reinvest cash to support this organic growth, remain disciplined in our strategic M&A activities and are returning excess capital to our shareholders via dividends and opportunistic share buybacks.
At the heart of our strategy is our focus on customer retention. As shown on Slide 8, we are continuing to strengthen and refine our focus on improving customer retention by doing 3 basic things: one, bringing on the right customer; two, onboarding them in the right way; and three, providing them a great customer experience. Doing these 3 things right is the key to further reductions in attrition and the right formula for improving customer economics and generating higher free cash flow.
We've made much progress over the past 2 years in improving in these areas, which is why we've seen a significant improvements in retention and net add performance. However, with new tools and analytics now at our disposal, giving us better insights into customer behavior and tendencies, we will make further improvements in the future.
We started last year with enhanced tenure screening to target higher quality customers upfront before we spend money to add them into our network. This effort alone has filtered out nearly 16,000 potential customer adds in the year and has contributed to a significant drop in attrition in the nonpay category.
With the additional insights into customer behavior and the new tools, such as our electronic order management platform, we are continuing to refine our approach and putting in place new customer requirements that will result in more engaged and longer tenure customers.
Improving the customer experience is at the core of our strategy and Pulse customers continue to exhibit better economics and retention.
On Slide #9, you can see that over 59% of our total gross adds during the quarter were Pulse units, up from 51% a year ago. In our residential direct channel, the Pulse take rate for new and resale units was 65%. While more than 75% of our new residential customers added via this channel were Pulse customers.
In our dealer channel, the Pulse take rate ramped up to 57% from about 47% last year. And in our small business channel, the Pulse take rate was 41%.
In addition to new Pulse sales, we also upgraded about 39,000 existing customers this quarter. Pulse upgrades allow us to provide additional service to our existing customers and yield higher ARPU.
In addition, these upgrades allow us to enhance the customer experience and enter into new contracts. We now have approximately 1.5 million Pulse customers with total interactive customers now comprising about 23% of our customer base.
As we discussed during our Investor Day, Pulse customers continue to demonstrate better retention characteristics than traditional security customers.
Our analysis also shows that retention further improves when customers choose automation features such as thermostats, light switches, door locks and cameras. Equally is important, our initial data also shows that the resale rate, the rate at which we sign up a new customer who moves into a home where Pulse automation is already installed, is higher as compared to non-Pulse customers.
Now let me turn things over to Mike to provide some additional details on our financial and operational performance for the quarter and year."
184157327,313700108,900918,"The ADT Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 11, 2015",2015-11-11,"Earnings Calls","The ADT Security Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Naren. 2015 was a transitional year for ADT, in which we improved both our operational and financial performance, positioning the company for future growth and increased profitability.In our core operations, this means a disciplined, more acute",2899,"Thanks, Naren. 2015 was a transitional year for ADT, in which we improved both our operational and financial performance, positioning the company for future growth and increased profitability.
In our core operations, this means a disciplined, more acute focus on customer economics and return on invested capital. Hence, the term smart growth, quality growth and profitable growth is describing our business objectives.
As Naren said, by enhancing the customer experience and using data analytics to drive our customer acquisition practices, we believe we can attract the right customers with the right offerings, at the appropriate SAC and ensure that these customers remain with us longer. This approach does put some top line pressure on gross add growth with dividends and customer retention, lower SAC, higher margins and increased free cash flow. As we look ahead to 2016, we expect more or the same. I will discuss 2016 guidance later in my remarks.
First, I'll review our Q4 and full year performance. Slide 10 summarizes our GAAP and non-GAAP financial results for the quarter. In Q4, recurring revenue, which accounts for approximately 93% of our total revenue, grew 2% to $835 million and total revenue increased by 1.8% to $899 million.
Recurring revenue growth outpaced total revenue growth as we continue to add different products and services to our portfolio, that generate recurring revenue in place of lower-margin onetime sales.
For example, late in 2014, our business channel began to offer hosted video services, that generate recurring revenue in place of onetime DVR sales.
All this being said, in 2016, we will have the opportunity to grow nonrecurring revenue as our commercial channel continues to gain traction, and we broadened our service capabilities and product offerings.
When adjusting for the Canadian dollar, which impacts approximately 10% of our total revenues and has declined significantly versus prior year, recurring revenue was up 3.4% and total revenue increased by 3.3%.
In Q4, reported operating expenses before special items were up 3.9% over the last year, including a 5% increase in depreciation and amortization.
Excluding the $8 million impact of the marketing efficiency program, total operating expenses before special items were up just 2.7% in the quarter.
Besides depreciation, the increase in total expenses was driven by the growth of Pulse, investments in our commercial expansion and development of our new Pulse app and all-in-one DIY product as well as investments we have made to improve our service levels.
EBITDA before special items was $460 million, which includes a negative impact of approximately $8 million related to the previously disclosed change in the way we account for our marketing efficiency program as well as a negative impact of approximately $5 million due to the decline of the Canadian dollar.
Adjusting for these 2 items, EBITDA was $15 million favorable at a prior year. EBITDA margin for the quarter was 51.2%, 100 basis point improvement from Q3. Improvement reflects continued execution of our cost efficiency program. Excluding special items, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.51, which includes the impact of $0.03 per share related to the prior mentioned marketing efficiency program. This compares to non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.55 per share last year. Using our Q4 cash tax rate, diluted earnings per share before special items was $0.73 for the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 30.8% compared with 24.8% last year.
Slide 10 also details our special items for the quarter. In Q4, we continue to make progress on our 2G radio conversion program, upgrading or converting nearly 40,000 customers in the quarter for a total of approximately 276,000 for the year.
We have made significant progress since the start of this project and have about 500,000 customers left who either need to upgrade or convert to a new radio. We plan to complete most of these conversions in fiscal 2016 and finalize the program in our first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Turning to the operating levers. Slide 11 shows gross adds and average revenue per unit for Q4. Overall, total company gross adds, excluding bulk acquisitions were 278,000, the highest level of 2015 of flat versus last year.
Our company's focus on quality growth combined with enhanced tenure screening created some slight headwinds to overall year-over-year growth, but resulted in better financial results. Gross adds in our direct channel were up slightly, offset by dealer gross additions, which were nearly flat to last year. Gross adds for ADT Business were up 17% and health adds were higher by 27%. Pricing continues to be an area of strength, as both average and new and resale ARPU continue to grow in the fourth quarter.
Overall, pricing remains healthy in our business as we continue to drive higher Pulse take rates with greater automation and grow our business channel, which has a higher ARPU.
For the quarter, new and resale ARPU was $48.40, an increase of 3.4% over the prior year. Our ARPU for the overall customer base was $42.65, an increase of nearly 3% year-over-year. When adjusting for the Canadian FX, ARPU was up by 4% over last year. As I indicated earlier, the company is committed to pursuing profitable growth and enhancing customer experience, which leads to greater customer retention and loyalty.
Slide 12 shows the progress we've made on customer retention. Attrition has improved for 6 consecutive quarters, reaching a new low in Q4. Net revenue attrition was 12.2%, sequential improvement of 20 basis points and a significant reduction of 130 basis points versus last year. Unit attrition, which measures customer attrition for just our residential and business customers, was also 12.2% for the quarter, a 10 basis point improvement versus Q3 and 100 basis points lower than last year.
Improvements are led by the progress we've made in gross attrition throughout 2015, as we reduced nonpay, voluntary and lost the competition disconnections, combined with a 21% year-over-year increase in resales.
Relocations skewed higher this quarter as the housing market improved, but this is more than offset by attrition improvement elsewhere and by the higher resales.
We are pleased with the progress we've made this year as our attrition results are materially favorable to both our guidance and prior year results. However, we see ample opportunity to perform better and are targeting further improvement in 2016.
Slide 13 shows our quarterly results for recurring revenue margin and SAC creation multiples. For the quarter, recurring revenue margin in our existing customer base was about 66.6% compared to 67.5% in last year. While the recurring revenue margin is down versus last year, it increased sequentially by 70 basis points in Q4.
Margins throughout the year have been pressured by our investments to expand into commercial, development of our new Pulse app and costs associated with the launch of our all-in-one DIY product.
Additionally, increased spending to improve customer service levels and response times have negatively impacted margins, but contributed to improvements in customer experience and attrition.
SAC is another favorable story for 2015. We've consistently lowered SAC in 2015 through marketing efficiencies, sales effectiveness and the installation processes by implementing electronic contracts, Total Security panel and lower cost equipment.
Our combined net creation multiple improved by 0.8x to 29.8x in Q4, while the net creation multiple in our direct channel fell to 29.1x, a onetime improvement versus last year. 
Net SAC in our direct channel fell to nearly $1,400, below the average SAC levels in Q4 2014. We have lowered both total and direct channel creation multiples, excluding upgrades in every quarter this year, while also increasing Pulse take rates.
Slide 14 details the components of our fourth quarter free cash flow results. The charts aggregate cash flow into cash generated from existing customers and cash invested to secure a new or upgrade existing customers.
Free cash flow before special items was $77 million in Q4, up $23 million or 43% versus last year. It's the second consecutive quarter of free cash flow growth, enabling us to finish 2015 with free cash flow before special items of $321 million, which is about 30% higher than the 2015 figure we baselined at our Investor Day in May.
Pre-SAC, free cash flow before special items was driven by lower attrition, operational improvements and growth in Pulse customers.
For the quarter, pre-SAC free cash flow before special items increased by 5.6% to $510 million, up $27 million from last year.
Investing in new customer growth is the main driver behind our ability to generate future free cash flow and our quality growth initiatives enable us to focus on the customers, which we feel are most likely to meet our return criteria.
Total SAC before special items for the quarter was $433 million, marginally above the $429 million in Q4 last year. For the year, free cash flow from our existing customers increased $116 million to almost $2 billion. This was partially offset by a $1.7 billion investment in new customers. 
This investment represents an increase of about 8%, driven by a 6% growth in gross adds and about 50,000 more Pulse upgrades.
Slide 15 highlights the improvements we've made in our steady-state free cash flow results over last year. Steady-state free cash flow is a long-term valuation metric, which allows us to measure the free cash flow generated by maintaining the recurring revenue from our existing customer base before investing in new subscriber growth.
The key drivers to this symmetric, pre-SAC EBITDA, SAC creation multiples and attrition are all continuing to move in the right direction, which allowed us to improve our results over last year.
Steady-state free cash flow before special items was $996 million, up $30 million versus prior year. When analyzing results in constant currency, steady-state free cash flow exceeded our guidance of $1 billion. 
Slide 16 highlights our capital allocation and debt levels for the quarter. Trailing 12-month leverage reached 3x EBITDA and trailing 12-month debt-to-pre-SAC EBITDA was 2.4x.
As a reminder, we began reporting pre-SAC leverage ratio to provide a harmonized view similar to how most, if not all, our security competitors report leverage by removing the expense investment in new subscribers.
In addition, our EBITDA results were negatively impacted by about $25 million in 2015 as a result of the noncash change in how we report the marketing efficiency program. Our long-term leverage target remains 3x EBITDA.
Our total cost of borrowing was below 4% in Q4 and our debt continues to trade at favorable levels. Having a low cost of borrowing provides us the flexibility to invest in growth and return capital to our shareholders.
In the fourth quarter, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share or 5% increase over last year.
In Q4, we also repurchased 4.3 million shares at an average price of $32.70 per share, contributing to the total of 9.8 million shares for $324 million of repurchases for fiscal 2015.
With our cash flow increasing, our business stable and our growth initiatives adequately funded, we continue to view share repurchases at current price level as the preferred vehicle for excess cash.
We have now reduced the diluted ending share count to 167 million, a 29% reduction from our share count and spend. We currently have more than $1 billion available in our share repurchase program.
Our company has significantly improved its operating and financial results since going public in 2012. We've had a challenging first quarter 2014. We've improved our performance since then, meeting or exceeding our guidance again in 2015.
On Slide 17, we highlight the quarterly trends for key financial and operational metrics for ADT.
When analyzing last 8 quarters, it's clear that our commitment to driving improvements in the 5 operating levers has been successful. Pre-SAC EBITDA and recurring revenue margins before special items has been steadily improving throughout the year, ending at their highest points since Q4. Steady-state free cash flow also had a new high this year, and we delivered 6% growth in gross adds for the year, as we grew sequentially throughout 2015. The most important driver of our business is attrition. The improvements we've made in the last 6 quarters are significant, as we improved attrition by 230 basis points.
And last but not least, we've consistently lowered our direct SAC creation multiples throughout 2015, despite increases in automation take rates.
We expect our focus on quality growth to continue to drive improvements to these metrics in 2016.
So let's move to Slide 18 and address our 2016 guidance. We feel optimistic about the upcoming year due to the progress we've made in 2015 and the initiatives we have underway and in the pipeline.
We expect 2016 to be a year of improved operating metrics and financial growth, driven by an even greater focus on improving customer retention. This should drive better customer metrics, increased profitability and higher levels of free cash flow growth before special charges.
The chart details our 5 primary financial and operating metric guidance for 2016. All growth levels are assumed to occur at constant exchange rates with prior year. 
Number one, we're calling for total revenue to grow between 3.5% and 4.5%. Most of this growth will come from increases in recurring revenue, although we also expect nonrecurring revenues to grow as we extend our commercial activities. We expect expansion activities in ADT Business and health to grow at accelerated rates. We also expect a modest level of recurring revenues from the launch of the LG all-in-one product.
Two, we are targeting EBITDA before special items to grow in the range of $75 million to $90 million. Higher-quality sales by key leverage cost efficiencies and synergies from the Protectron integration are expected to increase EBITDA margins for 2016.
We'll also continue to invest in growth as we look to improve the customer experience, accelerate our expansion into the commercial market and launch our security offering targeted at the DIY marketplace.
The EBITDA growth would have been higher, if not for the estimated $12 million negative impact, expected from the 53rd week we'll experienced in 2016. I will address this more in a moment. After finishing 2015 on a favorable note with $321 million of free cash flow before special items, we are guiding free cash flow to be higher for 2016.
Better customer retention and more favorable mix of Pulse customers, higher ARPU and margins will drive at least 5% increase in free cash flow from operations.
Somewhat mitigating this improvement is an expected increase in short-term interest rates.
On the SAC side, we expect further improvements in subscriber creation multiples resulting in capital spending increases, driven primarily by increasing gross adds and incremental Pulse upgrades. We do expect Pulse upgrades to temporarily increase in 2016 as we make a push to convert the remaining 2G customers to Pulse versus just replacing the radios.
Four, improving the customer retention will continue to be our top priority in 2016. We are targeting net unit attrition to fall below 12% versus the Q4 rate of 12.2%. This will be driven by smarter customer acquisition, a retention program and higher account resales, particularly on relocation disconnects. 
And finally, we're targeting to increase our customer base in 2016 from our current position of 6.6 million costumers.
In 2015, we lost about 70,000 customers, a 50% improvement over 2014.
For 2016, we expect to grow gross adds, reduce customer disconnects and attract new customers via small opportunistic account acquisitions at appropriate price levels.
Two last points on guidance before I turn the call back to Naren for concluding comments. First, we're targeting to step-up completion to the 2G conversion program in the course of 2016. Technically, we have until calendar year-end 2016 to complete this conversion. We'll be actively seeking to upgrade 2G customers to Pulse, but those that won't will just have to replace their radios.
As was the case in 2015, we will report a special charge for the radio replacement cost.
Lastly, I referred earlier to the 53rd week we report in 2016. Dating back to the Tyco period, ADT has utilized a 4-5-4 weekly calendar for reporting its quarterly earnings. This necessitates that once every 6 years or so, you have a 53rd week. 2016 is the year we have this extra week.
As previously reported, our management and Board have decided to use this timing to convert ADT to a traditional calendar month-end period for reporting results beginning in 2016.
Although this does not eliminate the 53rd week for 2016, it does ensure that this will not happen again and also aligns our reporting more appropriately with how we run the business.
Six of the extra 7 days will occur in the first quarter as our reporting period began on September 26 and ends December 31.
Most of our revenues are monthly recurring revenues, so there is little impact to revenues as a result of the extra days. However, certain costs are negatively impacted such as hourly labor, [indiscernible] cost and marketing spend.
For Q1, we expect the extra week to negatively impact EBITDA by $10 million and EPS about $0.04. This impact is cash neutral and one-time in nature. We expect Q1 2017 to be incrementally favorable than 2016 by this one-time expense before factoring in any business improvement.
Statistically, this will not affect our major operating metrics. Only gross adds and gross disconnects will be affected by the extra days.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Naren."

As a reflect on our first 3 years as a public company, I'm very proud of what our team has accomplished despite some bumps in the road. We completed a very complex separation from Tyco, which included over 100 shared IT systems, hundreds of co-located field offices and over 2 million customer monitoring lines, which needed to be moved between the 2 companies monitoring centers. During this time period, we also significantly strengthened our focus on enhancing the customer experience through adding more automation capabilities to our Pulse platform, improving customer service levels and screening out prospective customers who do not have the potential to become customers for life. These improvements resulted in 150 basis point improvement in customer retention.
In addition, we continue to position ourselves for future profitable growth by investing in Pulse, expanding our business activities into the mid-size commercial market, completing 2 acquisitions to bring new capabilities and increase our scale and coverage in the Canadian market, and establishing new partnerships and solutions that will allow us to enter previously unpenetrated segments of the residential market.
As a result of these investments, we've been able to grow Pulse customer base to over 1.5 million customers, increased recurring revenue by nearly 15% and expand our customer base by 279,000 subscribers during our first 3 years as a standalone company.
As I look forward over the next few years, I'm even more excited about the potential to further improve business performance and deliver profitable growth.
Our focus on quality growth and enhancing the customer experience should allow us to bring customer attrition down to historic low levels for ADT, below 11%. This will put us on a path for consistent annual net add growth organically.
Our continued investment in customer preference towards Pulse should result in Pulse growing to at least half of our customer base over the next few years. And I expect our new business platforms to continue to grow with our business and health channels growing double digits annually for the foreseeable future as a result of organic initiatives and some small acquisitions while our efforts in the previously unpenetrated residential market could attract up to 1 million new customers over the next several years. 
This growth should allow us to continue to improve our profitability and position us to deliver over $500 million worth of free cash flow annually, which will be used to further invest in the business or reward our shareholders with higher dividends and/or share repurchases. Needless to say, this is a very exciting path for ADT as we work hard to build on our market-leading position in the security and automation market.
With that, we can open up the call for questions. Stephanie, can you provide the instructions for dialers to ask a question?"

So recurring revenues has been -- is not affected by this extra week. We still will have the same amount of months as we had last year. So it really only affects -- and as true, a lot of our fixed cost and our salaries aren't affected either. It's really the hourly cost and the strict variable cost like marketing as well as nonrecurring revenue. So revenues are not affected by this. The customer will still pay 12x their monthly amount. It will be [indiscernible] years worth regardless of how many days are in a month."

So clearly, we want to be pursuing more customers who are implying to buy Pulse and Pulse Automation specifically. We've indicated that those who buy life safety solutions versus just intrusion solutions tend to be stickier. How they pay, again, and I think we've been very good at this by making sure that we get credit card or ACH payment. And then, I'd say the final thing that we continue to look at is how much the customer invests upfront. It's their level of engagement is driven by the investment that they make upfront. So it's a variety of parameters. I think our analytics are much better than they were 2 years ago, 3 years ago.

So we have changed and added the products, and those makeup more than 50% of our sales these days. And we are seeing good take rates on the fall detection as well.

We're continuing to sell through individual consumers, but we're also looking at more of those bigger account opportunities, and we've retooled the sales force, brought in a new sales leader to pursue those kinds of opportunities.

Is the Pulse attrition rates still tracking to that roughly kind of 30% better than kind of historical attrition now that you got, maybe what, 4 or 5 years of history now of Pulse customers? And also just kind of part of that, I was wondering, it obviously makes sense to kind of try to attract higher-quality customers on any day in any business, but does that focus in any way indicate that some of the experience on the early Pulse customers hasn't been quite as good as you thought, and so there's a further kind of level of scrutiny and screening around Pulse, specifically, sorry for the multipart?"

I would refer back to some of the data we shared in our Investor Day and things are continuing to hold there. As far as the quality growth piece, Jeff, again, I think what's happening is our ability to segment the data and segment customers better through our analytics is what's helping us just be a little bit more surgical than our approach. I think when you look at the economics on our portfolio basis, they've always been very good. We've talked about what the IRRs are.

Thank you for joining our call today. We hope you had a chance to review our previously issued earnings press release that highlights our results for the fourth quarter and our full fiscal year 2015.
This morning, I will discuss our key performance highlights and accomplishments for the quarter and year. Then our CFO, Mike Geltzeiler, will provide additional details on our financial and operational performance as well as our outlook for 2016.
2015 was a pivotal year for ADT. We met or exceeded all of our major financial and operational goals and made further progress towards building a foundation for future profitable growth.
Our continued focus on customer retention and quality growth resulted in our key metrics moving in the right direction again in the fourth quarter, reinforcing that we're pursuing the right strategies and priorities.
We continue to make smart investments in our business and establish new partnerships, positioning us well to execute upon our growth strategy. Many of the initiatives that fueled our performance in 2015 were launched in 2014 when we refocused our organization on improving customer retention by enhancing all aspects of the customer experience, attracting high-quality new customers in both our direct and dealer channels, selectively expanding into adjacent markets and exploring opportunities in previously unpenetrated markets.
As a result of our team's improved execution, the impact of these efforts first began to show through in our improved performance in the second half of 2014 and have continued to carry through in our results this past year. We're proud of what we've accomplished and remain confident that our best years are still in front of us.
The next 3 slides in the presentation deck reflect our report card for 2015.
I'll begin with the key operating levers that drive our results. Slide 3 shows our performance over the past year on the 4 operating levers that are affected by the competitive environment.
As you can see, we've delivered strong improvements in all 4 of these important levers. We increased gross adds across all lines of business and channels, improved customer retention by 130 basis points, increased new and resale ARPU by nearly 4% and reduced our direct channel creation multiple, which reflects the cash payback period for newly generated accounts.
This chart is evidence that we remain competitively strong and are extending our market leadership position, while improving overall business performance.
These operating levers fueled our improved performance in 2015. As shown on Slide 4, which highlight some of our key accomplishments, we delivered solid recurring revenue growth and improved financial results throughout the year. Customer adds increased by more than 6% over last year despite enhanced customer screening and other new customer onboarding requirements. We also focused a portion of our sales and marketing activities on Pulse upgrades, which rose 63% for the year.
Operationally, our primary focus continues to be on improved customer retention. For the year, we reduced attrition significantly, closing the year at 12.2% unit and revenue attrition, which is the lowest we have seen since the spin. This helped us reduce customer losses in 2015 and positions us well for net add growth in the future.
We also further reduced the cost of adding new customers to the ADT family, resulting in our lowest creation multiples since we became a public company despite a steady increase in Pulse take rates. And speaking of Pulse, we increased total Pulse customers by 50% during the year, reaching 1.5 million customers.
As I stated previously, if Pulse was a standalone company, it would be the second largest residential security company in North America, only behind ADT. On the strategic front, we further strengthened our competitive position and paved the way for future profitable growth by expanding into new market segments and entering into key partnerships to improve our product portfolio.
This year, we launched ADT Business, supporting our expansion in the small business channel and entry into the mid-size commercial market. Our business channel delivered double-digit year-over-year new customer growth this year, and we're still in the early stages of our commercial expansion.
We also enhanced our health business with a launch of our Mobile PERS solution with fall detection and added new distribution channels. We've opened up our Pulse ecosystem and partnered with innovative companies like Nest Labs to allow ADT customers to integrate with best-of-breed products, like the Nest Learning Thermostat. After a successful launch in 4 pilot markets, we're now making this integration available for our Pulse automation customers nationwide.
We also launched the new ADT-owned Pulse mobile app with more intuitive and easier navigation for our Pulse customers.
And lastly, in collaboration with LG, we announced a new all-in-one security device with ADT monitoring services to target the unpenetrated North America residential market, including renters and frequent movers.
We've made significant progress on the product, associated services and retail distribution strategy, and we are now targeting the first calendar quarter of 2016 for our launch. We're very excited about what this means for our business in the future.
On Slide #5, you can see our overall performance was strong, as we met or exceeded our guidance for 2015 on a constant-currency basis. And on Slide #6, you can see some of our achievements for the fourth quarter. Mike will cover the quarter in greater detail, but I wanted to mention a couple items. 
Overall, our operating metrics continued to move in the right direction, highlighted by another drop in net unit attrition, which improved 100 basis points year-over-year and net revenue attrition, which improved 130 basis points from last year. Both ended the year at 12.2%.
We generated 278,000 gross adds, about flat with prior year excluding bulk account purchases, as we continue to focus on quality customer additions that will provide longer tenure and higher financial returns.
These strong operating metrics fueled growth in revenues, EBITDA and free cash flow on a year-over-year basis.
Although we've shared Slide #7 before, I want to spend a minute on our strategy to create shareholder value as I think this reflects our strategic priorities very well. Our strategy is focused on 3 areas: growing our traditional business, selectively expanding it to near adjacencies and partnering to target the nontraditional residential market.
The dynamics of our industry continue to be positive creating a tremendous opportunity for ADT. A key driver of our opportunity continues to be growing consumer interest in smart home and Internet of Things devices, along with their desire to be in control and safe. And security remains at the top of the list of reasons for this consumer interest, which is great news for ADT. These changing market dynamics in the residential market, combined with the investments we're making in commercial and health, result in a very large market opportunity for ADT.
In total, we expect our addressable market to nearly triple over the next 5 years to over 70 million potential customers. We're coupling these growth activities with our strong balance sheet and are focused on optimizing our capital structure and capital allocation. We continue to reinvest cash to support this organic growth, remain disciplined in our strategic M&A activities and are returning excess capital to our shareholders via dividends and opportunistic share buybacks.
At the heart of our strategy is our focus on customer retention. As shown on Slide 8, we are continuing to strengthen and refine our focus on improving customer retention by doing 3 basic things: one, bringing on the right customer; two, onboarding them in the right way; and three, providing them a great customer experience. Doing these 3 things right is the key to further reductions in attrition and the right formula for improving customer economics and generating higher free cash flow.
We've made much progress over the past 2 years in improving in these areas, which is why we've seen a significant improvements in retention and net add performance. However, with new tools and analytics now at our disposal, giving us better insights into customer behavior and tendencies, we will make further improvements in the future.
We started last year with enhanced tenure screening to target higher quality customers upfront before we spend money to add them into our network. This effort alone has filtered out nearly 16,000 potential customer adds in the year and has contributed to a significant drop in attrition in the nonpay category.
With the additional insights into customer behavior and the new tools, such as our electronic order management platform, we are continuing to refine our approach and putting in place new customer requirements that will result in more engaged and longer tenure customers.
Improving the customer experience is at the core of our strategy and Pulse customers continue to exhibit better economics and retention.
On Slide #9, you can see that over 59% of our total gross adds during the quarter were Pulse units, up from 51% a year ago. In our residential direct channel, the Pulse take rate for new and resale units was 65%. While more than 75% of all new residential customers added via this channel were Pulse customers.
In our dealer channel, the Pulse take rate ramped up to 57% from about 47% last year. And in our small business channel, the Pulse take rate was 41%.
In addition to new Pulse sales, we also upgraded about 39,000 existing customers this quarter. Pulse upgrades allow us to provide additional service to our existing customers and yield higher ARPU.
In addition, these upgrades allow us to enhance the customer experience and enter into new contracts. We now have approximately 1.5 million Pulse customers with total interactive customers now comprising about 23% of our customer base.
As we discussed during our Investor Day, Pulse customers continue to demonstrate better retention characteristics than traditional security customers.
Our analysis also shows that retention further improves when customers choose automation features such as thermostats, light switches, door locks and cameras. Equally is important, our initial data also shows that the resale rate, the rate at which we sign up a new customer who moves into a home where Pulse automation is already installed, is higher as compared to non-Pulse customers.
Now let me turn things over to Mike to provide some additional details on our financial and operational performance for the quarter and year."
184157327,313700108,901142,"The ADT Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 11, 2015",2015-11-11,"Earnings Calls","The ADT Security Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Naren. 2015 was a transitional year for ADT, in which we improved both our operational and financial performance, positioning the company for future growth and increased profitability.In our core operations, this means a disciplined, more acute",2899,"Thanks, Naren. 2015 was a transitional year for ADT, in which we improved both our operational and financial performance, positioning the company for future growth and increased profitability.
In our core operations, this means a disciplined, more acute focus on customer economics and return on invested capital. Hence, the term smart growth, quality growth and profitable growth is describing our business objectives.
As Naren said, by enhancing the customer experience and using data analytics to drive our customer acquisition practices, we believe we can attract the right customers with the right offerings, at the appropriate SAC and ensure that these customers remain with us longer. This approach does put some top line pressure on gross add growth but pays dividends in customer retention, lower SAC, higher margins and increased free cash flow. As we look ahead to 2016, we expect more of the same. I will discuss 2016 guidance later in my remarks.
First, I'll review our Q4 and full year performance. Slide 10 summarizes our GAAP and non-GAAP financial results for the quarter. In Q4, recurring revenue, which accounts for approximately 93% of our total revenue, grew 2% to $835 million and total revenue increased by 1.8% to $899 million.
Recurring revenue growth outpaced total revenue growth as we continue to add different products and services to our portfolio, that generate recurring revenue in place of lower-margin onetime sales.
For example, late in 2014, our business channel began to offer hosted video services, that generate recurring revenue in place of onetime DVR sales.
All this being said, in 2016, we will have the opportunity to grow nonrecurring revenue as our commercial channel continues to gain traction, and we broadened our service capabilities and product offerings.
When adjusting for the Canadian dollar, which impacts approximately 10% of our total revenues and has declined significantly versus prior year, recurring revenue was up 3.4% and total revenue increased by 3.3%.
In Q4, reported operating expenses before special items were up 3.9% over the last year, including a 5% increase in depreciation and amortization.
Excluding the $8 million impact of the marketing efficiency program, total operating expenses before special items were up just 2.7% in the quarter.
Besides depreciation, the increase in total expenses was driven by the growth of Pulse, investments in our commercial expansion and development of our new Pulse app and all-in-one DIY product as well as investments we have made to improve our service levels.
EBITDA before special items was $460 million, which includes a negative impact of approximately $8 million related to the previously disclosed change in the way we account for our marketing efficiency program as well as a negative impact of approximately $5 million due to the decline of the Canadian dollar.
Adjusting for these 2 items, EBITDA was $15 million favorable to the prior year. EBITDA margin for the quarter was 51.2%, 100 basis point improvement from Q3. Improvement reflects continued execution of our cost efficiency program. Excluding special items, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.51, which includes the impact of $0.03 per share related to the prior mentioned marketing efficiency program. This compares to non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.55 per share last year. Using our Q4 cash tax rate, diluted earnings per share before special items was $0.73 for the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 30.8% compared with 24.8% last year.
Slide 10 also details our special items for the quarter. In Q4, we continue to make progress on our 2G radio conversion program, upgrading or converting nearly 40,000 customers in the quarter for a total of approximately 276,000 for the year.
We have made significant progress since the start of this project and have about 500,000 customers left who either need to upgrade or convert to a new radio. We plan to complete most of these conversions in fiscal 2016 and finalize the program in our first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Turning to the operating levers. Slide 11 shows gross adds and average revenue per unit for Q4. Overall, total company gross adds, excluding bulk acquisitions were 278,000, the highest level of 2015, but flat versus last year.
Our company's focus on quality growth combined with enhanced tenure screening created some slight headwinds to overall year-over-year growth, but resulted in better financial results. Gross adds in our direct channel were up slightly, offset by dealer gross additions, which were nearly flat to last year. Gross adds for ADT Business were up 17% and Health adds were higher by 27%. Pricing continues to be an area of strength, as both average and new and resale ARPU continue to grow in the fourth quarter.
Overall, pricing remains healthy in our business as we continue to drive higher Pulse take rates with greater automation and grow our business channel, which has a higher ARPU.
For the quarter, new and resale ARPU was $48.40, an increase of 3.4% over the prior year. Our ARPU for the overall customer base was $42.65, an increase of nearly 3% year-over-year. When adjusting for the Canadian FX, ARPU was up by 4% over last year. As I indicated earlier, the company is committed to pursuing profitable growth and enhancing customer experience, which leads to greater customer retention and loyalty.
Slide 12 shows the progress we've made on customer retention. Attrition has improved for 6 consecutive quarters, reaching a new low in Q4. Net revenue attrition was 12.2%, sequential improvement of 20 basis points and a significant reduction of 130 basis points versus last year. Unit attrition, which measures customer attrition for just our residential and business customers, was also 12.2% for the quarter, a 10 basis point improvement versus Q3 and 100 basis points lower than last year.
Improvements are led by the progress we've made in gross attrition throughout 2015, as we reduced nonpay, voluntary and loss-to-competition disconnections, combined with a 21% year-over-year increase in resales.
Relocations skewed higher this quarter as the housing market improved, but this is more than offset by attrition improvement elsewhere and by the higher resales.
We are pleased with the progress we've made this year as our attrition results are materially favorable to both our guidance and prior year results. However, we see ample opportunity to perform better and are targeting further improvement in 2016.
Slide 13 shows our quarterly results for recurring revenue margin and SAC creation multiples. For the quarter, recurring revenue margin in our existing customer base was about 66.6% compared to 67.5% in last year. While the recurring revenue margin is down versus last year, it increased sequentially by 70 basis points in Q4.
Margins throughout the year have been pressured by our investments to expand into commercial, development of our new Pulse app and costs associated with the launch of our all-in-one DIY product.
Additionally, increased spending to improve customer service levels and response times have negatively impacted margins, but contributed to improvements in customer experience and attrition.
SAC is another favorable story for 2015. We've consistently lowered SAC in 2015 through marketing efficiencies, sales effectiveness and the installation processes by implementing electronic contracts, Total Security panel and lower cost equipment.
Our combined net creation multiple improved by 0.8x to 29.8x in Q4, while the net creation multiple in our direct channel fell to 29.1x, a onetime improvement versus last year. 
Net SAC in our direct channel fell to nearly $1,400, below the average SAC levels in Q4 2014. We have lowered both total and direct channel creation multiples, excluding upgrades in every quarter this year, while also increasing Pulse take rates.
Slide 14 details the components of our fourth quarter free cash flow results. The charts aggregate cash flow into cash generated from existing customers and cash invested to secure a new or upgrade existing customers.
Free cash flow before special items was $77 million in Q4, up $23 million or 43% versus last year. It's the second consecutive quarter of free cash flow growth, enabling us to finish 2015 with free cash flow before special items of $321 million, which is about 30% higher than the 2015 figure we baselined at our Investor Day in May.
Pre-SAC, free cash flow before special items was driven by lower attrition, operational improvements and growth in Pulse customers.
For the quarter, pre-SAC free cash flow before special items increased by 5.6% to $510 million, up $27 million from last year.
Investing in new customer growth is the main driver behind our ability to generate future free cash flow and our quality growth initiatives enable us to focus on the customers, which we feel are most likely to meet our return criteria.
Total SAC before special items for the quarter was $433 million, marginally above the $429 million in Q4 last year. For the year, free cash flow from our existing customers increased $116 million to almost $2 billion. This was partially offset by a $1.7 billion investment in new customers. 
This investment represents an increase of about 8%, driven by a 6% growth in gross adds and about 50,000 more Pulse upgrades.
Slide 15 highlights the improvements we've made in our steady-state free cash flow results over last year. Steady-state free cash flow is a long-term valuation metric, which allows us to measure the free cash flow generated by maintaining the recurring revenue from our existing customer base before investing in new subscriber growth.
The key drivers to this symmetric, pre-SAC EBITDA, SAC creation multiples and attrition are all continuing to move in the right direction, which allowed us to improve our results over last year.
Steady-state free cash flow before special items was $996 million, up $30 million versus prior year. When analyzing results in constant currency, steady-state free cash flow exceeded our guidance of $1 billion. 
Slide 16 highlights our capital allocation and debt levels for the quarter. Trailing 12-month leverage reached 3x EBITDA and trailing 12-month debt-to-pre-SAC EBITDA was 2.4x.
As a reminder, we began reporting pre-SAC leverage ratio to provide a harmonized view similar to how most, if not all, our security competitors report leverage by removing the expense investment in new subscribers.
In addition, our EBITDA results were negatively impacted by about $25 million in 2015 as a result of the noncash change in how we report the marketing efficiency program. Our long-term leverage target remains 3x EBITDA.
Our total cost of borrowing was below 4% in Q4 and our debt continues to trade at favorable levels. Having a low cost of borrowing provides us the flexibility to invest in growth and return capital to our shareholders.
In the fourth quarter, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share or 5% increase over last year.
In Q4, we also repurchased 4.3 million shares at an average price of $32.70 per share, contributing to the total of 9.8 million shares for $324 million of repurchases for fiscal 2015.
With our cash flow increasing, our business stable and our growth initiatives adequately funded, we continue to view share repurchases at current price level as the preferred vehicle for excess cash.
We have now reduced the diluted ending share count to 167 million, a 29% reduction from our share count and spend. We currently have more than $1 billion available in our share repurchase program.
Our company has significantly improved its operating and financial results since going public in 2012. We've had a challenging first quarter 2014. We've improved our performance since then, meeting or exceeding our guidance again in 2015.
On Slide 17, we highlight the quarterly trends for key financial and operational metrics for ADT.
When analyzing the last 8 quarters, it's clear that our commitment to driving improvements in the 5 operating levers has been successful. Pre-SAC EBITDA and recurring revenue margins before special items has been steadily improving throughout the year, ending at their highest points in Q4. Steady-state free cash flow also had a new high this year, and we delivered 6% growth in gross adds for the year, as we grew sequentially throughout 2015. The most important driver of our business is attrition. The improvements we've made in the last 6 quarters are significant, as we improved attrition by 230 basis points.
And last but not least, we've consistently lowered our direct SAC creation multiples throughout 2015, despite increases in automation take rates.
We expect our focus on quality growth to continue to drive improvements to these metrics in 2016.
So let's move to Slide 18 and address our 2016 guidance. We feel optimistic about the upcoming year due to the progress we made in 2015 and the initiatives we have underway and in the pipeline.
We expect 2016 to be a year of improved operating metrics and financial growth, driven by an even greater focus on improving customer retention. This should drive better customer metrics, increased profitability and higher levels of free cash flow growth before special charges.
The chart details our 5 primary financial and operating metric guidance for 2016. All growth levels are assumed to occur at constant exchange rates with prior year. 
Number one, we're calling for total revenue to grow between 3.5% and 4.5%. Most of this growth will come from increases in recurring revenue, although we also expect nonrecurring revenues to grow as we extend our commercial activities. We expect expansion activities in ADT Business and health to grow at accelerated rates. We also expect a modest level of recurring revenues from the launch of the LG all-in-one product.
Two, we are targeting EBITDA before special items to grow in the range of $75 million to $90 million. Higher-quality sales. IT leverage cost efficiencies and synergies from the Protectron integration are expected to increase EBITDA margins for 2016.
We'll also continue to invest in growth as we look to improve the customer experience, accelerate our expansion into the commercial market and launch our security offering targeted at the DIY marketplace.
The EBITDA growth would have been higher, if not for the estimated $12 million negative impact, expected from the 53rd week we will experience in 2016. I will address this more in a moment. After finishing 2015 on a favorable note with $321 million of free cash flow before special items, we are guiding free cash flow to be higher for 2016.
Better customer retention, a more favorable mix of Pulse customers, higher ARPU and margins will drive at least 5% increase in free cash flow from operations.
Somewhat mitigating this improvement is an expected increase in short-term interest rates.
On the SAC side, we expect further improvements in subscriber creation multiples resulting in capital spending increases, driven primarily by increasing gross adds and incremental Pulse upgrades. We do expect Pulse upgrades to temporarily increase in 2016 as we make a push to convert the remaining 2G customers to Pulse versus just replacing the radios.
Four, improving the customer retention will continue to be our top priority in 2016. We are targeting net unit attrition to fall below 12% versus the Q4 rate of 12.2%. This will be driven by smarter customer acquisition, a retention program and higher account resales, particularly on relocation disconnects. 
And finally, we're targeting to increase our customer base in 2016 from our current position of 6.6 million customers.
In 2015, we lost about 70,000 customers, a 50% improvement over 2014.
For 2016, we expect to grow gross adds, reduce customer disconnects and attract new customers via small opportunistic account acquisitions at appropriate price levels.
Two last points on guidance before I turn the call back to Naren for concluding comments. First, we're targeting to step-up completion to the 2G conversion program in the course of 2016. Technically, we have until calendar year-end 2016 to complete this conversion. We'll be actively seeking to upgrade 2G customers to Pulse, but those that won't will just have to replace their radios.
As was the case in 2015, we will report a special charge for the radio replacement cost.
Lastly, I referred earlier to the 53rd week we report in 2016. Dating back to the Tyco period, ADT has utilized a 4-5-4 weekly calendar for reporting its quarterly earnings. This necessitates that once every 6 years or so, you have a 53rd week. 2016 is the year we have this extra week.
As previously reported, our management and Board have decided to use this timing to convert ADT to a traditional calendar month-end period for reporting results beginning in 2016.
Although this does not eliminate the 53rd week for 2016, it does ensure that this will not happen again and also aligns our reporting more appropriately with how we run the business.
Six of the extra 7 days will occur in the first quarter as our reporting period began on September 26 and ends December 31.
Most of our revenues are monthly recurring revenues, so there is little impact to revenues as a result of the extra days. However, certain costs are negatively impacted such as hourly labor, variable costs and marketing spend.
For Q1, we expect the extra week to negatively impact EBITDA by $10 million and EPS about $0.04. This impact is cash neutral and one-time in nature. We expect Q1 2017 to be incrementally favorable than 2016 by this one-time expense before factoring in any business improvement.
Statistically, this will not affect our major operating metrics. Only gross adds and gross disconnects will be affected by the extra days.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Naren."

As a reflect on our first 3 years as a public company, I'm very proud of what our team has accomplished despite some bumps in the road. We completed a very complex separation from Tyco, which included over 100 shared IT systems, hundreds of co-located field offices and over 2 million customer monitoring lines, which needed to be moved between the 2 companies monitoring centers. During this time period, we also significantly strengthened our focus on enhancing the customer experience through adding more automation capabilities to our Pulse platform, improving customer service levels and screening out prospective customers who do not have the potential to become customers for life. These improvements resulted in 150 basis point improvement in customer retention.
In addition, we continued to position ourselves for future profitable growth by investing in Pulse, expanding our business activities into the mid-size commercial market, completing 2 acquisitions to bring new capabilities and increase our scale and coverage in the Canadian market, and establishing new partnerships and solutions that will allow us to enter previously unpenetrated segments of the residential market.
As a result of these investments, we've been able to grow Pulse customer base to over 1.5 million customers, increased recurring revenue by nearly 15% and expand our customer base by 279,000 subscribers during our first 3 years as a standalone company.
As I look forward over the next few years, I'm even more excited about the potential to further improve business performance and deliver profitable growth.
Our focus on quality growth and enhancing the customer experience should allow us to bring customer attrition down to historic low levels for ADT, below 11%. This will put us on a path for consistent annual net add growth organically.
Our continued investment in and customer preference towards Pulse should result in Pulse growing to at least half of our customer base over the next few years. And I expect our new business platforms to continue to grow with our business and health channels growing double digits annually for the foreseeable future as a result of organic initiatives and some small acquisitions while our efforts in the previously unpenetrated residential market could attract up to 1 million new customers over the next several years. 
This growth should allow us to continue to improve our profitability and position us to deliver over $500 million worth of free cash flow annually, which will be used to further invest in the business or reward our shareholders with higher dividends and/or share repurchases. Needless to say, this is a very exciting time for ADT as we work hard to build on our market-leading position in the security and automation market.
With that, we can open up the call for questions. Stephanie, can you provide the instructions for dialers to ask a question?"

We were $64 million for the quarter. So nonrecurring revenue is revenue we record every day. We have 7 more days to realize nonrecurring revenue. So that is the only impact. The reason it will not affect regular revenue is -- the best way to kind of describe that is describe it on a monthly basis. In the month of February, a customer pays $45 for the services, whether it's 8 days in that month or 30 days or 31, we charged a monthly fee, we don't charge a per day fee. So we are booking -- we're charging customers who are going to pay 1/12 of -- or they're going to pay their annual amount divided by 12. So recurring revenues has been -- is not affected by this extra week. We still will have the same amount of months as we had last year. So it really only affects -- and as true, a lot of our fixed cost and our salaries aren't affected either. It's really the hourly cost and the strict variable cost like marketing as well as nonrecurring revenue. So revenues are not affected by this.

As you're probably aware, if you go back 2 years ago, we simply had a landline base in-home solution. We supplemented that with a cellular product that allowed us to at least serve customers who didn't have a landline. And then, in February of this year, we introduced the Mobile PERS solutions that isn't even necessarily tied to a home, it got GPS in it. So you can use it on-the-go. Similarly, both for our wireless product and our mobile product, we added fall detection. So that if you fall, you don't have to reach out and hit the button to call our monitoring center, the product detects that. And our monitoring center will call the individual or reach out through, you know, that pendant or that bracelet. So we have changed and added the products, and those makeup more than 50% of our sales these days. And we are seeing good take rates on the fall detection as well. From a channel perspective, it is more looking at bulk sales. Looking at nursing homes or other organizations that may have large versus a traditional residential model, where you're looking at individual consumers. We're continuing to sell through individual consumers, but we're also looking at more of those bigger account opportunities, and we've retooled the sales force, brought in a new sales leader to pursue those kinds of opportunities. So we expect to see continued acceleration there. And we're also working with retailers to see if there's an opportunity to sell either in the store or more likely via their websites. We've used e-commerce sales on our own platform."

We've brought in Andrea Martin at the beginning of this calendar year. Andrea has put together a really strong leadership team leveraging some great talent from Protectron, leveraging some talent from ADT. We actually took a sales leader out of the U.S. and moved him up there. We've also brought in some great talent from externally, including some people who had some pretty big name companies with strong recurring revenue experience. I think, we're starting to see the momentum build there. I think the employee engagement is improving pretty significantly. We've retooled the dealer program and Andrea and her team had their dealer conference a few weeks ago and the feedback from the dealers where they were very pleased with the changes that we're making in the program. So all the indicators are very positive. We're sharing best practices between the business and I think you'll see momentum in 2016 and I think that will accelerate in 2017 and beyond."

Although from a -- when you look at the year-over-year improvements, attrition improved pretty dramatically.

Those metrics continue to converge. If you look out for the year, our net losses were down about 50% on a year-over-year basis. So we feel like we're building momentum for that crossover point, and we're continuing to target getting to gross or -- excuse me, net add positive in the foreseeable future."

So -- but -- as we talked about quality growth and things, I mean, we started to implement not only the fully implemented tenure screening, which we've talked about, but also some of the customer changes emanating from the data analytic reviews that Naren mentioned earlier, I think we need to -- we definitely are targeting net subscriber growth, but we're going do it in the right way with the right terms. We're not going to chase sales by chasing customers that a year from now or 2 years from now won't be customers, because we're both trying to get subscriber growth and cash flow growth.

So I think the mix has something to do with the ultimate cost. But it's been running.

We're seeing -- there is a decent amount of consolidation interest, people who are in the market, I think there's still pretty high expectation for, one of the reasons we have -- again, everything with us is remaining disciplined, so we look at a lot of things and as you can see this year we have not done much in the way of consolidation and tuck-unders. I think, the price needs to be right. There's been a couple of transaction in the space. But a lot of businesses are -- people that say, ""If I can get this price, I will sell. If I can't, I won't."" And so I think we have a pretty good pipeline of business that we're interested in. And we think it is an opportunity for us for sure. But again, as we said, it needs to be at the right price. To us, some of these things we're looking at, particularly, the smaller to medium-size opportunities. This is really a third way to acquire our customers. Some are even asset deals, they are not even business acquisitions. So you're mostly buying accounts with a couple of salespeople. So I got to look at it relative to what my dealers and/or my direct team can deliver and make sure those return metrics are there. So we remain optimistic with that channel. I think it's not -- I think we remain one of the larger buyers out there, so if someone wants to sell, we'll be the ones who could make that. But I think at this stage, when I compare that to where my stock trades at, sub-40, RMR, it's why we believe that the best buy in security is our own stock."

Just actually hoping to get a little bit more color on some of the underlying dynamics within Pulse, kind of bringing the year to a close here, what percent of Pulse customers were automation customers? Is the Pulse attrition rate still tracking to that roughly kind of 30% better than kind of historical attrition now that you got, maybe what, 4 or 5 years of history now of Pulse customers? And also just kind of part of that, I was wondering, it obviously makes sense to kind of try to attract higher-quality customers on any day in any business, but does that focus in any way indicate that some of the experience on the early Pulse customers hasn't been quite as good as you thought, and so there's a further kind of level of scrutiny and screening around Pulse, specifically, sorry for the multipart?"

When you look at it from a base perspective, I expected it's higher than that from a base perspective, again, because it's got better retention. And over time, if we are losing Pulse customers, we would be losing more non-automation customers. The attrition rate, again, continues to be very good. I would refer back to some of the data we shared in our Investor Day and things are continuing to hold there. As far as the quality growth piece, Jeff, again, I think what's happening is our ability to segment the data and segment customers better through our analytics is what's helping us just be a little bit more surgical in our approach. I think when you look at the economics on our portfolio basis, they've always been very good. We've talked about what the IRRs are. Now what we can do is we can surgically ""remove"" some of those less attractive customers within a tranche and focus on the more attractive customers. So again, while we are walking away from some of business, it will help not just our operating metrics, but it will help the overall profitability and free cash flow for the company.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings release, which is furnished to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our Form 10-K for the year ended September 25, 2015, which we expect to file with the SEC later this week.

Thank you for joining our call today. We hope you had a chance to review our previously issued earnings press release that highlights our results for the fourth quarter and our full fiscal year 2015.
This morning, I will discuss our key performance highlights and accomplishments for the quarter and year. Then our CFO, Mike Geltzeiler, will provide additional details on our financial and operational performance as well as our outlook for 2016.
2015 was a pivotal year for ADT. We met or exceeded all of our major financial and operational goals and made further progress towards building a foundation for future profitable growth.
Our continued focus on customer retention and quality growth resulted in our key metrics moving in the right direction again in the fourth quarter, reinforcing that we're pursuing the right strategies and priorities.
We continue to make smart investments in our business and establish new partnerships, positioning us well to execute upon our growth strategy. Many of the initiatives that fueled our performance in 2015 were launched in 2014 when we refocused our organization on improving customer retention by enhancing all aspects of the customer experience, attracting high-quality new customers in both our direct and dealer channels, selectively expanding into adjacent markets and exploring opportunities in previously unpenetrated markets.
As a result of our team's improved execution, the impact of these efforts first began to show through in our improved performance in the second half of 2014 and have continued to carry through in our results this past year. We're proud of what we've accomplished and remain confident that our best years are still in front of us.
The next 3 slides in the presentation deck reflect our report card for 2015.
I'll begin with the key operating levers that drive our results. Slide 3 shows our performance over the past year on the 4 operating levers that are affected by the competitive environment.
As you can see, we've delivered strong improvements in all 4 of these important levers. We increased gross adds across all lines of business and channels, improved customer retention by 130 basis points, increased new and resale ARPU by nearly 4% and reduced our direct channel creation multiple, which reflects the cash payback period for newly generated accounts.
This chart is evidence that we remain competitively strong and are extending our market leadership position, while improving overall business performance.
These operating levers fueled our improved performance in 2015. As shown on Slide 4, which highlight some of our key accomplishments, we delivered solid recurring revenue growth and improved financial results throughout the year. Customer adds increased by more than 6% over last year despite enhanced customer screening and other new customer onboarding requirements. We also focused a portion of our sales and marketing activities on Pulse upgrades, which rose 63% for the year.
Operationally, our primary focus continues to be on improved customer retention. For the year, we reduced attrition significantly, closing the year at 12.2% unit and revenue attrition, which is the lowest we have seen since the spin. This helped us reduce customer losses in 2015 and positions us well for net add growth in the future.
We also further reduced the cost of adding new customers to the ADT family, resulting in our lowest creation multiples since we became a public company despite a steady increase in Pulse take rates. And speaking of Pulse, we increased total Pulse customers by 50% during the year, reaching 1.5 million customers.
As I stated previously, if Pulse was a standalone company, it would be the second largest residential security company in North America, only behind ADT. On the strategic front, we further strengthened our competitive position and paved the way for future profitable growth by expanding into new market segments and entering into key partnerships to improve our product portfolio.
This year, we launched ADT Business, supporting our expansion in the small business channel and entry into the mid-size commercial market. Our business channel delivered double-digit year-over-year new customer growth this year, and we're still in the early stages of our commercial expansion.
We also enhanced our health business with a launch of our Mobile PERS solution with fall detection and added new distribution channels. We've opened up our Pulse ecosystem and partnered with innovative companies like Nest Labs to allow ADT customers to integrate with best-of-breed products, like the Nest Learning Thermostat. After a successful launch in 4 pilot markets, we're now making this integration available for our Pulse automation customers nationwide.
We also launched the new ADT-owned Pulse mobile app with more intuitive and easier navigation for our Pulse customers.
And lastly, in collaboration with LG, we announced a new all-in-one security device with ADT monitoring services to target the unpenetrated North America residential market, including renters and frequent movers.
We've made significant progress on the product, associated services and retail distribution strategy, and we are now targeting the first calendar quarter of 2016 for our launch. We're very excited about what this means for our business in the future.
On Slide #5, you can see our overall performance was strong, as we met or exceeded our guidance for 2015 on a constant-currency basis. And on Slide #6, you can see some of our achievements for the fourth quarter. Mike will cover the quarter in greater detail, but I wanted to mention a couple items. 
Overall, our operating metrics continued to move in the right direction, highlighted by another drop in net unit attrition, which improved 100 basis points year-over-year and net revenue attrition, which improved 130 basis points from last year. Both ended the year at 12.2%.
We generated 278,000 gross adds, about flat with prior year excluding bulk account purchases, as we continue to focus on quality customer additions that will provide longer tenure and higher financial returns.
These strong operating metrics fueled growth in revenues, EBITDA and free cash flow on a year-over-year basis.
Although we've shared Slide #7 before, I want to spend a minute on our strategy to create shareholder value as I think this reflects our strategic priorities very well. Our strategy is focused on 3 areas: growing our traditional business, selectively expanding it to near adjacencies and partnering to target the nontraditional residential market.
The dynamics of our industry continue to be positive creating a tremendous opportunity for ADT. A key driver of our opportunity continues to be growing consumer interest in smart home and Internet of Things devices, along with their desire to be in control and safe. And security remains at the top of the list of reasons for this consumer interest, which is great news for ADT. These changing market dynamics in the residential market, combined with the investments we're making in commercial and health, result in a very large market opportunity for ADT.
In total, we expect our addressable market to nearly triple over the next 5 years to over 70 million potential customers. We're coupling these growth activities with our strong balance sheet and are focused on optimizing our capital structure and capital allocation. We continue to reinvest cash to support this organic growth, remain disciplined in our strategic M&A activities and are returning excess capital to our shareholders via dividends and opportunistic share buybacks.
At the heart of our strategy is our focus on customer retention. As shown on Slide 8, we are continuing to strengthen and refine our focus on improving customer retention by doing 3 basic things: one, bringing on the right customer; two, onboarding them in the right way; and three, providing them a great customer experience. Doing these 3 things right is the key to further reductions in attrition and the right formula for improving customer economics and generating higher free cash flow.
We've made much progress over the past 2 years in improving in these areas, which is why we've seen a significant improvements in retention and net add performance. However, with new tools and analytics now at our disposal, giving us better insights into customer behavior and tendencies, we will make further improvements in the future.
We started last year with enhanced tenure screening to target higher quality customers upfront before we spend money to add them into our network. This effort alone has filtered out nearly 16,000 potential customer adds in the year and has contributed to a significant drop in attrition in the nonpay category.
With the additional insights into customer behavior and the new tools, such as our electronic order management platform, we are continuing to refine our approach and putting in place new customer requirements that will result in more engaged and longer tenure customers.
Improving the customer experience is at the core of our strategy and Pulse customers continue to exhibit better economics and retention.
On Slide #9, you can see that over 59% of our total gross adds during the quarter were Pulse units, up from 51% a year ago. In our residential direct channel, the Pulse take rate for new and resale units was 65%. While more than 75% of all new residential customers added via this channel were Pulse customers.
In our dealer channel, the Pulse take rate ramped up to 57% from about 47% last year. And in our small business channel, the Pulse take rate was 41%.
In addition to new Pulse sales, we also upgraded about 39,000 existing customers this quarter. Pulse upgrades allow us to provide additional service to our existing customers and yield higher ARPU.
In addition, these upgrades allow us to enhance the customer experience and enter into new contracts. We now have approximately 1.5 million Pulse customers with total interactive customers now comprising about 23% of our customer base.
As we discussed during our Investor Day, Pulse customers continue to demonstrate better retention characteristics than traditional security customers.
Our analysis also shows that retention further improves when customers choose automation features such as thermostats, light switches, door locks and cameras. Equally is important, our initial data also shows that the resale rate, the rate at which we sign up a new customer who moves into a home where Pulse automation is already installed, is higher as compared to non-Pulse customers.
Now let me turn things over to Mike to provide some additional details on our financial and operational performance for the quarter and year."
184157327,313700108,901788,"The ADT Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 11, 2015",2015-11-11,"Earnings Calls","The ADT Security Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Naren. 2015 was a transitional year for ADT, in which we improved both our operational and financial performance, positioning the company for future growth and increased profitability.In our core operations, this means a disciplined, more acute",2899,"Thanks, Naren. 2015 was a transitional year for ADT, in which we improved both our operational and financial performance, positioning the company for future growth and increased profitability.
In our core operations, this means a disciplined, more acute focus on customer economics and return on invested capital. Hence, the term smart growth, quality growth and profitable growth is describing our business objectives.
As Naren said, by enhancing the customer experience and using data analytics to drive our customer acquisition practices, we believe we can attract the right customers with the right offerings, at the appropriate SAC and ensure that these customers remain with us longer. This approach does put some top line pressure on gross add growth but pays dividends in customer retention, lower SAC, higher margins and increased free cash flow. As we look ahead to 2016, we expect more of the same. I will discuss 2016 guidance later in my remarks.
First, I'll review our Q4 and full year performance. Slide 10 summarizes our GAAP and non-GAAP financial results for the quarter. In Q4, recurring revenue, which accounts for approximately 93% of our total revenue, grew 2% to $835 million and total revenue increased by 1.8% to $899 million.
Recurring revenue growth outpaced total revenue growth as we continue to add different products and services to our portfolio, that generate recurring revenue in place of lower-margin onetime sales.
For example, late in 2014, our business channel began to offer hosted video services, that generate recurring revenue in place of onetime DVR sales.
All this being said, in 2016, we will have the opportunity to grow nonrecurring revenue as our commercial channel continues to gain traction, and we broadened our service capabilities and product offerings.
When adjusting for the Canadian dollar, which impacts approximately 10% of our total revenues and has declined significantly versus prior year, recurring revenue was up 3.4% and total revenue increased by 3.3%.
In Q4, reported operating expenses before special items were up 3.9% over the last year, including a 5% increase in depreciation and amortization.
Excluding the $8 million impact of the marketing efficiency program, total operating expenses before special items were up just 2.7% in the quarter.
Besides depreciation, the increase in total expenses was driven by the growth of Pulse, investments in our commercial expansion and development of our new Pulse app and all-in-one DIY product as well as investments we have made to improve our service levels.
EBITDA before special items was $460 million, which includes a negative impact of approximately $8 million related to the previously disclosed change in the way we account for our marketing efficiency program as well as a negative impact of approximately $5 million due to the decline of the Canadian dollar.
Adjusting for these 2 items, EBITDA was $15 million favorable to the prior year. EBITDA margin for the quarter was 51.2%, 100 basis point improvement from Q3. Improvement reflects continued execution of our cost efficiency program. Excluding special items, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.51, which includes the impact of $0.03 per share related to the prior mentioned marketing efficiency program. This compares to non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.55 per share last year. Using our Q4 cash tax rate, diluted earnings per share before special items was $0.73 for the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 30.8% compared with 24.8% last year.
Slide 10 also details our special items for the quarter. In Q4, we continue to make progress on our 2G radio conversion program, upgrading or converting nearly 40,000 customers in the quarter for a total of approximately 276,000 for the year.
We have made significant progress since the start of this project and have about 500,000 customers left who either need to upgrade or convert to a new radio. We plan to complete most of these conversions in fiscal 2016 and finalize the program in our first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Turning to the operating levers. Slide 11 shows gross adds and average revenue per unit for Q4. Overall, total company gross adds, excluding bulk acquisitions were 278,000, the highest level of 2015, but flat versus last year.
Our company's focus on quality growth combined with enhanced tenure screening created some slight headwinds to overall year-over-year growth, but resulted in better financial results. Gross adds in our direct channel were up slightly, offset by dealer gross additions, which were nearly flat to last year. Gross adds for ADT Business were up 17% and Health adds were higher by 27%. Pricing continues to be an area of strength, as both average and new and resale ARPU continue to grow in the fourth quarter.
Overall, pricing remains healthy in our business as we continue to drive higher Pulse take rates with greater automation and grow our business channel, which has a higher ARPU.
For the quarter, new and resale ARPU was $48.40, an increase of 3.4% over the prior year. Our ARPU for the overall customer base was $42.65, an increase of nearly 3% year-over-year. When adjusting for the Canadian FX, ARPU was up by 4% over last year. As I indicated earlier, the company is committed to pursuing profitable growth and enhancing customer experience, which leads to greater customer retention and loyalty.
Slide 12 shows the progress we've made on customer retention. Attrition has improved for 6 consecutive quarters, reaching a new low in Q4. Net revenue attrition was 12.2%, sequential improvement of 20 basis points and a significant reduction of 130 basis points versus last year. Unit attrition, which measures customer attrition for just our residential and business customers, was also 12.2% for the quarter, a 10 basis point improvement versus Q3 and 100 basis points lower than last year.
Improvements are led by the progress we've made in gross attrition throughout 2015, as we reduced nonpay, voluntary and loss-to-competition disconnections, combined with a 21% year-over-year increase in resales.
Relocations skewed higher this quarter as the housing market improved, but this is more than offset by attrition improvement elsewhere and by the higher resales.
We are pleased with the progress we've made this year as our attrition results are materially favorable to both our guidance and prior year results. However, we see ample opportunity to perform better and are targeting further improvement in 2016.
Slide 13 shows our quarterly results for recurring revenue margin and SAC creation multiples. For the quarter, recurring revenue margin in our existing customer base was about 66.6% compared to 67.5% in last year. While the recurring revenue margin is down versus last year, it increased sequentially by 70 basis points in Q4.
Margins throughout the year have been pressured by our investments to expand into commercial, development of our new Pulse app and costs associated with the launch of our all-in-one DIY product.
Additionally, increased spending to improve customer service levels and response times have negatively impacted margins, but contributed to improvements in customer experience and attrition.
SAC is another favorable story for 2015. We've consistently lowered SAC in 2015 through marketing efficiencies, sales effectiveness and the installation processes by implementing electronic contracts, Total Security panel and lower cost equipment.
Our combined net creation multiple improved by 0.8x to 29.8x in Q4, while the net creation multiple in our direct channel fell to 29.1x, a onetime improvement versus last year. 
Net SAC in our direct channel fell to nearly $1,400, below the average SAC levels in Q4 2014. We have lowered both total and direct channel creation multiples, excluding upgrades in every quarter this year, while also increasing Pulse take rates.
Slide 14 details the components of our fourth quarter free cash flow results. The charts aggregate cash flow into cash generated from existing customers and cash invested to secure a new or upgrade existing customers.
Free cash flow before special items was $77 million in Q4, up $23 million or 43% versus last year. It's the second consecutive quarter of free cash flow growth, enabling us to finish 2015 with free cash flow before special items of $321 million, which is about 30% higher than the 2015 figure we baselined at our Investor Day in May.
Pre-SAC, free cash flow before special items was driven by lower attrition, operational improvements and growth in Pulse customers.
For the quarter, pre-SAC free cash flow before special items increased by 5.6% to $510 million, up $27 million from last year.
Investing in new customer growth is the main driver behind our ability to generate future free cash flow and our quality growth initiatives enable us to focus on the customers, which we feel are most likely to meet our return criteria.
Total SAC before special items for the quarter was $433 million, marginally above the $429 million in Q4 last year. For the year, free cash flow from our existing customers increased $116 million to almost $2 billion. This was partially offset by a $1.7 billion investment in new customers. 
This investment represents an increase of about 8%, driven by a 6% growth in gross adds and about 50,000 more Pulse upgrades.
Slide 15 highlights the improvements we've made in our steady-state free cash flow results over last year. Steady-state free cash flow is a long-term valuation metric, which allows us to measure the free cash flow generated by maintaining the recurring revenue from our existing customer base before investing in new subscriber growth.
The key drivers to this symmetric, pre-SAC EBITDA, SAC creation multiples and attrition are all continuing to move in the right direction, which allowed us to improve our results over last year.
Steady-state free cash flow before special items was $996 million, up $30 million versus prior year. When analyzing results in constant currency, steady-state free cash flow exceeded our guidance of $1 billion. 
Slide 16 highlights our capital allocation and debt levels for the quarter. Trailing 12-month leverage reached 3x EBITDA and trailing 12-month debt-to-pre-SAC EBITDA was 2.4x.
As a reminder, we began reporting pre-SAC leverage ratio to provide a harmonized view similar to how most, if not all, our security competitors report leverage by removing the expense investment in new subscribers.
In addition, our EBITDA results were negatively impacted by about $25 million in 2015 as a result of the noncash change in how we report the marketing efficiency program. Our long-term leverage target remains 3x EBITDA.
Our total cost of borrowing was below 4% in Q4 and our debt continues to trade at favorable levels. Having a low cost of borrowing provides us the flexibility to invest in growth and return capital to our shareholders.
In the fourth quarter, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share or 5% increase over last year.
In Q4, we also repurchased 4.3 million shares at an average price of $32.70 per share, contributing to the total of 9.8 million shares for $324 million of repurchases for fiscal 2015.
With our cash flow increasing, our business stable and our growth initiatives adequately funded, we continue to view share repurchases at current price level as the preferred vehicle for excess cash.
We have now reduced the diluted ending share count to 167 million, a 29% reduction from our share count and spend. We currently have more than $1 billion available in our share repurchase program.
Our company has significantly improved its operating and financial results since going public in 2012. We've had a challenging first quarter 2014. We've improved our performance since then, meeting or exceeding our guidance again in 2015.
On Slide 17, we highlight the quarterly trends for key financial and operational metrics for ADT.
When analyzing the last 8 quarters, it's clear that our commitment to driving improvements in the 5 operating levers has been successful. Pre-SAC EBITDA and recurring revenue margins before special items has been steadily improving throughout the year, ending at their highest points in Q4. Steady-state free cash flow also had a new high this year, and we delivered 6% growth in gross adds for the year, as we grew sequentially throughout 2015. The most important driver of our business is attrition. The improvements we've made in the last 6 quarters are significant, as we improved attrition by 230 basis points.
And last but not least, we've consistently lowered our direct SAC creation multiples throughout 2015, despite increases in automation take rates.
We expect our focus on quality growth to continue to drive improvements to these metrics in 2016.
So let's move to Slide 18 and address our 2016 guidance. We feel optimistic about the upcoming year due to the progress we made in 2015 and the initiatives we have underway and in the pipeline.
We expect 2016 to be a year of improved operating metrics and financial growth, driven by an even greater focus on improving customer retention. This should drive better customer metrics, increased profitability and higher levels of free cash flow growth before special charges.
The chart details our 5 primary financial and operating metric guidance for 2016. All growth levels are assumed to occur at constant exchange rates with prior year. 
Number one, we're calling for total revenue to grow between 3.5% and 4.5%. Most of this growth will come from increases in recurring revenue, although we also expect nonrecurring revenues to grow as we extend our commercial activities. We expect expansion activities in ADT Business and health to grow at accelerated rates. We also expect a modest level of recurring revenues from the launch of the LG all-in-one product.
Two, we are targeting EBITDA before special items to grow in the range of $75 million to $90 million. Higher-quality sales. IT leverage cost efficiencies and synergies from the Protectron integration are expected to increase EBITDA margins for 2016.
We'll also continue to invest in growth as we look to improve the customer experience, accelerate our expansion into the commercial market and launch our security offering targeted at the DIY marketplace.
The EBITDA growth would have been higher, if not for the estimated $12 million negative impact, expected from the 53rd week we will experience in 2016. I will address this more in a moment. After finishing 2015 on a favorable note with $321 million of free cash flow before special items, we are guiding free cash flow to be higher for 2016.
Better customer retention, a more favorable mix of Pulse customers, higher ARPU and margins will drive at least 5% increase in free cash flow from operations.
Somewhat mitigating this improvement is an expected increase in short-term interest rates.
On the SAC side, we expect further improvements in subscriber creation multiples resulting in capital spending increases, driven primarily by increasing gross adds and incremental Pulse upgrades. We do expect Pulse upgrades to temporarily increase in 2016 as we make a push to convert the remaining 2G customers to Pulse versus just replacing the radios.
Four, improving the customer retention will continue to be our top priority in 2016. We are targeting net unit attrition to fall below 12% versus the Q4 rate of 12.2%. This will be driven by smarter customer acquisition, a retention program and higher account resales, particularly on relocation disconnects. 
And finally, we're targeting to increase our customer base in 2016 from our current position of 6.6 million customers.
In 2015, we lost about 70,000 customers, a 50% improvement over 2014.
For 2016, we expect to grow gross adds, reduce customer disconnects and attract new customers via small opportunistic account acquisitions at appropriate price levels.
Two last points on guidance before I turn the call back to Naren for concluding comments. First, we're targeting to step-up completion to the 2G conversion program in the course of 2016. Technically, we have until calendar year-end 2016 to complete this conversion. We'll be actively seeking to upgrade 2G customers to Pulse, but those that won't will just have to replace their radios.
As was the case in 2015, we will report a special charge for the radio replacement cost.
Lastly, I referred earlier to the 53rd week we report in 2016. Dating back to the Tyco period, ADT has utilized a 4-5-4 weekly calendar for reporting its quarterly earnings. This necessitates that once every 6 years or so, you have a 53rd week. 2016 is the year we have this extra week.
As previously reported, our management and Board have decided to use this timing to convert ADT to a traditional calendar month-end period for reporting results beginning in 2016.
Although this does not eliminate the 53rd week for 2016, it does ensure that this will not happen again and also aligns our reporting more appropriately with how we run the business.
Six of the extra 7 days will occur in the first quarter as our reporting period began on September 26 and ends December 31.
Most of our revenues are monthly recurring revenues, so there is little impact to revenues as a result of the extra days. However, certain costs are negatively impacted such as hourly labor, variable costs and marketing spend.
For Q1, we expect the extra week to negatively impact EBITDA by $10 million and EPS about $0.04. This impact is cash neutral and one-time in nature. We expect Q1 2017 to be incrementally favorable than 2016 by this one-time expense before factoring in any business improvement.
Statistically, this will not affect our major operating metrics. Only gross adds and gross disconnects will be affected by the extra days.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Naren."

As a reflect on our first 3 years as a public company, I'm very proud of what our team has accomplished despite some bumps in the road. We completed a very complex separation from Tyco, which included over 100 shared IT systems, hundreds of co-located field offices and over 2 million customer monitoring lines, which needed to be moved between the 2 companies monitoring centers. During this time period, we also significantly strengthened our focus on enhancing the customer experience through adding more automation capabilities to our Pulse platform, improving customer service levels and screening out prospective customers who do not have the potential to become customers for life. These improvements resulted in 150 basis point improvement in customer retention.
In addition, we continued to position ourselves for future profitable growth by investing in Pulse, expanding our business activities into the mid-size commercial market, completing 2 acquisitions to bring new capabilities and increase our scale and coverage in the Canadian market, and establishing new partnerships and solutions that will allow us to enter previously unpenetrated segments of the residential market.
As a result of these investments, we've been able to grow Pulse customer base to over 1.5 million customers, increased recurring revenue by nearly 15% and expand our customer base by 279,000 subscribers during our first 3 years as a standalone company.
As I look forward over the next few years, I'm even more excited about the potential to further improve business performance and deliver profitable growth.
Our focus on quality growth and enhancing the customer experience should allow us to bring customer attrition down to historic low levels for ADT, below 11%. This will put us on a path for consistent annual net add growth organically.
Our continued investment in and customer preference towards Pulse should result in Pulse growing to at least half of our customer base over the next few years. And I expect our new business platforms to continue to grow with our business and health channels growing double digits annually for the foreseeable future as a result of organic initiatives and some small acquisitions while our efforts in the previously unpenetrated residential market could attract up to 1 million new customers over the next several years. 
This growth should allow us to continue to improve our profitability and position us to deliver over $500 million worth of free cash flow annually, which will be used to further invest in the business or reward our shareholders with higher dividends and/or share repurchases. Needless to say, this is a very exciting time for ADT as we work hard to build on our market-leading position in the security and automation market.
With that, we can open up the call for questions. Stephanie, can you provide the instructions for dialers to ask a question?"

The reason it will not affect regular revenue is -- the best way to kind of describe that is describe it on a monthly basis. In the month of February, a customer pays $45 for the services, whether it's 8 days in that month or 30 days or 31, we charged a monthly fee, we don't charge a per day fee. So we are booking -- we're charging customers who are going to pay 1/12 of -- or they're going to pay their annual amount divided by 12.

And some of the things we've talked about in the past are the products they buy. We've talked about the fact that ADT Pulse automation customers have higher retention. So clearly, we want to be pursuing more customers who are implying to buy Pulse and Pulse Automation specifically. We've indicated that those who buy life safety solutions versus just intrusion solutions tend to be stickier. How they pay, again, and I think we've been very good at this by making sure that we get credit card or ACH payment. And then, I'd say the final thing that we continue to look at is how much the customer invests upfront. It's -- their level of engagement is driven by the investment that they make upfront. So it's a variety of parameters. I think our analytics are much better than they were 2 years ago, 3 years ago.

So we have changed and added the products, and those makeup more than 50% of our sales these days. And we are seeing good take rates on the fall detection as well. From a channel perspective, it is more looking at bulk sales. Looking at nursing homes or other organizations that may have large versus a traditional residential model, where you're looking at individual consumers. We're continuing to sell through individual consumers, but we're also looking at more of those bigger account opportunities, and we've retooled the sales force, brought in a new sales leader to pursue those kinds of opportunities.

So I think by the end of '16, we'll be at the run rate of what we're looking for. It doesn't mean we're going to be realizing it all in '16, but to sort of integrate the 2 billing systems and some of the customer systems is going to require certainly some -- a significant amount of work up in Canada. I think they have a great plan to do that. So I think you're going to look in the -- possibly, in the higher range of that range of $10 million to $15 million."

Just actually hoping to get a little bit more color on some of the underlying dynamics within Pulse, kind of bringing the year to a close here, what percent of Pulse customers were automation customers? Is the Pulse attrition rate still tracking to that roughly kind of 30% better than kind of historical attrition now that you got, maybe what, 4 or 5 years of history now of Pulse customers? And also just kind of part of that, I was wondering, it obviously makes sense to kind of try to attract higher-quality customers on any day in any business, but does that focus in any way indicate that some of the experience on the early Pulse customers hasn't been quite as good as you thought, and so there's a further kind of level of scrutiny and screening around Pulse, specifically, sorry for the multipart?"

When you look at it from a base perspective, I expected it's higher than that from a base perspective, again, because it's got better retention. And over time, if we are losing Pulse customers, we would be losing more non-automation customers. The attrition rate, again, continues to be very good. I would refer back to some of the data we shared in our Investor Day and things are continuing to hold there. As far as the quality growth piece, Jeff, again, I think what's happening is our ability to segment the data and segment customers better through our analytics is what's helping us just be a little bit more surgical in our approach. I think when you look at the economics on our portfolio basis, they've always been very good. We've talked about what the IRRs are. Now what we can do is we can surgically ""remove"" some of those less attractive customers within a tranche and focus on the more attractive customers. So again, while we are walking away from some of business, it will help not just our operating metrics, but it will help the overall profitability and free cash flow for the company. And we know how important that this to our shareholders, and we want to make sure that we're using every penny wisely for them."
