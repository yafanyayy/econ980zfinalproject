I will say Zach is for Chris Phillips here today who is a bit under the weather today, and we hope Chris is back with us soon. As Zach mentioned, yesterday afternoon, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings, as well as announcing our 2015 capital budget. 
What we really want to accomplish this morning is to spend the bulk of our time on the 2015 capital budget and then turn to your questions. But before I do that, I'd like to share just a few thoughts on our full year 2014 results. I think I would summarize by saying, we delivered against our 2014 performance commitments. Investing in our 3 high-return U.S. resource plays, which yielded a 35% increase in production. We successfully closed on really 2 significant strategic disposition of over $4 billion in proceeds, and we're also be able to return value to our shareholders through an increased dividend and $1 billion in share repurchases. 
We also had proved reserve replacement ratio of 183% x dispositions and that was at a very competitive $20 per barrel oil equivalent and finding and development costs. And we also recorded 97% operational availability across our company-operated assets, and of course, these are our most economic barrels. I think we could say that by any measure, it was an outstanding year, but the second half of the year brought us a bit of a new reality, a bit of a gut check. Commodity prices corrected significantly downward, and I think we were harshly reminded yet again of our inability to predict pricing. Our business plans for 2015 as with others were being essentially adjusted in real time as the market continue to search for some sense of stability. in December, we felt that it was critical to at least advise our shareholders us to our view of 2015 capital budget guidance at that particular point in time with the caveat that we were prepared to respond to further downward movement in pricing. Our foreshadowing, unfortunately, was quite accurate and prices fell more as we move into the new year. This morning, what we're sharing is our updated plan and budget based on today's view of the pricing environment. But it has the same caveat that flexibility is going to be essential in a volatile commodity market. We will admit there were no more clairvoyant on pricing that we were in December. So with that a little bit of our preamp, that did go ahead and turn into 2015, were $3.5 billion budget really emphasizes investment selectivity and return, balance sheet flexibility and positions us for price recovery. It is a further 20% reduction since our December update. We've significantly reduced exploration spending by half, and we are moderating activity levels in the U.S. in alignment with good cash flow management. We'll end up directing about 70% or $2.4 billion of our budget toward our 3-core U.S. resource plays and these continue to be among our highest return investment opportunities. Our objective is simple. It's to deliver high returns in the current pricing environment while we protect our financial flexibility through prudent management of cash flows. Today, we're also releasing updated single well economics for the resource plays. And these new single well economics reflect  our 2015 inventory hydrating along with the service cost reduction that we've already captured and have in hand. 
Suffice to say, we are not opportunity-limited. Furthermore we're continuing to pursue all means to expand our margins. We're going to do this through capital efficiency, expense management and operational reliability. Those things that we can control. Marathon Oil clearly benefits from a deep multiyear inventory that is robust across a broad range of pricing scenarios. Given this portfolio, we're fortunate to have the opportunity to adjust our short-cycle investment in line with commodity prices. As we continue to focus on our 3 high-quality U.S. resource plays in 2015, our budget and activity plans will support high-return investments that will in turn generate a total company production growth rate x Libya, a 5% to 7% year-over-year. And specifically for our resource plays, a growth rate of about 20% year-over-year admittedly benefiting from the 2014 carry-on effect. 
Bottom line is that we're going to be driven by returns and cash flow management with growth as an outcome while we retain the ability to flex on pricing. With that, I'll turn over to Lance Robertson, our Vice President of North America Production Operations, and he'll take us through our newly plans for the resource plays. Lance?"
314842,281935940,765680,"Marathon Oil Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2015",2015-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Oil Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lee. I'll begin on Slide 4. In the context of the current environment, we are prudently reducing development activity and commensurate capital expenditures across all 3 of the resource plays. Having the flexibility within our existing commercial a",1483,"Thanks, Lee. I'll begin on Slide 4. In the context of the current environment, we are prudently reducing development activity and commensurate capital expenditures across all 3 of the resource plays. Having the flexibility within our existing commercial agreements allows us to make these adjustments readily and at little to no cost. As reflected by the table on the top right of the slide, activity will be reduced from 33 active rigs at the end of 2014 to 18 by the end of the first quarter, with a further reduction to 14 rigs by the end of the second quarter. 
We anticipate continuing at the 14-rig pace across the balance of 2015 but retain significant flexibility to scale up or down as market conditions warrant. In addition to rig reductions, we're optimizing completions activity to match our inventory of wells with a focus on maintaining the execution efficiency of full frac fleets. In addition to driving operational efficiencies, we have focused extensively on service cost reductions in this environment, securing today a minimum of $225 million in savings across the 2015 activity. 
Importantly, substantially all of these initial savings were effective in January, benefiting our returns early in the cycle. We continue to see opportunity for additional savings throughout the year further protecting our cash margins. Our North America opportunities for investment remain compelling at current commodity pricing. Referencing the plot in the bottom right, our 2015 investments will focus on inventory that can deliver strong returns in each of Eagle Ford, Bakken and the Oklahoma resource basins. In addition, we have multiple years of inventory that can deliver a similar returns at today's pricing. 
With our core position in 3 key basins and a relentless focus on continuing to drive efficiencies and cost savings, we can continue to provide Marathon Oil with opportunities to deliver value to our shareholders. The 2015 development spend and activity in the resource basins will resort in the production increase of approximately 20% year-on-year with fourth quarter 2015 exit rates up from the same quarter of 2014. 
Turning to Slide 5. We will focus initially on the Eagle Ford, where we have allocated approximately 40% of total 2015 capital on our high-return inventory. Our quality core acreage provides opportunity to drive tremendous value at this scale. We continue to realize this value through highly effective execution. With these efficiencies and recently secured service cost reductions, our cost have fallen by $1.3 million a well to an average of $6.3 million of wells in 2015.. Maintaining our position as one of the most cost efficient operators in the basin. Over the past year, completions optimization has resulted in a 25% increase in 180-day cumulative production across wells to sales. This incremental early life production materially improves well margins, and as this group matures, we anticipate adding further value with an increasing in ultimate volumes recover. Taking into account cost savings and improvements in well performance, we anticipate drilling approximately 215 to 225 wells this in South Texas, with returns ranging from 40% to 60% at $60 flat WTI pricing. This group includes Eagle Ford condensate wells, hygiene oil wells with the remaining 25% of wells to develop and further delineate the Austin Chalk. In all cases, the Austin Chalk is co-developed with the Lower Eagle Ford, leveraging the existing gathering networks and the facilities. Focusing  on the table on the upper left, we're illustrating for the first time single-well metrics for the Austin Chalk. From the data, you can see that the initial production and estimated ultimate recovery compared favorably to the Eagle Ford condensate and higher oil wells. The currently delineated core area, the Austin Chalk was delivered the highest returns driven by higher early life community production relative to other horizons in the Eagle Ford portfolio. 
Continuing with our co-development efforts, the first 4 Upper Eagle Ford wells were placed on sale in the fourth quarter. 
Their co-developed above high Lower Eagle Ford oil wells in this pilot consistent with the Austin Chalk co-development effort. Same zone spacing is 40-acre equivalent, with spacing between the horizons at a 20-acre equivalent. These wells were early on flow but initial rates and pressures are encouraging  for both horizons. 
We will continue this testing throughout the year much in the way the Austin Chalk has been and will continue to be identified, evaluated and developed. In addition, we also spotted the first stack-and-frac co-development pilot in the fourth quarter, including Austin Chalk, Upper Eagle Ford and 2 wells in the Lower Eagle Ford. We'll provide  an update on these efforts later in the year. 
Focusing on Bakken on Slide 6. The initial completion trials are mostly finished, with 42 of the wells completed and flowing to sales. Of these wells, the first 18 in Myrmidon and Hector had yielded more than 30% increase of community production over to for 60 days. This material change in early production is clearly very encouraging, and we anticipate further updates as the production histories mature. In aggregate, the incremental spend on more intensive completions is yielding a return on investment at or above 100% in all areas and zones. As a result, a strong early production response in our focus on driving value, we have adopted the updated practice is more intensive into the base program. These changes are effective across Myrmidon and Hector in Middle Bakken and Three Forks intervals. Reflecting the success, we will continue to test and optimize completions moving forward. 
Directing your attention to the single-well returns stable on the upper left of the slide. We illustrated updated gross completed well cost of $6.2 million to $6.6 million a well, reflecting a reduction of almost $1 million a well thus far. 
These costs include incremental spend for more intensive stimulations for each area, but the full performance benefits of enhanced completions on EUR is not yet reflected. In addition to the completion pilots, we have concluded drilling on the first 2 spacing pilots with 6 wells per horizon in Hector and Myrmidon. These pilots will move to completions over the coming weeks with the third spacing pilot currently drilling. We anticipate the combination of the proved stimulation designs coupled with increasing spacing density to drive towards the highest value, incremental improving go over efficiency across the drilling unit. With improved well costs and higher initial production, our investments in the Williston basin will deliver competitive returns of 20% to 30% in the current commodity environment. As we continue to focus on highest returns and value, the majority of our activity in 2015 will incur in the Myrmidon area. On slide 7, Oklahoma resource activity will focus on protecting core leasehold in the SCOOP and stack areas. With more than 70% of our Oklahoma acreage held by  production, our 2015 activity will allow us to manage lease expirees with moderate spend of approximately $225 million and 2 rigs after the first quarter. Our focus for the year will include high-value SCOOP and stack wells, including our first operating spacing pilot in the SCOOP Woodford, but we are targeting 6 wells and a 640-acre unit, effectively testing same zone spacing of approximately 105 acres. This spacing pilot was spud in the fourth quarter. We anticipate moving to completions by the middle of 2015. In addition, we will spud our first operated springer  well in the SCOOP area later in the year to complement the 17 outside operated springer wells in which we currently participate. We continue to grow our leaseholds in Oklahoma adding 10,000 net acres focused on the SCOOP and Springer areas in the fourth quarters. 
Drawing your attention to the table in the upper left, SCOOP while estimated ultimate recoveries continue to be among the highest available with a high liquids content. Having secured an initial cost reduction of more than $0.5 million, we can confidently deliver wells with 30% to 40% internal rates of return in the current commodity market. With the lower activity in Oklahoma, we'll turn our focus on developing the spacing pilots, driving efficiency, securing additional cost reductions and delivering higher ultimate value. With the longest wells from spud to total depth in our resource portfolio of today, we see ample opportunity for cycle time improvements in 2015 and with price recovery, we'll be ready to move to scale at the lowest cost. 
Slide 8 brings together all 3 U.S. resource plays and demonstrates the strength of our resource and inventory. Our 2015 capital development of program is one that is appropriately scaled to today's commodity price environment. As Lee mentioned at the beginning, we expect these basins to achieve an approximate 20% increase in production 2015 over 2014, taking into account our spending plans and moderated activity levels. 
Next, I'll hand it off to my counterpart, Mitch Little, Vice President of International and Offshore E&P Operations. Mitch will describe 2015 activity for his business."

Switching now to our international and offshore activities, which begin on Slide 9. Our 2015 development activities are focused on high return, previously sanctioned long cycle commitments and selected by the projects that offer superior risk-adjusted returns, including targeted activities in Equatorial Guinea, the region of Iraq; U.S. Gulf of Mexico and U.K. North Sea. Within EG, we're progressing the B3 compression project, which adds important infrastructure, allowing us to access the field's proven reserve base by significantly lowering field pressure. The project is approximately 60% complete, remains within budget and on track for a 2016 start up. Combined with the addition of the C21 infill producer, the project is expected to maintain field production plateau for an additional 2 years while extending field life by as much as 8 years. 
Our investment activities in EG also include a second near-field wildcat well, testing an oil prone amplitude supported prospect at Rodo, which is located within subarea B of the  block. While the recently drilled well did not encounter commercial hydrocarbon quantities, we were encouraged by the presence of high-quality oil in multiple STACK sands. Our upcoming well is targeting a younger reservoir section, and we have several additional prospects across our more than 120,000 net acres under contract in EG. 
Our U.K. investment program is concentrated on the addition of 3 infill producers that add high return, incremental barrels to our existing operations. The first well, in the producer of Southbury, will be online in the first quarter and follows on the success of 2 previous wells that were brought online in late 2014 and continued to outperform predrill expectations. Activities also include drilling and completion of 2 subsea infill producers within our operated West Bayfield, the first of these wells is expected to be online by the end of February with the second coming online around midyear. Moving onto our plans for 2015 Kurdistan investment program, which includes the development activities highlighted here as well as exploration activities, which will be discussed on the subsequent slides. Within the outside operated Block, construction and installation of the phase 1 production facilities continues with the first production currently forecast for late 2015. Appraisal and testing activities also continue in the eastern portions of the field and results from those activities will be integrated with existing data to inform a future decision regarding the applicability of additional development phases. The outside-operated block is currently producing around 4,000 gross barrels of oil a day from a single-well facility within the field. A phased field development plan is under review within the Kurdistan Ministry of Natural Resources, and we anticipate approval and associated development activities in 2015. 
Finally, in the Gulf of Mexico, we're participating in the 2-well subsea development project at the outside operated Gunflint with first production expected in 2016. 
Moving now to Slide 10.  We have materially reduced our global exploration spending in 2015 with activities focused towards ongoing appraisal activities and/or prior commitments. The majority of this spending is tightly focused within 2 geographic areas. Within the Gulf of Mexico, we continue evaluation and testing of our prospect inventory within the inboard Paleogene play. Several discoveries have been announced within the play over the past few years, including the outside-operated Shenandoah field, where Marathon Oil hold 10% working interest. An appraisal well is expected to spud at Shenandoah in the second quarter. 
Additionally, the and drillship will be back for our second operated well slot sometime during the second quarter of 2015. Moving over to Kurdistan. We are currently drilling the 2 appraisal well within the company-operated block. The well is a follow-up to the 2013 discovery well and will further define the resource base in advance of a commerciality decision, which is due later this year. In addition, within the outside-operated block, the East exploration well is currently being sidetracked to an updated location. Well results are expected to be announced later in 2015. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Lee for his concluding comments."

We are exercising every means available to expand our margins, including significant contributions that you've heard about from enhanced completions and service cost reductions. But we're also mindful of driving the fundamentals of expense management, including organizational capacity, which must match the current environment and activity levels, and finally, operational reliability. Our commitment to our previously stated 7 strategic imperatives is durable regardless of the commodity cycle. Though we're rightly focused on prudent near-term actions, we've laid the groundwork for the future, and we'll continue building on our resource base. 
In 2015, our asset teams will be aggressively testing co-development, stack and frac, downspacing, enhanced completion designs and new horizons. All strategic opportunities to expand our unconventional resource for the future. We are well prepared for the current low-price environment, and our 2015 investment program is based on achieving the highest returns at today's commodity prices while prudently managing cash flows.

Let me address that one, Ed. First, maybe it's useful for us to reflect on kind of how we develop this year's plan, and it was really looking at kind of the near-term pricing environment, the returns that we could generate, high-grading the inventory and then testing that against our cash flow management objectives. And really when we did that, growth became an outcome,  if you will, from that process. And we tested that, of course, against numerous pricing scenarios. If we look at 2015, as we stated in the prepared material, Ed, we're looking at overall growth on average of 5% to 7% for the portfolio but we also believe the resource plays will deliver approximately 20% in growth. If we think about that in terms of exit rates, the exit rates 4Q '14 to 4Q '15 and the resource plays will actually be up and overall portfolio will eventually be flat on exit rates with the resource plays eventually offsetting our more mature properties. Now looking forward into 2016 and as you might imagine, Ed, we ran numerous scenarios looking at not only '15 but also '16 under many, many price decks over the last few months. But when we think about '16 and we think about a moderate level of recovery in '16, we think that we could go over budget essentially at current levels, '15 like levels around the $3.5 billion and keep our overall average for the portfolio essentially flat with likely exit rates increasing a bit year-on-year as we see a little bit more activity because we're seeing some improvement cash flows."

I think Lee's indicated earlier today we really did design the capital budget to reflect the spend that we believe is appropriate even in the current environment. And it was really approached quite carefully to balance between this ongoing capital investment and what we believe are attractive returns in our U.S. unconventional resources and high returns quite candidly with our ability in our commitment to continue to maintain appropriate financial flexibility during this time frame. I think also let's keep in mind, I am seating on nearly $5 billion of liquidity today, and I think that puts us in a good position as we start in the 2015. But honestly, that said, we're going to continue to monitor our level of cash flows based on not only the current price environment but expectations in later part of '15 and 2016 and look at our cash flow profile accordingly to make sure that we're maintaining that flexibility. And if conditions change, we've got a great deal of flexibility to either decrease if they get worse, or equally important, to increase if we see a strengthening environment, our level of capital spend really much of increasing cash flows as well. So -- and then finally, I'd say, Doug, I think Lee highlighted pretty well that we're going to continue to address those matters that really within our control of the business, operating costs, G&A and those sorts of matters. So at this point in time, there's no doubt that we are investing a significant portion of our Norway proceeds this year but I think we're investing them in an organic program that's delivering solid returns for our shareholders."

Back on your other question though maybe more along the lines of the M&A, the acquisitive side. I would maybe characterized that the rates are the focus for us today when you think about the bid spreads that are still out there, there's probably still a bit of a gap. But then thing that we would evaluate has to compete against our already very strong organic inventory.

I think the reason that again we're able to be very capital efficient and 2015 is, again, several fold: one, we've the ability to high-grade our inventory even within our extremely strong core areas. So you've got a high grading effect or you're bringing the best opportunities forward, not only within a basin but across all 3 basins; secondly, were able to do that at lower cost for the reasons that Lance has already enumerated. We captured those cost savings very early in the cycle and certainly we're chasing even more throughout the year. And so -- and then at the asset teams continue to drive things like enhanced completion performance, as well as some of the co-development work, the downspacing work, all of those are tending to improve the overall productivity of the wells also. So it's kind of lifting all boats, if I can put it that way. So when you consider all those factors, I think it positions us very, very strongly to continue to drive that kind of exit rate to exit rate growth. Now again, we are still benefiting from some pretty strong carry-on effects from 2014 as well, but as we look across the year and optimize our completion program, we're going to be able to again keep that production relatively steady throughout the year with, again, a little bit of uptick in the exit rates for '15."

We talked a lot about how share buybacks have got to compete against organic capital reinvestments, and I think we've demonstrated that in 2014. You recall back when we sold Angola, the thought process was what was the next best highest use of capital. And in that point of time, it's a little bit of history, we just significantly ramped up activity across North America. And in that point in time, we were not ready to make that next incremental investment in North America, given our desire to see us operating at that higher scale. So really the next highest and best use from an allocation standpoint is share repurchase. Now fast forward, not only did buy doses of this volatile commodity price environment, but we find ourselves with a level of capital spend that really isn't funding a large portion of our organic investment opportunities and are still higher earnings. So it is a much different conversation regarding what is the risk-adjusted return of that organic reinvestment versus the share repurchases. But I got to tell you though, Pavel, until we see a bit more clarity around the depth and duration of the commodity price correction that we're in right now, I feel like the balance sheet is probably the best place for any incremental capital at this point in time until we see a strengthening in of cash flow. But again, at the appropriate time, share repurchases is going to be a consideration for capital allocation. It's just going to have to continue to compete on a risk-adjusted basis."

But that said, first and foremost, I want to make sure it's clear that we are committed to maintaining that strong balance sheet, and we'll continue to get that commitment throughout this commodity price cycle. I think I said earlier we today, we've got nearly -- or at year-end  we got nearly $5 billion of liquidity, $2.4 billion of that in cash. And the way I look at our investment-grade rating, and I think it's a solid investment-grade rating, is it does reflect: one, that we would expect to maintain throughout this commodity price cycle. And so -- and I think the rating agencies have always historically rated our sector based on a commodity price cycle approach and not just on the environment that they're in. And finally, I think as we've done that, Jason, we've taken that into consideration in designing a 2015 capital program. It does reflect that balance between the need to continue the ongoing investment at high returns while at the same time maintaining that balance sheet. That said, and I think I mentioned it earlier, we're going to continue to watch the current environment and ensure that our capital profile and our operating cash flow profile are appropriately taken into consideration depending on that environment."

We will obviously work to defend those to the extent we can and push on that. It's not all just cost savings though. We continue to focus on cycle time reductions and efficiencies. And so the efficiencies we can achieve in the market, those will be very sticky and stay with us in a perpetuity basis.

I will say Zach is penshading [ph] for Chris Phillips today, who is a bit under the weather. We hope Chris is back with us soon. As Zach mentioned, yesterday afternoon, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings as well as announcing our 2015 capital budget. 
What we really want to accomplish this morning is to spend the bulk of our time on the 2015 capital budget and then turn to your questions. But before I do that, I'd like to share just a few thoughts on our full year 2014 results. I think I would summarize by saying we delivered against our 2014 performance commitments, investing in our 3 high-return U.S. resource plays, which yielded a 35% increase in production. We successfully closed on really 2 significant strategic dispositions of over $4 billion in proceeds, and we are also able to return value to our shareholders through an increased dividend and $1 billion in share repurchases. 
We also had a proved reserve replacement ratio of 183%, x dispositions, and that was at a very competitive $20 per barrel oil equivalent in finding and development costs. And we also recorded 97% operational availability across our company-operated assets, and of course, these are our most economic barrels. I think we could say that by any measure, it was an outstanding year, but the second half of the year brought us a bit of a new reality, a bit of a gut check. Commodity prices corrected significantly downward, and I think we were harshly reminded yet again of our inability to predict pricing. Our business plans for 2015 as with others were being essentially adjusted in real time as the market continued to search for some semblance of stability. And in December, we felt it was critical to, at least, advise our shareholders as to our view of 2015 capital budget guidance at that particular point in time with the caveat that we were prepared to respond to further downward movement in pricing. Our foreshadowing, unfortunately, was quite accurate and prices fell more as we moved into the new year. 
This morning, what we're sharing is our updated plan and budget based on today's view of the pricing environment. But it has the same caveat that flexibility is going to be essential in a volatile commodity market. We will admit there were no more clairvoyant on pricing than we were in December. 
So with that little bit of a preamble, let me go ahead and turn to 2015. Our $3.5 billion budget really emphasizes investment selectivity and returns, balance sheet flexibility and positions us for price recovery. It is a further 20% reduction since our December update. We've significantly reduced exploration spending by half, and we are moderating activity levels in the U.S. in alignment with good cash flow management. We'll end up directing about 70% or $2.4 billion of our budget toward our 3-core U.S. resource plays, and these continue to be among our highest return investment opportunities. Our objective is simple. It's to deliver high returns in the current pricing environment while we protect our financial flexibility through prudent management of cash flows. Today, we're also releasing updated single-well economics for the resource plays. And these new single-well economics reflect our 2015 inventory hydrating along with the service cost reductions that we've already captured and have in hand. 
Suffice to say, we are not opportunity-limited. Furthermore, we're continuing to pursue all means to expand our margins. We're going to do this through capital efficiency, expense management and operational reliability. Those things that we can control. 
Marathon Oil clearly benefits from a deep multi-year inventory that is robust across a broad range of pricing scenarios. Given this portfolio, we're fortunate to have the optionality to adjust our short-cycle investment in line with commodity prices. As we continue to focus on our 3 high-quality U.S. resource plays in 2015, our budget and activity plans will support high-return investments that will, in turn, generate a total company production growth rate x Libya, of 5% to 7% year-over-year. And specifically for our resource plays, a growth rate of about 20% year-over-year, admittedly benefiting from the 2014 carry-on effect. Bottom line is that we're going to be driven by returns and cash flow management with growth as an outcome while we retain the ability to flex on pricing. 
With that, I'll turn over to Lance Robertson, our Vice President of North America Production Operations, and he'll take us through our activity plans for the resource plays. Lance?"

In the context of the current environment, we are prudently reducing development activity and commensurate capital expenditures across all 3 of the resource plays. Having the flexibility within our existing commercial agreements allows us to make these adjustments readily and at little to no cost. As reflected by the table in the top right of the slide, activity will be reduced from 33 active rigs at the end of 2014 to 18 by the end of the first quarter, with a further reduction to 14 rigs by the end of the second quarter. 
We anticipate continuing at the 14-rig pace across the balance of 2015 but retain significant flexibility to scale up or down as market conditions warrant. In addition to rig reductions, we are optimizing completions activity to match our inventory of wells with the focus on maintaining the execution efficiency of full frac fleets. In addition to driving operational efficiencies, we have focused extensively on service cost reductions in this environment, securing to date a minimum of $225 million in savings across the 2015 activity. 
Importantly, substantially, all of these initial savings were effective in January, benefiting our returns early in the cycle. We continue to see opportunity for additional savings throughout the year further protecting our cash margins. Our North America opportunities for investment remain compelling at current commodity pricing. Referencing the plot in the bottom right, our 2015 investments will focus on inventory that can deliver strong returns in each of Eagle Ford, Bakken and the Oklahoma Resource Basins. In addition, we have multiple years of inventory that can deliver similar returns at today's pricing. 
With our core position in 3 key basins and a relentless focus on continuing to drive efficiencies and cost savings, we can continue to provide Marathon Oil with opportunities to deliver value to our shareholders. The 2015 development spend and activity in the resource basins will resort in a production increase of approximately 20% year-on-year with fourth quarter 2015 exit rates up from the same quarter of 2014. 
Turning to Slide 5. We will focus initially on the Eagle Ford, where we have allocated approximately 40% of total 2015 capital on our high-return inventory. Our quality core acreage provides opportunity to drive tremendous value at this scale. We continue to realize this value through highly effective execution. With these efficiencies and recently secured service cost reductions, our costs have fallen by $1.3 million a well to an average of $6.3 million a well in 2015. Maintaining our position is one of the most cost efficient operators in the basin. Over the past year, completions optimization has resulted in a 25% increase in 180-day cumulative production across wells to sales. This incremental early-life production materially improves well margins. And as this group matures, we anticipate adding further value with an increase in ultimate volumes recovery. 
Taking into account cost savings and improvements in well performance, we anticipate drilling approximately 215 to 225 wells this year in South Texas, with returns ranging from 40% to 60% at $60 flat WTI pricing. This group includes Eagle Ford condensate wells, high GOR Eagle Ford oil wells, with the remaining 25% of wells to develop and further delineate the Austin Chalk. In all cases, the Austin Chalk is codeveloped with the Lower Eagle Ford, leveraging the existing gathering network and the facilities. Focusing on the table in the upper left, we are illustrating for the first time single-well metrics for the Austin Chalk. From the data, you can see that the initial production in estimated ultimate recovery compared favorably to the Eagle Ford condensate and high GOR oil wells. In the currently delineated core area, the Austin Chalk wells delivered the highest returns driven by higher early-life cumulative production relative to other horizons in the Eagle Ford portfolio. 
Continuing with our codevelopment efforts, the first 4 Upper Eagle Ford wells were placed on sales in the fourth quarter. They're codeveloped above high GOR Lower Eagle Ford oil wells in this pilot consistent with the Austin Chalk codevelopment effort. Same zone spacing is 40-acre equivalent, with spacing between the horizons at 20-acre equivalent. These wells are early on flow, but initial rates and pressures are encouraging from both horizons. 
We will continue this testing throughout the year much in the way of the Austin Chalk has been and will continue to be identified, evaluated and developed. In addition, we also spud the first stack-and-frac codevelopment pilot in the fourth quarter, including Austin Chalk, Upper Eagle Ford and 2 wells in the Lower Eagle Ford. We will provide  an update on these efforts later in the year. 
Focusing on the Bakken on Slide 6. The initial completion trials are mostly finished, with 42 of the wells completed and flowing to sales. Of these wells, the first 18 in Myrmidon and Hector have yielded a more than 30% increase in cumulative production over the first 60 days. This material change in early production is clearly very encouraging, and we anticipate further updates as the production histories mature. In aggregate, the incremental spend on more intensive completions is yielding a return on investment at or above 100% in all areas and zones. As a result, a strong early production response in our focus on driving value. We have adopted the updated completion practices with more intensive stimulations into the base program. These changes are effective across Myrmidon and Hector and Middle Bakken and Three Forks intervals. Reflecting the success, we will continue to test and optimize completions moving forward. 
Directing your attention to the single-well returns table in the upper left of the slide. We illustrated updated gross completed well costs of $6.2 million to $6.6 million a well, reflecting a reduction of almost $1 million a well thus far. 
These costs include incremental spend for more intensive stimulations for each area, but the full performance benefits of enhanced completions on EUR is not yet reflected. 
In addition to the completion pilots, we have concluded drilling on the first 2 spacing pilots with 6 wells per horizon in Hector and Myrmidon. These pilots will move to completions over the coming weeks with the third spacing pilot currently drilling. We anticipate a combination of improved stimulation designs coupled with increasing spacing density to drive toward the highest value, incrementally improving the recovery efficiency across a drilling unit. With improved well costs and higher initial production, our investments in the Williston Basin will deliver competitive returns of 20% to 30% in the current commodity environment. As we continue to focus on highest returns and value, the majority of our activity in 2015 will incur in the Myrmidon area. 
On slide 7, Oklahoma Resource activity will focus on protecting core leasehold in the SCOOP and STACK areas. With more than 70% of our Oklahoma acreage held by production, our 2015 activity will allow us to manage lease expirees with moderated spend of approximately $225 million in 2 rigs after the first quarter. Our focus for the year will include high-value SCOOP and STACK wells, including our first operated spacing pilot in the SCOOP Woodford, but we are targeting 6 wells in a 640-acre unit, effectively testing same zone spacing of approximately 105 acres. This spacing pilot was spud in the fourth quarter. We anticipate moving to completions by the middle of 2015. In addition, we will spud our first operated Springer well in the SCOOP area later in the year to complement the 17 outside operated Springer wells in which we currently participate. We continue to grow our leasehold in Oklahoma, adding 10,000 net acres focused on the SCOOP and Springer areas in the fourth quarters. 
Drawing your attention to the table in the upper left, SCOOP well estimated ultimate recoveries continue to be among the highest available with a high liquids content. Having secured an initial cost reduction of more than $0.5 million, we can confidently deliver wells with 30% to 40% internal rates of return in the current commodity market. With the lower activity in Oklahoma, we'll turn our focus to developing the spacing pilots, driving efficiency, securing additional cost reductions and delivering higher ultimate value. With the longest wells from spud to total depth in our resource portfolio of today, we see ample opportunity for cycle time improvements in 2015. And with price recovery, we'll be ready to move the scale at the lowest cost. 
Slide 8 brings together all 3 U.S. resource plays and demonstrates the strength of our resource and inventory. Our 2015 capital development program is one that appropriately scaled to today's commodity price environment. As Lee mentioned at the beginning, we expect these basins to achieve an approximate 20% increase in production 2015 over 2014, taking into account our spending plans and moderated activity levels. 
Next, I'll hand it off to my counterpart, Mitch Little, Vice President of International and Offshore E&P Operations. Mitch will describe 2015 activity for his business."

Switching now to our international and offshore activities, which begin on Slide 9. Our 2015 development activities are focused on high-return, previously sanctioned, long-cycle commitments and selective other projects that offer superior risk-adjusted returns, including targeted activities in Equatorial Guinea, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, U.S. Gulf of Mexico and U.K. North Sea. Within EG, we're progressing the Alba B3 compression project, which adds important infrastructure, allowing us to access the field's proven reserve base by significantly lowering field abandonment pressure. The project is approximately 60% complete, remains within budget and on track for a 2016 start-up. Combined with the addition of the C-21 infill producer, the project is expected to maintain field production plateau for an additional 2 years while extending field life by as much as 8 years. 
Our investment activities in EG also include a second near-field wildcat well, testing an oil-prone amplitude-supported prospect at Rodo, which is located within Sub Area B of the Alba block. While the recently drilled Sodalita West well did not encounter commercial hydrocarbon quantities, we were encouraged by the presence of high-quality oil in multiple STACK sands. Our upcoming Rodo well is targeting a younger reservoir section, and we have several additional prospects across our more than 120,000 net acres under contract in EG. 
Our U.K. investment program is concentrated on the addition of 3 infill producers that add high-return, incremental barrels to our existing operations. The first well, an infil producer at South Brae, will be online within the first quarter and follows on the success of 2 previous wells that were brought online in late 2014 and continued to outperform predrill expectations. Activities also include drilling and completion of 2 subsea infill producers within our operated West Brae field. The first of these wells is expected to be online by the end of February, with the second coming online around mid-year. 
Moving on to our planed 2015 Kurdistan investment program, which includes the development activities highlighted here as well as exploration activities, which will be discussed on the subsequent slides. Within the outside Atrush Block, construction and installation of the phase 1 production facilities continues with the first production currently forecast for late 2015. Appraisal and testing activities also continue in the eastern portions of the field, and results from those activities will be integrated with existing data to inform a future decision regarding the applicability of additional development phases. The outside-operated Sarsang block is currently producing around 4,000 gross barrels of oil a day from a single-well facility within the Swara Tika field. A phased field development plan is under review within the Kurdistan Ministry of Natural Resources, and we anticipate approval and associated development activities in 2015. 
Finally, in the Gulf of Mexico, we're participating in the 2-well subsea development project at the outside-operated Gunflint with first production expected in 2016. 
Moving now to Slide 10. We have materially reduced our global exploration spending in 2015 with activities focused towards ongoing appraisal activities and/or prior commitments. The majority of this spending is tightly focused within 2 geographic areas. Within the Gulf of Mexico, we continue evaluation and testing of our prospect inventory within the inboard Paleogene play. Several discoveries have been announced within the play over the past few years, including the outside-operated Shenandoah field, where Marathon Oil holds a 10% working interest. An appraisal well is expected to spud at Shenandoah in the second quarter.
Additionally, the Maersk Valiant drillship will be back for our second operated well slot sometime during the second quarter of 2015. Moving over to Kurdistan, we are currently drilling the Mirawa 2 appraisal well within the company-operated Harir Block. The well is a follow-up to the 2013 Mirawa discovery well and will further define the resource base in advance of a commerciality decision, which is due later this year. In addition, within the outside-operated Sarsang block, the East Swara Tika exploration well is currently being sidetracked to an updip location. Well results are expected to be announced later in 2015. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Lee for his concluding comments."

As our budget and activity plans demonstrate, Marathon Oil is focused on delivering long-term shareholder value regardless of the commodity price cycle. We have a keen eye on returns and financial flexibility. We're committed to exercising capital discipline that will protect our optionality and position us to be a stronger E&P and not only 2015 and '16 but beyond. Our 3 U.S. resource plays have exceptional subsurface quality and strong single-well economics that will deliver solid returns across a broad range of price scenarios. Even after high-grading our opportunities for this low-price environment, our deep portfolio affords us a multi-year drilling inventory, with pace and spending levels ultimately moderated based on pricing and cash flows. We are exercising every means available to expand our margins, including significant contributions that you've heard about from enhanced completions and service cost reductions. But we're also mindful of driving the fundamentals of expense management, including organizational capacity, which must match the current environment and activity levels, and finally, operational reliability. Our commitment to our previously stated 7 strategic imperatives is durable regardless of the commodity cycle. Though we're rightly focused on prudent near-term actions, we've laid the groundwork for the future, and we'll continue building on our resource base. 
In 2015, our asset teams will be aggressively testing codevelopment, stack and frac, downspacing, enhanced completion designs and new horizons; all strategic opportunities to expand our unconventional resource for the future. We are well prepared for the current low-price environment, and our 2015 investment program is based on achieving the highest returns at today's commodity prices while prudently managing cash flows. We will also continue to protect optionality to flex our spend up or down, and we'll ensure that our outstanding asset teams are prepared to take full advantage of a sustained recovery. 
That really concludes our prepared remarks. So operator, we'll now open up the call for questions."

Let me address that one, Ed. First, maybe it's useful for us just to reflect on kind of how we develop this year's plan, and it was really looking at kind of the near-term pricing environment, the returns that we could generate, high-grading the inventory and then testing that against our cash flow management objectives. And really when we did that, growth became an outcome, if you will, from that process. And we tested that, of course, against numerous pricing scenarios. If we look at 2015, as we stated in the prepared material, Ed, we're looking at overall growth on average of 5% to 7% for the portfolio, but we also believe the resource plays will deliver approximately 20% in growth. If we think about that in terms of exit rates, the exit rates 4Q '14 to 4Q '15 in the resource plays will actually be up, and the overall portfolio will essentially be flat on exit rate with the resource plays essentially offsetting our more mature properties. Looking forward into 2016 and as you might imagine, Ed, we ran numerous scenarios looking at not only '15 but also '16 under many, many price decks over the last few months. But when we think about '16 and we think about a moderate level of recovery in '16, we think that we could hold our budget essentially at current levels, '15-type levels around the $3.5 billion, and keep our overall average for the portfolio essentially flat with likely exit rates increasing a bit year-on-year as we see a little bit more activity because we're seeing some improvement in cash flows."

I will say though that we are optimizing our completion program. We're not simply just driving forward with our backlog of inventory. As Lance mentioned, we're going to be very judicious about pacing our completion activity in 2015 to ensure that we, one, capture full cost reduction savings at scale; but two, also capture the executions efficiency of running full-frac crews.

I think also, let's keep in mind, I am sitting on nearly $5 billion of liquidity today, and I think that puts us in a good position as we start in the 2015. But honestly, that said, I mean, we're going to continue to monitor our level of cash flows based on not only the current price environment but the expectations in later part of '15 and 2016, and look at our cash flow profile accordingly to make sure that we're maintaining that flexibility. And if conditions changed, we've got a great deal of flexibility to either decrease, if they get worse; or equally important, to increase, if we see a strengthening environment, our level of capital spend to really match that increase in cash flows as well.

Back on your other question, though, more maybe along the lines of the M&A, the acquisitive side, I would maybe characterize it -- though it's not a focus for us today, I mean, when you think about the bid-ask spread that's still out there, there's probably still a bit of a gap.

I think the reason that, again, we're able to be very capital efficient in 2015 is, again, several folds. One, we've had the ability to high-grade our inventory even within our extremely strong core areas. So you've got a high-grading effect or you're bringing the best opportunities forward, not only within a basin but across all 3 basins; secondly, we're able to do that at lower cost for the reasons that Lance has already enumerated. We've captured those early cost savings very early in the cycle and certainly, we're chasing even more throughout the year. And then as the asset teams continue to drive things like enhanced completion performance, as well as some of the codevelopment work, the downspacing work, all of those are tending to improve the overall productivity of the wells also. So it's kind of lifting all boats, if I can put it that way. So when you consider all those factors, I think it positions us very, very strongly to continue to drive that kind of exit rate to exit rate growth. Now again, we are still benefiting from some pretty strong carry-on effects from 2014 as well. But as we look across the year and optimize our completion program, we're going to be able to again keep that production relatively steady throughout the year with, again, a little bit of uptick in the exit rates for '15"

To be very frank, we are not satisfied with our historical performance in exploration. And under Mitch's leadership, we feel a need to improve in that area. And while we're searching for the enhanced approach that will drive those improved results, we are reducing spend materially. A lot of that reduction quite, frankly, was in place in a basis before the commodity price correction though. So it was largely driven by, I would say, scheduling and commitments that we had in the 2015 time period. I would end just by saying that exploration must compete for capital allocation, like every other aspect of our business. And so this year, the spend will be materially reduced. And as we look forward in time, opportunities in exploration will have to go head to head with the other investment opportunities we have in our portfolio."

We talked a lot about how share buybacks have got to compete against organic capital reinvestments, and I think we've demonstrated that in 2014. You recall back when we sold Angola, the thought process was what was that next best highest use of capital. And that point of time, so a little bit of history, we just significantly ramped up activity across North America. And that point in time, we were not ready to make that next incremental investment in North America given our desire to see us operating at that higher scale. So really the next highest and best use from an allocation standpoint was share repurchases. Now fast forward, not only do we find ourselves in this volatile commodity price environment, but we find ourselves with a level of capital spend that really isn't funding a large portion of our organic investment opportunities that are still higher earnings. So it is a much different conversation regarding what is the risk-adjusted return of that organic reinvestment versus the share repurchases. But I got to tell you, though, Pavel, I mean, until we see a bit more clarity around the depth and duration of the commodity price correction that we're in right now, I feel like the balance sheet is probably the best place for any incremental capital at this point in time until we see a strengthening of cash flow. But again, at the appropriate time, share repurchases is going to be a consideration for capital allocation. It's just going to have to continue to compete on a risk adjusted basis."

So we do have a lot of data, and we're advancing our understanding of the reservoir performance early. But of course, we're excited to get to our own operated activity later this year."

I will say Zach is pinch-hitting for Chris Phillips today, who is a bit under the weather. We hope Chris is back with us soon. As Zach mentioned, yesterday afternoon we released our fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings, as well as announcing our 2015 capital budget. 
What we really want to accomplish this morning is to spend the bulk of our time on the 2015 capital budget and then turn to your questions. But before I do that, I'd like to share just a few thoughts on our full year 2014 results. I think I would summarize by saying we delivered against our 2014 performance commitments, investing in our 3 high-return U.S. resource plays, which yielded a 35% increase in production. We successfully closed on really 2 significant strategic dispositions of over $4 billion in proceeds, and we are also able to return value to our shareholders through an increased dividend and $1 billion in share repurchases. 
We also had a proved reserve replacement ratio of 183%, ex dispositions, and that was at a very competitive $20 per barrel oil equivalent and finding and development costs. And we also recorded 97% operational availability across our company-operated assets, and of course, these are our most economic barrels. I think we could say that by any measure, it was an outstanding year, but the second half of the year brought us a bit of a new reality, a bit of a gut check. Commodity prices corrected significantly downward, and I think we were harshly reminded yet again of our inability to predict pricing. Our business plans for 2015, as with others, were being essentially adjusted in real time, as the market continued to search for some semblance of stability. And in December, we felt it was critical to at least advise our shareholders as to our view of 2015 capital budget guidance at that particular point in time, with the caveat that we were prepared to respond to further downward movement in pricing. Our foreshadowing, unfortunately, was quite accurate and prices fell more as we moved into the new year. 
This morning, what we're sharing is our updated plan and budget based on today's view of the pricing environment. But it has the same caveat, that flexibility is going to be essential in a volatile commodity market. We will admit that we're no more clairvoyant on pricing than we were in December. 
So with that little bit of a preamble, let me go ahead and turn to 2015. Our $3.5 billion budget really emphasizes investment selectivity and returns, balance sheet flexibility and positions us for price recovery. It is a further 20% reduction since our December update. We've significantly reduced exploration spending by half, and we are moderating activity levels in the U.S. in alignment with good cash flow management. We'll end up directing about 70% or $2.4 billion of our budget toward our 3 core U.S. resource plays, and these continue to be among our highest-return investment opportunities. Our objective is simple. It's to deliver high returns in the current pricing environment while we protect our financial flexibility through prudent management of cash flows. Today, we're also releasing updated single-well economics for the resource plays. And these new single-well economics reflect our 2015 inventory high-grading, along with the service cost reductions that we've already captured and have in hand. 
Suffice it to say, we are not opportunity-limited. Furthermore, we're continuing to pursue all means to expand our margins. We're going to do this through capital efficiency, expense management and operational reliability, those things that we can control. 
Marathon Oil clearly benefits from a deep multi-year inventory that is robust across a broad range of pricing scenarios. Given this portfolio, we're fortunate to have the optionality to adjust our short-cycle investment in line with commodity prices. As we continue to focus on our 3 high-quality U.S. resource plays in 2015, our budget and activity plans will support high-return investments that will in turn generate a total company production growth rate, ex Libya, of 5% to 7% year-over-year. And specifically for our resource plays, a growth rate of about 20% year-over-year, admittedly benefiting from the 2014 carry in effect. Bottom line is that we're going to be driven by returns and cash flow management with growth as an outcome while we retain the ability to flex on pricing. 
With that, I'll turn over to Lance Robertson, our Vice President of North America Production Operations, and he'll take us through our activity plans for the resource plays. Lance?"
314842,281935940,766317,"Marathon Oil Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2015",2015-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Oil Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lee. I'll begin on Slide 4. In the context of the current environment, we are prudently reducing development activity and commensurate capital expenditures across all 3 of the resource plays.

In the context of the current environment, we are prudently reducing development activity and commensurate capital expenditures across all 3 of the resource plays. Having the flexibility within our existing commercial agreements allows us to make these adjustments readily and at little to no cost. As reflected by the table in the top right of the slide, activity will be reduced from 33 active rigs at the end of 2014 to 18 by the end of the first quarter, with a further reduction to 14 rigs by the end of the second quarter. 
We anticipate continuing at the 14-rig pace across the balance of 2015 but retain significant flexibility to scale up or down as market conditions warrant. In addition to rig reductions, we are optimizing completions activity to match our inventory of wells, with a focus on maintaining the execution efficiency of full frac fleets. In addition to driving operational efficiencies, we have focused extensively on service cost reductions in this environment, securing to date a minimum of $225 million in savings across the 2015 activity. 
Importantly, substantially all of these initial savings were effective in January, benefiting our returns early in the cycle. We continue to see opportunity for additional savings throughout the year further protecting our cash margins. Our North America opportunities for investment remain compelling at current commodity pricing. Referencing the plot in the bottom right, our 2015 investments will focus on inventory that can deliver strong returns in each of Eagle Ford, Bakken and the Oklahoma Resource Basins. In addition, we have multiple years of inventory that can deliver similar returns at today's pricing. 
With our core position in 3 key basins and a relentless focus on continuing to drive efficiencies and cost savings, we can continue to provide Marathon Oil with opportunities to deliver value to our shareholders. The 2015 development spend and activity in the resource basins will result in a production increase of approximately 20% year-on-year, with fourth quarter 2015 exit rates up from the same quarter of 2014. 
Turning to Slide 5. We will focus initially on the Eagle Ford, where we have allocated approximately 40% of total 2015 capital on our high-return inventory. Our quality core acreage provides opportunity to drive tremendous value at this scale. We continue to realize this value through highly effective execution. With these efficiencies and recently secured service cost reductions, our costs have fallen by $1.3 million a well to an average of $6.3 million a well in 2015, maintaining our position as one of the most cost efficient operators in the basin. Over the past year, completions optimization has resulted in a 25% increase in 180-day cumulative production across wells to sales. This incremental early-life production materially improves well margins. And as this group matures, we anticipate adding further value with an increase in ultimate volumes recovered. 
Taking into account cost savings and improvements in well performance, we anticipate drilling approximately 215 to 225 wells this year in South Texas, with returns ranging from 40% to 60% at $60 flat WTI pricing. This group includes Eagle Ford condensate wells, high GOR Eagle Ford oil wells, with the remaining 25% of wells to develop and further delineate the Austin Chalk. In all cases, the Austin Chalk is co-developed with the Lower Eagle Ford, leveraging the existing gathering network and the facilities. Focusing on the table in the upper left, we are illustrating for the first time single-well metrics for the Austin Chalk. From the data, you can see that the initial production in estimated ultimate recovery compare favorably to the Eagle Ford condensate and high GOR oil wells. In the currently delineated core area, the Austin Chalk wells deliver the highest returns, driven by higher early-life cumulative production relative to other horizons in the Eagle Ford portfolio. 
Continuing with our co-development efforts, the first 4 Upper Eagle Ford wells were placed on sales in the fourth quarter. They're co-developed above high GOR Lower Eagle Ford oil wells. In this pilot, consistent with the Austin Chalk co-development effort, same zone spacing is 40-acre equivalent, with spacing between the horizons at 20-acre equivalent. These wells are early on flow, but initial rates and pressures are encouraging from both horizons. 
We will continue this testing throughout the year much in the way the Austin Chalk has been and will continue to be identified, evaluated and developed. In addition, we also spud the first stack-and-frac co-development pilot in the fourth quarter, including Austin Chalk, Upper Eagle Ford and 2 wells in the Lower Eagle Ford. We will provide an update on these efforts later in the year. 
Focusing on the Bakken on Slide 6. The initial completion trials are mostly finished, with 42 of the wells completed and flowing to sales. Of these wells, the first 18 in Myrmidon and Hector have yielded a more than 30% increase in cumulative production over the first 60 days. This material change in early production is clearly very encouraging, and we anticipate further updates as the production histories mature. In aggregate, the incremental spend on more intensive completions is yielding a return on investment at or above 100% in all areas and zones. As a result, a strong early production response and our focus on driving value, we have adopted the updated completion practices with more intensive stimulations into the base program. These changes are effective across Myrmidon and Hector and Middle Bakken and Three Forks intervals. Reflecting the success, we will continue to test and optimize completions moving forward. 
Directing your attention to the single-well returns table in the upper left of the slide, we illustrated updated gross completed well costs of $6.2 million to $6.6 million a well, reflecting a reduction of almost $1 million a well thus far. 
These costs include incremental spend for more intensive stimulations for each area, but the full performance benefits of enhanced completions on EUR is not yet reflected. 
In addition to the completion pilots, we have concluded drilling on the first 2 spacing pilots, with 6 wells per horizon in Hector and Myrmidon. These pilots will move to completions over the coming weeks, with a third spacing pilot currently drilling. We anticipate a combination of improved stimulation designs coupled with increasing spacing density to drive toward the highest value, incrementally improving the recovery efficiency across a drilling unit. With improved well costs and higher initial production, our investments in the Williston Basin will deliver competitive returns of 20% to 30% in the current commodity environment. As we continue to focus on highest returns and value, the majority of our activity in 2015 will occur in the Myrmidon area. 
On Slide 7, Oklahoma Resource activity will focus on protecting core leasehold in the SCOOP and STACK areas. With more than 70% of our Oklahoma acreage held by production, our 2015 activity will allow us to manage lease expiries with moderated spend of approximately $225 million and 2 rigs after the first quarter. Our focus for the year will include high-value SCOOP and STACK wells, including our first operated spacing pilot in the SCOOP Woodford, where we are targeting 6 wells in a 640-acre unit, effectively testing same zone spacing of approximately 105 acres. This spacing pilot was spud in the fourth quarter. We anticipate moving to completions by the middle of 2015. In addition, we will spud our first operated Springer well in the SCOOP area later in the year to complement the 17 outside-operated Springer wells in which we currently participate. We continue to grow our leasehold in Oklahoma, adding 10,000 net acres focused on the SCOOP and Springer areas in the fourth quarter. 
Drawing your attention to the table in the upper left, SCOOP well estimated ultimate recoveries continue to be among the highest available, with a high liquids content. Having secured an initial cost reduction of more than $0.5 million, we can confidently deliver wells with 30% to 40% internal rates of return in the current commodity market. With the lower activity in Oklahoma, we'll turn our focus to developing the spacing pilots, driving efficiency, securing additional cost reductions and delivering higher ultimate value. With the longest wells from spud to total depth in our resource portfolio today, we see ample opportunity for cycle time improvements in 2015. And with price recovery, we'll be ready to move to scale at the lowest cost. 
Slide 8 brings together all 3 U.S. resource plays and demonstrates the strength of our resource and inventory. Our 2015 capital development program is one that appropriately scaled to today's commodity price environment. As Lee mentioned at the beginning, we expect these basins to achieve an approximate 20% increase in production 2015 over 2014, taking into account our spending plans and moderated activity levels. 
Next, I'll hand it off to my counterpart, Mitch Little, Vice President of International and Offshore E&P Operations. Mitch will describe 2015 activity for his business."

Switching now to our international and offshore activities, which begin on Slide 9. Our 2015 development activities are focused on high-return, previously sanctioned, long-cycle commitments and selective other projects that offer superior risk-adjusted returns, including targeted activities in Equatorial Guinea, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, U.S. Gulf of Mexico and the U.K. North Sea. Within EG, we're progressing the Alba B3 compression project, which adds important infrastructure, allowing us to access the field's proven reserve base by significantly lowering field abandonment pressure. The project is approximately 60% complete, remains within budget and on track for a 2016 start-up. Combined with the addition of the C-21 infill producer, the project is expected to maintain field production plateau for an additional 2 years, while extending field life by as much as 8 years. 
Our investment activities in EG also include a second near-field wildcat well, testing an oil-prone, amplitude-supported prospect at Rodo, which is located within Sub Area B of the Alba block. While the recently drilled Sodalita West well did not encounter commercial hydrocarbon quantities, we were encouraged by the presence of high-quality oil in multiple stacked sands. Our upcoming Rodo well is targeting a younger reservoir section, and we have several additional prospects across our more than 120,000 net acres under contract in EG. 
Our U.K. investment program is concentrated on the addition of 3 infill producers that add high-return, incremental barrels to our existing operations. The first well, an infill producer at South Brae, will be online within the first quarter and follows on the success of 2 previous wells that were brought online in late 2014 and continued to outperform predrill expectations. Activities also include drilling and completion of 2 subsea infill producers within our operated West Brae field. The first of these wells is expected to be online by the end of February, with the second coming online around mid-year. 
Moving on to our planned 2015 Kurdistan investment program, which includes the development activities highlighted here, as well as exploration activities, which will be discussed on the subsequent slides. Within the outside-operated Atrush Block, construction and installation of the phase 1 production facilities continues, with first production currently forecast for late 2015. Appraisal and testing activities also continue in the eastern portions of the field, and results from those activities will be integrated with existing data to inform a future decision regarding the applicability of additional development phases. The outside-operated Sarsang block is currently producing around 4,000 gross barrels of oil a day from a single-well facility within the Swara Tika field. A phased field development plan is under review within the Kurdistan Ministry of Natural Resources, and we anticipate approval and associated development activities in 2015. 
Finally, in the Gulf of Mexico, we're participating in the 2-well subsea development project at the outside-operated Gunflint, with first production expected in 2016. 
Moving now to Slide 10. We have materially reduced our global exploration spending in 2015, with activities focused towards ongoing appraisal activities and/or prior commitments. The majority of this spending is tightly focused within 2 geographic areas. Within the Gulf of Mexico, we continue evaluation and testing of our prospect inventory within the inboard Paleogene play. Several discoveries have been announced within the play over the past few years, including the outside-operated Shenandoah field, where Marathon Oil holds a 10% working interest. An appraisal well is expected to spud at Shenandoah in the second quarter.
Additionally, the Maersk Valiant drillship will be back for our second operated well slot sometime during the second quarter of 2015. Moving over to Kurdistan, we are currently drilling the Mirawa 2 appraisal well within the company-operated Harir Block. The well is a follow-up to the 2013 Mirawa discovery well and will further define the resource base in advance of a commerciality decision, which is due later this year. In addition, within the outside-operated Sarsang block, the East Swara Tika exploration well is currently being sidetracked to an updip location. Well results are expected to be announced later in 2015. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Lee for his concluding comments."

Our 3 U.S. resource plays have exceptional subsurface quality and strong single-well economics that will deliver solid returns across a broad range of price scenarios. Even after high-grading our opportunities for this low-price environment, our deep portfolio affords us a multi-year drilling inventory, with pace and spending levels ultimately moderated based on pricing and cash flows. We are exercising every means available to expand our margins, including significant contributions that you've heard about from enhanced completions and service cost reductions. But we're also mindful of driving the fundamentals of expense management, including organizational capacity, which must match the current environment and activity levels, and finally, operational reliability. Our commitment to our previously stated 7 strategic imperatives is durable regardless of the commodity cycle. Though we're rightly focused on prudent near-term actions, we've laid the groundwork for the future, and we'll continue building on our resource base. 
In 2015, our asset teams will be aggressively testing co-development, stack and frac, downspacing, enhanced completion designs and new horizons; all strategic opportunities to expand our unconventional resource for the future. We are well prepared for the current low-price environment, and our 2015 investment program is based on achieving the highest returns at today's commodity prices while prudently managing cash flows. We will also continue to protect optionality to flex our spend up or down, and we'll ensure that our outstanding asset teams are prepared to take full advantage of a sustained recovery.

Let me address that one, Ed. First, maybe it's useful for us just to reflect on kind of how we developed this year's plan, and it was really looking at kind of the near-term pricing environment, the returns that we could generate, high-grading the inventory and then testing that against our cash flow management objectives. And really when we did that, growth became an outcome, if you will, from that process. And we tested that, of course, against numerous pricing scenarios. If we look at 2015, as we stated in the prepared material, Ed, we're looking at overall growth on average of 5% to 7% for the portfolio, but we also believe the resource plays will deliver approximately 20% in growth. If we think about that in terms of exit rates, the exit rates 4Q '14 to 4Q '15 in the resource plays will actually be up, and the overall portfolio will essentially be flat on exit rate with the resource plays essentially offsetting our more mature properties. Looking forward into 2016 and as you might imagine, Ed, we've run numerous scenarios looking at not only '15 but also '16 under many, many price decks over the last few months. But when we think about '16 and we think about a moderate level of recovery in '16, we think that we could hold our budget essentially at current levels, '15-type levels around the $3.5 billion, and keep our overall average for the portfolio essentially flat, with likely exit rates increasing a bit year-on-year as we see a little bit more activity because we're seeing some improvement in cash flows."

I will say though that we are optimizing our completion program. We're not simply just driving forward with our backlog of inventory. As Lance mentioned, we're going to be very judicious about pacing our completion activity in 2015 to ensure that we, one, capture full cost reduction savings at scale; but two, also capture the executions efficiency of running full frac crews.

I think Lee's indicated earlier today, I mean, we really did design the capital budget to reflect the spend that we believe is appropriate even in the current environment. And it was really approached quite carefully to balance between this ongoing capital investment in what we believe are attractive returns in our U.S. unconventional resources, and high returns quite candidly, with our ability and our commitment to continue to maintain appropriate financial flexibility during this time frame. I think also, let's keep in mind, I am sitting on nearly $5 billion of liquidity today, and I think that puts us in a good position as we start into 2015. But honestly, that said, I mean, we're going to continue to monitor our level of cash flows based on not only the current price environment, but the expectations in later part of '15 and 2016, and look at our cash flow profile accordingly to make sure that we're maintaining that flexibility. And if conditions change, we've got a great deal of flexibility to either decrease, if they get worse; or equally important, to increase, if we see a strengthening environment, our level of capital spend to really match that increase in cash flows as well. And then finally, I'd say, Doug, I think Lee highlighted pretty well that we're going to continue to address those matters that are really within our control of the business, operating costs, G&A and those sorts of matters.

Now let's be honest, it's a tough market right now to go out and dispose of an asset and capture true value for the shareholder, but we're going to continue to test the market when we think that it makes sense for the shareholder. Back on your other question, though, more maybe along the lines of the M&A, the acquisitive side, I would maybe characterize it -- though it's not a focus for us today, I mean, when you think about the bid-ask spread that's still out there, there's probably still a bit of a gap. But anything that we would evaluate has to compete against our already very strong organic inventory. It would have to come in and compete for capital allocation, which in our view is a relatively high bar from a quality and scale standpoint.

I think the reason that, again, we're able to be very capital efficient in 2015 is, again, several-fold. One, we've had the ability to high-grade our inventory even within our extremely strong core areas. So you've got a high-grading effect where you're bringing the best opportunities forward, not only within a basin but across all 3 basins. Secondly, we're able to do that at lower costs, for the reasons that Lance has already enumerated. We've captured those early cost savings very early in the cycle and certainly, we're chasing even more throughout the year. And then as the asset teams continue to drive things like enhanced completion performance, as well as some of the co-development work, the downspacing work, all of those are tending to improve the overall productivity of the wells also. So it's kind of lifting all boats, if I can put it that way. So when you consider all those factors, I think it positions us very, very strongly to continue to drive that kind of exit rate to exit rate growth. Now again, we are still benefiting from some pretty strong carry-in effects from 2014 as well. But as we look across the year and optimize our completion program, we're going to be able to, again, keep that production relatively steady throughout the year with, again, a little bit of uptick in the exit rates for '15."

We see this as a great opportunity to drive well productivity as well as test spacing so that as prices do recover in the future, we're very well positioned to grow to full field development scale quickly and at the highest value for the company.

We talked a lot about how share buybacks have got to compete against organic capital reinvestments, and I think we've demonstrated that in 2014. You recall back when we sold Angola, the thought process was what was that next best highest use of capital. And at that point of time, so a little bit of history, we had just significantly ramped up activity across North America. And at that point in time, we were not ready to make that next incremental investment in North America, given our desire to see us operating at that higher scale. So really the next highest and best use from an allocation standpoint was share repurchases. Now fast forward, not only do we find ourselves in this volatile commodity price environment, but we find ourselves with a level of capital spend that really isn't funding a large portion of our organic investment opportunities that are still high-earning. So it is a much different conversation regarding what is the risk-adjusted return of that organic reinvestment versus the share repurchases. But I got to tell you, though, Pavel, I mean, until we see a bit more clarity around the depth and duration of the commodity price correction that we're in right now, I feel like the balance sheet is probably the best place for any incremental capital at this point in time until we see a strengthening of cash flow. But again, at the appropriate time, share repurchases is going to be a consideration for capital allocation. It's just going to have to continue to compete on a risk-adjusted basis."

But what really happens is really by the third month, those 2 have equalized and then the Austin Chalk well declines at a little bit slower rate.

That does not reflect the lack of confidence on our part. It really reflects some constraints on the amount of activity we'll have in Oklahoma during the year.

I would like to open with just a few comments regarding the elements of over business that we control. Cost of efficiencies and execution. And discuss how our actions will enhance return and have us well-positioned for the environment as well as when commodity prices show a sustained improvement.
Rigorous cost control across all areas of our business is at the forefront of what we do each and everyday. And the first quarter was no exception. We reduced our North America E&P production cost, per equivalent oil barrel $7.94, down 17% from fourth quarter 2014 and 28% below the year-ago quarter. 
Operating cost reduction is hard work, and our teams had taken on the challenge. There is no one magic bullet, but rather there is a the first range of drivers within these savings. A few examples include more coordinated deployment of contract labor, focus on compressor utilization, aggregating water production in the gathering systems and optimizing our chemical program. 
These types of savings are durable in natue and resilient to the commodity cycle. In, we continue to work with our vendor base and Supply Chain experts to take full advantage of our scale to drive commercial savings.
On the service cost side, we increased our year-to-date captured U.S. unconventional D&C service cost by an additional $25 million, bringing that total to $250 million. That represents a 17% reduction from our revised activity level and we fully expect to secure more saving as the year progresses. 
And finally on G&A. We have taken necessary steps to scale our organizational capacity to match our activity level. And our first quarter workforce reductions are expected to generate annualized net savings of approximately $100 million. 
During the first quarter, we have also made significant progress enhancing our returns  through efficiency gains. Our high specification rigs in the Eagle Ford are a prime example. And delivered pacesetter spud-to-TD of under 7 days, drilling 2,800 feet per day, significantly above the quarterly average of about 1,600 feet per day. In the Eagle Ford, our EUR uplift was 26% for condensate wells and 79% for high GOR wells, relative to fall of last year, while completed well cost have fallen about 15%.
Finally, we are reallocating more than $25 million of capital to the Oklahoma Resource Basin to further advance our understanding of the resource potential, which already stands at over $1 billion oil equivalent barrels on a 2P basis. We are complementing our 2 rig program with incremental high-value non-operated activity, which is a very efficient way to maximize the benefits of our capital dollars.
From an execution standpoint, our team had a great first quarter. We grew production from our 3 U.S. resource plays 11% over the prior quarter and 49% year-over-year. 
Our total E&P net production excluding Libya also posted strong results growing 4% and 20% respectively. All this was accomplished within our plan first quarter capital budget. 
We recorded 98% average operational availability for company operated assets during the first quarter are most economic barrels. Yesterday, we announced a further optimization of our 2015 capital investment and exploration budget to $3.3 billion. This reduction is driven by a relentless focus on capital discipline and maintaining financial flexibility in this period of ongoing price uncertainty. 
We're adjusting activity levels to manage cash flows, while still delivering on our strategic objective and our 3 U.S. resource plays. And with no change to full year E&P production guidance.
In addition, we are continuing our commitment to ongoing portfolio management regardless of commodity cycle. And are targeting non-core asset sales to generate at least $500 million in proceeds. Portfolio management is simply part of what we do as an independent E&P company. 
At quarter end, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.1 billion, which combined with our revolving credit facility resulted in a total liquidity of $3.6 billion. 
And in May, we amended the revolving credit facility to increase the available capacity from $2.5 billion to $3 billion and extended the maturity date to 2020. 
Our 2015 capital program was always designed to be front end loaded and the first quarter of 2015 has been a quarter of transition. We are efficiently ramping down to lower activity levels in our U.S. resource plays and will achieve our target of 10 rigs by the end of second quarter. 
Our current plan is to hold that activity level relatively flat for the remainder of the year, averaging a mid-teens rig count for the full year. But just to reiterate, our guidance of 5% to 7% year-over-year production growth for the total company excluding Libya and 20% growth for the U.S. unconventional plays has not changed. 
With the enablers of lower cost, improved efficiencies and strong execution are strategic objectives in the 3 U.S. resource plays remain in full force, even at an overall reduced budget level. We will continue our successful Eagle Ford co-development, expanding beyond the Austin Chalk to the Upper Eagle Ford and our stack-and-frac pilot. Our first quarter stack-and-frac pilot, Which include 1 Austin Chalk, 1 Upper Eagle Ford and 2 lower Eagle Ford wells is online and early performance is encouraging. 
We also placed 5 Upper Eagle Ford wells online in the quarter.
In Oklahoma, we're executing our 2 rig operating program and brought 5 gross opeated wells to sales this quarter all in the SKU. We're also continuing to leverage the benefit of our high-value outside operated program and plan to participate in approximately 50 of those wells this year in that SCOOP Woodford, SCOOP Springer and STACK areas, thanks to reallocation of budget to one of oru most perspective areas.
The capital we reallocated to Oklahoma is primarily focused on increasing our non-operated gross well exposure. This increase in capital demonstrates our belief  that Oklahoma an represents exciting growth opportunity for Marathon Oil that compete very favorably with our existing portfolio. 
We continue to advance our technical work here to be position to step up our activity and prices improve.
And finally in the Bakken, we concluded our enhanced completion pilots and have incorporated the improved design into all wells drilled this quarter. Additionally, initial results from the first of our 4 downspacing pilots are encouraging. The second pilot is currently online, but with fewer 30 days, and the third just completed drilling. Our ultimate objective is to fully integrate the downspacing pilot results with the now concluded completion design trials into our future development plans.
Before we open the call up to questions, I'd like to reiterate that our strong operational execution, cost reductions continued efficiency gains and capital discipline are enhancing our returns today, have us well-positioned for the current price environment and well prepared for sustain commodity price recovery. With that, I'll hand it back to Chris to begin the Q&A."

We continue to see improvements on that side. There is an impact as we focus in this year particularly 2015, on a more focused area to deliver the highest returns in a lower commodity environment. So we are seeing some uplift from that, but I'd encourage to say it's principally driven by the completions efficacy we're pushing all across those basins. That's what driving the real EUR enhancement. And I think that's reflected, if you even look at early IPs again driving that."

As I mentioned in my opening remarks, operating cost is just hard work. It's many things coming together to contribute to driving that unit cost lower, it's both the numerator as well as the denominator, it's working your absolute cost as well as making sure you're keeping your barrels online and the teams did outstanding job at that this quarter. 
Many of those things, I think operating cost side though are structural in nature. When you think about things around provident maintenance and our ability to efficiently deploy contractors, when you think about efficiently using our installed compression horsepower. When you think about our optimizing of our chemical programs in the oil fill, all of these things in our mine are independent of the commodity price environment. We will carry those forward in time. 
In parallel with that though, we're not turning a blind eye to our scale and our ability to leverage that scale in commercial dialogue as well. And some of those will be more sticky than others in some cases. But we do expect that we'll retain even an element of those commercial gain as we move forward in time. 
But those will have a much closer correlation with the pricing environment that we find ourselves. On the capital side, when you think about the cost reductions we've achieved there. I mean, when you look at kind of the $1.3 million of well in the Eagle Ford, the $1 million of wells that we've achieved in the Bakken, the $600,000 we've achieved per well in Oklahoma. Those capital efficiencies have in large parts and driven by the response of the service industry to participate in the downturn that we're experiencing. 
But even within that, there is a commercial element and efficiency element as well. Our most efficient frac crews can deliver a high number of stages on a monthly basis that's a win-win for both the operator as well as the service provider. And our ability to keep those most efficient crews running, even with this downturn in activity, I believe will be key to our ability to continue momentum as we see price improvements in the future."

First is just a continued focus on capital discipline and financial flexibility in a period, where we still have uncertainty around the price environment. We're seeing some strengthening here as late, a lot of macro factors that have driven the downturn are still in place, so we need to recognize that. 
Secondly, with the enablers of both cost efficiency and cost reduction, we're still able to achieve our strategic objectives in each of the 3 U.S. resource plays. And hold good our guidance under that revised budget and drive those efficiencies and savings really down to the balance sheet. 
And if we start to see a sustainable price recovery. We can then reconsider, if we want to take some of that cash flow and redeploy it into the business.

So it's that vertical co-development. We like the rates from all 3 of those horizons, when they have been stack, we announced that first pilot in that.

Well, I think, there you're hitting upon really the contrast between the short cycle and the long cycle investments. And to be fair to the Deepwater, you need to look at it in terms of full cycle returns as well not incremental returns. 
So I guess it really comes down to your view of that longer-term price outlook over time. If you take a view to where that longer-term outlook is constructive. Then Deepwater has a role to play in continuing to meet part of the future demand. 
And in our view, the high-quality Deepwater assets still have the stability to compete in that longer-term environment. I think the question for us becomes one of scale and cash flows and our ability to support the large investment dollars that are required in Deepwater development. And so we're going to be very selective and very focused this year's exploration program, as it's half of the spend that we were last year. So we're going to bring a very short focus to that program. That reflects the fact that these longer cycle investments can have a role to play in your portfolio."

We are learning an enormous amount from all the offset operated activity. That activity is predominantly focused in the highest values areas within the SCOOP and in the STACK, where we have acreage. We clearly want to participate and capture that acreage and convert to it HPP. But we also want tot take in leverage all of the early production, the petrophysics and the learnings we can have from that. One of the things, we really appreciate about the Oklahoma Resource Basin is we're getting several multiples of data from the activity that we get from an operated activity for very few capital dollars. So we're learning tremendously at very lower risk, really accelerates our description of the resource to the well productivity, and allows us to design our own pilots and grow and get ready to grow scale activity much more rapidly. 
I think our increase in capital spend in that area reflects that as Oklahoma's continues to be resident in the returns that can deliver. The activity in Oklahoma is also been resilient. And we're just responding to make sure, we don't miss any valuable opportunity."

So we generally let the technical and operations teams manage those wells effectively. So rather than try for example, flow them on a smaller choke size and smooth that out. We're looking for highest value on that investment return today. The wells we're investing in this quarter are generating good returns in current pricing. So we have confidence, we can do that. And decisions would really let the technical teams make. We've scaled our activity in North America in logical increments that make sense. So for example, on the Eagle Ford, we want to keep whole frac to rather than partial frac lease to drive efficiency or we scale the drilling activity to match that. Part of the reduction we've taken in activity there is actually not just related to capital spend, but just recognizing is the efficiencies continue to improve. We were going to have to let go 1 or more rigs anyway to make sure, we didn't over drill our plan for the year. And so we'll keep doing that. And I think as you noted also, we have not been building a backlog of drill, but uncompleted wells for use later in the year.

We captured $600,000 in well cost already, since we released our new well cost this year in our single well economics. So we think, there is a lot more room to maneuver there from both in efficiency as well as commercial standpoint. And that's just going to take some time as we grow to scale. Bear in mind Ed, we had plans and had actually ramped up the 6 rigs in the Eagle Ford at year end -- I'm sorry in Oklahoma at the end of the year here. And so the execution capacity is there.

Let me add my good morning to everyone. I'd like to open with just a few comments regarding the elements of our business that we control, costs, efficiencies and execution, and discuss how our actions",1153,"Thanks, Chris, and glad to have you back on the call. Let me add my good morning to everyone. I'd like to open with just a few comments regarding the elements of our business that we control, costs, efficiencies and execution, and discuss how our actions will enhance returns and have us well positioned for the current environment as well as when commodity prices show a sustained improvement.
Rigorous cost control across all areas of our business is at the forefront of what we do each and every day, and the first quarter was no exception. We reduced our North America E&P production cost per oil equivalent barrel to $7.94, down 17% from fourth quarter 2014 and 28% below the year-ago quarter. Operating cost reduction is hard work, and our teams have taken on that challenge. There is no one magic bullet, but rather, there's a diverse range of drivers within these savings. A few examples include more coordinated deployment of contract labor, focus on compressor utilization, aggregating water production in the gathering systems and optimizing our chemical programs.  These types of savings are durable in nature and resilient to the commodity cycle. In parallel, we continue to work with our vendor base and supply chain experts to take full advantage of our scale to drive commercial savings.
On the service cost side, we increased our year-to-date captured U.S. unconventional D&C service cost by an additional $25 million, bringing that total to $250 million. That represents a 17% reduction from our revised activity levels, and we fully expect to secure more savings as the year progresses. 
And finally, on G&A, we have taken the necessary steps to scale our organizational capacity to match our activity level. And our first quarter workforce reductions are expected to generate annualized net savings of approximately $100 million. 
During the first quarter, we have also made significant progress enhancing our returns through efficiency gains. Our high-specification rigs in the Eagle Ford are a prime example and delivered pacesetter spud-to-TD results of under 7 days, drilling 2,800 feet per day, significantly above the quarterly average of about 1,600 feet per day. In the Eagle Ford, our EUR uplift was 26% for condensate wells and 79% for high-GOR oil wells relative to fall of last year, while completed well costs have fallen about 15%.
Finally, we are reallocating more than $25 million of capital to the Oklahoma Resource Basins to further advance our understanding of the resource potential, which already stands at over $1 billion oil equivalent barrels on a 2P basis. We are complementing our 2-rig operated program with incremental high-value, non-operated activity, which is a very efficient way to maximize the benefits of our capital dollars.
From an execution standpoint, our teams had a great first quarter. We grew production from our 3 U.S. resource plays 11% over the prior quarter and 49% year-over-year. Our total E&P net production, excluding Libya, also posted strong results, growing 4% and 20%, respectively. All this was accomplished within our planned first quarter capital budget. We recorded 98% average operational availability for company-operated assets during the first quarter, our most economic barrels. Yesterday, we announced a further optimization of our 2015 capital investment and exploration budget to $3.3 billion. This reduction is driven by a relentless focus on capital discipline and maintaining financial flexibility in this period of ongoing price uncertainty. We're adjusting activity levels to manage cash flows while still delivering on our strategic objectives in our 3 U.S. resource plays and with no change to full year E&P production guidance.
In addition, we are continuing our commitment to ongoing portfolio management regardless of commodity cycle and are targeting non-core asset sales to generate at least $500 million in proceeds. Portfolio management is simply part of what we do as an independent E&P company. 
At quarter-end, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.1 billion, which, combined with our revolving credit facility, resulted in a total liquidity of $3.6 billion. And in May, we amended the revolving credit facility to increase the available capacity from $2.5 billion to $3 billion and extended the maturity date to 2020. 
Our 2015 capital program was always designed to be front end-loaded, and the first quarter of 2015 has been a quarter of transition. We are efficiently ramping down to lower activity levels in our U.S. resource plays and will achieve our target of 10 rigs by the end of second quarter. Our current plan is to hold that activity level relatively flat for the remainder of the year, averaging a mid-teens rig count for the full year. But just to reiterate, our guidance of 5% to 7% year-over-year production growth for the total company, excluding Libya, and 20% growth for the U.S. unconventional plays have not changed. 
With the enablers of lower costs, improved efficiencies and strong execution, our strategic objectives in the 3 U.S. resource plays remain in full force, even at an overall reduced budget level. We will continue our successful Eagle Ford co-development, expanding beyond the Austin Chalk to the Upper Eagle Ford and our stack-and-frac pilots. Our first quad stack-and-frac pilot, which includes 1 Austin Chalk, 1 Upper Eagle Ford and 2 Lower Eagle Ford wells, is online, and early performance is encouraging. We also placed 5 Upper Eagle Ford wells online in the quarter.
In Oklahoma, we are executing our 2-rig operated program and brought 5 gross operated wells to sales this quarter, all in the SCOOP. We're also continuing to leverage the benefit of our high-value, outside-operated program and plan to participate in approximately 50 of those wells this year in the SCOOP Woodford, SCOOP Springer and STACK areas, thanks to our reallocation of budget to one of our most prospective areas.
The capital we've reallocated to Oklahoma is primarily focused on increasing our non-operated gross well exposure. This increase in capital demonstrates our belief that Oklahoma represents an exciting growth opportunity for Marathon Oil that competes very favorably with our existing portfolio. We continue to advance our technical work here to be positioned to step up our activity as prices improve.
And finally, in the Bakken, we've concluded our enhanced completion pilots and have incorporated the improved design into all wells drilled this quarter. Additionally, initial results from the first of our 4 downspacing pilots are encouraging. The second pilot is currently online but was fewer than 30 days, and the third just completed drilling. Our ultimate objective is to fully integrate the downspacing pilot results with the now concluded completion design trials into our future development plans.
Before we open the call up to questions, I'd like to reiterate that our strong operational execution, cost reductions, continued efficiency gains and capital discipline are enhancing our returns today, have us well positioned for the current price environment and well prepared for a sustained commodity price recovery. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Chris to begin the Q&A."

We really like the focus on operating expense, and we have more steps planned to work on that this year. Certainly, the production is a sign that -- in fact, this is the fourth strong quarter in a row of production deliverability out of that business, so I think we're on that road to improvement that we haven't been able to point to before. Again, I'd like to see more run time. But I'm certainly encouraged by this past quarter and, actually, the past 4 quarters. That trend is headed in the right direction, and it needs to in this environment."

And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, operating cost is just hard work. It's many things coming together to contribute to driving that unit cost lower. It's both the numerator as well as the denominator. It's working your absolute cost as well as making sure you're keeping your barrels online, and the teams did an outstanding job at that this quarter. Many of those things, I think, in the operating cost side, though, are structural in nature. When you think about things around preventive maintenance and our ability to efficiently deploy contractors, when you think about efficiently using our installed compression horsepower, when you think about our optimizing of our chemical programs in the oil field, all of these things, in our mind, are independent of the commodity price environment. And we will carry those forward in time. In parallel with that, though, we're not turning a blind eye to our scale and our ability to leverage that scale in commercial dialogue as well. And some of those will be more sticky than others in some cases, but we do expect that we'll retain even an element of those commercial gains as we move forward in time. But those will have a much closer correlation with the pricing environment that we find ourselves. On the capital side, when you think about the cost reductions we've achieved there, I mean, when you look at kind of the $1.3 million of well in the Eagle Ford, the $1 million of well that we've achieved in the Bakken, the $600,000 we've achieved per well in Oklahoma, those capital efficiencies have, in large part, been driven by the response of the service industry to participate in this downturn that we're experiencing. But even within that, there is a commercial element and efficiency element as well. Our most efficient frac crews can deliver a high number of stages on a monthly basis. That's a win-win for both the operator as well as the service provider. And our ability to keep those most efficient crews running even with this downturn in activity, I believe, will be key to our ability to continue momentum as we see price improvements in the future."

I would really describe that decision and really driven by 2 things. First is just a continued focus on capital discipline and financial flexibility in a period where we still have uncertainty around the price environment. Albeit we've seen some strengthening here as of late, a lot of the macro factors that have driven the downturn are still in place, so we need to recognize that. Secondly, with the enablers of both cost efficiency and cost reduction, we're still able to achieve our strategic objectives in each of the 3 U.S. resource plays and hold our guidance under that revised budget and drive those efficiencies and savings really down to the balance sheet. And if we start to see a sustainable price recovery, we can then reconsider if we want to take some of that cash flow and redeploy it into the business. In terms of volumes targeting and trajectory, you've mentioned that we had communicated previously an exit-to-exit in the unconventional target -- or unconventional production 4Q-to-4Q, '14 to '15, slightly up on an exit-to-exit basis.

But if we saw those levels, we felt that the macros were supportive and constructive of a sustainable $65-plus kind of range, we feel very confident going into 2016 with a ramp-up in our unconventionals.

But if look at the diagram we've put out in our previous press releases, we're showing that as a 4-interval co-development, 4 vertical intervals, which is Austin Chalk, Upper Eagle Ford and then 2 wells in the Lower Eagle Ford. We would actually broaden that to say that we'll have stack-and-frac pilots, where there'll just be 3, which is Austin Chalk, Upper Eagle Ford as well as Lower Eagle Ford. So it's that vertical co-development. We like the rates from all 3 of those horizons when they've been stacked. We announced that first pilot in that. And we have some additional pilots flowing. We'll be able to talk about those as they mature. But in terms of the efficiency you're referencing there, in this opportunity, we really like the efficiency because we're codeveloping all those horizons from the same pad, so we're spudding from rig to rig. And it gives us an opportunity to address those efficiently. So if you look at those pilots, what you'll see is that in most of those cases, it's 40-well -- excuse me, 40-acre spacing in the same zone. In the Lower Eagle Ford, where we have 2 Lower Eagle Ford wells, it's 40-acre vertical, but if you -- it's really 20-acre between them. So it's like a chevron or a W pattern, if you will, in that Lower Eagle Ford when you put 2 in there. But generally, same zone, 40-acre, with the exception of that -- in the Lower Eagle Ford, we actually separate it into -- it's confusing. The upper Lower Eagle Ford and lower Lower Eagle Ford, creative names, I know, so it's generally 40-acre with the exception -- when you put 2 in there in the Lower Eagle Ford, it gets to what's effectively 20-acre spacing, but they're offset in that pattern."

I think our increase in capital spend in that area reflects that as Oklahoma continues to be resilient in the returns that can deliver, the activity in Oklahoma has also been resilient. And we're just responding to make sure we don't miss any valuable opportunity."

If you go back to our single well economics and you look at those even head to head with the Eagle Ford, those wells are on par, so strictly, from an economic standpoint, absolutely competitive. But we saw a unique opportunity in Oklahoma, I think as Lance very well described, to really leverage our money there to continue to expand our knowledge and insights around the Oklahoma Resource Basin. So we felt that was a unique opportunity. It's largely being driven by Oklahoma continuing to attract more capital from other operators' portfolios, and we want to participate in that."

So rather than try to, for example, flow them on a smaller choke size and smooth that out, we're looking for highest value on that investment return today. The wells we're investing in this quarter are generating good returns at current pricing, so we have confidence we can do that. And decisions, we really let the technical teams make. We've scaled our activity in North America in logical increments that make sense. So for example, in the Eagle Ford, we want to keep whole frac fleets active rather than partial frac fleets to drive efficiency, and we've scaled the drilling activity to match that. Part of the reduction we've taken in activity there is actually not just related to capital spend but just recognizing as the efficiencies continue to improve, we were going to have to let go one or more rigs anyway to make sure we didn't over drill our plan for the year. And so we'll keep doing that. I think as you noted also, we have not been building a backlog of drilled-but-uncompleted wells for use later in the year. We're really managing that as an operations basket of wells to complete to manage our stimulation operations smoothly and efficiently."

When we typically talk about production results, Ed, we tend to talk about kind of wanting to get 180 days of production to really understand well performance, understand where we are on a specific type curve. We are still, though, on the learning curve in Oklahoma when it comes, though, to D&C cost. And we think we're starting in a much more favorable position because of all the good work that has been done already in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken to drive well costs down. We captured $600,000 in well costs already since we released our new well costs this year in our single well economics. So we think there's a lot more room to maneuver there from both an efficiency as well as a commercial standpoint. And that's just going to take some time as we grow the scale. Bear in mind, Ed, we had plans and had actually ramped up the 6 rigs in the Eagle Ford at year-end -- I'm sorry, in Oklahoma at the end of the year here, and so the execution capacity is there.

Let me add my good morning to everyone. I'd like to open with just a few comments regarding the elements of our business that we control: costs, efficiencies and execution, and discuss how our actions",1154,"Thanks, Chris, and glad to have you back on the call. Let me add my good morning to everyone. I'd like to open with just a few comments regarding the elements of our business that we control: costs, efficiencies and execution, and discuss how our actions will enhance returns and have us well positioned for the current environment as well as when commodity prices show a sustained improvement.
Rigorous cost control across all areas of our business is at the forefront of what we do each and every day, and the first quarter was no exception. We reduced our North America E&P production cost per oil equivalent barrel to $7.94, down 17% from fourth quarter 2014 and 28% below the year-ago quarter. Operating cost reduction is hard work, and our teams have taken on that challenge. There is no one magic bullet, but rather, there's a diverse range of drivers within these savings. A few examples include more coordinated deployment of contract labor, focus on compressor utilization, aggregating water production in the gathering systems and optimizing our chemical programs.  These types of savings are durable in nature and resilient to the commodity cycle. In parallel, we continue to work with our vendor base and supply chain experts to take full advantage of our scale to drive commercial savings.
On the service cost side, we increased our year-to-date captured U.S. unconventional D&C service costs by an additional $25 million, bringing that total to $250 million. That represents a 17% reduction from our revised activity levels, and we fully expect to secure more savings as the year progresses. 
And finally, on G&A, we have taken the necessary steps to scale our organizational capacity to match our activity level. And our first quarter workforce reductions are expected to generate annualized net savings of approximately $100 million. 
During the first quarter, we have also made significant progress enhancing our returns through efficiency gains. Our high-specification rigs in the Eagle Ford are a prime example and delivered pacesetter spud-to-TD results of under 7 days, drilling 2,800 feet per day, significantly above the quarterly average of about 1,600 feet per day. In the Eagle Ford, our EUR uplift was 26% for condensate wells and 79% for high-GOR oil wells relative to fall of last year, while completed well costs have fallen about 15%.
Finally, we are reallocating more than $25 million of capital to the Oklahoma Resource Basins to further advance our understanding of the resource potential, which already stands at over $1 billion oil equivalent barrels on a 2P basis. We are complementing our 2-rig operated program with incremental high-value, non-operated activity, which is a very efficient way to maximize the benefits of our capital dollars.
From an execution standpoint, our teams had a great first quarter. We grew production from our 3 U.S. resource plays 11% over the prior quarter and 49% year-over-year. Our total E&P net production, excluding Libya, also posted strong results, growing 4% and 20%, respectively. All this was accomplished within our planned first quarter capital budget. We recorded 98% average operational availability for company-operated assets during the first quarter, our most economic barrels. Yesterday, we announced a further optimization of our 2015 capital investment and exploration budget to $3.3 billion. This reduction is driven by a relentless focus on capital discipline and maintaining financial flexibility in this period of ongoing price uncertainty. We're adjusting activity levels to manage cash flows while still delivering on our strategic objectives in our 3 U.S. resource plays and with no change to full year E&P production guidance.
In addition, we are continuing our commitment to ongoing portfolio management regardless of commodity cycle and are targeting non-core asset sales to generate at least $500 million in proceeds. Portfolio management is simply part of what we do as an independent E&P company. 
At quarter-end, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.1 billion, which, combined with our revolving credit facility, resulted in a total liquidity of $3.6 billion. And in May, we amended the revolving credit facility to increase the available capacity from $2.5 billion to $3 billion and extended the maturity date to 2020. 
Our 2015 capital program was always designed to be front end-loaded, and the first quarter of 2015 has been a quarter of transition. We are efficiently ramping down to lower activity levels in our U.S. resource plays and will achieve our target of 10 rigs by the end of second quarter. Our current plan is to hold that activity level relatively flat for the remainder of the year, averaging a mid-teens rig count for the full year. But just to reiterate, our guidance of 5% to 7% year-over-year production growth for the total company, excluding Libya, and 20% growth for the U.S. unconventional plays have not changed. 
With the enablers of lower costs, improved efficiencies and strong execution, our strategic objectives in the 3 U.S. resource plays remain in full force, even at an overall reduced budget level. We will continue our successful Eagle Ford co-development, expanding beyond the Austin Chalk to the Upper Eagle Ford and our stack-and-frac pilots. Our first quad stack-and-frac pilot, which includes 1 Austin Chalk, 1 Upper Eagle Ford and 2 Lower Eagle Ford wells, is online, and early performance is encouraging. We also placed 5 Upper Eagle Ford wells online in the quarter.
In Oklahoma, we are executing our 2-rig operated program and brought 5 gross operated wells to sales this quarter, all in the SCOOP. We are also continuing to leverage the benefit of our high-value, outside-operated program and plan to participate in approximately 50 of those wells this year in the SCOOP Woodford, SCOOP Springer and STACK areas, thanks to our reallocation of budget to one of our most prospective areas.
The capital we've reallocated to Oklahoma is primarily focused on increasing our non-operated gross well exposure. This increase in capital demonstrates our belief that Oklahoma represents an exciting growth opportunity for Marathon Oil that competes very favorably with our existing portfolio. We continue to advance our technical work here to be positioned to step up our activity as prices improve.
And finally, in the Bakken, we've concluded our enhanced completion pilots and have incorporated the improved design into all wells drilled this quarter. Additionally, initial results from the first of our 4 downspacing pilots are encouraging. The second pilot is currently online but was fewer than 30 days, and the third just completed drilling. Our ultimate objective is to fully integrate the downspacing pilot results with the now concluded completion design trials into our future development plans.
Before we open the call up to questions, I'd like to reiterate that our strong operational execution, cost reductions, continued efficiency gains and capital discipline are enhancing our returns today, have us well positioned for the current price environment and well prepared for a sustained commodity price recovery. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Chris to begin the Q&A."

There is an impact as we focused in this year, particularly 2015, on a more focused area to deliver the highest returns in a lower commodity environment. So we are seeing some uplift from that, but I'm encouraged to say it's principally driven by the completions efficacy we're pushing all across those basins.

I'd say those results are very much in line with lower Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk in the same respective areas. And I would say what's most encouraging to us, the Upper Eagle Ford is working well in the areas where the Austin Chalk has worked a little bit less effectively, and so we see those 2 as increasingly interchangeable, so we can codevelop in a broader area. And very encouraged thus far on the Upper Eagle Ford, both in that northern end as well as in the stack-and-frac. I think to be more clear, we brought on 5 Upper Eagle Ford wells that we announced that are distinctive.

And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, operating cost is just hard work. It's many things coming together to contribute to driving that unit cost lower. It's both the numerator as well as the denominator. It's working your absolute cost as well as making sure you're keeping your barrels online, and the teams did an outstanding job at that this quarter. Many of those things, I think, in the operating cost side, though, are structural in nature. When you think about things around preventive maintenance and our ability to efficiently deploy contractors, when you think about efficiently using our installed compression horsepower, when you think about our optimizing of our chemical programs in the oil field, all of these things, in our mind, are independent of the commodity price environment. And we will carry those forward in time. In parallel with that, though, we're not turning a blind eye to our scale and our ability to leverage that scale in commercial dialogue as well. And some of those will be more sticky than others in some cases, but we do expect that we'll retain even an element of those commercial gains as we move forward in time. But those will have a much closer correlation with the pricing environment that we find ourselves. On the capital side, when you think about the cost reductions we've achieved there, I mean, when you look at kind of the $1.3 million of well in the Eagle Ford, the $1 million of well that we've achieved in the Bakken, the $600,000 we've achieved per well in Oklahoma, those capital efficiencies have, in large part, been driven by the response of the service industry to participate in this downturn that we're experiencing. But even within that, there is a commercial element and efficiency element as well. Our most efficient frac crews can deliver a high number of stages on a monthly basis. That's a win-win for both the operator as well as the service provider. And our ability to keep those most efficient crews running even with the downturn in activity, I believe, will be key to our ability to continue momentum as we see price improvements in the future."

I would really describe that decision and really driven by 2 things. First is just a continued focus on capital discipline and financial flexibility in a period where we still have uncertainty around the price environment. Albeit we've seen some strengthening here as of late, a lot of the macro factors that have driven the downturn are still in place, so we need to recognize that. Secondly, with the enablers of both cost efficiency and cost reduction, we're still able to achieve our strategic objectives in each of the 3 U.S. resource plays and hold our guidance under that revised budget and drive those efficiencies and savings really down to the balance sheet. And if we start to see a sustainable price recovery, we can then reconsider if we want to take some of that cash flow and redeploy it into the business. In terms of volumes targeting and trajectory, you mentioned that we had communicated previously an exit-to-exit in the unconventional target -- or unconventional production 4Q-to-4Q, '14 to '15, slightly up on an exit-to-exit basis.

There's no doubt that there's been an activity uptick in Oklahoma in our non-operated portfolio as those folks that are multi-basin operators direct more capital into Oklahoma.

For us -- you're right, the forward curve is looking around $65. I think if we saw sustainment at kind of $65-plus certainly going into the back half of the year in '16, to us, it's more about seeing that being a sustainable recovery and having the confidence to come back in and begin a ramp-up. But if we saw those levels, we felt that the macros were supportive and constructive of a sustainable $65-plus kind of range, we feel very confident going into 2016 with a ramp-up in our unconventionals.

We would actually broaden that to say that we'll have stack-and-frac pilots, where there'll just be 3, which is Austin Chalk, Upper Eagle Ford as well as Lower Eagle Ford. So it's that vertical co-development. We like the rates from all 3 of those horizons when they've been stacked. We announced that first pilot in that. And we have some additional pilots flowing and we'll be able to talk about those as they mature. But in terms of the efficiency you're referencing there, in this opportunity, we really like the efficiency because we're codeveloping all those horizons from the same pad, so we're spudding from rig to rig. And it gives us an opportunity to address those efficiently. So if you look at those pilots, what you'll see is that in most of those cases, it's 40-well -- excuse me, 40-acre spacing in the same zone. In the Lower Eagle Ford, where we have 2 Lower Eagle Ford wells, it's 40-acre vertical, but if you -- it's really 20-acre between them.

So rather than try to, for example, flow them on a smaller choke size and smooth that out, we're looking for the highest value on that investment return today. The wells we're investing in this quarter are generating good returns at current pricing, so we have confidence we can do that. And decisions, we really let the technical teams make. We've scaled our activity in North America in logical increments that make sense. So for example, in the Eagle Ford, we want to keep whole frac fleets active rather than partial frac fleets to drive efficiency, and we've scaled the drilling activity to match that. Part of the reduction we've taken in activity there is actually not just related to capital spend but just recognizing as the efficiencies continue to improve, we were going to have to let go one or more rigs anyway to make sure we didn't over drill our plan for the year. And so we'll keep doing that. I think as you noted also, we have not been building a backlog of drilled-but-uncompleted wells for use later in the year. We're really managing that as an operations basket of wells to complete to manage our stimulation operations smoothly and efficiently."

We are still, though, on the learning curve in Oklahoma when it comes, though, to D&C costs. And we think we're starting in a much more favorable position because of all the good work that has been done already in Eagle Ford and the Bakken to drive well costs down. We captured $600,000 in well costs already since we released our new well costs this year in our single well economics, but we think there's a lot more room to maneuver there from a, both an efficiency, as well as a commercial standpoint. And that's just going to take some time as we grow to scale. Bear in mind, Ed, we had plans and had actually ramped up the 6 rigs in the Eagle Ford at year-end -- I'm sorry, in Oklahoma at the end of the year here, and so the execution capacity is there. And I think as we move that to scale, that is going to allow us to really accelerate on that learning curve, particularly when it comes to D&C costs."

Let me add my good morning. I'd like to open with just a few comments regarding the elements of our business that we control: cost, efficiencies and execution, and discuss our actions will enhance returns and have us positi",866,"All right. Well, thanks, Chris. Let me add my good morning. I'd like to open with just a few comments regarding the elements of our business that we control: cost, efficiencies and execution, and discuss our actions will enhance returns and have us position for the current environment, as well as when commodity prices show a sustained improvement. 
We find ourselves in a continued low and volatility pricing environment. We've taken the 5 action consistent with our business plan released in first quarter, activity and CapEx reductions, capital efficiency and productivity gains, operating and G&A cost reductions and non-core asset divestments. We have successfully and efficiently achieved our planned activity reductions in the 3 resource plays to yield a program that will hold production volumes for the balance of 2015 while still progressing our strategic objectives in all 3 plays. Those objectives are codevelopment in the Eagle Ford, integration of completion and downspacing pilots in the Bakken and protecting our valuable lease holds in both our SCOOP and STACK positions, while investing our high return outside operating opportunities. 
Even with these planned reductions, we will still deliver on our growth targets of 5% to 7% for the overall company and 20% for the resource plays year-over-year. We've also raised the low end of our total company EMT full year production guidance, essentially increasing the midpoint despite that announced asset sale. Our planned deceleration and capital spend is evident in the sequential reduction in our capital program by almost $500 million and the significant decrease in wells to sales relative to the first quarter. We had already cut exploration spend by half from last year and are continuing to moderate Ford commitments as we reset our strategy, including withdrawal from new country entries that do not compete for capital allocation. 
For capital efficiency, we have captured greater than $300 million in DNC savings in the U.S. resource plays or about 20% and are driving for more. Our completed well costs continue to fall and are well productivity continues to improve. 
We have reduced unit operating cost in both of our E&P segments from the year ago quarter. More than 30% in North America and 25% in international ex- Libya and have reflected this in our forward full year guidance for unit cost lowering them $1.25 and $1 per boe, respectively. 
We were quick to address G&A cost in the first quarter as we finalize our activity plans and implemented a workforce reduction of about 400 people that is expected to generate annualized net savings of approximately $100 million. 
Our non-core asset sales are progressing with signed agreements for approximately $100 million toward our target of over $500 million. This recent transaction confirmed that the right assets will generate a competitive process and yield compelling deal metrics even in the current environment. All of these actions combined to give us confidence in driving toward cash flow neutrality in 2016 inclusive of non-core asset sales. 
We are only just beginning the budget process for 2016, but we'll focus capital allocation to the high return U.S. resource plays as several longer cycle investments run their course by the end of this year and exploration spend continues to decline. 
Our forward look positions us well below our 2015 $3.3 billion capital program. And while our 2015 quarterly exit rate will be in the range of $700 million and $750 million, we still have the ability to flex down or up as required. 
Additionally, we expect expense reduction and collateral efficiency to continue into 2016. We are optimizing our business around a lower cost structure, holding production levels and protecting our investment in our high return U.S. resource plays while challenging all other spend in excess of that. 
Our U.S. resource plays continue to deliver solid returns at current pricing with capital efficiency and enhanced productivity lowering breakeven prices. 
Our last disclosure on our 5-year drilling inventory showed 70% of our inventory profitable at $50 a barrel WTI, and that analysis did not incorporate our most recent completed well cost savings and productivity enhancements. 
We have multiple years of high-quality inventory that can deliver competitive returns in the current environment. 
We do not believe this is a time to be accelerating inventory in associated production from short cycle investments. We believe it's the time for discipline, continuous cost reduction, sustainable efficiency, maximizing returns and balance sheet protection. We continue to have a strong balance sheet with $5.5 billion in liquidity at quarter end. 
As we move into the second half of 2015, we look forward to providing more results from our codevelopment in the Eagle Ford, operated downspacing activity in Oklahoma and resource updates for the U.S. unconventional plays. 
I want to conclude by taking a moment to recognize our Marathon Oil employees who have been the driving force behind our results in this very dynamic environment. They have stepped forward to lead our efforts in cost reduction and efficiency gains and have kept their focus on execution despite the distraction of the macroenvironment. Our employees are committed to an enterprise first view for which I'm both thankful and proud. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Chris to begin the Q&A."

We have a some of the highest in each of those at South Texas even though we've taken, for example, in the second quarter have taken more than 1/3 of the total wells are outside of the lower Eagle Ford in either of the Austin Chalk or the Upper Eagle Ford. We really accelerated that codevelopment and multiple horizons 3 and in some cases, 4 horizons developed across our acreage position, particularly in Karnes County, to see how much vertical density in that total package we could create, as well as the 40-acre, and in some cases, 30-acre space that we have horizontally that. So what really most excited about is even as we materially increase the complexity of the codevelopment through the stack-and-frac pilots, what we've seen is that the production for well and the other horizons, specifically the Upper Eagle Ford and the Austin Chalk, have competed very favorably with the traditional lower Eagle Ford. So we're still getting great results in are competitive returns among the best in our portfolio from all 3 those horizons, which long-term inventory and really helps our capital efficiency as we can move to develop more wells per pad across the Eagle Ford."

But as we kind of think about the current prices and look ahead to '16, we would envision a certainly material lower budget than where we are below that $3.3 billion. And certainly, as you mentioned, our run rates coming out of this year are certainly a south of $3 billion. We're honestly though, Evan, right in the beginning of our budget process for 2016 and clearly, any actions that we take, our capital allocation is going to be low governed in large part by what we see in the commodity price environment. But in general, our strategic approach is going to be to prioritize our available capital to those highest return investments that we have in the North America resource play. And the balance will go to any previously committed kind of nondiscretionary longer cycle requirements. I would also expect in '16 that our exploration CapEx is further reduced. It was cut in half this year. And as you think about kind of even for a flat to reduced budget into '16, the North America component of that will still grow in that context because we have some long cycle investments running the course in 2015. We have further reductions, as I mentioned, in exploration standards, and we also have some nonrecurring U.S. infrastructure investments this year in 2015 that are going to provide some accommodations space, if you will, for additional North America investments. Again, our goal is going to be to target as much investment as we can at the U.S. resource play based on the prevailing commodity environment and available cash flows. We still have the inventory to deliver strong and long-term growth, and we're going to protect that optionality as we move into 2016. With that, maybe I'll just offer it over to J.R. just to talk a little bit about cash flow."

Again, philosophically, I want to see 2016 be as close to free cash flow neutral, including asset sales as we possibly can. Many variables to that equation. Capital -- clearly, capital activity, capital efficiency, capital spend, operating cost efficiency and, of course, our success on the ongoing asset sales programs are all variables in dialing up and down that prospective capital profile. But I think your takeaway should be that we continue to have a great deal of flexibility to manage that and to really achieve all of what we want to achieve in terms of protecting that balance sheet, in terms -- if the commodity price environment is supportive of it, we continue to put those North American unconventionals back kind of growth track going forward. The one point you did bring up and I'll go ahead brought up the question with regard to the dividend, and as you might imagine in this environment, it's a question we frequently get. Evan, it's still a very important element to when you think about the total shareholder return for our shareholders. Even more so, in this environment. And it does -- it continues to be that first call of capital in our capital allocation process. The board is very thoughtful and very considered when they address this issue each and every quarter. They're making sure that it's still meeting our long-term capital allocation objective and they'll continue to fulfill the role of each and every quarter. But honestly, sitting here today, I feel very good. Good solid balance sheet, $5.5 billion of liquidity, $2.5 billion of that in cash and cash equivalents.

And of course, we gained the information in the data from that investment in addition to the barrels, which allows us to continue to move toward that vision of what a full field development will look like ultimately in the SCOOP and the STACK. But I just emphasize that we are early days, but we are making good progress already. You've seen some movement in our completed well costs downward in Oklahoma, reflecting some good efficiency, as well as commercial work by the teams. And I think as we move to scale, we move out of leasehold mode, we've given the pad drilling, those efficiencies are simply going to increase over time and we could see even more reduction in those costs."

Just on the cash breakeven that J.R. was addressing in his earlier comments, we view that is inclusive of the dividend.

But we still feel that this is an important way to deliver value to our shareholder. And we tend to look at the dividend and in the context of our overall capital allocation and in conjunction with the growth that we can generate organically within our very strong North America resource plays. So we'll be those 2 things as leading to be viewed collectively from an investment standpoint.

Let me maybe take the high-level question first, which is more around exploration strategy, how does that fit into our portfolio. As we've shared previously, Doug, we've been assessing our conventional exploration strategy and really in the context of its ability to compete for capital allocation within the current portfolio, which does include, as you well stated, the North America inventory. And it must compete really on a risk-adjusted return basis. And we really started this assessment some time ago. It really wasn't crossed by that current macroenvironment. It was really prompted by the depths and quality of the inventory that we saw the North America resource play. So we're bit ahead of the curve. We've already taken the steps to reduce exploration essentially by half in 2015 and we certainly see a path that will allow us to moderate that further into 2016. I also mentioned in my opening comments that we recently withdrew from the new country entries that we simply sell it in the current environment, did not compete for capital allocation. So when you consider the current commodity price environment, when you consider the depth of our resource inventory North America and the limited capital to invest, it's just simply getting tougher and tougher for conventional exploration to compete for capital on a risk-adjusted basis. Back to your specific question on kind of the uptick in exploration expense, we did have a write-down in Birchwood, which is our in situ property in Canada, which contributed to that, Doug."

Well, let me maybe start with addressing what I think is more a question around maintenance capital. And I think first and foremost, Ryan, of course, the $700 million, $750 million run rate includes the full portfolio. When we talk about the maintenance capital, we tend to focus in on the resource plays themselves in aggregate. And our best estimate of CapEx required to hold those resource plays flat is around $2 billion to $2.1 billion. Of course, as capital efficiencies and productivity activities kick in, there'll be actually downward pressure on that maintenance capital. And so when you think about looking ahead and how long could maintenance levels be sustained, my answer to that really would be that we have multiple years of high quality, high return resource play inventory that could sensibly drive a maintenance levels program even in a $50 barrel WTI environment. Again, you'll recall, as I mentioned in my opening comments, that they took a lot of in our most recent disclosure and 5-year drilling inventory, over 70% of our wells were profitable at $50-barrel per WTI. So you're right, we have had this rapid deceleration from first to second quarter in our overall capital program that $500 million that I quoted. We've now kind of settled in to I'd say a maintenance capital mode in the resource plays. But bear in mind, riding on top of that, are some of other investments that will be a little bit more lumpy and bumpy, including we may even see a little bit of an up in third quarter because of some nonrecurring infrastructure investments and a few other nonrecurring items in our international portfolio. But as you look through that lumpiness in the second half of the year, that $700 million, $750 million exit rate feels about right with some plus or minus there. Your other question was around how much of some of these longer cycle investments may run their course in 2015. And the items there that we talked about when we mentioned those things to make the work that we're doing is currently other EG compression project, which is now heavily in fabrication mode, the work that we did in the EG drilling program, the work that we did also in the U.K. drilling program, those are the types of items that we talked about. And so when we look kind of on a net-net basis as those kind of come off in 2016, there'll be some puts and takes, but you're probably in the couple of hundred million kind of dollar range in terms of the accommodation space that that might create within the budget."

I think in general, I'd say we're really, really pleased with the progress broadly from the Bakken completion pilots. You should step back and look at what we've accomplished over the last several quarters, that material improvement in initial production now with accumulative production level both wells reaching 180 days, you start to see that improvement hold up over time. We've consistently taken those new designs and application despite across our entire portfolio. I would add that even as we've demonstrated these results of our kind of rearview mirror looking, we're continuing to progress even more intensive simulations. I think we noted in the notes of that this group you're looking at has 40% more profit and about 10% more completion stages. We continue to see opportunity even beyond that for more intensity to drive those results further. I think based on the results you're seeing and referencing, there are certainly some pressure on us to look at overall EURs and talk about those perhaps later this year, perhaps some more color and context of that. And obviously with more EUR combined, with the Bakken well cost trending down to plus or minus $6 million in material reduction there, I think you can see the value implication of the portfolio of Bakken from that.

And will hopefully be able to share a little bit more color on that a bit later in the year as we're able to roll in some of the specific updates on EURs and single well economics. But I think that order in terms of capital allocation is exactly what you see in our current portfolio, which is the Eagle Ford wells, particularly condensate and highly to a certain extent, are still very strong from a return standpoint. Both the SCOOP and the STACK still compete very favorably as well. And then in higher quality areas of Bakken such as the Myrmidon, they're also competing for capital allocation."

Let me -- I'll maybe that jump in the hedging question. Versus sort cycle. Right now, the bulk of our investment dollars were flowing into North America short cycle, then the driver there is they have the highest risk-adjusted returns in the portfolio that we have today. So for us, it's probably a little bit less about short cycle, long cycle than it is about where can we generate a highest risk-adjusted return. And to the extent that they continue to see long cycle or longer cycle opportunities, great example are the things that we done in Equatorial Guinea and the U.K. this year in terms of the program drilling that we've done there that are very strong from a capital allocation standpoint and have added very profitable barrels to the portfolio. So in no way are we necessarily turning our back on longer cycle type investments, but the balance is going to be dictated by the opportunities that we have in the portfolio and being driven by generating those highest risk-adjusted return. From a hedging standpoint, certainly, we view that as just an element of overall commodity risk management. And maybe I'll let JR comment on that."

Really, the wave of those higher productivity wells that are very early in their life coming down is kind of overwhelmed the number of new wells to sales. I think from a perspective of activity across North America, including Eagle Ford has come down to about 45% for us. What you really see we're managing that downward to a point of stability. We will have roughly the same number of wells, plus or minus in the third and fourth quarter in Eagle Ford, specifically. And any given quarter, our interest move within that so that number grows also that wells can move a bit. So I think in general, we're guiding to what relatively flat production quarter-over-quarter and we're managing that large activity downward in the quarter. I would say, too, some context of that is even as we said that was to sales were lower Eagle Ford, I think it's important to note we went from 5 frac fleets to 2 by April.

But when you put them together, they did make their performing very in line with our early expectations for that despite being a closer spacing in the stand-alone wells. So that gives us a lot of encouragement. We expected some differentiation. In some cases, what we'll find is when we go in and there's more than 1 parent well or older well in the area, you'll see some impact in the new well that's near that older well will be impacted modestly by that. But in aggregate, we tend to look at the entire unit, how many wells, how many total dollar invested, what's the total production coming out of that. And so that Ajax pilot, for example, is performing very much in line with those expectations. Moving further north to Hector in that pilot, again, we see a diversity of results. But in aggregate, they're performing very similarly to our expectations for the early production. Some of the wells in other groups are more mature than others, so several of those are at 90 or 120 days and they're continuing to perform well. So we're very pleased with that result overall. And these pilots -- some of the wells vintage wise had more aggressive simulations than others based on when they were drilled and completed. And then lastly, in Myrmidon, we see a wide range there, too. I think in the case of that 1 pilot, we intentionally looked at that pilot and said there are 4 older parent wells between those 2 sections or units that were developed together. And so the wells near -- those new wells near the parent wells are showing lesser production than the wells that are further outlined. And that's not unexpected. In our case, we want to test that as we have parent well we need to work around. And I think in general, we're still very pleased with the overall production and continue to see that as a validation of our spacing assumptions moving forward."

314842,303383999,851028,"Marathon Oil Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2015",2015-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Oil Corporation","Executives","All right. Well, thanks, Chris. Let me add my good morning. I'd like to open with just a few comments regarding the elements of our business that we control, cost, efficiencies and execution, and discuss how our actions will enhance returns and have us po",859,"All right. Well, thanks, Chris. Let me add my good morning. I'd like to open with just a few comments regarding the elements of our business that we control, cost, efficiencies and execution, and discuss how our actions will enhance returns and have us positioned for the current environment as well as when commodity prices show a sustained improvement. 
We find ourselves in a continued low and volatile pricing environment. We have taken a decisive action consistent with our business plan released in first quarter, activity and CapEx reductions, capital efficiency and productivity gains, operating and G&A cost reductions and noncore asset divestments. We have successfully and efficiently achieved our planned activity reductions in the 3 resource plays to yield a program that will hold production volumes for the balance of 2015 while still progressing our strategic objectives in all 3 plays. 
Those objectives are co-development in the Eagle Ford, integration of completion and downspacing pilots in the Bakken and protecting our valuable leasehold in both our SCOOP and STACK positions while investing in high-return, outside-operated opportunities. Even with these planned reductions, we will still deliver on our growth targets of 5% to 7% for the overall company and 20% for the resource plays year-over-year. We've also raised the low end of our total company E&P full year production guidance, essentially increasing the midpoint despite that announced asset sale. 
Our planned deceleration in capital spend is evident in the sequential reduction in our capital program by almost $500 million and the significant decrease in wells to sales relative to the first quarter. We had already cut exploration spend by half from last year and are continuing to moderate forward commitments as we reset our strategy, including withdrawal from new country entries that do not compete for capital allocation. 
For capital efficiency, we have captured greater than $300 million in D&C savings in the U.S. resource plays or about 20% and are driving for more. Our completed well costs continue to fall, and our well productivity continues to improve. We have reduced unit operating cost in both of our E&P segments from the year-ago quarter, more than 30% in North America and 25% in international ex Libya, and have reflected this in our forward full year guidance for unit costs, lowering them $1.25 and $1 per BOE, respectively. We were quick to address G&A costs in the first quarter as we finalized our activity plans and implemented a workforce reduction of about 400 people that is expected to generate annualized net savings of approximately $100 million. 
Our noncore asset sales are progressing with signed agreements for approximately $100 million toward our target of over $500 million. This recent transaction confirm that the right assets will generate a competitive process and yield compelling deal metrics even in the current environment. All of these actions combine to give us confidence in driving toward cash flow neutrality in 2016 inclusive of noncore asset sales. 
We are only just beginning the budget process for 2016, but we'll focus capital allocation to the high-return U.S. resource plays as several longer-cycle investments run their course by the end of this year and exploration spend continues to decline. Our forward-look positions us well below our 2015 $3.3 billion capital program. And while our 2015 quarterly exit rate will be in the range of $700 million and $750 million, we still have the ability to flex down or up as required. Additionally, we expect expense reductions and capital efficiency to continue into 2016. 
We are optimizing our business around a lower cost structure, holding production levels and protecting our investment in our high-return U.S. resource plays while challenging all other spend in excess of that. Our U.S. resource plays continue to deliver solid returns at current pricing with capital efficiency and enhanced productivity lowering breakeven prices. Our last disclosure on our 5-year drilling inventory showed 70% of our inventory profitable at $50 a barrel WTI, and that analysis did not incorporate our most recent completed well cost savings and productivity enhancements. We have multiple years of high-quality inventory that can deliver competitive returns in the current environment. 
We do not believe this is a time to be accelerating inventory and associated production from short-cycle investments. We believe it's a time for discipline, continuous cost reduction, sustainable efficiency, maximizing returns and balance sheet protection. We continue to have a strong balance sheet with $5.5 billion in liquidity at quarter end. As we move into the second half of 2015, we look forward to providing more results from our co-development in the Eagle Ford, operated downspacing activity in Oklahoma and resource updates for the U.S. unconventional plays. 
I want to conclude by taking a moment to recognize our Marathon Oil employees who have been the driving force behind our results in this very dynamic environment. They have stepped forward to lead our efforts in cost reduction and efficiency gains and have kept their focus on execution despite the distraction of the macro environment. Our employees are committed to an enterprise-first view, for which I'm both thankful and proud. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Chris to begin the Q&A."

Ed, I would say for the second quarter and actually the previous couple of quarters, the focus in the Eagle Ford has been to maintain the very high initial production and the high EURs we have. We have some of the highest of each of those in South Texas even as we have taken -- for example, in the second quarter, taken more than 1/3 of the total wells are outside of the Lower Eagle Ford, in either of the Austin Chalk or the Upper Eagle Ford. We've really accelerated that co-development in multiple horizons, 3 and in some cases, 4 horizons developed across our acreage position, particularly in Karnes County, to see how much vertical density in that total package we could create as well as the 40-acre and in some cases, 30-acre spacing we have horizontally in that. So what we're really most excited about it is even as we've materially increased the complexity of the co-development through the stack and frac pilots, what we've seen is that the production per well in the other horizons, specifically the Upper Eagle Ford and the Austin Chalk, have competed very favorably with the traditional Lower Eagle Ford. So we're still getting great results that are competitive and returns among the best in our portfolio from all 3 of those horizons, which helps our long-term inventory and really helps our capital efficiency as we can move to develop more wells per pad across the Eagle Ford."

And then perhaps I'll let J.R. maybe talk a little bit on the cash flow outspend question. But as we kind of think about the current prices and look ahead to '16, we would envision a -- certainly, a material lower budget than where we are, below that $3.3 billion. And certainly, as you mentioned, our run rates coming out of this year are certainly south of $3 billion. We're, honestly, though, Evan, right at the beginning of our budget process for 2016, and clearly, any actions that we take, our capital allocation is going to be governed in large part by what we see in the commodity price environment. But in general, our strategic approach is going to be to prioritize our available capital to those highest-return investments that we have in the North America resource plays. And the balance will go to any previously committed kind of nondiscretionary longer-cycle requirements. I would also expect in '16 that our exploration CapEx is further reduced. It was cut in half this year. And as you think about kind of even for a flat to reduced budget into '16, the North America component of that will still grow in that context because we have some long-cycle investments running their course in 2015. We have further reductions, as I mentioned, in exploration spend, and we also have some nonrecurring U.S. infrastructure investments this year in 2015 that are going to provide some accommodation space, if you will, for additional North America investments. Again, our goal is going to be to target as much investment as we can to the U.S. resource plays based on the prevailing commodity environment and available cash flows. We still have the inventory to deliver strong and long-term growth, and we're going to protect that optionality as we move into 2016. With that, maybe I'll just offer it over to J.R. just to talk a little bit about cash flow."

Again, philosophically, I want to see 2016 be as close to free cash flow neutral, including asset sales, as we possibly can. Many variables to that equation. Capital -- clearly, capital activity, capital efficiency, capital spend, operating cost efficiency and of course, our success on the ongoing asset sales programs are all variables in dialing up and down that prospective capital profile. But I think your takeaway should be that we continue to have a great deal of flexibility to manage that and to really achieve all of what we want to achieve in terms of protecting that balance sheet, in terms -- if the commodity price environment is supportive of it, to continue to put those North American unconventionals back on a growth track going forward. The one point you did bring up and I'll go ahead and answer. You brought up the question with regard to the dividend. And as you might imagine, in this environment, it's a question we frequently get. Evan, it's still a very important element to when you think about the total shareholder return for our shareholders, even more so in this environment. And it does -- it continues to be that first call of capital in our capital allocation process. The board is very thoughtful and very considerate when they address this issue each and every quarter. They're making sure that it's still meeting our long-term capital allocation objective, and they'll continue to fulfill that role each and every quarter. But honestly, sitting here today, I feel very good. Good solid balance sheet, $5.5 billion of liquidity, $2.5 billion of that in cash and cash equivalents, and I think we've got a tremendous amount of flexibility to still continue to deliver that important element to our shareholders."

And as we've said in the past, we certainly believe, with well over 1 billion barrels of 2P resource, that this is a tremendously important growth engine for the company going forward. Because, again, of capital constraints and the current environment, we're running a 2-rig operated program there. That's designed to ensure that we protect our very valuable leasehold in both the SCOOP and the STACK. And as you mentioned, what we're doing is we're participating at a lower interest in the nonoperated part of our portfolio to really leverage our funds to continue to grow our dataset in Oklahoma in a very cost-effective manner. In fact, in total, we've redeployed about $60 million into the Oklahoma nonoperated business. And of course, we gained the information and the data from that investment, in addition to the barrels, which allows us to continue to move toward that vision of what a full field development will look like ultimately in the SCOOP and the STACK. But I'd just emphasize that we are early days, but we're making good progress already. You've seen some movement in our completed well cost downward in Oklahoma, reflecting some good efficiency as well as commercial work by the teams. And I think as we move to scale, we move out of leasehold mode, we get into pad drilling, those efficiencies are simply going to increase over time and we could see even more reduction in those costs."

Just on the cash breakeven that J.R. was addressing in his earlier comments, we view that as inclusive of the dividend.

Obviously, with our dividend yield where it sits today, that's a bit different looking than it was in a different commodity price environment. But we still feel that this is an important way to deliver value to our shareholder, and we tend to look at the dividend in the context of our overall capital allocation and in conjunction with the growth that we can generate organically within our very strong North America resource plays. So we view those 2 things as needing to be viewed collectively from an investment standpoint.

Let me maybe take the high-level question first, Doug, which is more around exploration strategy, how does that fit into our portfolio. As we've shared previously, Doug, we've been assessing our conventional exploration strategy and really in the context of its ability to compete for capital allocation within the current portfolio, which does include, as you well stated, the North America inventory, and it must compete really on a risk-adjusted-return basis. And we really started this assessment some time ago. It really wasn't prompted by the current macro environment. It was really prompted by the depth and quality of the inventory that we saw in the North America resource plays. So we were a bit ahead of the curve. We've already taken the step to reduce exploration essentially by half in 2015, and we certainly see a path that will allow us to moderate that further into 2016. I also mentioned in my opening comments that we most recently withdrew from some new country entries that we just simply felt, in the current environment, did not compete for capital allocation. So when you consider the current commodity price environment, when you consider the depth of our resource inventory in North America and the limited capital to invest, it's just simply getting tougher and tougher for conventional exploration to compete for capital on a risk-adjusted basis. Back to your specific question on kind of the uptick in exploration expense, we did have a write-down in Birchwood, which is our in situ property in Canada, which contributed to that, Doug."

Well, let me maybe start with addressing what I think is more a question around maintenance capital. And I think first and foremost, Ryan, of course, the $700 million to $750 million run rate includes the full portfolio, and when we talk about maintenance capital, we tend to focus in on the resource plays themselves in aggregate. And our best estimate of CapEx required to hold those resource plays flat is around $2 billion to $2.1 billion. Of course, as capital efficiencies and productivity improvements kick in, there'll be actually downward pressure on that maintenance capital. And so when you think about looking ahead and how long could maintenance levels be sustained, my answer to that really would be that we have multiple years of high-quality, high-return resource play inventory that could extensively drive a maintenance-level program even in a $50 barrel WTI environment. Again, you'll recall, as I mentioned in my opening comments, that when we took a look in our most recent disclosure on our 5-year drilling inventory, over 70% of our wells were profitable at $50 barrel per WTI. So you're right, we have had this rapid deceleration from first to second quarter in our overall capital program, that $500 million that I quoted. We've now kind of settled into, I'd say, a maintenance capital mode in the resource plays. But bear in mind, riding on top of that are some of our other investments that will be a little bit more lumpy and bumpy, including -- we may even see a little bit of an up in third quarter because of some nonrecurring infrastructure investments and a few other nonrecurring items in our international portfolio. But as you look through that lumpiness in the second half of the year, that $700 million to $750 million exit rate feels about right with some plus or minus there. Your other question was around how much of some of these longer-cycle investments may run their course in 2015. And the items there that we talk about when we mentioned those are things like the work that we're doing currently on the EG compression project, which is now heavily in fabrication mode; the work that we did in the EG drilling program; the work that we did also in the U.K. drilling program. Those are the types of items that we talk about. And so when we look kind of on a net-net basis, as those kind of come off in 2016, there will be some puts and takes, but you're probably in the couple of hundred million kind of dollar range in terms of the accommodation space that, that might create within the budget."

I think, in general, I'd say we're really, really pleased with the progress broadly from the Bakken completion pilots. You should step back and look at what we've accomplished over the last several quarters, that material improvement in initial production. Now with the cumulative production of a group of wells reaching 180 days, you start to see that improvement hold up over time. We've consistently taken those new designs and applications and spread it across our entire portfolio. I would add that even as we've demonstrated these results that are kind of rearview-mirror looking, we're continuing to progress even more intensive simulations. I think we noted in the notes that this group you're looking at has 40% more proppant and about 10% more completion stages. We continue to see opportunity even beyond that for more intensity to drive those results further. I think based on the results you're seeing and referencing, there's certainly some pressure on us to look at overall EURs and talk about those, perhaps later this year provide some more color and context on that. But obviously, with more EUR, combined with the Bakken well cost trending down to plus or minus $6 million of material reduction there, I think you can see the value implication of the portfolio on Bakken from that. So again, we're very pleased with it. And by all means, we expect that momentum to continue."

So in no way are we necessarily turning our back on longer-cycle type investments, but the balance is going to be dictated by the opportunities that we have in the portfolio and being driven by generating those highest risk-adjusted return.

They continue to see into the future. They can be innovative and thoughtful. In this case, part of the change is that we've -- as we have moderated activity, we've certainly kept the best rigs and the best crews because it helps both our operational efficiency as well as our environmental safety performance. We've retained rigs with the highest specification, so the right types of capabilities that we move to in that rig fleet that can really drive it. And those unique attributes of those rigs allow us to use other types of downhole tools. The combination of those technologies together has really delivered this performance. And I would say, well, 1,800 feet per day was materially better than the year-ago quarter. Our best rigs are at 2,600, 2,700 feet per day already, which shows you the gap, right? We can get the whole fleet to there. There's still room to improve that overall. We see that as sustainable. And in fact, as we move to stack and frac pilots in the co-development of multiple horizons, we actually think that enables that type of efficiency further because we're going to drill more wells on each pad as we go to development."

Phil, I think you're seeing that actually very well. Compared to the previous several quarters where we've had in excess of 90 wells to sales, in the second quarter, we had 52 wells for sales, which is driving that production in the Eagle Ford downward. Really, the wave of those higher-productivity wells that are very early in their life coming down has kind of overwhelmed the number of new wells to sales. I think from a perspective of activity across North America, including Eagle Ford, has come down to about 45% for us. What you really see is we're managing that downward to a point of stability. We will have roughly the same number of wells, plus or minus, in the third and fourth quarter in Eagle Ford, specifically. In any given quarter, our working interest moves around a little bit within that, so the number of gross wells and net wells can move a bit. So I think in general, we're guiding toward relatively flat production quarter-over-quarter, and we're managing that large activity downward in the quarter. I would say, too, some context on that. Even as we said the wells to sales were lower in Eagle Ford, I think it's important to note we went from 5 frac fleets to 2 by April. So we were down to that lowest level of wells to sales-driven activity by very early in the second quarter, which kind of added to that deceleration impact."

When you look at the deal metrics, they were very compelling on a cash flow multiple basis, over 9x. And so we feel like for the right type of assets, there is still a ready market out there. And I would not want to leave the impression that we're selling anything at reduced value or low value to our shareholders. I mean, we don't view these as distressed assets. We simply view them as part of our ongoing portfolio management. And if we can't capture fair value, then we'll continue to operate. In the case of the East Texas, North Louisiana, Wilburton deal, it was a gassy asset. It was no longer competing for capital allocation, a relatively high unit cash cost.

So with 3 spacing pilots online, I feel like we've made a lot of progress at moving that forward on an operated basis, kind of start work south to north, if you will. Those are -- spacing pilots are in 3 different areas, starting in the south. It's Middle Bakken, so it's a 6-well per Middle Bakken pattern overall. There is a wide range of results there. I think in the case of that pilot in the Ajax area, when you look at the aggregate or all of the wells on there, you'll see some above type curve, you'll see some a little below. But when you put them together, they look like they're performing very in line with our early expectations for that despite being at closer spacing than stand-alone wells. So that gives us a lot of encouragement. We expected some differentiation. In some cases, what we'll find is, when we go in and there's more than 1 parent well or older well in the area, you'll see some depletion impact in the new well that's near that older well. We'll be impacted modestly by that. But in aggregate, we tend to look at the entire unit, how many wells, how many total dollars invested, what's the total production coming out of that. And so that Ajax pilot, for example, is performing very much in line with those expectations. Moving further north to Hector in that pilot. Again, we see a diversity of results. But in aggregate, they're performing very similarly to our expectations for the early production. Some of the wells in those groups are more mature than others. So several of those are at 90 or 120 days, and they're continuing to perform well. So we're very pleased with that result overall. And these pilots -- some of the wells, vintage-wise, had more aggressive stimulations than others based on when they were drilled and completed. And then lastly, in Myrmidon, we see a wide range there, too. I think in the case of that one pilot, we intentionally looked at that pilot and said there are 4 older parent wells between those 2 sections or units that were developed together. And so the wells near  those -- the new wells near the parent wells are showing lesser production than the wells that are further outlying, and that's not unexpected in our case. We want to test that as we have parent wellbores we need to work around. But I think in general, we're still very pleased with the overall production and continue to see that as a validation of our spacing assumptions moving forward."

314842,303383999,851343,"Marathon Oil Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2015",2015-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Oil Corporation","Executives","All right. Well, thanks, Chris. Let me add my good morning. I'd like to open with just a few comments regarding the elements of our business that we control: cost, efficiencies and execution; and discuss how our actions will enhance returns and have us po",859,"All right. Well, thanks, Chris. Let me add my good morning. I'd like to open with just a few comments regarding the elements of our business that we control: cost, efficiencies and execution; and discuss how our actions will enhance returns and have us positioned for the current environment as well as when commodity prices show a sustained improvement. 
We find ourselves in a continued low and volatile pricing environment. We have taken a decisive action consistent with our business plan released in first quarter, activity and CapEx reductions, capital efficiency and productivity gains, operating and G&A cost reductions and noncore asset divestments. We have successfully and efficiently achieved our planned activity reductions in the 3 resource plays to yield a program that will hold production volumes for the balance of 2015 while still progressing our strategic objectives in all 3 plays. 
Those objectives are co-development in the Eagle Ford, integration of completion and downspacing pilots in the Bakken and protecting our valuable leasehold in both our SCOOP and STACK positions while investing in high-return, outside-operated opportunities. Even with these planned reductions, we will still deliver on our growth targets of 5% to 7% for the overall company and 20% for the resource plays year-over-year. We've also raised the low end of our total company E&P full year production guidance, essentially increasing the midpoint despite that announced asset sale. 
Our planned deceleration in capital spend is evident in the sequential reduction in our capital program by almost $500 million and the significant decrease in wells to sales relative to the first quarter. We had already cut exploration spend by half from last year and are continuing to moderate forward commitments as we reset our strategy, including withdrawal from new country entries that do not compete for capital allocation. 
For capital efficiency, we have captured greater than $300 million in D&C savings in the U.S. resource plays or about 20% and are driving for more. Our completed well costs continue to fall, and our well productivity continues to improve. We have reduced unit operating cost in both of our E&P segments from the year-ago quarter, more than 30% in North America and 25% in international ex Libya, and have reflected this in our forward full year guidance per unit cost, lowering them $1.25 and $1 per BOE, respectively. We were quick to address G&A costs in the first quarter as we finalized our activity plans and implemented a workforce reduction of about 400 people that is expected to generate annualized net savings of approximately $100 million. 
Our noncore asset sales are progressing with signed agreements for approximately $100 million toward our target of over $500 million. This recent transaction confirm that the right assets will generate a competitive process and yield compelling deal metrics even in the current environment. All of these actions combine to give us confidence in driving toward cash flow neutrality in 2016 inclusive of noncore asset sales. 
We are only just beginning the budget process for 2016, but we'll focus capital allocation to the high-return U.S. resource plays as several longer-cycle investments run their course by the end of this year and exploration spend continues to decline. Our forward-look positions us well below our 2015 $3.3 billion capital program. And while our 2015 quarterly exit rate will be in the range of $700 million and $750 million, we still have the ability to flex down or up as required. Additionally, we expect expense reductions and capital efficiency to continue into 2016. 
We are optimizing our business around a lower cost structure, holding production levels and protecting our investment in our high-return U.S. resource plays while challenging all other spend in excess of that. Our U.S. resource plays continue to deliver solid returns at current pricing with capital efficiency and enhanced productivity lowering breakeven prices. Our last disclosure on our 5-year drilling inventory showed 70% of our inventory profitable at $50 a barrel WTI, and that analysis did not incorporate our most recent completed well cost savings and productivity enhancements. We have multiple years of high-quality inventory that can deliver competitive returns in the current environment. 
We do not believe this is a time to be accelerating inventory and associated production from short-cycle investments. We believe it's a time for discipline, continuous cost reduction, sustainable efficiency, maximizing returns and balance sheet protection. We continue to have a strong balance sheet with $5.5 billion in liquidity at quarter end. As we move into the second half of 2015, we look forward to providing more results from our co-development in the Eagle Ford, operated downspacing activity in Oklahoma and resource updates for the U.S. unconventional plays. 
I want to conclude by taking a moment to recognize our Marathon Oil employees who have been the driving force behind our results in this very dynamic environment. They have stepped forward to lead our efforts in cost reduction and efficiency gains and have kept their focus on execution despite the distraction of the macro environment. Our employees are committed to an enterprise-first view, for which I'm both thankful and proud. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Chris to begin the Q&A."

Ed, I would say for the second quarter and actually the previous couple of quarters, the focus in the Eagle Ford has been to maintain the very high initial production and the high EURs we have. We have some of the highest of each of those in South Texas even as we have taken -- for example, in the second quarter, taken more than 1/3 of the total wells are outside of the Lower Eagle Ford, in either of the Austin Chalk or the Upper Eagle Ford. We've really accelerated that co-development in multiple horizons, 3 and in some cases, 4 horizons developed across our acreage position, particularly in Karnes County, to see how much vertical density in that total package we could create as well as the 40-acre and in some cases, 30-acre spacing we have horizontally in that. So what we're really most excited about it is even as we've materially increased the complexity of the co-development through the stack and frac pilots, what we've seen is that the production per well in the other horizons, specifically the Upper Eagle Ford and the Austin Chalk, have competed very favorably with the traditional Lower Eagle Ford. So we're still getting great results that are competitive and returns among the best in our portfolio from all 3 of those horizons, which helps our long-term inventory and really helps our capital efficiency as we can move to develop more wells per pad across the Eagle Ford."

And then perhaps I'll let J.R. maybe talk a little bit on the cash flow outspend question. But as we kind of think about the current prices and look ahead to '16, we would envision a -- certainly, a material lower budget than where we are below that $3.3 billion. And certainly, as you mentioned, our run rates coming out of this year are certainly south of $3 billion. We're, honestly, though, Evan, right at the beginning of our budget process for 2016, and clearly, any actions that we take, our capital allocation is going to be governed in large part by what we see in the commodity price environment. But in general, our strategic approach is going to be to prioritize our available capital to those highest-return investments that we have in the North America resource plays. And the balance will go to any previously committed kind of nondiscretionary longer-cycle requirements. I would also expect in '16 that our exploration CapEx is further reduced. It was cut in half this year. And as you think about kind of even for a flat to reduced budget into '16, the North America component of that will still grow in that context because we have some long-cycle investments running their course in 2015. We have further reductions, as I mentioned, in exploration spend, and we also have some nonrecurring U.S. infrastructure investments this year in 2015 that are going to provide some accommodation space, if you will, for additional North America investments. Again, our goal is going to be to target as much investment as we can to the U.S. resource plays based on the prevailing commodity environment and available cash flows. We still have the inventory to deliver strong and long-term growth, and we're going to protect that optionality as we move into 2016. With that, maybe I'll just offer it over to J.R. just to talk a little bit about cash flow."

I mean, it is early in the process, but philosophically, from my standpoint, he referred to the balance sheet strength that's going to remain a priority. Again, philosophically, I want to see 2016 be as close to free cash flow neutral, including asset sales, as we possibly can. Many variables to that equation. Capital -- clearly, capital activity, capital efficiency, capital spend, operating cost efficiency and of course, our success on the ongoing asset sales programs are all variables in dialing up and down that prospective capital profile. But I think your takeaway should be that we continue to have a great deal of flexibility to manage that and to really achieve all of what we want to achieve in terms of protecting that balance sheet, in terms -- if the commodity price environment is supportive of it, to continue to put those North American unconventionals back on a growth track going forward. The one point you did bring up and I'll go ahead and answer. You brought up the question with regard to the dividend. And as you might imagine, in this environment, it's a question we frequently get. Evan, it's still a very important element to when you think about the total shareholder return for our shareholders, even more so in this environment. And it does -- it continues to be that first call of capital in our capital allocation process. The board is very thoughtful and very considered when they address this issue each and every quarter. They're making sure that it's still meeting our long-term capital allocation objectives, and they'll continue to fulfill that role each and every quarter. But honestly, sitting here today, I feel very good. Good solid balance sheet, $5.5 billion of liquidity, $2.5 billion of that in cash and cash equivalents, and I think we've got a tremendous amount of flexibility to still continue to deliver that important element to our shareholders."

I think we are still in the very early days in the development in Oklahoma in both the STACK and the SCOOP. And as we've said in the past, we certainly believe, with well over 1 billion barrels of 2P resource, that this is a tremendously important growth engine for the company going forward. Because, again, of capital constraints in the current environment, we're running a 2-rig operated program there. That's designed to ensure that we protect our very valuable leasehold in both the SCOOP and the STACK. And as you mentioned, what we're doing is we're participating at a lower interest in the nonoperated part of our portfolio to really leverage our funds to continue to grow our dataset in Oklahoma in a very cost-effective manner. In fact, in total, we've redeployed about $60 million into the Oklahoma nonoperated business. And of course, we gained the information and the data from that investment, in addition to the barrels, which allows us to continue to move toward that vision of what a full field development will look like ultimately in the SCOOP and the STACK. But I'd just emphasize that we are early days, but we're making good progress already. You've seen some movement in our completed well cost downward in Oklahoma, reflecting some good efficiency as well as commercial work by the teams. And I think as we move to scale, we move out of leasehold mode, we get into pad drilling, those efficiencies are simply going to increase over time and we could see even more reduction in those costs."

Just on the cash breakeven that J.R. was addressing in his earlier comments, we view that as inclusive of the dividend. When we think about cash flow neutrality, we're certainly wanting to cover all of our obligations from a capital allocation standpoint, and the dividend is one of those. Obviously, with our dividend yield where it sits today, that's a bit different looking than it was in a different commodity price environment. But we still feel that this is an important way to deliver value to our shareholder, and we tend to look at the dividend in the context of our overall capital allocation and in conjunction with the growth that we can generate organically within our very strong North America resource plays. So we view those 2 things as needing to be viewed collectively from an investment standpoint. And I think in this lower price environment, although you're correct in that it perhaps puts a bit more pressure than some of those peers, I do believe that is a key element of the return that we offer in this type of environment. And as J.R. very well put it, we're sitting with $5.5 billion in liquidity. We do not feel that we need to make any alteration in the way the dividend competes for capital allocation today."

Let me maybe take the high-level question first, Doug, which is more around exploration strategy, how does that fit into our portfolio. As we've shared previously, Doug, we've been assessing our conventional exploration strategy and really in the context of its ability to compete for capital allocation within the current portfolio, which does include, as you well stated, the North America inventory, and it must compete really on a risk adjusted return basis. And we really started this assessment some time ago. It really wasn't prompted by the current macro environment. It was really prompted by the depth and quality of the inventory that we saw in the North America resource plays. So we were a bit ahead of the curve. We've already taken the step to reduce exploration essentially by half in 2015, and we certainly see a path that will allow us to moderate that further into 2016. I also mentioned in my opening comments that we most recently withdrew from some new country entries that we just simply felt, in the current environment, did not compete for capital allocation. So when you consider the current commodity price environment, when you consider the depth of our resource inventory in North America and the limited capital to invest, it's just simply getting tougher and tougher for conventional exploration to compete for capital on a risk-adjusted basis. Back to your specific question on kind of the uptick in exploration expense, we did have a write-down in Birchwood, which is our in situ property in Canada, which contributed to that, Doug."

Could you maybe put some numbers around those that we could get maybe a bit of a better pro forma estimate for what the run rate on CapEx looks like into 2016?"

Well, let me maybe start with addressing what I think is more a question around maintenance capital. And I think first and foremost, Ryan, of course, the $700 million to $750 million run rate includes the full portfolio, and when we talk about maintenance capital, we tend to focus in on the resource plays themselves in aggregate. And our best estimate of CapEx required to hold those resource plays flat is around $2 billion to $2.1 billion. Of course, as capital efficiencies and productivity improvements kick in, there'll be actually downward pressure on that maintenance capital. And so when you think about looking ahead and how long could maintenance levels be sustained, my answer to that really would be that we have multiple years of high-quality, high-return resource play inventory that could ostensibly drive a maintenance-level program even in a $50 barrel WTI environment. Again, you'll recall, as I mentioned in my opening comments, that when we took a look in our most recent disclosure on our 5-year drilling inventory, over 70% of our wells were profitable at $50 barrel per WTI. So you're right, we have had this rapid deceleration from first to second quarter in our overall capital program, that $500 million that I quoted. We've now kind of settled into, I'd say, a maintenance capital mode in the resource plays. But bear in mind, riding on top of that are some of our other investments that will be a little bit more lumpy and bumpy, including -- we may even see a little bit of an up in third quarter because of some nonrecurring infrastructure investments and a few other nonrecurring items in our international portfolio. But as you look through that lumpiness in the second half of the year, that $700 million to $750 million exit rate feels about right with some plus or minus there. Your other question was around how much of some of these longer-cycle investments may run their course in 2015. And the items there that we talk about when we mentioned those are things like the work that we're doing currently on the EG compression project, which is now heavily in fabrication mode; the work that we did in the EG drilling program; the work that we did also in the U.K. drilling program. Those are the types of items that we talk about. And so when we look kind of on a net-net basis, as those kind of come off in 2016, there will be some puts and takes, but you're probably in the couple of hundred million kind of dollar range in terms of the accommodation space that, that might create within the budget."

I think, in general, I'd say we're really, really pleased with the progress broadly from the Bakken completion pilots. If you step back and look at what we've accomplished over the last several quarters, that material improvement in initial production. Now with the cumulative production of a group of wells reaching 180 days, you start to see that improvement hold up over time. We've consistently taken those new designs and applications and spread it across our entire portfolio. I would add that even as we've demonstrated these results that are kind of rearview-mirror looking, we're continuing to progress even more intensive simulations. I think we noted in the notes that this group you're looking at has 40% more proppant and about 10% more completion stages. We continue to see opportunity even beyond that for more intensity to drive those results further. I think based on the results you're seeing and referencing, there's certainly some pressure on us to look at overall EURs and talk about those, perhaps later this year provide some more color and context on that. But obviously, with more EUR, combined with the Bakken well cost trending down to plus or minus $6 million of material reduction there, I think you can see the value implication of the portfolio on Bakken from that. So again, we're very pleased with it. And by all means, we expect that momentum to continue."

We've retained rigs with the highest specification, so the right types of capabilities that we move to in that rig fleet that can really drive it. And those unique attributes of those rigs allow us to use other types of downhole tools. The combination of those technologies together has really delivered this performance. And I would say, while 1,800 feet per day was materially better than the year-ago quarter. Our best rigs are at 2,600, 2,700 feet per day already, which shows you the gap, right, that if we can get the whole fleet to there there's still room to improve that overall.

I mean we're really at scale in the Eagle Ford. Certainly, we've been in Bakken at scale for some time as well. But Oklahoma is still an area where we would like to see more capital invested and not just the nonoperated but also the operated program. And certainly, as we think about that incremental amount of capital coming available to invest, we absolutely see that flowing to places like the Eagle Ford and Oklahoma."

There's been a few one-off opportunities that were probably taken -- the decisions may have been taken in a slightly different environment than we find ourselves today. But with equities very depressed, I think with everyone kind of reacting to another dramatic downtick in pricing, it's hard to imagine there's going to be a lot of that type of activity, at least in the near term. Now as you look further ahead and we see a more persistent kind of lower-for-longer price environment, then I think the concept that there will be additional consolidation, additional opportunities come available to those that are prepared to take advantage of those, then absolutely, I would agree with that."

Phil, I think you're seeing that actually very well. Compared to the previous several quarters where we've had in excess of 90 wells to sales, in the second quarter, we had 52 wells for sales, which is driving that production in the Eagle Ford downward. Really, the wave of those higher-productivity wells that are very early in their life coming down has kind of overwhelmed the number of new wells to sales. I think from a perspective of activity across North America, including Eagle Ford, has come down to about 45% for us. What you really see is we're managing that downward to a point of stability. We will have roughly the same number of wells, plus or minus, in the third and fourth quarter in Eagle Ford, specifically. In any given quarter, our working interest moves around a little bit within that, so the number of gross wells and net wells can move a bit. So I think in general, we're guiding toward relatively flat production quarter-over-quarter, and we're managing that large activity downward in the quarter. I would say, too, some context on that. Even as we said the wells to sales were lower in Eagle Ford, I think it's important to note we went from 5 frac fleets to 2 by April. So we were down to that lowest level of wells to sales-driven activity by very early in the second quarter, which kind of added to that deceleration impact."

And I'll use the East Texas, North Louisiana, Wilburton transaction as an example. We had a very strong response to the data room. We had well over 20 proposals for the property. When you look at the deal metrics, they were very compelling on a cash flow multiple basis, over 9x. And so we feel like for the right type of assets, there is still a ready market out there. And I would not want to leave the impression that we're selling anything at reduced value or low value to our shareholders. I mean, we don't view these as distressed assets. We simply view them as part of our ongoing portfolio management. And if we can't capture fair value, then we'll continue to operate. In the case of the East Texas, North Louisiana, Wilburton deal, it was a gassy asset. It was no longer competing for capital allocation, a relatively high unit cash cost.

And to some extent, if you didn't participate in those valuable acreage, it's an opportunity lost, and we certainly want to capture all those opportunities. So it's not really driven by an operator.

So with 3 spacing pilots online, I feel like we've made a lot of progress at moving that forward on an operated basis, kind of start work south to north, if you will. Those are -- spacing pilots are in 3 different areas, starting in the south. It's Middle Bakken, so it's on a 6-well per Middle Bakken pattern overall. There is a wide range of results there. I think in the case of that pilot in the Ajax area, when you look at the aggregate or all of the wells on there, you'll see some above type curve, you'll see some a little below. But when you put them together, they look like they're performing very in line with our early expectations for that despite being at closer spacing than stand-alone wells. So that gives us a lot of encouragement. We expected some differentiation. In some cases, what we'll find is, when we go in and there's more than 1 parent well or older well in the area, you'll see some depletion impact in the new well that's near that older well will be impacted modestly by that. But in aggregate, we tend to look at the entire unit, how many wells, how many total dollars invested, what's the total production coming out of that. And so that Ajax pilot, for example, is performing very much in line with those expectations. Moving further north to Hector in that pilot. Again, we see a diversity of results. But in aggregate, they're performing very similarly to our expectations for the early production. Some of the wells in those groups are more mature than others. So several of those are at 90 or 120 days, and they're continuing to perform well. So we're very pleased with that result overall. And these pilots -- some of the wells, vintage-wise, had more aggressive stimulations than others based on when they were drilled and completed. And then lastly, in Myrmidon, we see a wide range there, too. I think in the case of that one pilot, we intentionally looked at that pilot and said there are 4 older parent wells between those 2 sections or units that were developed together. And so the wells near  those -- the new wells near the parent wells are showing lesser production than the wells that are further outlying, and that's not unexpected in our case. We want to test that as we have parent wellbores we need to work around. But I think in general, we're still very pleased with the overall production and continue to see that as a validation of our spacing assumptions moving forward."

Let me add my good morning. I'd like to open with just a few comments regarding the elements of our business that we control: cost, efficiencies and execution; and discuss how our actions will enhance returns and have us po",859,"All right. Well, thanks, Chris. Let me add my good morning. I'd like to open with just a few comments regarding the elements of our business that we control: cost, efficiencies and execution; and discuss how our actions will enhance returns and have us positioned for the current environment as well as when commodity prices show a sustained improvement. 
We find ourselves in a continued low and volatile pricing environment. We have taken a decisive action consistent with our business plan released in first quarter, activity and CapEx reductions, capital efficiency and productivity gains, operating and G&A cost reductions and noncore asset divestments. We have successfully and efficiently achieved our planned activity reductions in the 3 resource plays to yield a program that will hold production volumes for the balance of 2015 while still progressing our strategic objectives in all 3 plays. 
Those objectives are co-development in the Eagle Ford, integration of completion and downspacing pilots in the Bakken and protecting our valuable leasehold in both our SCOOP and STACK positions while investing in high-return, outside-operated opportunities. Even with these planned reductions, we will still deliver on our growth targets of 5% to 7% for the overall company and 20% for the resource plays year-over-year. We've also raised the low end of our total company E&P full year production guidance, essentially increasing the midpoint despite that announced asset sale. 
Our planned deceleration in capital spend is evident in the sequential reduction in our capital program by almost $500 million and the significant decrease in wells to sales relative to the first quarter. We had already cut exploration spend by half from last year and are continuing to moderate forward commitments as we reset our strategy, including withdrawal from new country entries that do not compete for capital allocation. 
For capital efficiency, we have captured greater than $300 million in D&C savings in the U.S. resource plays or about 20% and are driving for more. Our completed well costs continue to fall, and our well productivity continues to improve. We have reduced unit operating cost in both of our E&P segments from the year-ago quarter, more than 30% in North America and 25% in international ex Libya, and have reflected this in our forward full year guidance per unit cost, lowering them $1.25 and $1 per BOE, respectively. We were quick to address G&A costs in the first quarter as we finalized our activity plans and implemented a workforce reduction of about 400 people that is expected to generate annualized net savings of approximately $100 million. 
Our noncore asset sales are progressing with signed agreements for approximately $100 million toward our target of over $500 million. This recent transaction confirm that the right assets will generate a competitive process and yield compelling deal metrics even in the current environment. All of these actions combine to give us confidence in driving toward cash flow neutrality in 2016 inclusive of noncore asset sales. 
We are only just beginning the budget process for 2016, but we'll focus capital allocation to the high-return U.S. resource plays as several longer-cycle investments run their course by the end of this year and exploration spend continues to decline. Our forward-look positions us well below our 2015 $3.3 billion capital program. And while our 2015 quarterly exit rate will be in the range of $700 million and $750 million, we still have the ability to flex down or up as required. Additionally, we expect expense reductions and capital efficiency to continue into 2016. 
We are optimizing our business around a lower cost structure, holding production levels and protecting our investment in our high-return U.S. resource plays while challenging all other spend in excess of that. Our U.S. resource plays continue to deliver solid returns at current pricing with capital efficiency and enhanced productivity lowering breakeven prices. Our last disclosure on our 5-year drilling inventory showed 70% of our inventory profitable at $50 a barrel WTI, and that analysis did not incorporate our most recent completed well cost savings and productivity enhancements. We have multiple years of high-quality inventory that can deliver competitive returns in the current environment. 
We do not believe this is a time to be accelerating inventory and associated production from short-cycle investments. We believe it's a time for discipline, continuous cost reduction, sustainable efficiency, maximizing returns and balance sheet protection. We continue to have a strong balance sheet with $5.5 billion in liquidity at quarter end. As we move into the second half of 2015, we look forward to providing more results from our co-development in the Eagle Ford, operated downspacing activity in Oklahoma and resource updates for the U.S. unconventional plays. 
I want to conclude by taking a moment to recognize our Marathon Oil employees who have been the driving force behind our results in this very dynamic environment. They have stepped forward to lead our efforts in cost reduction and efficiency gains and have kept their focus on execution despite the distraction of the macro environment. Our employees are committed to an enterprise-first view, for which I'm both thankful and proud. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Chris to begin the Q&A."

Ed, I would say for the second quarter and actually the previous couple of quarters, the focus in the Eagle Ford has been to maintain the very high initial production and the high EURs we have. We have some of the highest of each of those in South Texas even as we have taken -- for example, in the second quarter, taken more than 1/3 of the total wells are outside of the Lower Eagle Ford, in either of the Austin Chalk or the Upper Eagle Ford. We've really accelerated that co-development in multiple horizons, 3 and in some cases, 4 horizons developed across our acreage position, particularly in Karnes County, to see how much vertical density in that total package we could create as well as the 40-acre and in some cases, 30-acre spacing we have horizontally in that. So what we're really most excited about it is even as we've materially increased the complexity of the co-development through the stack and frac pilots, what we've seen is that the production per well in the other horizons, specifically the Upper Eagle Ford and the Austin Chalk, have competed very favorably with the traditional Lower Eagle Ford. So we're still getting great results that are competitive and returns among the best in our portfolio from all 3 of those horizons, which helps our long-term inventory and really helps our capital efficiency as we can move to develop more wells per pad across the Eagle Ford."

And certainly, as you mentioned, our run rates coming out of this year are certainly south of $3 billion. We're, honestly, though, Evan, right at the beginning of our budget process for 2016, and clearly, any actions that we take, our capital allocation is going to be governed in large part by what we see in the commodity price environment. But in general, our strategic approach is going to be to prioritize our available capital to those highest-return investments that we have in the North America resource plays. And the balance will go to any previously committed kind of nondiscretionary longer-cycle requirements. I would also expect in '16 that our exploration CapEx is further reduced. It was cut in half this year. And as you think about kind of even for a flat to reduced budget into '16, the North America component of that will still grow in that context because we have some long-cycle investments running their course in 2015. We have further reductions, as I mentioned, in exploration spend, and we also have some nonrecurring U.S. infrastructure investments this year in 2015 that are going to provide some accommodation space, if you will, for additional North America investments. Again, our goal is going to be to target as much investment as we can to the U.S. resource plays based on the prevailing commodity environment and available cash flows. We still have the inventory to deliver strong and long-term growth, and we're going to protect that optionality as we move into 2016.

Capital -- clearly, capital activity, capital efficiency, capital spend, operating cost efficiency and of course, our success on the ongoing asset sales programs are all variables in dialing up and down that prospective capital profile. But I think your takeaway should be that we continue to have a great deal of flexibility to manage that and to really achieve all of what we want to achieve in terms of protecting that balance sheet, in terms -- if the commodity price environment is supportive of it, to continue to put those North American unconventionals back on a growth track going forward. The one point you did bring up and I'll go ahead and answer. You brought up the question with regard to the dividend. And as you might imagine, in this environment, it's a question we frequently get. Evan, it's still a very important element to when you think about the total shareholder return for our shareholders, even more so in this environment. And it does -- it continues to be that first call of capital in our capital allocation process. The board is very thoughtful and very considered when they address this issue each and every quarter. They're making sure that it's still meeting our long-term capital allocation objectives, and they'll continue to fulfill that role each and every quarter. But honestly, sitting here today, I feel very good. Good solid balance sheet, $5.5 billion of liquidity, $2.5 billion of that in cash and cash equivalents, and I think we've got a tremendous amount of flexibility to still continue to deliver that important element to our shareholders."

Because, again, of capital constraints in the current environment, we're running a 2-rig operated program there. That's designed to ensure that we protect our very valuable leasehold in both the SCOOP and the STACK. And as you mentioned, what we're doing is we're participating at a lower interest in the nonoperated part of our portfolio to really leverage our funds to continue to grow our dataset in Oklahoma in a very cost-effective manner. In fact, in total, we've redeployed about $60 million into the Oklahoma nonoperated business. And of course, we gained the information and the data from that investment, in addition to the barrels, which allows us to continue to move toward that vision of what a full field development will look like ultimately in the SCOOP and the STACK. But I'd just emphasize that we are early days, but we're making good progress already. You've seen some movement in our completed well cost downward in Oklahoma, reflecting some good efficiency as well as commercial work by the teams. And I think as we move to scale, we move out of leasehold mode, we get into pad drilling, those efficiencies are simply going to increase over time and we could see even more reduction in those costs."

Just on the cash breakeven that J.R. was addressing in his earlier comments, we view that as inclusive of the dividend.

But we still feel that this is an important way to deliver value to our shareholder, and we tend to look at the dividend in the context of our overall capital allocation and in conjunction with the growth that we can generate organically within our very strong North America resource plays. So we view those 2 things as needing to be viewed collectively from an investment standpoint. And I think in this lower price environment, although you're correct in that it perhaps puts a bit more pressure than some of those peers, I do believe that is a key element of the return that we offer in this type of environment.

Let me maybe take the high-level question first, Doug, which is more around exploration strategy, how does that fit into our portfolio. As we've shared previously, Doug, we've been assessing our conventional exploration strategy and really in the context of its ability to compete for capital allocation within the current portfolio, which does include, as you well stated, the North America inventory, and it must compete really on a risk adjusted return basis. And we really started this assessment some time ago. It really wasn't prompted by the current macro environment. It was really prompted by the depth and quality of the inventory that we saw in the North America resource plays. So we were a bit ahead of the curve. We've already taken the step to reduce exploration essentially by half in 2015, and we certainly see a path that will allow us to moderate that further into 2016. I also mentioned in my opening comments that we most recently withdrew from some new country entries that we just simply felt, in the current environment, did not compete for capital allocation. So when you consider the current commodity price environment, when you consider the depth of our resource inventory in North America and the limited capital to invest, it's just simply getting tougher and tougher for conventional exploration to compete for capital on a risk-adjusted basis. Back to your specific question on kind of the uptick in exploration expense, we did have a write-down in Birchwood, which is our in situ property in Canada, which contributed to that, Doug."

Well, let me maybe start with addressing what I think is more a question around maintenance capital. And I think first and foremost, Ryan, of course, the $700 million to $750 million run rate includes the full portfolio, and when we talk about maintenance capital, we tend to focus in on the resource plays themselves in aggregate. And our best estimate of CapEx required to hold those resource plays flat is around $2 billion to $2.1 billion. Of course, as capital efficiencies and productivity improvements kick in, there'll be actually downward pressure on that maintenance capital. And so when you think about looking ahead and how long could maintenance levels be sustained, my answer to that really would be that we have multiple years of high-quality, high-return resource play inventory that could ostensibly drive a maintenance-level program even in a $50 barrel WTI environment. Again, you'll recall, as I mentioned in my opening comments, that when we took a look in our most recent disclosure on our 5-year drilling inventory, over 70% of our wells were profitable at $50 barrel per WTI. So you're right, we have had this rapid deceleration from first to second quarter in our overall capital program, that $500 million that I quoted. We've now kind of settled into, I'd say, a maintenance capital mode in the resource plays. But bear in mind, riding on top of that are some of our other investments that will be a little bit more lumpy and bumpy, including -- we may even see a little bit of an up in third quarter because of some nonrecurring infrastructure investments and a few other nonrecurring items in our international portfolio. But as you look through that lumpiness in the second half of the year, that $700 million to $750 million exit rate feels about right with some plus or minus there. Your other question was around how much of some of these longer-cycle investments may run their course in 2015. And the items there that we talk about when we mentioned those are things like the work that we're doing currently on the EG compression project, which is now heavily in fabrication mode; the work that we did in the EG drilling program; the work that we did also in the U.K. drilling program. Those are the types of items that we talk about. And so when we look kind of on a net-net basis, as those kind of come off in 2016, there will be some puts and takes, but you're probably in the couple of hundred million kind of dollar range in terms of the accommodation space that, that might create within the budget."

I think, in general, I'd say we're really, really pleased with the progress broadly from the Bakken completion pilots. If you step back and look at what we've accomplished over the last several quarters, that material improvement in initial production. Now with the cumulative production of a group of wells reaching 180 days, you start to see that improvement hold up over time. We've consistently taken those new designs and applications and spread it across our entire portfolio. I would add that even as we've demonstrated these results that are kind of rearview-mirror looking, we're continuing to progress even more intensive simulations. I think we noted in the notes that this group you're looking at has 40% more proppant and about 10% more completion stages. We continue to see opportunity even beyond that for more intensity to drive those results further. I think based on the results you're seeing and referencing, there's certainly some pressure on us to look at overall EURs and talk about those, perhaps later this year provide some more color and context on that. But obviously, with more EUR, combined with the Bakken well cost trending down to plus or minus $6 million of material reduction there, I think you can see the value implication of the portfolio on Bakken from that. So again, we're very pleased with it. And by all means, we expect that momentum to continue."

But also the Bakken has continued to improve its competitiveness as well. And we'll hopefully be able to share a little bit more color on that a bit later in the year as we're able to roll in some of the specific updates on EURs and single-well economics.

So for us, it's probably a little bit less about short cycle/long cycle than it is about where can we generate the highest risk-adjusted return. And to the extent that we continue to see long cycle -- or longer-cycle opportunities -- and great examples are the things that we've done in Equatorial Guinea and the U.K. this year in terms of the program drilling that we've done there that are very strong from a capital allocation standpoint and have added very profitable barrels to the portfolio. So in no way are we necessarily turning our back on longer-cycle type investments, but the balance is going to be dictated by the opportunities that we have in the portfolio and being driven by generating those highest risk-adjusted return.

We've retained rigs with the highest specification, so the right types of capabilities that we move to in that rig fleet that can really drive it. And those unique attributes of those rigs allow us to use other types of downhole tools. The combination of those technologies together has really delivered this performance. And I would say, while 1,800 feet per day was materially better than the year-ago quarter. Our best rigs are at 2,600, 2,700 feet per day already, which shows you the gap, right, that if we can get the whole fleet to there there's still room to improve that overall.

But with equities very depressed, I think with everyone kind of reacting to another dramatic downtick in pricing, it's hard to imagine there's going to be a lot of that type of activity, at least in the near term. Now as you look further ahead and we see a more persistent kind of lower-for-longer price environment, then I think the concept that there will be additional consolidation, additional opportunities come available to those that are prepared to take advantage of those, then absolutely, I would agree with that."

You mentioned that in this price environment, capital spending would be down from the current year. You also said that even with a flat to lower budget in 2016, that the North American production component would grow. So could you just elaborate on that comment a bit? I wanted to make sure that we have that right. And really, just trying to understand that assertion and square that with our understanding that the unconventional production would exit this year below the full year average, and then on maintenance CapEx levels, you could hold that 4Q exit rate flat through '16. So just want to make sure we understand that trajectory and some of the moving parts that we might be missing."

In fact, the run rate that you mentioned as we exit 2015, kind of that $2.9 billion-ish kind of run rate, certainly less than the 3 billion barrel -- or $3 billion, that really does entail an ability to direct more capital deployment to the North America resource plays. So for a bit smaller pie, we're able to dedicate a much larger slice to the North America resource plays even in that scenario. And so the ability to have that optionality to move from more of a maintenance capital mode in the resource plays to more of a growth mode, we still have that optionality within a reduced budget in 2016.

Phil, I think you're seeing that actually very well. Compared to the previous several quarters where we've had in excess of 90 wells to sales, in the second quarter, we had 52 wells for sales, which is driving that production in the Eagle Ford downward. Really, the wave of those higher-productivity wells that are very early in their life coming down has kind of overwhelmed the number of new wells to sales. I think from a perspective of activity across North America, including Eagle Ford, has come down to about 45% for us. What you really see is we're managing that downward to a point of stability. We will have roughly the same number of wells, plus or minus, in the third and fourth quarter in Eagle Ford, specifically. In any given quarter, our working interest moves around a little bit within that, so the number of gross wells and net wells can move a bit. So I think in general, we're guiding toward relatively flat production quarter-over-quarter, and we're managing that large activity downward in the quarter. I would say, too, some context on that. Even as we said the wells to sales were lower in Eagle Ford, I think it's important to note we went from 5 frac fleets to 2 by April. So we were down to that lowest level of wells to sales-driven activity by very early in the second quarter, which kind of added to that deceleration impact."

And I'll use the East Texas, North Louisiana, Wilburton transaction as an example. We had a very strong response to the data room. We had well over 20 proposals for the property. When you look at the deal metrics, they were very compelling on a cash flow multiple basis, over 9x. And so we feel like for the right type of assets, there is still a ready market out there. And I would not want to leave the impression that we're selling anything at reduced value or low value to our shareholders. I mean, we don't view these as distressed assets. We simply view them as part of our ongoing portfolio management. And if we can't capture fair value, then we'll continue to operate. In the case of the East Texas, North Louisiana, Wilburton deal, it was a gassy asset. It was no longer competing for capital allocation, a relatively high unit cash cost.

So with 3 spacing pilots online, I feel like we've made a lot of progress at moving that forward on an operated basis, kind of start work south to north, if you will. Those are -- spacing pilots are in 3 different areas, starting in the south. It's Middle Bakken, so it's on a 6-well per Middle Bakken pattern overall. There is a wide range of results there. I think in the case of that pilot in the Ajax area, when you look at the aggregate or all of the wells on there, you'll see some above type curve, you'll see some a little below. But when you put them together, they look like they're performing very in line with our early expectations for that despite being at closer spacing than stand-alone wells. So that gives us a lot of encouragement. We expected some differentiation. In some cases, what we'll find is, when we go in and there's more than 1 parent well or older well in the area, you'll see some depletion impact in the new well that's near that older well will be impacted modestly by that. But in aggregate, we tend to look at the entire unit, how many wells, how many total dollars invested, what's the total production coming out of that. And so that Ajax pilot, for example, is performing very much in line with those expectations. Moving further north to Hector in that pilot. Again, we see a diversity of results. But in aggregate, they're performing very similarly to our expectations for the early production. Some of the wells in those groups are more mature than others. So several of those are at 90 or 120 days, and they're continuing to perform well. So we're very pleased with that result overall. And these pilots -- some of the wells, vintage-wise, had more aggressive stimulations than others based on when they were drilled and completed. And then lastly, in Myrmidon, we see a wide range there, too. I think in the case of that one pilot, we intentionally looked at that pilot and said there are 4 older parent wells between those 2 sections or units that were developed together. And so the wells near  those -- the new wells near the parent wells are showing lesser production than the wells that are further outlying, and that's not unexpected in our case. We want to test that as we have parent wellbores we need to work around. But I think in general, we're still very pleased with the overall production and continue to see that as a validation of our spacing assumptions moving forward."

Well, good morning. Thank you, Chris. Our priority this year has been exercising capital discipline, reducing cost, capturing efficiencies, progressing our noncore asset sales and protecting the balance sheet, and our most recent actions have been fully consistent with those objectives. Last Thursday, we announced a decision by the Board of the Directors to adjust our quarterly dividend from $0.21 per share to $0.05 per share. We felt that this action was prudent and the best interest of all shareholders and appropriately addresses the uncertainty of a lower-for-longer commodity price environment. It will increase annual free cash flow by more than $425 million and aligns with our priority of maintaining a strong balance sheet through the cycle. The initial capital flexibility is essential to support growth from our deep inventory of investment opportunities in the U.S. resource plays when commodity prices improve. 
Further, it is another step in the transformation of Marathon Oil from its integrated legacy to becoming a leading independent E&P company focused on capturing value in the U.S. unconventional resource plays.
Turning to the third quarter. We delivered operational results that reflected consistent execution, efficiency gains and lower costs. The third quarter capital investment in exploration program came in below expectations, down 7% sequentially to $623 million.
We've been able to reduce our 2015 program by $200 million to $3.1 billion, primarily through a combination of U.S. resource play efficiency gain and phasing of international projects.
Total company net production from continuing operations excluding Libya averaged 434,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, a 6% increase over the year ago quarter and a 7% increase over the prior quarter.
Record production from Oil Sands Mining and higher production from Equatorial Guinea contributed to the increase from the prior quarter. We're on pace to achieve the high end of our total company 2015 production growth guidance at 7% year-over-year, and U.S. resource play growth at 20%, even with the $200 million reduction to our 2015 program.
In the U.S. resource plays net production averaged 212,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, up 12% over the year ago quarter and down 4% over the prior quarter. Our quarterly variance was driven primarily by lower sequential production from the Eagle Ford, due to timing of well to sales late in the third quarter and step-out in delineation drilling test. Our asset teams target the right balance of high-confidence development activity and continued resource delineation that positions us for growth as we look through the current cycle. In the case of the Eagle Ford this quarter, the team was focused on development drilling in core Karnes County, while also testing the limits of delineated acreage. 
We had another quarter of solid reduction and completed well cost, faster feet per day drill and more frac stages completed per month. We also previously announced additions to Eagle Ford 2P resource of 165 million oil equivalent barrels driven by the Upper Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk.
Though our operated Oklahoma Resource Basin's program is still dominated by leasehold activity, we bought our first SCOOP Woodford downspacing pilot online late in the third quarter. Early results are in line with our type curve and supportive of 107-acre spacing. Importantly, the learning curve improvement as we drilled and completed the wells illustrate the potential for Oklahoma to become significantly more efficient when we move into development mode. During the quarter, we announced a 35% increase in SCOOP and STACK 2P resource, adding 400 million oil equivalent barrels.
The Bakken team had an exciting quarter despite reduced completion activity, delivering 61,000 net oil equivalent barrels per day, in line with second quarter volumes. Results were driven by continued outperformance from the Doll pad wells in West Myrmidon, enhanced uptime as well as consistent performance from our 3 downspacing pilots. The team continue to aggressively attack cost, lowering direct expense in the quarter from a variety of factors, reduce water handling cost and contract services, getting more of our product on pipelines and greater efficiency gains from workover rigs.
International production and sales volumes were higher in the quarter primarily as a result of the performance of the new Alba C-21 well, the EG wire-line intervention program and high operational availability. The EG compression project achieved mechanical completion during the third quarter, and is preparing for transportation from the Netherlands to site. Installation and startup is set for mid-2016. 
Oil Sands Mining reported outstanding operational results in the third quarter, recording the highest level of production in the history of the asset as well as the lowest operating cost ever per synthetic barrels. These results were driven by increased reliability and uptime as well as an intense focus on reducing cost. We made great strides so far this year focusing on those elements of the business of that we control by reducing activity levels and capturing capital efficiencies. We've also reduced total company E&P production expenses and G&A cost excluding special items by about $136 million or 28% for third quarter 2015 compared to the same quarter in 2014. Similarly, on a year-to-date basis, the savings amount to over $290 million, over 20%. Drilling efficiency remains a focus across our U.S. unconventional plays with our best Eagle Ford rig drilling a well that averaged 3,000 feet per day in the third quarter, similar to the exceptional pace and our performance in the previous quarter. This performance was achieved while maintaining our geo-steering accuracy to land in the target window, 98% of the time. 
Our other 2 areas, the Bakken and Oklahoma Resource Basins also continue to show sustained improvements in their drilling efficiency.
Portfolio management ranged front and center, and we continue to make progress advancing our plan at divesting at least $500 million of noncore assets. What we've identified for sale are non-core E&P and Midstream asset, operator and non-operated, and simply do not compete for capital today, given the depth and breadth of our inventory in the U.S. resource plays, and will likely have higher value in someone else's portfolio.
During the quarter, we announced our strategic intent to scale back our conventional exploration business as the success of our U.S. resource play has continued to raise the bar for capital allocation. Commensurate with this decision, we signed an agreement to divest our exploration acreage in East Africa.
Last week, we provided initial guidance on our 2016 capital investment and exploration program as we continue to progress through the planning process with the overarching goal of living within our means next year inclusive of dividend and noncore asset sales.
Based on our current outlook and preliminary plan discussions, we would anticipate a total company 2016 program of up to $2.2 billion, which would give us the flexibility to deliver 2016 annual average production in the U.S. resource plays flat to 2015 exit rate. This represents a significant reduction from our $3.1 billion program in 2015, but at least 3 quarters of our 2016 program is expected to be directed towards the U.S. resource plays, which is also our highest risk-adjusted returns. We expect our 2016 budget to be approved by the Board of Directors later this year.
There's no doubt that the macro environment continues to challenge the industry. But one thing remains clear, Marathon Oil, is not opportunity limited. We are profitable inventory even in a lower-for-longer commodity price scenario as lower cost, capital efficiency and enhanced productivity continue to reduce breakeven prices and improve our economics.
Our priority remains balance sheet strength and capital flexibility in 2016. And we have a workforce that is responding to the challenge and positioning our company for success today and through the cycle.
I want to pause and personally thank and recognize our dedicated employees and contractors who continue to execute and deliver results while protecting our license to operate each and every day despite the distractions and uncertainties of the current environment.
With that, I'll hand it back to Chris to begin the Q&A."

Very good. Well, thanks, and good morning, Doug. Of course, our decision around the adjustment and the dividend, one of the aspects of that was in fact the capital flexibility that it provides as we think about driving more allocation into the resource plays as we see more constructive pricing. But as we think about where that first incremental capital may be directed, by the way, I think about it as it's going to be driven by economics, which today says that capital would be targeted toward incremental activity in both the Eagle Ford as well as ultimately Oklahoma, expanding our operated program in Oklahoma. In terms of the noncore assets question, maybe let me step back and just address that in general, first and foremost. We have high confidence in our $500 million target that we have put out on the noncore assets. We have before shared that we have, in fact, closed the earlier announced deal in East Texas, North Louisiana. We have many of those opportunities in process today, and continue to feel that there is a market out there for the right type of assets. So our confidence in that remains very high. There well, no doubt, the implications as we are successful in those transactions from a capital avoidance standpoint,point but it's probably bit premature to get into those numbers until we actually are able to execute deals."

Is there a -- and we've heard these questions asked other places, is there a rationale to keep that flat because of the challenges of recovering once oil prices come up and you start drilling more in terms of fighting decline curves? Or should we think of it as in a $45 to $50 oil environment, that really is a reasonable way to invest in terms of just the returns of those wells today?"

Our priorities this year have been exercising capital discipline, reducing cost, capturing efficiencies, progressing our noncore asset sales and protecting the balance sheet. And our most recent actions have been fully consistent with those objectives. Last Thursday, we announced a decision by the Board of the Directors to adjust our quarterly dividend from $0.21 per share to $0.05 per share. We felt that this action was prudent and the best interest of all shareholders and appropriately addresses the uncertainty of a lower-for-longer commodity price environment. It will increase annual free cash flow by more than $425 million and aligns with our priority of maintaining a strong balance sheet through the cycle. The initial capital flexibility is essential to support growth from our deep inventory of investment opportunities in the U.S. resource plays when commodity prices improve. 
Further, it is another step in the transformation of Marathon Oil from its integrated legacy to becoming a leading independent E&P company focused on capturing value in the U.S. unconventional resource plays.
Turning to the third quarter. We delivered operational results that reflected consistent execution, efficiency gains and lower costs. The third quarter capital, investment and exploration program came in below expectations, down 7% sequentially to $623 million.
We've been able to reduce our 2015 program by $200 million to $3.1 billion, primarily through a combination of U.S. resource play efficiency gains and phasing in international projects.
Total company net production from continuing operations, excluding Libya, averaged 434,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, a 6% increase over the year ago quarter and a 7% increase over the prior quarter.
Record production from Oil Sands Mining and higher production from Equatorial Guinea contributed to the increase from the prior quarter. We're on pace to achieve the high end of our total company 2015 production growth guidance at 7% year-over-year, and U.S. resource play growth at 20%, even with the $200 million reduction to our 2015 program.
In the U.S. resource play, net production averaged 212,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, up 10% over the year ago quarter and down 4% over the prior quarter. Our quarterly variance was driven primarily by lower sequential production from the Eagle Ford, due to timing of well to sales late in the third quarter and step-out in delineation drilling test. Our asset teams target the right balance of high-confidence development activity and continued resource delineation that positions us for growth as we look through the current cycle. In the case of the Eagle Ford this quarter, the team was focused on development drilling in core Karnes County, while also testing the limits of delineated acreage. 
We had another quarter of solid reductions and completed well cost, faster feet per day drilled and more frac stages completed per month. We also previously announced additions to Eagle Ford 2P resource of 165 million oil equivalent barrels, driven by the Upper Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk.
Though our operated Oklahoma Resource Basin's program is still dominated by leasehold activity, we brought our first SCOOP Woodford downspacing pilot online late in the third quarter. Early results are in line with our type curve and supportive of 107-acre spacing. Importantly, the learning curve improvement, as we drilled and completed the wells, illustrate the potential for Oklahoma to become significantly more efficient when we move to development mode. 
During the quarter, we announced a 35% increase in SCOOP and STACK 2P resource, adding 400 million oil equivalent barrels.
The Bakken team had an outstanding quarter despite reduced completion activity, delivering 61,000 net oil equivalent barrels per day, in line with second quarter volumes. Results were driven by continued outperformance from the Doll Pad wells in West Myrmidon, enhanced uptime as well as consistent performance from our 3 downspacing pilots. The team continue to aggressively attack costs, lowering direct expense in the quarter from a variety of factors: reduce water handling cost and contract services, getting more of our product on pipelines and greater efficiency gains from workover rigs.
International productions and sales volumes were higher in the quarter, primarily as a result of the performance of the new Alba C-21 well, the EG wire-line intervention program and high operational availability. The EG compression project achieved mechanical completion during the third quarter and is preparing for transportation from the Netherlands to site. Installation and startup is set for mid-2016. 
Oil Sands Mining reported outstanding operational results in the third quarter, recording the highest level of production in the history of the asset as well as the lowest operating cost ever per synthetic barrels. These results were driven by increased reliability and uptime as well as an intense focus on reducing cost. We made great strides so far this year focusing on those elements of the business that we control by reducing activity levels and capturing capital efficiencies. We've also reduced total company E&P production expenses and G&A cost, excluding special items, by about $136 million or 28% for third quarter 2015 compared to the same quarter in 2014. Similarly, on a year-to-date basis, the savings amount to over $290 million, over 20%. Drilling efficiency remained a focus across our U.S. unconventional plays with our best Eagle Ford rig drilling a well that averaged 3,000 feet per day in the third quarter, similar to the exceptional pacesetter performance in the previous quarter. This performance was achieved while maintaining our geo-steering accuracy to land in the target window, 98% of the time. 
Our other 2 areas, the Bakken and Oklahoma Resource Basins also continue to show sustained improvement in their drilling efficiency.
Portfolio management ranged front and center, and we continue to make progress advancing our plan at divesting at least $500 million of noncore assets. What we've identified for sale are noncore E&P and midstream asset operated and nonoperated that simply do not compete for capital today, given the depth and breadth of our inventory in the U.S. resource plays and will likely have higher value in someone else's portfolio.
During the quarter, we announced our strategic intent to scale back our conventional exploration business as the success of our U.S. resource play has continued to raise the bar for capital allocation. Commensurate with this decision, we signed an agreement to divest our exploration acreage in East Africa.
Last week, we provided initial guidance on our 2016 capital investment and exploration program, as we continue to progress through the planning process with the overarching goal of living within our means next year inclusive of dividend and noncore asset sales.
Based on our current outlook and preliminary plan discussions, we would anticipate a total company 2016 program of up to $2.2 billion, which would give us the flexibility to deliver 2016 annual average production in the U.S. resource plays flat to 2015 exit rate. This represents a significant reduction from our $3.1 billion program in 2015, but at least 3 quarters of our 2016 program is expected to be directed toward the U.S. resource play which offer our highest risk-adjusted returns. We expect our 2016 budget to be approved by the Board of Directors later this year.
There is no doubt that the macro environment continues to challenge the industry. But one thing remains clear, Marathon Oil is not opportunity limited. We have profitable inventory even in a lower-for-longer commodity price scenario. At lower cost, capital efficiency and enhanced productivity continue to reduce breakeven prices and improve our economics.
Our priority remains balance sheet strength and capital flexibility in 2016. And we have a workforce that is responding to the challenge and positioning our company for success today and through the cycle.
I want to pause and personally thank and recognize our dedicated employees and contractors who continue to execute and deliver results while protecting our license to operate each and every day despite the distractions and uncertainties of the current environment.
With that, I'll hand it back to Chris to begin the Q&A."

Very good. Well, thanks, and good morning, Doug. Of course, our decision around the adjustment and the dividend, one of the aspects of that was in fact the capital flexibility that it provides as we think about driving more allocation into the resource plays as we see more constructive pricings. But as we think about where that first incremental capital may be directed, the way I think about it is it's going to be driven by economics, which today says that capital would be targeted toward incremental activity in both the Eagle Ford as well as ultimately Oklahoma, expanding our operated program in Oklahoma. In terms of the noncore asset question, maybe let me step back and just address that in general, first and foremost. We have high confidence in our $500 million target that we have put out on the noncore assets. We have fore shared that we have, in fact, closed the earlier announced deal in East Texas, North Louisiana. We have many of those opportunities in process today, and continue to feel that there is a market out there for the right type of assets. So our confidence in that remains very high. There well, no doubt, the implications as we are successful in those transactions from a capital avoidance standpoint, but it's probably a bit premature to get into those numbers until we actually are able to execute deals."

One is, of course, Equatorial Guinea, which will largely be flat x the downtime that I just addressed. Two, Oil Sands Mining, which will have largely again a flat profile ex-planned maintenance and turnarounds. We do have some other North America onshore assets that will have relatively shallow declines, and then, of course -- and our conventional Guam and mature U.K. businesses, which albeit relatively small volumes. We'd expect those to have typical mature declines. So as you put that overlay on it, I just want to try to give a feel for what volumes might feel like in their totality in 2016."

Our priorities this year have been exercising capital discipline, reducing cost, capturing efficiencies, progressing our noncore asset sales and protecting the balance sheet. And our most recent actions have been fully consistent with those objectives. Last Thursday, we announced a decision by the Board of the Directors to adjust our quarterly dividend from $0.21 per share to $0.05 per share. We felt that this action was prudent and the best interest of all shareholders and appropriately addresses the uncertainty of a lower-for-longer commodity price environment. It will increase annual free cash flow by more than $425 million and aligns with our priority of maintaining a strong balance sheet through the cycle. The initial capital flexibility is essential to support growth from our deep inventory of investment opportunities in the U.S. resource plays when commodity prices improve. 
Further, it is another step in the transformation of Marathon Oil from its integrated legacy to becoming a leading independent E&P company focused on capturing value in the U.S. unconventional resource plays.
Turning to the third quarter. We delivered operational results that reflected consistent execution, efficiency gains and lower costs. The third quarter capital, investment and exploration program came in below expectations, down 7% sequentially to $623 million.
We've been able to reduce our 2015 program by $200 million to $3.1 billion, primarily through a combination of U.S. resource play efficiency gains and phasing of international projects.
Total company net production from continuing operations, excluding Libya, averaged 434,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, a 6% increase over the year ago quarter and a 7% increase over the prior quarter.
Record production from Oil Sands Mining and higher production from Equatorial Guinea contributed to the increase from the prior quarter. We're on pace to achieve the high end of our total company 2015 production growth guidance at 7% year-over-year, and U.S. resource play growth at 20%, even with the $200 million reduction to our 2015 program.
In the U.S. resource play, net production averaged 212,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, up 10% over the year ago quarter and down 4% over the prior quarter. Our quarterly variance was driven primarily by lower sequential production from the Eagle Ford, due to timing of well to sales late in the third quarter and step-out in delineation drilling tests. Our asset teams target the right balance of high-confidence development activity and continued resource delineation that positions us for growth as we look through the current cycle. In the case of the Eagle Ford this quarter, the team was focused on development drilling in core Karnes County, while also testing the limits of delineated acreage. 
We had another quarter of solid reductions and completed well cost, faster feet per day drilled and more frac stages completed per month. We also previously announced additions to Eagle Ford 2P resource of 165 million oil equivalent barrels, driven by the Upper Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk.
Though our operated Oklahoma Resource Basin's program is still dominated by leasehold activity, we brought our first SCOOP Woodford downspacing pilot online late in the third quarter. Early results are in line with our type curve and supportive of 107-acre spacing. Importantly, the learning curve improvement, as we drilled and completed the wells, illustrate the potential for Oklahoma to become significantly more efficient when we move to development mode. 
During the quarter, we announced a 35% increase in SCOOP and STACK 2P resource, adding 400 million oil equivalent barrels.
The Bakken team had an outstanding quarter despite reduced completion activity, delivering 61,000 net oil equivalent barrels per day, in line with second quarter volumes. Results were driven by continued outperformance from the Doll Pad wells in West Myrmidon, enhanced uptime as well as consistent performance from our 3 downspacing pilots. The team continued to aggressively attack costs, lowering direct expense in the quarter from a variety of factors: reduce water handling cost and contract services, getting more of our product on pipelines and greater efficiency gains from workover rigs.
International productions and sales volumes were higher in the quarter, primarily as a result of the performance of the new Alba C-21 well, the EG wire-line intervention program and high operational availability. The EG compression project achieved mechanical completion during the third quarter and is preparing for transportation from the Netherlands to site. Installation and startup is set for mid-2016. 
Oil Sands Mining reported outstanding operational results in the third quarter, recording the highest level of production in the history of the asset as well as the lowest operating cost ever per synthetic barrel. These results were driven by increased reliability and uptime as well as an intense focus on reducing cost. We made great strides so far this year focusing on those elements of the business that we control by reducing activity levels and capturing capital efficiencies. We've also reduced total company E&P production expenses and G&A cost, excluding special items, by about $136 million or 28% for third quarter 2015 compared to the same quarter in 2014. Similarly, on a year-to-date basis, the savings amount to over $290 million, over 20%. Drilling efficiency remained a focus across our U.S. unconventional plays with our best Eagle Ford rig drilling a well that averaged 3,000 feet per day in the third quarter, similar to the exceptional pacesetter performance in the previous quarter. This performance was achieved while maintaining our geo-steering accuracy to land in the target window, 98% of the time. 
Our other 2 areas, the Bakken and Oklahoma Resource Basins also continue to show sustained improvement in their drilling efficiency.
Portfolio management ranged front and center, and we continue to make progress advancing our plan at divesting at least $500 million of noncore assets. What we've identified for sale are noncore E&P and midstream asset operated and nonoperated that simply do not compete for capital today, given the depth and breadth of our inventory in the U.S. resource plays and will likely have higher value in someone else's portfolio.
During the quarter, we announced our strategic intent to scale back our conventional exploration business as the success of our U.S. resource play has continued to raise the bar for capital allocation. Commensurate with this decision, we signed an agreement to divest our exploration acreage in East Africa.
Last week, we provided initial guidance on our 2016 capital investment and exploration program, as we continue to progress through the planning process with the overarching goal of living within our means next year inclusive of dividend and noncore asset sales.
Based on our current outlook and preliminary plan discussions, we would anticipate a total company 2016 program of up to $2.2 billion, which would give us the flexibility to deliver 2016 annual average production in the U.S. resource plays flat to 2015 exit rate. This represents a significant reduction from our $3.1 billion program in 2015, but at least 3 quarters of our 2016 program is expected to be directed toward the U.S. resource play which offer our highest risk-adjusted returns. We expect our 2016 budget to be approved by the Board of Directors later this year.
There is no doubt that the macro environment continues to challenge the industry. But one thing remains clear, Marathon Oil is not opportunity limited. We have profitable inventory even in a lower-for-longer commodity price scenario. At lower costs, capital efficiency and enhanced productivity continue to reduce breakeven prices and improve our economics.
Our priority remains balance sheet strength and capital flexibility in 2016. And we have a workforce that is responding to the challenge and positioning our company for success today and through the cycle.
I want to pause and personally thank and recognize our dedicated employees and contractors who continue to execute and deliver results while protecting our license to operate each and every day despite the distractions and uncertainties of the current environment.
With that, I'll hand it back to Chris to begin the Q&A."

Very good. Well, thanks, and good morning, Doug. Of course, our decision around the adjustment and the dividend, one of the aspects of that was in fact the capital flexibility that it provides as we think about driving more allocation into the resource plays as we see more constructive pricing. But as we think about where that first incremental capital may be directed, the way I think about it is it's going to be driven by economics, which today says that capital would be targeted toward incremental activity in both the Eagle Ford as well as ultimately Oklahoma, expanding our operated program in Oklahoma. In terms of the noncore asset question, maybe let me step back and just address that in general, first and foremost. We have high confidence in our $500 million target that we have put out on the noncore assets. We have fore shared that we have, in fact, closed the earlier announced deal in East Texas, North Louisiana. We have many of those opportunities in process today, and continue to feel that there is a market out there for the right type of assets. So our confidence in that remains very high. There will, no doubt, be implications as we are successful in those transactions from a capital avoidance standpoint, but it's probably a bit premature to get into those numbers until we actually are able to execute deals."

But when you think about it from a total company perspective, given that we have provided direct guidance on the resource play, I'd like to think about it and really a few kind of large buckets. One is, of course, Equatorial Guinea, which will largely be flat x the downtime that I just addressed. Two, Oil Sands Mining, which will have largely again a flat profile ex-planned maintenance and turnarounds. We do have some other North America onshore assets that will have relatively shallow declines, and then, of course -- and our conventional Guam and mature U.K. businesses, which albeit relatively small volumes.

Similarly, maybe perhaps best illustrated by the Smith pilot that was in our earnings deck, we also expect that more mature development cycle as it unfolds for us to really be able to materially impact the capital cost. I think that example we're down 33% from the front-end to the back-end of that pad is emblematic of what we expect on a full-cycle basis.

I think one of the things we've seen, David, over the balance of this year is we continue to get more and more efficient overall both on the completion cycle and in the drilling cycle. I think we've illustrated that in the deck. And we continue to avoid building an inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells. So what you're seeing is us manage as we get more efficient with those rigs and if we do it at lower cost, we have more opportunity to invest. We're just managing that inventory in an efficient operational basis overall. No intent to build inventory or to deplete it. We want to keep it relatively constant, and so we're managing that actively, David."

I think as we're working through this early part of the Meramec. It's important to realize that we're focusing primarily on leasehold drilling, so we're covering a diverse area of several counties to convert these term leases to held by production. We expect to see some diversity in those early well results. We're still working on the best designs and the completion and how we manage those wells in their early days. So I think while our results aren't or perhaps as much as we desired, we expected this diversity, it's early days. We're excited about seeing the continued momentum in the basin. The IPs continue to get better. The productivity is improving overall. And importantly, the cost improvements over the last year have been very material. And on top of that, you've seen us continue to be opportunistic in adding acres in this area at attractive pricing because we continue to see this as a great place to invest in the future."

I did get on the call a little bit late. In the unconventionals, when you announced the dividend reduction, the initial CapEx for '16, the expectation to U.S. unconventionals could be flattish, I think, is the right way to think about it in '16 with the '15 exit rate. Is there a -- and we've heard these questions asked other places, is there a rationale to keep that flat because of the challenges of recovering once oil prices come up and you start drilling more in terms of fighting decline curves? Or should we think of it as in a $45 to $50 oil environment, that really is a reasonable way to invest in terms of just the returns of those wells today?"
