While we were pleased to have met expectations for earnings per share for the first quarter, we were certainly disappointed with our top line performance. Total revenue was flat for the quarter versus a yea",839,"Thank you, Kristi, and good afternoon, everyone. While we were pleased to have met expectations for earnings per share for the first quarter, we were certainly disappointed with our top line performance. Total revenue was flat for the quarter versus a year ago driven by portion pack growth that was offset by lower brewer and accessory sales. Continued softness in our traditional coffee business was also a contributing factor as well as a negative impact from currency and the timing of some significant orders that got pulled into Q4 versus Q1 due to our SAP implementation, Excluding FX and the impact of the SAP pre-ordering, our core Keurig Beverage System revenue grew 5% in the quarter. 
While Fran will detail the year-over-year drivers, the reason our revenue was essentially flat versus year ago was brewers. Although we shipped 4.3 million brewers in the quarter, we were down about 600,000 year-over-year. Now approximately 400,000 of that decline were the MINI Plus brewers. While we did plan for some MINI decline given the low promotional price points last year, this result was lower than our expectations due in part to the voluntary product recall executed in the quarter.  The remainder of the decline from last year was the Vue brewer which, of course, we anticipated. 
In terms of our revenue performance versus our outlook, gap was about $100 million also driven primarily by brewers and to a lesser extent, portion packs. 
Let me first address brewers. While our 1.0 and 2. U.S. brewer shipments grew by 6% versus the prior year, we expected that growth rate to be meaningfully higher. Quite simply, our 2.0 launch got off to a slower start than we planned to due to a few important factors. First, our efforts to get new packs transitioned on to retail shelves and into homes did not move quickly enough. There was also confusion among consumers as to whether the 2.0 would still brew all of their favorite brands. These issues impacted consumer perception of the 2.0 and led to lower-than-expected brewer ratings early on. While consumer confusion has begun to subside and ratings have improved, the effect weighed on brewer sales during the key holiday season. 
The other driver of the brewer revenue shortfall was impact of the voluntary product recall we took on certain models of our MINI Plus brewers. Replacing any product that has been removed from retailer shelf is an involved process, and cost us significant revenue in the first quarter. We expect that impact to continue in the second quarter. 
Portion packs also contributed to the revenue shortfall as the mix impact across branded channels was greater than expected. Volumes were also impacted by softer-than-expected brewer sales because consumers typically stock their pantry when they first buy a brewer. Additionally, revenues were impacted by inventory reductions across retail as takeaway exceeded shipments in the quarter for portion packs. 
Finally, the SAP transition required consolidation of the legacy Green Mountain and Keurig websites. We experienced several transition issues during the key holiday season, which impacted channel mix for both portion packs and brewers. Our direct channel produces higher revenues typically and a loss of those sales hit disproportionately.
Moving on from revenues. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.88 in the quarter, which was at high end of our guidance range we laid out in the fourth quarter call. This came despite significant investment in Keurig cold and other platforms and foreign exchange that was worse than expected. 
As we look at the quarter, the issues impacting our results are transitory and part of a complex product transition that we knew would be challenging. We are confident in our strategy and are proceeding resolutely as we continue to see strong growth prospects for the Keurig hot system. Specifically, we expect our U.S. At Home installed base to grow in the mid-teens this year. And we believe we have a long runway for growth in the hot system as we continue to target the 70 million households that use a coffee maker daily. Single serve household penetration in the U.S. is still well below the 40-plus percent levels seen in other developed countries such as Portugal, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Belgium. Combined with our forthcoming cold system, we feel even more confident in the ability of the Keurig brand to be a leading player in the growing trend to offer premium beverage systems at home. 
Our strong balance sheet is also an advantage because it enables us to invest in organic growth and return significant share to shareholders. We ended the quarter with over $600 million in cash and other current cash assets. We have a dividend that has grown over time. And as at the end of the first quarter, we had $1.1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. And as market conditions warrant, we will be very active with our share repurchase during the coming quarters. 
I'll now turn the call over to Fran to discuss the first quarter financial results in greater detail."
334622,282560814,754889,"Keurig Green Mountain, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2015",2015-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian. For the first quarter, we generated net sales of $1.4 billion, flat with the prior year quarter and up 1% excluding currency impact. As previously discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, certain retailer customers ordered portion pac",827,"Thanks, Brian. For the first quarter, we generated net sales of $1.4 billion, flat with the prior year quarter and up 1% excluding currency impact. As previously discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, certain retailer customers ordered portion packs more aggressively in the fourth quarter in advance of our fiscal year-end SAP implementation. We estimate that this pre-ordering negatively impacted first quarter 2015 net sales growth by approximately 3 percentage points. Excluding foreign currency and SAP, total net sales grew 4% and core Keurig Beverage System net sales grew 5% in the quarter. 
For the quarter, brewer and accessory net sales declined 18%. Brewer volume declined 12%. As Brian referenced earlier, the Vue and MINI brewers alone accounted for the full volume decline in the quarter. 
Brewer net price realization declined by 8 percentage points, and there were 3 percentage points of positive mix. Price realization was impacted by weakness in our brewer promotional strategy, which did not yield the sales we expected. 
Portion pack sales was 9% with 13% increase in volume and 2 percentage points of pricing, offset by 6 percentage points of negative mix and a roughly 1 percentage point unfavorable impact on currency. Portion pack volumes for this quarter came in slightly below our expectations, particularly in December, due to a number of factors: first, lower brewer unit sales; Second, the impact of what we believe to be a higher percentage of trade-ups from 1.0 to 2.0 brewers than anticipated. Typically, when consumers trade up, the already have portion packs at home, thus, resulting in less portion pack takeaway at the time of the brewer purchase. And third, retailer inventory introductions in the quarter also impacted volume. 
In addition to volumes, greater-than-expected negative mix impact portion pack net sale. As we continue to add previously unlicensed portion packs to the Keurig system, we are seeing more fluctuations in mix. In addition, the weakness in our digital channel that Brian referenced earlier, strong promotions by some of our partner brands and the lower volumes related to purchases ahead of our SAP implementation, all were a drag on portion pack mix in the quarter. 
We did take a portion pack price increase in early November on brands that we sell into retail. Many retailers did not fully pass through the price increase for the quarter, although we are seeing signs of increases in the marketplace in January. 
Next, we are achieving positive price realization from our customers, but it is too early to tell how customer elasticities are impacting the category. 
Additionally, accessory net sales declined 15% in the quarter. Net sales of other products decreased 17% in the quarter due to continued headwinds in traditional package coffee and bulk coffee formats. 
If we break down results regionally. For the quarter, our U.S. business had revenue growth of 2% while our Canadian business declined 12%. Excluding the impact of currency, the Canadian business declined 6% for the quarter. The revenue performance in Canada is primarily due to weaker brewer sales where the impact of unlicensed pack -- packs in the marketplace led to slower consumer adoption of the Keurig 2.0 brewer. 
Moving on to a review of gross profit. For the quarter, our gross margin was flat year-over-year at 33.5% of net sales. This was largely driven by benefits from a shift in sales mix between brewers and portion packs versus prior year, supply chain productivity and an increase in price realization on portion packs. This was offset by lower brewer pricing, higher costs on the Vue brewers and negative portion pack mix. Today's press release includes a table that outlines the changes in gross margin.
Turning to operating results. Non-GAAP SG&A increased by 4% in the quarter. As a percentage of sales, non-GAAP SG&A increased by 60 basis points to 17% of sales as we continued to invest in R&D ahead of our Keurig cold a launch later this year.  Our non-GAAP operating profit declined 4% for the quarter, reflecting lower-than-expected sales growth and continued investment in new products and platforms. 
Our first quarter tax rate of 35.7% was slightly above our guidance of 35% to 35.5%, but was favorable to our prior year tax rate of 36.6%. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.88 came in at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP EPS, excluding dilution from 2014 equity transactions and foreign exchange, was $0.98. Foreign exchange and dilution impact on EPS were each $0.01 above our guidance at $0.03 and $0.07, respectively.
Turning to the balance sheet and free cash flow. As Brian mentioned, our net cash position at quarter's end was over $300 million, and we generated free cash flow of $42 million for the quarter. At the end of the first quarter, inventory was slightly higher versus a year ago driven by finished goods inventory and brewers. We are taking decisive steps to address the higher brewer-level inventory. 
At this point, I'd like to turn the call back to Brian."

We're actively addressing the issues that affected revenue during the key holiday season, and we're making changes that we believe will get our hot system back on the growth track. 
First, let me discuss brewers. Our research tells us that consumers who are new to the Keurig system are very, very happy with their 2.0 purchase. But we simply did not reach enough of them during the quarter as early low ratings deterred sales. We also note that 80% of 1-star reviews from the August through December period came from consumers who cited non-compatibility of packs as a reason for their rating. 
These issues are clearly interrelated, and we're active in our efforts to clear up any lingering confusion consumers have over the portion pack issue. This includes better education to the point of purchase, improved inbox communication and continued exceptional service when people call our customer care center. We believe these actions are already improving our reviews and ratings and that should discuss stronger interest among new and current households.  The compatibility issue should continue to subside over the remainder of the year as we execute these enhancements and integrate additional formerly unlicensed brands such as community coffee, into our system over the coming months and continue to add new brands to our system. 
As an aside, on the topic of unlicensed. The reason our partners have come to us and stayed with us is because of our history of innovation, the strong consumer passion for our Keurig brand and their confidence in the strength of our future pipeline. We know we need to continually earn their trust through our ongoing innovation efforts. We enjoy MINI strong long-term partnerships with the brands in our system, and we expect to welcome even more brands in over the short and long term. In fact, we have a series of innovations coming that will continue to give consumers greater choice and benefits in our 2.0 system, ultimately making it even more appealing to both our customers and our partners. Other areas where we plan to impact brewer sales include rounding out the portfolio and appealing to more consumer segments. 
In April, we will begin shipping the new K200 brewer, which offers our new 2.0 system to consumers who prefer a slimmer design, a smaller footprint, vibrant color choices and a lower price point. This will be our entry-level reservoir brewer, and we expect it will bring new users into the system. 
As you know, the way consumers shop today is undergoing major transformation. To align with the changes we are seeing in the marketplace, particularly with a younger demographic, we are testing a number of unique Keurig system shopping and pricing models. They're designed to make it even more appealing for a broader segment of consumers to join the Keurig system. Today, these models are being tested online in our Keurig choice program that allows consumers to join Keurig for a monthly fee over a defined time period, a subscription-like model.  We are also exploring these types of models with retailers as they explore omni-channel opportunities to improve customer engagement. 
Lastly, on the heels of the voluntary action we took certain MINI Plus brewers last quarter, we have resumed filling orders on the MINI. 
Beyond the plan we have for brewer sales, we are also looking to improve our overall system marketing. To that end, we have recently hired Mark as our first Chief Marketing Officer. Mark comes us with a strong CPG background and will be leading our efforts to elevate our brand in digital marketing. Initially, he will be focused on delivering the message of the wide variety and choice that the Keurig system provides. And this includes a portfolio now of approximately 70 brands and almost 500 of the finest coffees, teas, cocoas and food and beverages by spring. 
Our marketing efforts will also support our rollout of new sizes and variety of portion packs, including 9 additional varieties of K-Carafe packs in the spring. Also in the spring, we will launch our new K-mug line of coffees on keurig.com, which will brew between 12 and 18 ounces, to be followed by coffee launch at retail. 
In all, we will work hard to improve our communication on how the Keurig system offers extensive variety and choice. We will be refining our marketing efforts in other way to drive portion. Will begin to introduce new packaging in the spring across our own to coffee brands, including the entire Green Mountain line with updated branding and graphics. Our new packaging template has tested well with stronger purchase intent and shelf visibility scores. We're also furthering our efforts in store with improved point of purchased material. 
Finally,, we're focused on growing our digital business and our redoubling our efforts to improve website performance and develop meaningful programs to drive this channel, as consumers shift more and more of their purchases online. 
Now let me move on to one  of our most important objectives for 2015, which is the introduction of Keurig cold to North American consumers. Our plans are progressing well, and we're on track to launch this fall. Our partners, Coca-Cola Company and the Dr Pepper Snapple Group, are working closely with us in virtually all aspects of the Keurig cold system in preparation for launch. I'd like to give you an update of where we stand in terms of 4 key work streams for this new launch: the appliance, the parts, the brand and the marketplace launch. 
With respect to appliance development, the process began with developing and testing an initial design. Next came a more refined theories of engineering builds of the appliance and home use tests which are currently underway. that comes in from the testing, is used to fine-tune particular aspects of the appliance.  After the final engineering build, we move to begin the scale of production capacity. The first manufacturing line for our cold appliances is currently up and running, producing at pilot rates. 
With respect to the , we have finalized the design and develop great period and techniques to manufacture the pods on high-speed lines. The first lines have been installed and are being qualified in our Williston, Vermont cold facility. The first line will be producing live pods in March and will be followed by the second line which will production in the summer.  Also construction our new cold pod plant in Georgia is on track with the plan expected to open this summer. 
From a beverage standpoint, Keurig cold will launch with 30 beverage varieties across 16 brands, including carbonated soft drinks, craft sodas, iced teas, sports drinks, seltzers and flavored waters. the following spring, we expect the Keurig cold system will offer more than 60 varieties and more than 28 brands. As we said before, Keurig cold will be able to a branded system and we expect to add new partners in the future. 
Finally,, let me discuss the marketplace launch. We're in the final stages of developing the positioning and packaging an overall Friday of our Keurig system. We continue to refine launch strategy and marketing plans, and we're working closely with our partners and retail customers to do so. As we've stated before, the long-term growth potential for Keurig cold both in North America and globally is significant. Keurig cold will empower consumers to create a wide variety of fresh great testing beverages at the bottom in their home. 
Finally, I am very happy to announce that we will preview the Keurig cold system for investors in May. Details of this invitation-only event will be forthcoming in the next few weeks. 
Now let me pass the call back to Fran for our outlook. Fran?"

We expect effective tax rate to be in the 36% to 37% range. 
Our second quarter revenue will be impacted by several factors. First, while we are working to improve brewer trends, we expect brewer revenues to decline as volumes are expected to be down in the mid-20% range, as retails sell through inventory levels and we lap a difficult volume comparison of 29% in the prior year quarter. Based on our forecast, which includes the launch of our K200 brewer, we expect our brewer inventories to remain near current levels until the third quarter. 
Second, with respect to portion packs, we expect revenue growth trends to be similar to what we saw in the first quarter.  Finally, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact revenue growth by our profit 2 percentage points. 
Our second quarter EPS guidance is impacted by the following factors: We expect brewers to be a smaller percentage of mix versus prior year period, which will positively impact margin. However, this will be partially offset by higher 2.0 brewer costs as compared to the 1.0 brewers. Commodities become a headwind; continued investment in Keurig cold and other new platforms; we begin to lap the Coca-Cola equity transaction mid-second quarter. Foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.07. And finally, we expect an approximate $0.08 dilutive impact due to the Coca-Cola and Lavazza equity transaction. Next, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and dilution, we expect EPS growth in the high single to low double-digit range despite significant investments.
Moving to our full year guidance. For fiscal 2015, we now expect net sales growth in the mid-single to high single digits over fiscal 2014. We are also revising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to mid-single-digit growth due to a greater negative impact from foreign exchange, which we now estimate at $0.15 versus $0.04 in our previous guidance. 
Our EPS guidance continues to imply a mid-teens operating profit growth rate for our core North American hot business. Our revenue estimate reflects a negative 2 percentage point impact from foreign exchange, a 1-point headwind due to lapping the benefit of retailer pre-ordering ahead of the year-end SAP implementation and the adverse impact from portion pack mix related to new brands entering the system.  The reduction in our full year revenue guidance is primarily driven by the first quarter results, lower brewer sales estimates for the balance of the year and a greater negative impact from foreign exchange. Lower brewer sales in the key holiday season also have an impact on portion pack volumes due to a lower installed base. 
In terms of revenue breakdown throughout the year, please keep in mind the following: We expect growth to accelerate in the second half, driven by improving brewer sales and accelerating portion pack revenues. We will continue to benefit from adding previously unlicensed brands, although we begin to lap certain wins in the fourth quarter. Although Keurig cold will be a small contributor to revenue growth for the full year, we anticipate it will be more meaningful to fourth quarter revenue growth. 
With respect to gross margins, we will see benefits from portion pack pricing and productivity as well as lower margin brewers being a smaller portion of our business versus prior year. Headwinds include higher commodity costs, higher costs on the Keurig 2.0 brewer versus 1.0, and negative portion pack mix as we transition formerly unlicensed brands into the Keurig system.
With respect to coffee costs, we are over 90% locked for fiscal 2015 but at higher rates than fiscal 2014. Coffee costs will be a headwind for the remainder of fiscal year 2015. 
We will continue to invest in our cold platform, other new product platforms and new geographies. We begin to anniversary the Coca-Cola and Lavazza equity transaction dilution in the second and third quarters, which will positively impact earnings growth in the second half of the year. 
Finally, our non-GAAP EPS guidance includes a $0.15 negative impact from foreign exchange, a 34% to 35% tax rate and an approximate $0.27 dilutive impact from the Coca-Cola and Lavazza equity transaction. 
From a cash flow perspective, we expect free cash flow in the range of $225 million to $325 million and capital investment in the range of $425 million to $475 million. Embedded in this capital investment guidance is North America hot platform investments within our previously mentioned 4% to 7% of revenue target, with the remainder representing investment in new products and platforms. 
And finally, although we expect 2015 results to be below our long-term guidance, we continue to believe that our business can deliver double-digit revenue growth and mid-teens earnings per share growth over the long term. Now I'll turn the call back to Brian to wrap up."

We delivered earnings in line with our outlook in a tough environment in the first quarter. And our full year EPS guidance remains the same, excluding the greater than expected negative impact from currency. 
We acknowledge that we missed revenue on brewers over the holiday season. And although our U.S. at home 1.0 and 2.0 reservoir brewers grew 6%, we expected better. With that said, we still shipped 4.3 million brewers in the holiday quarter. And if you look at the top 10 best-selling brewers in the category in the quarter, Keurig has the #1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 of the top 10 selling brewers in terms of dollar sales for the quarter according to NPD. 
Importantly, new consumers love the 2.0 product, which is strategically fundamental to our growth. Current users will go through a transition with their portion packs at home, but that's only transitory.
We're in the middle of an important strategic position of our business. And while we currently have high brewer inventory levels and face some consumer confusion with Keurig 2.0, we're taking decisive steps to address these issues and execute with excellence over the remainder of the year. Our hot system is healthy. Our installed base is expected to grow in the mid-teens this year. And we continue to see a significant long-term opportunity in front of us. We're very excited about our cold launch, and we look forward to previewing the cold system to all of you in May. And finally, we have a strong balance sheet and won't hesitate to act on the $1.1 billion left on our share repurchase authorization.

If you look at it versus prior year, was all brewers and it was MINIs and Vues. Because actually 1.0 -- the combination of 1.0 and 2.0 was up 6% versus a year ago. If you look at it versus our plan, both impacted it. The MINI impacted it. Vue didn't impact because we planned on the Vue going away. We didn't count on any Vue sales this year. if you look at our 100 million miss versus plan, it was due to a combination of the MINI issue as well as 2.0 and 1.0 combination sales that we expected to be higher. We attribute that to the fact that they got off to a slow start. 2.0 did got to a slow start because of the consumer confusion, and it improves as time goes on. we're bringing in the K200 because one of the things we do expect and we see is the K200 appeals to new users. It's slimmer look. It's a lower price point. It's a reservoir brewer. The consumer can get in. Fran, would you add anything?"

And then, what we saw in Q -- our holiday quarter, we saw the whole coffee maker major category decline, and it was about -- and NBC traded accounts, it is down 14%. I think what we saw in the key holiday season, we continue to sell tremendous amount of brewers as we noted on -- in our call, 4.3 million brewers. I think have a lot of units, but I think whole coffee maker category slowed down. Some analogies we're hearing is more people bought iPhones and things like that for holiday gifting. So that's really the major reason we believe  we missed our brewer estimates, because we were using -- we didn't even plan on an up 10%. We actually took it down a bit because a strong promotion last year. We anticipate slightly down from the up 10% for the holiday, But we didn't plan on it going minus 14% the whole category."

If you've been a current Keurig owner for quite a while and you're trading up and you had old packs, those were the ratings that were low. You heard in my remarks that 80% of those very low ratings, the 1-star ratings, when we tracked and analyze them, 80% of them were the by noncompatible pack issue. So we know that's transitory issue. That's going to resolve itself. And it's going to resolve itself with some speed over time here as we get to retailers clear of all of the old inventory. There still are some unlicensed pacts out there though that will continue to be a challenge for the consumer if it doesn't work in the system. So if you look at the growth of our system, to get to your second portion, the installed base growth in the mid-teens we think is very healthy. we think it's healthy, and that's something that we see that the good continue in the future. And when we look at the penetration rates of brewers here, of single serve brewers the U.S. and Canada and look at the roughly 16% where we are today, 16%, roughly 17%. And compare it with some of the countries I mentioned -- and I just mentioned the ones that are over 40%. 40% of the U.S.' 120 million population, you're talking about nearly 50 million households. And so we continue to see 50-million-plus households as a very realistic target long term for where the system can be. We know that we have a lot of things we can do and in our innovation pipeline. New design brewers, unique things that we can bring to the consumer loves some of which ask for, some of which they don't ask for. And we know we can them with new renovation. So we were still very confident that the 50 million plus is be something we can achieve over time. I'll mention one  other thing. And that is, we mentioned it in the script. And that is the way consumers are buying, particularly are buying products they, there joining a system. They're a product. we're testing some unique and innovative ways to consumers in a way that they want to buy  . We also know as we expand the beverages that we offer, we know younger consumers drink different beverages than consumers are plus 40 and plus 50 and plus 60.

One of the things that comes up a lot when you just even Google it is reviews around influencer.com. So the reviews read something like I got a free brewer from Influencer, and this is a -- this is my review. So are you more actively trying to bend some of the trends in the reviews?

So we don't know exactly what the future will bring in terms of how many households will want 2 machines, how many want 1 machine combined.

The execution issue was -- it was a situation of how quickly do consumers in home pantry stock of pods convert. And so we, months ago back in January, we began converting our manufacturing. Actually, we started earlier than that. But we are producing pods with the new lids. If you're familiar with our pods, the new lids, they started converting. They have to then, we converted all our plans. all the the retailer inventory has to convert. the retail stores have to convert. And then, what happens, what you never really have visibility to is what's in the consumers home. And what we learned -- and we knew that we didn't know. At least we were somewhat wise enough to know what we don't know. You really can't tell what consumer in-home stock is. And so we planned for that conversion. For the most part, it converted well, but it was too slow. When we look at it in hindsight, I would judge us as too slow in converting it. Some of it is you -- the consumer had maybe more stock of the some of the slowest moving SKUs are the hardest ones to convert. The fast-moving coffees we have, the Green Mountain brand, the Starbucks brand, the Folgers brand, the big brands in the system converted quickly because those are SKUs that move quickly. Some of the less frequently consumed pods are the ones that take the longest to convert. And so that's what we experienced. And so the cold system doesn't have anything like that in terms of execution. The -- this is a very unique transition. It's a complex transition after we had a number of pods come into the system and positive the system that were incompatible. So the quality of the pods and brewers, the point I want to make sure everyone understands, the quality of the packs and brewers are excellent. They're excellent. The 2.0 brewers are excellent. The pods are excellent, always have been. And so we didn't have an execution issue that impacted anything like that. We have a conversion issue in terms of making sure the pods sell through and we get them exited from consumers' homes as quickly as possible, the old pods."

Let me address the 3 or 4 things that we think have the ability to accelerate and even reaccelerate growth in the installed base. Now the first is, we're getting smarter and smarter about what a quality installed base is. Meaning, a household, we know that for instance, if we break into the household that have Keurig in their home and we look at that top 10%, top 20%, top 30% of the households they're doing obviously a disproportionate number of pods. And the attachment rate is quite high, much higher than what the average the mean would be across the entire group. But yet, we're selling brewers to the bottom 10, that decile that is doing very few brewers -- very few portion packs. So we're looking at how do we target households that will brew a lot of coffee and brew a lot of tea? We're getting smarter and smarter about that. That's one of the key marketing priorities we have. Second, the ability to get consumers' ways of joining Keurig beyond just the traditional way of buying an appliance, and we're working with our retailers to do that. We're working with subscription models. We're doing work on my record doing work with our retailers online to understand our there are simpler, easier, better ways to attack different portions of the populations. The third, the geographic opportunity is still very, very important to us. We still are heavily, heavily skewed in terms of index towards the upper northeast where we started. If we look at the big DMA, if you look at the big market areas across U.S. and you say, are there areas where we are at 25%, 30%, 35%, 40% of those households? And what do we do to get them? And what can we do in other cities to replicate it? And do we need to do unique things in certain cities? We've done very little to appeal to the southern portion where it's we don't have Hispanic brands in the system today. We bought Smuckers, Cafe Bustelo, which is a terrific brand. But we need more brands to appeal to Hispanic households. So we know we can do much more finite targeting to continue to grow the installed base. And then, over the longer term, we know that exciting innovation, exciting brewers, beautiful brewers, new callers. It excites the category. And we know we can create that excitement. We can drive the category and it's about innovation. So those are some of the things that give us the confidence that we can continue to grow."

While we were pleased to have met expectations for earnings per share for the first quarter, we were certainly disappointed with our top line performance.

While we were pleased to have met expectations for earnings per share for the first quarter, we were certainly disappointed with our top line performance. Total revenue was flat for the quarter versus a year ago driven by portion pack growth that was offset by lower brewer and accessory sales. Continued softness in our traditional coffee business was also a contributing factor as well as a negative impact from currency and the timing of some significant orders that got pulled into Q4 versus Q1 due to our SAP implementation, Excluding FX and the impact of the SAP pre-ordering, our core Keurig Beverage System revenue grew 5% in the quarter. 
While Fran will detail the year-over-year drivers, the reason our revenue was essentially flat versus year ago was brewers. Although we shipped 4.3 million brewers in the quarter, we were down about 600,000 year-over-year. Now approximately 400,000 of that decline were the MINI Plus brewers. While we did plan for some MINI decline given the low promotional price points last year, this result was lower than our expectation due in part to the voluntary product recall we executed in the quarter. The remainder of the decline from last year was the Vue brewer, which of course, we anticipated. 
In terms of our revenue performance versus our outlook, the gap was about $100 million, also driven primarily by brewers and, to a lesser extent, portion packs. 
Let me first address brewers. While our 1.0 and 2.0 U.S. reservoir brewer shipments grew by 6% versus the prior year, we expected that growth rate to be meaningfully higher. Quite simply, our 2.0 launch got off to a slower start than we planned due to a few important factors. First, our efforts to get new packs transitioned on retail shelves and into homes did not move quickly enough. There was also confusion among consumers as to whether the 2.0 would still brew all of their favorite brands. These issues impacted consumer perception of the 2.0 and led to lower-than-expected brewer ratings early on. While consumer confusion has begun to subside and ratings have improved, the effect weighed on brewer sales during the key holiday season. 
The other driver of the brewer revenue shortfall was the impact of the voluntary product recall we took on certain models of our MINI Plus brewers. Replacing any product that has been removed from retailer shelf is an involved process, and it cost us significant revenue in the first quarter. We expect that impact to continue in the second quarter. 
Portion packs also contributed to the revenue shortfall as the mix impact across branded channels was greater than expected. Volumes were also impacted by softer-than-expected brewer sales because consumers typically stock their pantry when they first buy a brewer. Additionally, revenues were impacted by inventory reductions across retail as takeaway exceeded shipments in the quarter for portion packs. 
Finally, the SAP transition required consolidation of the legacy Green Mountain and Keurig websites. We experienced several transition issues during the key holiday season, which impacted channel mix for both portion packs and brewers. Our direct channel produces higher revenues for us typically and the loss of those sales hit us disproportionately.
Moving on from revenues. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.88 for the quarter, which was at high end of our guidance range that we laid out in the fourth quarter call. This came despite significant investment in Keurig cold and other platforms and foreign exchange that was worse than expected. 
As we look at the quarter, the issues impacting our results are transitory and part of a complex product transition that we knew would be challenging. We are confident in our strategy and are proceeding resolutely as we continue to see strong growth prospects for the Keurig hot system. Specifically, we expect our U.S. At Home installed base to grow in the mid-teens this year, and we believe we have a long runway for growth in the hot system as we continue to target the 70 million households that use a coffee maker daily. Single serve household penetration in the U.S. is still well below the 40-plus percent levels seen in other developed countries such as Portugal, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Belgium. Combined with our forthcoming cold system, we feel even more confident in the ability of the Keurig brand to be a leading player in the growing trend to offer premium beverage systems at home. 
Our strong balance sheet is also an advantage because it enables us to invest in organic growth and return significant cash to shareholders. We ended the quarter with over $600 million in cash and other current cash assets. We have a dividend that has grown over time. And as at the end of the first quarter, we had $1.1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. And as market conditions warrant, we will be very active with our share repurchases during the coming quarters. 
I'll now turn the call over to Fran to discuss the first quarter financial results in greater detail."
334622,282560814,754999,"Keurig Green Mountain, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2015",2015-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian. For the first quarter, we generated net sales of $1.4 billion, flat with the prior year quarter and up 1% excluding currency impact.

For the first quarter, we generated net sales of $1.4 billion, flat with the prior year quarter and up 1% excluding currency impact. As previously discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, certain retailer customers ordered portion packs more aggressively in the fourth quarter in advance of our fiscal year-end SAP implementation. We estimate that this pre-ordering negatively impacted first quarter 2015 net sales growth by approximately 3 percentage points. Excluding foreign currency and SAP, total net sales grew 4% and core Keurig Beverage System net sales grew 5% in the quarter. 
For the quarter, brewer and accessory net sales declined 18%. Brewer volume declined 12%. As Brian referenced earlier, the Vue and MINI brewers alone accounted for the full volume decline in the quarter. 
Brewer net price realization declined by 8 percentage points, and there were 3 percentage points of positive mix. Price realization was impacted by weakness in our brewer promotional strategy, which did not yield the sales we expected. 
Portion pack sales was 9% with 13% increase in volume and 2 percentage points of pricing, offset by 6 percentage points of negative mix and a roughly 1 percentage point unfavorable impact from currency. 
Portion pack volumes for this quarter came in slightly below our expectations, particularly in December, due to a number of factors: first, lower brewer unit sales; second, the impact of what we believe to be a higher percentage of trade-ups from 1.0 to 2.0 brewers than anticipated. Typically, when consumers trade up, the already have portion packs at home, thus resulting in less portion pack takeaway at the time of the brewer purchase. And third, retailer inventory reductions in the quarter also impacted volume. 
In addition to volumes, greater-than-expected negative mix impacted portion pack net sale. As we continue to add previously unlicensed portion packs to the Keurig system, we are seeing more fluctuations in mix. In addition, the weakness in our digital channel that Brian referenced earlier, strong promotions by some of our partner brands and the lower volumes related to purchases ahead of our SAP implementation all were a drag on portion pack mix in the quarter. 
We did take a portion pack price increase in early November on brands that we sell into retail. Many retailers did not fully pass through the price increase in the quarter, although we are seeing signs of increases in the marketplace in January. 
Next, we are achieving positive price realization from our customers, but it is too early to tell how customer elasticities are impacting the category. 
Additionally, accessory net sales declined 15% in the quarter. Net sales of other products decreased 17% in the quarter due to continued headwinds in traditional packaged coffee and bulk coffee formats. 
If we break down results regionally. For the quarter, our U.S. business had revenue growth of 2%, while our Canadian business declined 12%. Excluding the impact of currency, the Canadian business declined 6% for the quarter. The revenue performance in Canada is primarily due to weaker brewer sales, where the impact of unlicensed packs in the marketplace led to slower consumer adoption of the Keurig 2.0 brewer. 
Moving on to a review of gross profit. For the quarter, our gross margin was flat year-over-year at 33.5% of net sales. This was largely driven by benefits from a shift in sales mix between brewers and portion packs versus prior year, supply chain productivity and an increase in price realization on portion packs. This was offset by lower brewer pricing, higher costs on 2.0 brewers and negative portion pack mix. Today's press release includes a table that outlines the changes in gross margin.
Turning to operating results. Non-GAAP SG&A increased by 4% in the quarter. As a percentage of sales, non-GAAP SG&A increased by 60 basis points to 17% of sales as we continued to invest in R&D ahead of our Keurig cold launch later this year. Our non-GAAP operating profit declined 4% for the quarter, reflecting lower-than-expected sales growth and continued investment in new products and platforms. 
Our first quarter tax rate of 35.7% was slightly above our guidance of 35% to 35.5% but was favorable to our prior year tax rate of 36.6%. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.88 came in at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP EPS, excluding dilution from 2014 equity transactions and foreign exchange, was $0.98. Foreign exchange and dilution impact on EPS were each $0.01 above our guidance at $0.03 and $0.07, respectively.
Turning to the balance sheet and free cash flow. As Brian mentioned, our net cash position at quarter's end was over $300 million, and we generated free cash flow of $42 million for the quarter. At the end of the first quarter, inventory was slightly higher versus a year ago driven by finished goods inventory and brewers. We are taking decisive steps to address the higher brewer-level inventory. 
At this point, I'd like to turn the call back to Brian. Brian?"

We're actively addressing the issues that affected revenue during the key holiday season, and we're making changes that we believe will get our hot system back on the growth track. 
First, let me discuss brewers. Our research tells us that consumers who are new to the Keurig system are very, very happy with their 2.0 purchase, but we simply did not reach enough of them during the quarter as early low ratings deterred sales. We also note that 80% of 1-star reviews from the August through December period came from consumers who cited non-compatibility of packs as a reason for their rating. 
These issues are clearly interrelated, and we're active in our efforts to clear up any lingering confusion consumers have over the portion pack issue. This includes better education at the point of purchase, improved inbox communication and continued exceptional service when people call our customer care center. We believe these actions are already improving our reviews and ratings and that should drive stronger interest among new and current households.  The compatibility issue should continue to subside over the remainder of the year as we execute these enhancements and integrate additional formerly unlicensed brands, such as Community Coffee, into our system over the coming months and continue to add new brands to our system. 
As an aside, on the topic of unlicensed. The reason our partners have come to us and stayed with us is because of our history of innovation, the strong consumer passion for our Keurig brand and their confidence in the strength of our future pipeline. We know we need to continually earn their trust through our ongoing innovation efforts. We enjoy many strong long-term partnerships with the brands in our system, and we expect to welcome even more brands in over the short and long term. In fact, we have a series of innovations coming that will continue to give consumers greater choice and benefits in our 2.0 system, ultimately making it even more appealing to both our customers and our partners. 
Other areas where we plan to impact brewer sales include rounding out the portfolio and appealing to more consumer segments. In April, we will begin shipping the new K200 brewer, which offers our new 2.0 system to consumers who prefer a slimmer design, a smaller footprint, vibrant color choices and a lower price point. This will be our entry-level reservoir brewer, and we expect it will bring new users into the system. 
As you know, the way consumers shop today is undergoing major transformation. To align with the changes we are seeing in the marketplace, particularly with the younger demographic, we are testing a number of unique Keurig system shopping and pricing models. They're designed to make it even more appealing for a broader segment of consumers to join the Keurig system. Today, these models are being tested online in our Keurig choice program that allows consumers to join Keurig for a monthly fee over a defined time period, a subscription-like model.  We are also exploring these types of models with retailers as they explore omni-channel opportunities to improve customer engagement. 
Lastly, on the heels of the voluntary action we took certain MINI Plus brewers last quarter, we have resumed filling orders on the MINI. 
Beyond the plan we have for brewer sales, we also are looking to improve our overall system marketing. To that end, we have recently hired Mark Baynes as our first Chief Marketing Officer. Mark comes to us with a strong CPG background and will be leading our efforts to elevate our brand in digital marketing. Initially, he will be focused on delivering the message of the wide variety and choice that the Keurig system provides. And this includes a portfolio now of approximately 70 brands and almost 500 of the finest coffees, teas, cocoas and food and beverages by spring. 
Our marketing efforts will also support our rollout of new sizes and varieties of portion packs, including 9 additional varieties of K-Carafe packs in the spring. Also in the spring, we will launch our new K-mug [ph] line of coffees on keurig.com, which will brew between 12 and 18 ounces, to be followed by K-mug [ph] coffee launch at retail. 
In all, we will work hard to improve our communication on how the Keurig system offers extensive variety and choice. We will be refining our marketing efforts in other ways to drive portion pack volume and improve mix. We will begin to introduce new packaging in the spring across our owned coffee brands, including the entire Green Mountain line, with updated branding and graphics. Our new packaging template has tested well with stronger purchase intent and shelf visibility scores. We're also furthering our efforts in store with improved point of purchased material. 
Finally, we're focused on growing our digital business and are redoubling our efforts to improve website performance and develop meaningful programs to drive this channel, as consumers shift more and more of their purchases online. 
  
Now let me move on to one  of our most important objectives for 2015, which is the introduction of Keurig cold to North American consumers. Our plans are progressing well, and we're on track to launch this fall. Our partners, The Coca-Cola Company and the Dr Pepper Snapple Group, are working closely with us in virtually all aspects of the Keurig cold system in preparation for launch. 
I'd like to give you an update of where we stand in terms of 4 key work streams for this new launch: the appliance, the pods, the brand and the marketplace launch. 
With respect to appliance development, the process began with developing and testing an initial design. Next came a more refined series of engineering builds of the appliance and home use tests, which are currently underway. As data comes in from the testing, it is used to fine-tune particular aspects of the appliance. After the final engineering build, we move to begin the scale of our production capacity. The first manufacturing line for our cold appliances is currently up and running, producing at pilot rates. 
With respect to the pods, we have finalized the design and have developed proprietary equipment and techniques to manufacture the pods on high-speed lines. The first lines have been installed and are being qualified in our Williston, Vermont cold facility. The first line will be producing live pods in March and will be followed by a second line, which will begin production in the summer.  Also, the construction our new cold pod plant in Georgia is on track, with the plant expected to open this summer. 
From a beverage standpoint, Keurig cold will launch with 30 beverage varieties across 16 brands, including carbonated soft drinks, craft sodas, iced teas, sports drinks, seltzers and flavored waters. The following spring, we expect the Keurig cold system will offer more than 60 varieties and more than 28 brands. As we said before, Keurig cold will be a multi-branded system and we expect to add new partners in the future. 
Finally,, let me discuss the marketplace launch. We're in the final stages of developing the positioning and packaging and overall strategy for our cold system launch. We continue to refine the launch strategy and marketing plans, and we're working closely with our partners and retail customers to do so. 
As we've stated before, the long-term growth potential for Keurig cold both in North America and globally is significant. Keurig cold will empower consumers to create a wide variety of fresh, great-tasting beverages at the touch of a button in their home. 
Finally, I'm very happy to announce that we will preview the Keurig cold system for investors in May. Details of this invitation-only event will be forthcoming in the next few weeks. 
Now let me pass the call back to Fran for our outlook. Fran?"

For the second quarter, we expect net sales growth of mid-single digits and non-GAAP EPS of $1 to $1.05. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the 36% to 37% range. Our second quarter revenue will be impacted by several factors. First",815,"Thanks, Brian. For the second quarter, we expect net sales growth of mid-single digits and non-GAAP EPS of $1 to $1.05. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the 36% to 37% range. 
Our second quarter revenue will be impacted by several factors. First, while we are working to improve brewer trends, we expect brewer revenues to decline as volumes are expected to be down in the mid-20% range, as retailers sell through inventory levels and we lap a difficult volume comparison of 29% in the prior year quarter. Based on our forecast, which includes the launch of our K200 brewer, we expect our brewer inventories to remain near current levels until the third quarter. 
Second, with respect to portion packs, we expect revenue growth trends to be similar to what we saw in the first quarter. Finally, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 2 percentage points. 
Our second quarter EPS guidance is impacted by the following factors: We expect brewers to be a smaller percentage of mix versus the prior year period, which will positively impact margin. However, this will be partially offset by higher 2.0 brewer costs as compared to the 1.0 brewers. Commodities become a headwind; continued investment in Keurig cold and other new platforms. We'll begin to lap the Coca-Cola equity transaction mid-second quarter. Foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.07. And finally, we expect an approximate $0.08 dilutive impact due to the Coca-Cola and Lavazza equity transaction. Next, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and dilution, we expect EPS growth in the high single to low double-digit range despite significant investments.
Moving to our full year guidance. For fiscal 2015, we now expect net sales growth in the mid-single to high single digits over fiscal 2014. We are also revising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to mid-single-digit growth due to a greater negative impact from foreign exchange, which we now estimate at $0.15 versus $0.04 in our previous guidance. 
Our EPS guidance continues to imply a mid-teens operating profit growth rate for our core North American hot business. Our revenue estimate reflects a negative 2 percentage point impact from foreign exchange, a 1-point headwind due to lapping the benefit of retailer pre-ordering ahead of the year-end SAP implementation and the adverse impact from portion pack mix related to new brands entering the system.  The reduction in our full year revenue guidance is primarily driven by the first quarter results, lower brewer sales estimates for the balance of the year and a greater negative impact from foreign exchange. Lower brewer sales in the key holiday season also have an impact on portion pack volumes due to a lower installed base. 
In terms of revenue breakdown throughout the year, please keep in mind the following: We expect growth to accelerate in the second half, driven by improving brewer sales and accelerating portion pack revenues. We will continue to benefit from adding previously unlicensed brands, although we begin to lap certain wins in the fourth quarter. Although Keurig cold will be a small contributor to revenue growth for the full year, we anticipate it will be more meaningful to fourth quarter revenue growth. 
With respect to gross margins, we will see benefits from portion pack pricing and productivity as well as lower margin brewers being a smaller portion of our business versus prior year. Headwinds include higher commodity costs, higher costs on the Keurig 2.0 brewer versus 1.0, and negative portion pack mix as we transition formerly unlicensed brands into the Keurig system.
With respect to coffee costs, we are over 90% locked for fiscal 2015 but at higher rates than fiscal 2014. Coffee costs will be a headwind for the remainder of fiscal year 2015. 
We will continue to invest in our cold platform, other new product platforms and new geographies. We'll begin to anniversary the Coca-Cola and Lavazza equity transaction dilution in the second and third quarters, which will positively impact earnings growth in the second half of the year. 
Finally, our non-GAAP EPS guidance includes a $0.15 negative impact from foreign exchange, a 34% to 35% tax rate and an approximate $0.27 dilutive impact from the Coca-Cola and Lavazza equity transaction. 
From a cash flow perspective, we expect free cash flow in the range of $225 million to $325 million and capital investment in the range of $425 million to $475 million. Embedded in this capital investment guidance is North America hot platform investment within our previously mentioned 4% to 7% of revenue target, with the remainder representing investment in new products and platforms. 
And finally, although we expect 2015 results to be below our long-term guidance, we continue to believe that our business can deliver double-digit revenue growth and mid-teens earnings per share growth over the long term. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Brian to wrap up."

We delivered earnings in line with our outlook in a tough environment in the first quarter. And our full year EPS guidance remains the same, excluding the greater-than-expected negative impact from currency. 
We acknowledge that we missed revenue on brewers over the holiday season. And although our U.S. At Home 1.0 and 2.0 reservoir brewers grew 6%, we expected better. 
With that said, we still shipped 4.3 million brewers in the holiday quarter. And if you look at the top 10 best-selling brewers in the category in the quarter, Keurig has the #1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 of the top 10 selling brewers in terms of dollar sales for the quarter, according to NPD. 
Importantly, new consumers love the 2.0 product, which is strategically fundamental to our growth. Current users will go through a transition with their portion packs at home, but that's only transitory.
We're in the middle of an important strategic transition of our business. And while we currently have high brewer inventory levels and face some consumer confusion with Keurig 2.0, we're taking decisive steps to address these issues and execute with excellence over the remainder of the year. Our hot system is healthy. Our installed base is expected to grow in the mid-teens this year. And we continue to see a significant long-term opportunity in front of us. We're very excited about our cold launch, and we look forward to previewing the cold system to all of you in May. And finally, we have a very strong balance sheet and won't hesitate to act on the $1.1 billion left on our share repurchase authorization. 
With that, I'd like to open up the line to any questions. Operator?"

You can never predict it perfectly because as our base gets larger, again, you expect a larger portion, again, to roll off as their brewer ages or they need to buy a new brewer. We've sold 6 million and 7 million and 8 million brewers per year for the last 3 years in POS. That creates a lot of users who need to then replace their current brewer. So you're going to sell an ever-increasing number of your brewers to replacement users. The fact that 50% of the purchasers were among new users was encouraging to us, yes. So that was slightly higher than we expected, although we want it to be even higher. You requested, on the first part of your question, a break between really the difference between prior year and the difference between our 100 million shortfall. And so that's what the difference is. If you look at it versus prior year, it was all brewers and it was MINIs and Vues. Because actually 1.0 -- the combination of 1.0 and 2.0 was up 6% versus a year ago. If you look at it versus our plan, both impacted it. The MINI impacted it. Vue didn't impact it because we planned on Vue going away. We didn't count on any Vue sales this year. If you look at our 100 million miss versus plan, it was due to a combination of the MINI issue as well as 2.0 and 1.0 combination sales that we expected to be higher. We attribute that to the fact that they got off to a slow start. The 2.0 did get off to a slow start because of the consumer confusion, and it improves as time goes on. Now we're bringing in the K200 because one of the things we do expect and we see is that the K200 appeals to new users. It's a slimmer look. It's a lower price point. It's a reservoir brewer. The consumer can get in. Fran, would you add anything?"

So I think what we saw was in this key holiday season, we continue to sell a tremendous amount of brewers, as we noted in our call, 4.3 million brewers. I think we have a lot of units, but I think the whole coffee maker category slowed down. Some analogies we're hearing is more people bought iPhones and things like that for holiday gifting. So that's really the major reason we believe  we missed our brewer estimates, because we were using -- we didn't even plan on an up 10%. We actually took it down a bit because we have such strong promotions last year. We anticipated slightly down from the up 10% for the holiday, But we didn't plan on it going minus 14% the whole category."

And then, in addition, Q2, just to remind you in my remarks I mentioned last year, Q2 in particular had very, very strong brewer sales and, in fact, were up 29%.

We look at the transitory issues as -- what we mentioned for instance, when a new user comes in, what really is encouraging for 2.0 is that they're very excited about the brewer, they love the product. If you've been a current Keurig owner for quite a while and you're trading up and you had old packs, those were the ratings that were low. You heard in my remarks that 80% of those very low ratings, the 1-star ratings, when we've tracked and analyzed them, 80% of them were caused by the noncompatible pack issue. So we know that's a transitory issue. That's kind of resolved itself. And it's going to resolve itself with some speed over time here as we get through retailers clear of all of that old inventory. There still are some unlicensed packs out there though that will continue to be a challenge for the consumer if it doesn't work in the system. So if you look at the growth though of our system, to get to your second portion, the installed base growth in the mid-teens we think is very healthy. We think it's healthy, and that's something that we see that can continue in the future. And when we look at the penetration rate of brewers here, of single-serve brewers here in the U.S. and Canada, and you look at the roughly 16% where we are today, 16%, roughly 17% and you compare that to some of the countries I mentioned -- and I just mentioned the ones that are all over 40%. 40% of the U.S.' 120 million population, you're talking about nearly 50 million households. And so we continue to see 50 million-plus households as a very realistic target long term for where this system can be. We know that we have a lot of things we can do in our innovation pipeline, new design of brewers, unique things that we can bring to the brewer the consumer loves, some of which they've asked for, some of which they don't ask for. And we know we can thrill them with new renovation. So we -- we're still very confident that the 50 million-plus is going to be something we can achieve over time. I'll mention one other thing. And that is, we mentioned a bit in the script, and that is the way consumers are buying, particularly younger consumers are buying products today, electronics today, they're joining a system. They're joining a brand. And so we're testing some pretty unique and innovative ways to get consumers in a way they want to buy and come in. We also know, as we expand the beverages that we offer, we know younger consumers drink different beverages than consumers who are plus-40 and plus-50 and plus-60. So we know all of these things can continue to expand the desire for Keurig."

And so I know it's not simple to look when you see IRI data or you look at Nielsen data. A couple of points, they don't look at the entire market. IRI looks at about 55%, 50% to 60%, it ranges in there. We see the entire market. We have POS for the entire marketplace that we sell into. And so we have a very good view of this. I would also mention that it's hard to track because when -- let's just take IRI, for instance. When something that was unlicensed becomes licensed, it moves into, in essence, a Keurig brewed system. And so if the history moves with it, it's going to be really hard to track. We see our share, but sometimes the growth rates that you see in IRI are not necessarily indicative of exactly what's happening. I know that is not simple to explain on a call like this, but we'd be happy to walk you through that at some point."

The execution issue was this, it was a situation of how quickly do consumers in-home pantry stock of pods convert. And so we, months ago, back in January, we began converting our manufacturing. Actually, we started earlier than that, but we are producing pods with the new lids. If you're familiar with our pods, the new lids, they started converting. They have to then -- we converted our plants. All the retailer inventory has to convert. The retailer stores have to convert. And then what happens, what you never really have visibility to is what's in the consumers' home. And what we learned -- and we knew that we didn't know, at least we were somewhat wise enough to know what we don't know. You really can't tell what consumer in-home stock is. And so we planned for that conversion. For the most part, it converted well, but it was too slow. When we look at it in hindsight, I would judge us as too slow in converting it. Some of it is you -- the consumer had maybe more stock of some of the slowest moving SKUs are the hardest ones to convert. The fast-moving coffees we have, the Green Mountain brand, the Starbucks brand, the Folgers brand, the big brands in the system, converted quickly because those are SKUs that move quickly. Some of the less frequently consumed pods are the ones that take the longest to convert."

Let me address the 3 or 4 things that we think have the ability to accelerate and even reaccelerate growth in the installed base. Now the first is, we're getting smarter and smarter about what a quality installed base is, meaning a household, we know that, for instance, if we break into deciles, the households that have Keurig in their home. And we look at that top 10%, top 20%, top 30% of the households, they're doing obviously a disproportionate number of pods and the attached rate is quite high, much higher than what the average and the mean would be across the entire group. But yet, we're selling brewers to the bottom 10%, that decile that is doing very few brewers -- very few portion packs, sorry. So we're looking at how do we target the households that will brew a lot of coffee and brew a lot of tea? We're getting smarter and smarter about that. That's one of the key marketing priorities we have. Second, the ability to get consumers' ways of joining Keurig beyond just the traditional way of buying an appliance, and we're working with our retailers to do that. We're working with subscription models, we're doing work online, we're doing work with our retailers online to understand, are there simpler, easier, better ways to attack different portions of the populations. The third, the geographic opportunity is still very, very important to us. We still are heavily, heavily skewed in terms of index toward the upper northeast where we started. If we look at the big DMAs, if you look at the big market areas across U.S. and you say, are there areas where we are at 25%, 30%, 35%, 40% of those households? And what do we do to get them? And what do we -- what can we do in the other cities to replicate it? And do we need to do unique things in certain cities? We've done very little to appeal to the southern portion where it's a large Hispanic population, we don't have Hispanic brands in the system today. We brought Smuckers, Cafe Bustelo in, which is a terrific brand, but we need more brands to appeal to the Hispanic households. So we know we can do much more finite targeting to continue to grow the installed base. And then, over the longer term, we know that exciting innovation, exciting brewers, beautiful brewers, new colors, it excites the category. And we know we can create that excitement. We can drive the category, and it's about innovation. So those are some of the things that give us the confidence that we can continue to grow."

334622,282560814,755037,"Keurig Green Mountain, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2015",2015-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kristi, and good afternoon, everyone. While we were pleased to have met expectations for earnings per share for the first quarter, we were certainly disappointed with our top line performance.

While we were pleased to have met expectations for earnings per share for the first quarter, we were certainly disappointed with our top line performance. Total revenue was flat for the quarter versus a year ago, driven by portion pack growth that was offset by lower brewer and accessory sales. Continued softness in our traditional coffee business was also a contributing factor as well as a negative impact from currency and the timing of some significant orders that got pulled into Q4 versus Q1 due to our SAP implementation. Excluding FX and the impact of the SAP pre-ordering, our core Keurig Beverage System revenue grew 5% in the quarter. 
While Fran will detail the year-over-year drivers, the reason our revenue was essentially flat versus year ago was brewers. Although we shipped 4.3 million brewers in the quarter, we were down about 600,000 year-over-year. Now approximately 400,000 of that decline were the MINI Plus brewers. While we did plan for some MINI decline given the low promotional price points last year, this result was lower than our expectation, due in part to the voluntary product recall we executed in the quarter. The remainder of the decline from last year was the Vue brewer, which of course, we anticipated. 
In terms of our revenue performance versus our outlook, the gap was about $100 million, also driven primarily by brewers and, to a lesser extent, portion packs. 
Let me first address brewers. While our 1.0 and 2.0 U.S. reservoir brewer shipments grew by 6% versus the prior year, we expected that growth rate to be meaningfully higher. Quite simply, our 2.0 launch got off to a slower start than we planned, due to a few important factors. First, our efforts to get new packs transitioned onto retail shelves and into homes did not move quickly enough. There was also confusion among consumers as to whether the 2.0 would still brew all of their favorite brands. These issues impacted consumer perception of the 2.0 and led to lower-than-expected brewer ratings early on. While consumer confusion has begun to subside and ratings have improved, the effect weighed on brewer sales during the key holiday season. 
The other driver of the brewer revenue shortfall was the impact of the voluntary product recall we took on certain models of our MINI Plus brewers. Replacing any product that has been removed from retailer shelves is an involved process, and it cost us significant revenue in the first quarter. We expect that impact to continue in the second quarter. 
Portion packs also contributed to the revenue shortfall as the mix impact across branded channels was greater than expected. Volumes were also impacted by softer-than-expected brewer sales because consumers typically stock their pantry when they first buy a brewer. Additionally, revenues were impacted by inventory reductions across retail as takeaway exceeded shipments in the quarter for portion packs. 
Finally, the SAP transition required consolidation of the legacy Green Mountain and Keurig websites. We experienced several transition issues during the key holiday season, which impacted channel mix for both portion packs and brewers. Our direct channel produces higher revenues for us typically and the loss of those sales hit us disproportionately.
Moving on from revenues. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.88 for the quarter, which was at high end of our guidance range that we laid out on the fourth quarter call. This came despite significant investment in Keurig Cold and other platforms and foreign exchange that was worse than expected. 
As we look at the quarter, the issues impacting our results are transitory and part of a complex product transition that we knew would be challenging. We are confident in our strategy and are proceeding resolutely as we continue to see strong growth prospects for the Keurig hot system. Specifically, we expect our U.S. At Home installed base to grow in the mid-teens this year, and we believe we have a long runway for growth in the hot system as we continue to target the 70 million households that use a coffee maker daily. Single serve household penetration in the U.S. is still well below the 40-plus percent levels seen in other developed countries such as Portugal, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Belgium. Combined with our forthcoming cold system, we feel even more confident in the ability of the Keurig brand to be a leading player in the growing trend to offer premium beverage systems at home. 
Our strong balance sheet is also an advantage because it enables us to invest in organic growth and return significant cash to shareholders. We ended the quarter with over $600 million in cash and other current cash assets. We have a dividend that has grown over time, and as of the end of the first quarter, we had $1.1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. And as market conditions warrant, we will be very active with our share repurchases in the coming quarters. 
I'll now turn the call over to Fran to discuss the first quarter financial results in greater detail."
334622,282560814,755037,"Keurig Green Mountain, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2015",2015-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian. For the first quarter, we generated net sales of $1.4 billion, flat with the prior year quarter and up 1% excluding currency impacts. As previously discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, certain retailer customers ordered portion pa",823,"Thanks, Brian. For the first quarter, we generated net sales of $1.4 billion, flat with the prior year quarter and up 1% excluding currency impacts. As previously discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, certain retailer customers ordered portion packs more aggressively in the fourth quarter in advance of our fiscal year-end SAP implementation. We estimate that this pre-ordering negatively impacted first quarter 2015 net sales growth by approximately 3 percentage points. Excluding foreign currency and SAP, total net sales grew 4% and core Keurig Beverage System net sales grew 5% in the quarter. 
For the quarter, brewer and accessory net sales declined 18%. Brewer volume declined 12%. As Brian referenced earlier, the Vue and MINI brewers alone accounted for the full volume decline in the quarter. 
Brewer net price realization declined by 8 percentage points, and there were 3 percentage points of positive mix. Price realization was impacted by weakness in our brewer promotional strategy, which did not yield the sales we expected. 
Portion pack sales was 9% with 13% increase in volume and 2 percentage points of pricing, offset by 6 percentage points of negative mix and a roughly 1 percentage point unfavorable impact from currency. 
Portion pack volumes for this quarter came in slightly below our expectations, particularly in December, due to a number of factors: first, lower brewer unit sales; second, the impact from what we believe to be a higher percentage of trade-ups from 1.0 to 2.0 brewers than anticipated. Typically, when consumers trade up, the already have portion packs at home, thus resulting in less portion pack takeaway at the time of the brewer purchase. And third, retailer inventory reductions in the quarter also impacted volumes. 
In addition to volumes, greater-than-expected negative mix impacted portion pack net sale. As we continue to add previously unlicensed portion packs to the Keurig system, we are seeing more fluctuations in mix. In addition, the weakness in our digital channel that Brian referenced earlier, strong promotions by some of our partner brands and the lower volumes related to purchases ahead of our SAP implementation all were a drag on portion pack mix in the quarter. 
We did take a portion pack price increase in early November on brands that we sell into retail. Many retailers did not fully pass through the price increase in the quarter, although we are seeing signs of increases in the marketplace in January. 
Net, we are achieving positive price realization from our customers, but it is too early to tell how customer elasticities are impacting the category. 
Additionally, accessory net sales declined 15% in the quarter. Net sales of other products decreased 17% in the quarter due to continued headwinds in traditional packaged coffee and bulk coffee formats. 
If we break down results regionally, for the quarter, our U.S. business had revenue growth of 2%, while our Canadian business declined 12%. Excluding the impact of currency, the Canadian business declined 6% for the quarter. The revenue performance in Canada is primarily due to weaker brewer sales, where the impact of unlicensed packs in the marketplace led to slower consumer adoption of the Keurig 2.0 brewer. 
Moving on to a review of gross profit. For the quarter, our gross margin was flat year-over-year at 33.5% of net sales. This was largely driven by benefits from a shift in sales mix between brewers and portion packs versus prior year, supply chain productivity and an increase in price realization on portion packs. This was offset by lower brewer pricing, higher costs on 2.0 brewers and negative portion pack mix. Today's press release includes a table that outlines the changes in gross margin.
Turning to operating results. Non-GAAP SG&A increased by 4% in the quarter. As a percentage of sales, non-GAAP SG&A increased by 60 basis points to 17% of sales as we continued to invest in R&D ahead of our Keurig Cold launch later this year. Our non-GAAP operating profit declined 4% for the quarter, reflecting lower-than-expected sales growth and continued investment in new products and platforms. 
Our first quarter tax rate of 35.7% was slightly above our guidance of 35% to 35.5% but was favorable to our prior year tax rate of 36.6%. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.88 came in at the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP EPS, excluding dilution from 2014 equity transactions and foreign exchange, was $0.98. Foreign exchange and dilution impact on EPS were each $0.01 above our guidance at $0.03 and $0.07, respectively.
Turning to the balance sheet and free cash flow. As Brian mentioned, our net cash position at quarter's end was over $300 million, and we generated free cash flow of $42 million for the quarter. At the end of the first quarter, inventory was slightly higher versus year ago, driven by finished goods, inventory and brewers. We are taking decisive steps to address the higher brewer-level inventory. 
At this point, I'd like to turn the call back to Brian. Brian?"

First, let me discuss brewers. Our research tells us that",1304,"Thanks, Fran. We're actively addressing the issues that affected revenue during the key holiday season, and we're making changes that we believe will get our hot system back on the growth track. 
First, let me discuss brewers. Our research tells us that consumers who are new to the Keurig system are very, very happy with their 2.0 purchase, but we simply did not reach enough of them during the quarter as early low ratings deterred sales. We also know that 80% of 1-star reviews from the August through December period came from consumers who cited non-compatibility of packs as a reason for their rating. 
These issues are clearly interrelated, and we're active in our efforts to clear up any lingering confusion consumers have over the portion pack issue. This includes better education at the point of purchase, improved inbox communication and continued exceptional service when people call our customer care center. We believe these actions are already improving our reviews and ratings and that should drive stronger interest among new and current households.  The compatibility issue should continue to subside over the remainder of the year as we execute these enhancements and integrate additional formerly unlicensed brands, such as Community Coffee, into our system over the coming months and continue to add new brands to our system. 
As an aside, on the topic of unlicensed. The reason our partners have come to us and stayed with us is because of our history of innovation, the strong consumer passion for our Keurig brand and their confidence in the strength of our future pipeline. We know we need to continually earn their trust through our ongoing innovation efforts. We enjoy many strong long-term partnerships with the brands in our system, and we expect to welcome even more brands in over the short and long term. In fact, we have a series of innovations coming that will continue to give consumers greater choice and benefits in our 2.0 system, ultimately making it even more appealing to both our consumers and our partners. 
Other areas where we plan to impact brewer sales include rounding out the portfolio and appealing to more consumer segments. In April, we will begin shipping the new K200 brewer, which offers our new 2.0 system to consumers who prefer a slimmer design, a smaller footprint, vibrant color choices and a lower price point. This will be our entry-level reservoir brewer, and we expect it will bring new users into the system. 
As you know, the way consumers shop today is undergoing major transformation. To align with the changes we are seeing in the marketplace, particularly with the younger demographic, we are testing a number of unique Keurig system shopping and pricing models. They're designed to make it even more appealing for a broader segment of consumers to join the Keurig system. Today, these models are being tested online in our Keurig choice program that allows consumers to join Keurig for a monthly fee over a defined time period, a subscription-like model. We are also exploring these types of models with retailers as they explore omnichannel opportunities to improve customer engagement. 
Lastly, on the heels of the voluntary action we took on certain MINI Plus brewers last quarter, we have resumed filling orders on the MINI. 
Beyond the plan we have for brewer sales, we also are looking to improve our overall system marketing. To that end, we have recently hired Mark Baynes as our first Chief Marketing Officer. Mark comes to us with a strong CPG background and will be leading our efforts to elevate our brand in digital marketing. Initially, he will be focused on delivering the message of the wide variety and choice that the Keurig system provides. And this includes a portfolio now of approximately 70 brands and almost 500 of the finest coffees, teas, cocoas and food and beverages by spring. 
Our marketing efforts will also support our rollout of new sizes and varieties of portion packs, including 9 additional varieties of K-Carafe packs in the spring. Also in the spring, we will launch our new K-MUG line of coffees on keurig.com, which will brew between 12 and 18 ounces, to be followed by a K-MUG coffee launch at retail. 
In all, we will work hard to improve our communication on how the Keurig system offers extensive variety and choice. We will be refining our marketing efforts in other ways to drive portion pack volume and improve mix. We will begin to introduce new packaging in the spring across our owned coffee brands, including the entire Green Mountain line, with updated branding and graphics. Our new packaging template has tested well, with stronger purchase intent and shelf visibility scores. We're also furthering our efforts in store with improved point-of-purchase material. 
Finally, we're focused on growing our digital business and are redoubling our efforts to improve website performance and develop meaningful programs to drive this channel, as consumers shift more and more of their purchases online. 
  
Now let me move on to one of our most important objectives for 2015, which is the introduction of Keurig Cold to North American consumers. Our plans are progressing well, and we're on track to launch this fall. Our partners, The Coca-Cola Company and the Dr Pepper Snapple Group, are working closely with us in virtually all aspects of the Keurig Cold system in preparation for launch. 
I'd like to give you an update of where we stand in terms of 4 key work streams for this new launch: the appliance, the pods, the brands, and the marketplace launch. 
With respect to appliance development, the process began with developing and testing an initial design. Next came a more refined series of engineering builds of the appliance and home use tests, which are currently underway. As data comes in from the testing, it is used to fine-tune particular aspects of the appliance. After the final engineering build, we move to begin the scale of our production capacity. The first manufacturing line for our cold appliances is currently up and running, producing at pilot rates. 
With respect to the pods, we have finalized the design and have developed proprietary equipment and techniques to manufacture the pods on high-speed lines. The first lines have been installed and are being qualified in our Williston, Vermont cold facility. The first line will be producing live pods in March and will be followed by a second line, which will begin production in the summer.  Also, the construction our new cold pod plant in Georgia is on track, with the plant expected to open this summer. 
From a beverage standpoint, Keurig Cold will launch with 30 beverage varieties across 16 brands, including carbonated soft drinks, craft sodas, iced teas, sports drinks, seltzers and flavored waters. By the following spring, we expect the Keurig Cold system will offer more than 60 varieties and more than 28 brands. As we said before, Keurig Cold will be a multi-branded system and we expect to add new partners in the future. 
Finally, let me discuss the marketplace launch. We're in the final stages of developing the positioning and packaging and overall strategy for our cold system launch. We continue to refine the launch strategy and marketing plans, and we're working closely with our partners and retail customers to do so. 
As we've stated before, the long-term growth potential for Keurig Cold both in North America and globally is significant. Keurig Cold will empower consumers to create a wide variety of fresh, great-tasting beverages at the touch of a button in their home. 
Finally, I'm very pleased to announce that we will preview the Keurig Cold system for investors in May. Details of this invitation-only event will be forthcoming in the next few weeks. 
Now let me pass the call back to Fran for our outlook. Fran?"

For the second quarter, we expect net sales growth of mid-single digits and non-GAAP EPS of $1 to $1.05. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the 36% to 37% range. Our second quarter revenue will be impacted by several factors. First",815,"Thanks, Brian. For the second quarter, we expect net sales growth of mid-single digits and non-GAAP EPS of $1 to $1.05. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the 36% to 37% range. 
Our second quarter revenue will be impacted by several factors. First, while we are working to improve brewer trends, we expect brewer revenues to decline as volumes are expected to be down in the mid-20% range, as retailers sell through inventory levels and we lap a difficult volume comparison of 29% in the prior year quarter. Based on our forecast, which includes the launch of our K200 brewer, we expect our brewer inventories to remain near current levels until the third quarter. 
Second, with respect to portion packs, we expect revenue growth trends to be similar to what we saw in the first quarter. Finally, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 2 percentage points. 
Our second quarter EPS guidance is impacted by the following factors. We expect brewers to be a smaller percentage of mix versus the prior year period, which will positively impact margin. However, this will be partially offset by higher 2.0 brewer costs as compared to the 1.0 brewers. Commodities become a headwind; continued investment in Keurig Cold and other new platforms; we begin to lap the Coca-Cola equity transaction mid-second quarter; foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.07. And finally, we expect an approximate $0.08 dilutive impact due to the Coca-Cola and Lavazza equity transaction. Net, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and dilution, we expect EPS growth in the high single to low double-digit range despite significant investments.
Moving to our full year guidance. For fiscal 2015, we now expect net sales growth in the mid-single to high single digits over fiscal 2014. We are also revising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to mid-single-digit growth due to a greater negative impact from foreign exchange, which we now estimate at $0.15 versus $0.04 in our previous guidance. 
Our EPS guidance continues to imply a mid-teens operating profit growth rate for our core North American hot business. Our revenue estimate reflects a negative 2 percentage point impact from foreign exchange, a 1-point headwind due to lapping the benefit of retailer pre-ordering ahead of the year-end SAP implementation and the adverse impact from portion pack mix related to new brands entering the system.  The reduction in our full year revenue guidance is primarily driven by the first quarter results, lower brewer sales estimates for the balance of the year and a greater negative impact from foreign exchange. Lower brewer sales in the key holiday season also have an impact on portion pack volumes due to a lower installed base. 
In terms of revenue breakdown throughout the year, please keep in mind the following. We expect growth to accelerate in the second half, driven by improving brewer sales and accelerating portion pack revenues. We will continue to benefit from adding previously unlicensed brands, although we begin to lap certain wins in the fourth quarter. Although Keurig Cold will be a small contributor to revenue growth for the full year, we anticipate it will be more meaningful to fourth quarter revenue growth. 
With respect to gross margins, we will see benefits from portion pack pricing and productivity as well as lower margin brewers being a smaller portion of our business versus prior year. Headwinds include higher commodity costs, higher costs on the Keurig 2.0 brewer versus 1.0, and negative portion pack mix as we transition formerly unlicensed brands into the Keurig system.
With respect to coffee costs, we are over 90% locked for fiscal 2015 but at higher rates than fiscal 2014. Coffee costs will be a headwind for the remainder of fiscal year 2015. 
We will continue to invest in our cold platform, other new product platforms and new geographies. We begin to anniversary the Coca-Cola and Lavazza equity transaction dilution in the second and third quarters, which will positively impact earnings growth in the second half of the year. 
Finally, our non-GAAP EPS guidance includes a $0.15 negative impact from foreign exchange, a 34% to 35% tax rate and an approximate $0.27 dilutive impact from the Coca-Cola and Lavazza equity transaction. 
From a cash flow perspective, we expect free cash flow in the range of $225 million to $325 million and capital investment in the range of $425 million to $475 million. Embedded in this capital investment guidance is North America hot platform investment within our previously mentioned 4% to 7% of revenue target, with the remainder representing investment in new products and platforms. 
And finally, although we expect 2015 results to be below our long-term guidance, we continue to believe that our business can deliver double-digit revenue growth and mid-teens earnings per share growth over the long term. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Brian to wrap up."

We delivered earnings in line with our outlook in a tough environment in the first quarter. And our full year EPS guidance remains the same, excluding the greater-than-expected negative impact from currency. 
We acknowledge that we missed revenue on brewers over the holiday season. And although our U.S. At Home 1.0 and 2.0 reservoir brewers grew 6%, we expected better. 
With that said, we still shipped 4.3 million brewers in the holiday quarter. And if you look at the top 10 best-selling brewers in the category in the quarter, Keurig had the #1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 of the top 10 selling brewers in terms of dollar sales for the quarter, according to NPD. 
Importantly, new consumers love the 2.0 product, which is strategically fundamental to our growth. Current users will go through a transition with their portion packs at home, but that's only transitory.
We're in the middle of an important strategic transition in our business. And while we currently have high brewer inventory levels and face some consumer confusion with Keurig 2.0, we're taking decisive steps to address these issues and execute with excellence over the remainder of the year. Our hot system is healthy. Our installed base is expected to grow in the mid-teens this year. And we continue to see a significant long-term opportunity in front of us. We're very excited about our cold launch, and we look forward to previewing the cold system to all of you in May. And finally, we have a very strong balance sheet and won't hesitate to act on the $1.1 billion left on our share repurchase authorization.

You can never predict it perfectly because as our base gets larger, again, you expect a larger portion, again, to roll off as their brewer ages or they need to buy a new brewer. We've sold 6 million and 7 million and 8 million brewers per year for the last 3 years in POS. That creates a lot of users who need to then replace their current brewer. So you're going to sell an ever-increasing number of your brewers to replacement users. The fact that 50% of the purchasers were among new users was encouraging to us, yes. So that was slightly higher than we expected, although we want it to be even higher. You requested, on the first part of your question, a break between really the difference between prior year and the difference between our $100 million shortfall. And so that's what the difference is. If you look at versus prior year, it was all brewers and it was MINIs and Vues. Because actually 1.0 -- the combination of 1.0 and 2.0 was up 6% versus year ago. If you look at versus our plan, both impacted it. The MINI impacted it. Vue didn't impact it because we planned on Vue going away. We didn't count on any Vue sales this year. If you look at our $100 million miss versus plan, it was due to a combination of the MINI issue as well as 2.0 and 1.0 combination sales that we expected to be higher. We attribute that to the fact that they got off to a slow start. The 2.0 did get off to a slow start because of the consumer confusion, and it improves as time goes on. Now we're bringing in the K200 because one of the things we do expect and we see is that the K200 appeals to new users. It's a slimmer look. It's a lower price point. It's a reservoir brewer. The consumer can get in. Fran, would you add anything?"

So I think what we saw was in this key holiday season, we continued to sell a tremendous amount of brewers, as we noted in our call, 4.3 million brewers. I think we had a lot of units, but I think the whole coffee maker category slowed down. Some analogies we're hearing is more people bought iPhones and things like that for holiday gifting. So that's really the major reason we believe we missed our brewer estimates, because we were using -- we didn't even plan on an up 10%. We actually took it down a bit because we had such strong promotions last year. We anticipated slightly down from the up 10% for the holiday, But we didn't plan on it going minus 14% the whole category."

You heard in my remarks that 80% of those very low ratings, the 1-star ratings, when we've track and analyze them, 80% of them were caused by the noncompatible pack issue. So we know that's a transitory issue. That's going to resolve itself. And it's going to resolve itself with some speed over time here as we get through retailers clear of all of that old inventory. There still are some unlicensed packs out there though that will continue to be a challenge for the consumer if it doesn't work in the system. So if you look at the growth though of our system, to get to your second portion, the installed base growth in the mid-teens we think is very healthy. We think it's healthy, and that's something we see can continue in the future. And when we look at the penetration rate of brewers here, of single-serve brewers here in the U.S. and Canada, and you look at the roughly 16% where we are today, 16%, roughly 17% and you compare that to some of the countries I mentioned -- and I just mentioned the ones that are all over 40%. 40% of the U.S. 120 million population, you're talking about nearly 50 million households. And so we continue to see 50 million-plus households as a very realistic target long-term for where this system can be. We know that we have a lot of things we can do, and in our innovation pipeline: new designs of brewers, unique things that we can bring to the brewer that the consumer loves, some of which they've asked for, some of which they don't ask for. And we know we can thrill them with new innovation. So we're still very confident that the 50 million-plus is going to be something we can achieve over time. I'll mention one other thing. And that is, we mentioned a bit in the script, and that is the way consumers are buying, particularly younger consumers are buying products today, electronics today, they're joining a system. They're joining a brand. And so we're testing some pretty unique and innovative ways to get consumers in a way they want to buy and come in. We also know, as we expand the beverages that we offer, we know younger consumers drink different beverages than consumers who are plus-40 and plus-50 and plus-60. So we know all of these things can continue to expand the desire for Keurig."

Second piece is, we look at the incompatibility of packs and we track in our call center and we have other ways of tracking, but most predominantly is in our call center, we can see that the portion of those calls coming in is being reduced. It gets lower each week. And it gets lower each week because there are fewer and fewer packs in the consumers' home that are old packs, that don't have the new readability. So those are the 2 most salient features we can see that are changing and that are improving that give us confidence that these are transitory issues that are -- that will be behind us."

And I believe we're 6 or 7 of the top 10 in terms of units sold. And the difference between us at #1 and the others is, I think, is vast, as you well know, Akshay.
So I think the share piece is one thing, and we'll -- the share fluctuates, but we'll get that share back. The K200 that's coming.

And we're also still in the transition with Kraft where we're not yet manufacturing all of their pods. And so that transition is going on. And so I know it's not simple to look when you see IRI data or you look at Nielsen data. A couple of points, they don't look at the entire market. IRI looks at about 55%, 50% to 60%, it ranges in there. We see the entire market. We have POS for the entire marketplace that we sell into. And so we have a very good view of this. I would also mention that it's hard to track because when -- let's just take IRI, for instance. When something that was unlicensed becomes licensed, it moves into, in essence, a Keurig brewed system. And so if the history moves with it, it's going to be really hard to track. We see our share, but sometimes the growth rates that you see in IRI are not necessarily indicative of exactly what's happening.

But there's also a lot of consumers who only want the hot. There are many consumers who only want the cold. There are consumers who want both. There are consumers who want it as 2 separate machines, consumers who want it as 1 combi omni-machine. And we're going to have to be able to deliver all of those over time to the consumer. And so as we look at the interest level, it's very, very high among current Keurig hot users, for cold. And they know it's a distinct machine. They know it's a separate machine. Many of them tell us it will go in a different place in their home, some say it will go in the same kitchen. So we don't know exactly what the future will bring in terms of how many households will want 2 machines, how many will want 1 machine combined. We also know, as I've mentioned before, that some consumers don't want it coming out of 1 machine because they believe it should be unique, that coffee shouldn't come out of the same machine that other beverages come out of.

The execution issue with this was, it was a situation of how quickly do consumers' in-home pantry stock of pods convert. And so we, months ago, back in January, we began converting our manufacturing.

They have to then -- we converted all our plants. All the retailer inventory has to convert. The retailer stores have to convert. And then what happens, what you never really have visibility to is what's in the consumers' home. And what we learned -- and we knew that we didn't know, at least we were somewhat wise enough to know what we don't know. You really can't tell what consumer in-home stock is. And so we planned for that conversion. For the most part, it converted well, but it was too slow. When we look at it in hindsight, I would judge us as too slow in converting it. Some of it is you -- the consumer had maybe more stock of -- some of the slowest moving SKUs are the hardest ones to convert. The fast-moving coffees we have, the Green Mountain brand, the Starbucks brand, the Folgers brand, the big brands in the system, converted quickly because those are SKUs that move quickly.

Maybe there is not as large an addressable incremental market? Is it income-weighted? Or just sort of how you think -- or maybe do you just think that maybe this didn't reaccelerate sort of as consumers get more comfortable with the functionality of 2.0 and, to your point, the issues about compatibility of pods and stuff.

Let me address the 3 or 4 things that we think have the ability to accelerate and even reaccelerate growth in the installed base. Now the first is, we're getting smarter and smarter about what a quality installed base is, meaning a household -- we know that, for instance, if we break into deciles, the households that have Keurig in their home. And we look at that top 10%, top 20%, top 30% of the households, they're doing obviously a disproportionate number of pods and the attachment rate is quite high, much higher than what the average and the mean would be across the entire group. But yet, we're selling brewers to the bottom 10%, that decile that is doing very few brewers -- very few portion packs, sorry. So we're looking at how do we target the households that will brew a lot of coffee and brew a lot of tea? We're getting smarter and smarter about that. That's one of the key marketing priorities we have. Second, the ability to get consumers' ways of joining Keurig beyond just the traditional way of buying an appliance, and we're working with our retailers to do that. We're working with subscription models, we're doing work online, we're doing work with our retailers online to understand, are there simpler, easier, better ways to attack different portions of the populations. The third, the geographic opportunity is still very, very important to us. We still are heavily, heavily skewed in terms of index toward the upper northeast where we started. If we look at the big DMAs, if you look at the big market areas across U.S. and you say, are there areas where we are at 25%, 30%, 35%, 40% of those households? And what do we do to get them? And what do we -- what can we do in the other cities to replicate it? And do we need to do unique things in certain cities? We've done very little to appeal to the southern portion where it's a large Hispanic population, we don't have Hispanic brands in the system today. We brought Smuckers' Cafe Bustelo in, which is a terrific brand, but we need more brands to appeal to Hispanic households. So we know we can do much more finite targeting to continue to grow the installed base. And then, over the longer term, we know that exciting innovation, exciting brewers, beautiful brewers, new colors, it excites the category. And we know we can create that excitement. We can drive the category, and it's about innovation. So those are some of the things that give us the confidence that we can continue to grow."

Total revenue was up 2% for the quarter versus a year",1296,"Thanks, Kristi, and good afternoon, everyone.
While we were pleased to deliver earnings per share in line with our guidance for the second quarter, our top line performance was below our expectations. Total revenue was up 2% for the quarter versus a year ago and up 3% on a currency-neutral basis driven by 14% pod volume growth that was offset by lower brewer and accessory sales.
Now Fran will detail the year-over-year drivers of the quarter in her remarks, so I'll spend my time focusing on what we're seeing in the marketplace as we continue through the Keurig 2.0 product transition. I'll also detail the actions we're taking and currently taking to position the hot platform for success ahead of the upcoming holiday season.
Let me first address brewers. With any new product introduction, there are always challenges that are front-end loaded, and our transition to 2.0 was particularly complex. Point-of-sale results were not as strong as anticipated, which led to higher levels of brewer inventory at retail and on our balance sheet. Some of this was due to consumer confusion around pod compatibility, which we've mentioned in the past. Although we're seeing improvement as we transition more formerly unlicensed brands into manufacturing system.
Our second challenge has been the inability to address key entry level brewer price points. And third, customer feedback suggests we should reintroduce My K-Cup accessory and enhance some brewer features.
Turning to pods. Volume in the measured channels continues to be healthy at 17% total category growth in the quarter according to IRI. However, we saw weakness in several unmeasured channels, including the specialty channels, digital and Dunkin' Donuts retail stores, which reduced total system category growth to the low teens.
With respect to our owned brand of volumes, we've experienced some share loss as we focused on innovation for partner brands as they were introduced into the system. Also, our price gaps widened versus the competition.
This one other element to note that affected our pod volume. In bringing Kraft into our system, we agreed to a multiyear transition plan for manufacturing. Today, we manufacture only a portion of Kraft's pods, and they recently launched Mc Café, which we do not yet manufacturer. And while difficult to forecast with precision, we estimate that total Keurig system volume would have been a few hundred basis points higher if we were manufacturing the pods for all Kraft brands.
Having outlined where we stand, I'd now like to address our plan to get the brewer product transition behind us and how we'll adapt to compete more effectively in the fast-evolving competitive landscape within the pod category.
So let me start with brewers. First, the pricing of our 2.0 brewer portfolio has not allowed us to effectively participate in historically highest volume single serve segment, the $79 to $119 retail price point. We did not have these offerings fully available in the first half of the year. We intend to address this issue with the digital launch of our K200 in May and its retail launch this summer. We are also continuing to restart the many retail. And its return, combined with the K200 launch, will give us 2 strong offering in this key price point range for the latter part of fiscal 2015 and for the upcoming holiday season.
Second. Beginning in June of this year, 2.0 brewer packaging will more prominently communicate the fact that the Keurig 2.0 brews more than 500 varieties across more than 70 brands, including the top 10 brands. We expect this to help clear up the misperception that the system only brews Green Mountain or Keurig-owned brands.
Third, we are planning to reintroduce the My K-Cup accessory for the holiday season, which will allow consumers to once again brew any coffee they choose in their Keurig brewer. Our new My K-Cup accessory will work in Keurig 2.0 and importantly, will respond to the small but passionate amount of consumers who expressed their strong desire to see it in the Keurig 2.0.
Finally, we'll be making a number of brewer enhancements for the holiday season, including more sizes, additional temperature control capability and easier hot water dispenser and a continued evolution of the brew process. We expect these actions, along with incremental promotional programs with our retail partners, to bring our brewer inventory down to more typical levels over the next several quarters.
Turning to pods. transitioning a large number of unlicensed brands into our system over a short period of time has required a significant amount of effort by our beverage team. Now that a majority of that transition work is done, they are now fully focused on reinvigorating innovation across our own brands, and we expect to see these products in the marketplace over the next several quarters.
Specifically, we began shipping in February 2 new Green Mountain brand owner varieties and are expanding our premium offering with the launch of Green Mountain Organic, Green Mountain Reserve and our Man brand, all of which will begin shipping in the June-July time frame. We will also introduce numerous seasonal offerings in the fall under the Green Mountain Coffee brand and the Donut Shop brand to drive incremental volume.
Finally, our new packaging, which includes enhanced branding and graphics, is rolling out across our portfolio of beverages over the next several quarters. Our new packaging is tested well with stronger purchase intent and shelf visibility scores.
Other initiatives to improve pod volumes include offering larger sizes with greater variety. Specifically, we launched the new K-MUG line of coffees on keurig.com in April, which will enable consumers to brew travel mug sizes between 12 and 18 ounces. We are launching 4 new varieties on keurig.com this fall, which will expand the K-MUG line to 9 varieties. We will also continue to expand varieties in Kraft launching 8 new varieties this spring, and we expect to add additional K Kraft partner brands this fall.
While the initiatives I described above on pods and brewers will address the current transition, they will require a few quarters to take hold. Therefore, we are revising our guidance to better reflect brewer sale through trends and their associated impact on the installed base. It also factors in the pod share shifts I referenced earlier as well as a slightly accelerated level of investment in Keurig KOLD.
One last operational issue that's not factored into our guidance is incremental productivity. As we move from a coffee company to a multi-category beverage company, it's critical that our organization become more efficient and effective. To that end, we are reviewing all aspects of our operations over the next 60 to 90 days and believe we can make meaningful changes that will yield a better structure for a multi-system company. This should improve performance and allow us to fund important growth priorities.
Although we're not in a position today to discuss the plan, we will lay it out in greater detail on our third quarter earnings call.
In summary, we have some work to do with the consumer to increase the adoption of our 2.0 platform, and we expect to resolve these issues over the next several quarters. As far as longer term, we remain very confident in our strategy and continue to see strong growth prospects for the Keurig hot system as U.S. single serve household penetration slowly moves closer to levels seen in other countries where single serve system adoption is more mature.
Combined with our forthcoming KOLD system launch, which is on track for the fall of 2015, we expect to be the leading player in the growing trend to offer premium beverage systems at home.
I'll now turn the call over to Fran to discuss the detail of our second quarter and our guidance."
334622,291450257,805941,"Keurig Green Mountain, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, May 06, 2015",2015-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian. For the second quarter, we generated net sales of $1.1 billion, up 2% versus the prior year quarter and up 3%, excluding currency impacts. Core Keurig Beverage System net sales increased 3% in the quarter and 4%, excluding currency impacts.",1319,"Thanks, Brian. For the second quarter, we generated net sales of $1.1 billion, up 2% versus the prior year quarter and up 3%, excluding currency impacts. Core Keurig Beverage System net sales increased 3% in the quarter and 4%, excluding currency impacts. As expected, brewer and accessory net sales declined 23%. Brewer volume declined 22% due not only to a difficult comparison in the prior-year quarter, but high inventory levels at retail that negatively impacted shipments.
Brewer net price realization declined by 1 percentage point, and they were up 2 percentage points of positive mix. Pod revenue grew 7%. Volume increased 14% with 1 percentage point of pricing offset by 7 percentage points of negative mix and a roughly 1 percentage point unfavorable impact from currency.
Given the always competitive pod environmental, we were not able to achieve the price realization we had expected. Pod volumes for the quarter came in below our expectation. This was due to softer-than-expected performance in certain channels such as specialty and digital, along with Dunkin' Donuts store sales performing below our expectation. Pod volumes were also affected by lower installed base growth due to weaker brewer sales and somewhat higher-than-expected consumer price elasticity at retail. In addition, the success of Mc Café in the quarter had a larger-than-expected impact on volumes.
In addition to volumes, mix was worse than expected driven by weakness in our digital channel that Brian referenced earlier, strong promotions by some of our partner brands and lower levels of innovation on our own brands.
If we break down results regionally, for the quarter, our U.S. business had revenue growth of 3% while our Canadian business declined 5%. Excluding the impact of currency, the Canadian business grew 6% for the quarter.
Moving on to a review of gross profit. For the quarter, our gross margin declined 80 basis points to 40.7% of net sales. This was largely driven by benefits from a shift in sales between brewers and pods versus the prior year and supply chain productivity, offset by higher obsolescence, higher coffee costs negative mix. A major component of the higher obsolescence was a $10 million charge related to lower-than-anticipated sales of the Rivo brewer.
Turning to operating results. Non-GAAP SG&A increased by 8% in the quarter. As a percentage of sales, non-GAAP SG&A increased by 100 basis points to 17.8% of sales as we continue to invest in R&D ahead of our Keurig KOLD launch later this year and experienced higher expenses associated with information technology and supporting our call centers.
Our non-GAAP operating profit declined 5% for the quarter, reflecting significant investment in our upcoming Keurig KOLD platform and due to the $10 million Rivo obsolescence charge.
Our second quarter tax rate of 34.8% was favorable to our prior year period tax rate of 35.8%. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.03 came in at the midpoint of our guidance range. Non-GAAP EPS, excluding dilution from 2014 equity transactions and foreign exchange, was $1.16. The foreign exchange impact on EPS was a negative $0.05 and dilution was $0.08.
Turning to the balance sheet and free cash flow. During the second quarter, we spent approximately $624 million to repurchase shares from Lavazza and repurchased an additional 213 million of shares in the open market. Our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.4x.
We generated free cash flow of $133 million year-to-date, which was below the prior year period. This was primarily due to high inventory levels and higher capital expenditures related to our new Keurig KOLD launch.
Moving on to guidance. For the third quarter, we expect net sales to be flat to up low single digits and non-GAAP EPS of $0.75 to $0.80 per share. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the 32% to 32.5% range. We expect our third quarter revenue to be impacted by several factors: negative brewer shipment growth year-over-year as we continue to work through inventory levels at retail and lap 13% shipment growth in the prior year; pod volumes affected by continued conversion of formerly unlicensed brands into the Keurig system; the launch of Dunkin' Donuts K-Cup pod at retail, continuing negative mix and elasticity to higher pricing on our own brands. The net effect of these factors is pod revenue growth slightly higher than the second quarter.
Finally, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact total revenue growth by approximately 2 percentage points.
Our third quarter EPS guidance is impacted by the following factors: we expect brewers to be a smaller percentage of mix versus the prior year period, which will positively impact margins year-over-year. This will be offset by higher 2.0 brewer costs as compared to the 1.0 brewers. Pod mix is expected to negatively impact margin. Commodity will be a greater headwind in Q3 on both a year-over-year basis and versus what we experienced in Q2. We are lapping a significant logistics productivity benefit in the prior year, continued investment in Keurig KOLD. We fully lap the Coca-Cola equity transaction the second quarter and begin to lap the Lavazza equity transaction mid-third quarter.
Foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.02. And finally, our guidance in bps, the share repurchases that we have made year-to-date.
Now moving to our full year guidance. For fiscal 2015, we now expect flat to low single-digit net sales relative to fiscal 2014. We're revising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to a mid-single-digit decline. Our EPS guidance embeds the share repurchases.
Our revenue guidance reflects an approximately negative 2 percentage point impact from foreign exchange, a 1 point headwind due to lapping the benefit of retailer pre-ordering ahead of the year-end SAP implementation and the adverse impact from pod mix related to new brands entering the system.
The reduction in our full year revenue guidance takes into account second quarter results, lower brewer sales estimates for the balance of the year, lower pod revenue growth due to a slightly lower estimated growth rate in the installed base and entire negative mix. Please note that the prior-year SAP benefit was entirely in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
With respect to gross margins, we will still see benefits from pod pricing and productivity as well as brewers compromising a smaller portion of our business versus prior year. Headwinds include higher commodity costs, higher costs on the Keurig 2.0 brewer versus 1.0 and negative pod mix as we continue to transition formerly unlicensed brands into the Keurig system.
With respect to coffee costs, we are now more than 95% locked for fiscal 2015, but at higher rates than fiscal 2014. Coffee costs will be a headwind for the remainder of fiscal year 2015. We will continue to invest in our KOLD platform. With our guidance taking into account investments slightly above the high end of the previously mentioned range of $50 million to $100 million with acceleration in the back half of the year as we move closer to launch. We anniversary-ed the Coca-Cola equity transaction dilution in the second quarter and begin to anniversary the Lavazza equity transaction dilution in the third quarter, which will positively impact EPS growth in the second half of the year.
And finally, our non-GAAP EPS guidance includes a $0.14 negative impact from foreign exchange, a 34.5% to 35% tax rate and includes the impact of share repurchases.
From a cash flow perspective, we expect free cash flow in the range of $120 million to $170 million and capital investment in the range of $425 million to $475 million. in our capital investment guidance is North America hot platform investment within our previously mentioned 4% to 7% of revenue target with the remainder representing investment in new products and platforms.
With respect to fiscal year 2016, we will be providing our guidance as per our typical practice on our fourth quarter earnings call.
Now I'll turn the call back to Brian to wrap up."

Closing, we have an extraordinary valuable asset in our Keurig brand, and we're fortunate to have the finest beverage brand partners of any home beverage system in the world. Our current partnerships are strong, and we continue to add new ones, such at the New England Coffee and Luzianne tea brands, and we expand current partner relationships such as the Dunkin' Donuts retail launch.
We are taking decisive steps to position our hot system for success over the long term and are excited to showcase Keurig KOLD at next week's investor event.

And so when I look at that -- from that standpoint, that's where we were in the quarter in terms of POS. As we look in the next 2 quarters, we know we will promote brewers in order to get -- move the inventory through and be ready for success in the holiday season, and that's what's going to be really important to us, particularly also as we launch 200, the K200, we want to make sure that we're right in the thick of the price point that we need to be in with that K200 all the while we bring the MINI back and we continue to restock the MINI.

So when you compare to the prior years as well as sequentially, Q2, that's one of the things also. Higher investment were really at the point where we're go in a lot more of the preproduction cost of getting the plants up on the capsule or the plant up in the capsules. So that's affecting us as well as a drag on EPS. And also, just continued, we believe our estimates have more of a negative mix from the portion packs side in Q3 compared to Q2."

I think we haven't changed 1 bit the long-term opportunity of 50 million plus household that we think we can target single serve Keurig brewers in. I would say that if you look at this year and if you look at the growth rate, we think it's probably in the 10% to 15% range. We would have said -- in the first quarter, we would have told you it's probably the high end of that. We say now it's a lower to mid range of that. And if you look at what's happening in total single serve, the single serve market we think is as attractive as ever. The consumer has indicated no lack of interest in single serve. In fact, it continues to grow at a healthy rate. So we don't see any change there. We're still the leader. We're still in a very, very good position. And we see in the future short term and midterm and long term very, very healthy growth for single serve and for Keurig within it. We know that a large portion of single serve brewer sales occur below $100. And if you look at in the first half, we didn't have an offering at that price point. The MINI Plus was not in the market and we didn't have the 200 launched. Both of those will be coming. We'll be ready in the market with those who, which get us in the sweet spot of the price points for single serve brewers. And we have a number of other actions, which I outlined that we'll take to make sure that we continue to grow the installed base."

We mentioned that Kraft brands were not using at all of them, and then there are still a number of quarters that are not fairly producing. And so those are coming.

And we continue to be aggressive in terms of welcoming other unlicensed in to make sure that we offer consumers the best brand in our system. We also are very excited.

If you look at the price points, you're right, Akshay, that the MINI has a lower attachment rate because it doesn't have a reservoir. and so you're accurate there. What we're excited about with the 200 is that it's going to be at that promotionally $99 price point and it does have a reservoir. It's a smaller footprint. It's a beautiful design. It's modern. It's progressive. It looks terrific, and we think we will do quite well. So it will have all the benefits of a reservoir brewer with 2.0 capability from K-Cup through mug and Kraft. It'll be able to do all the SKUs we have as well it has full reservoir, and it will be at an attractive price point. So you're -- that, we expect to have the same level of attachment that any other reservoir brew would have. And on the marketing front, you asked a question Mark is a terrific add. He's a very seasoned and capable marketer. He is not only helping in terms of positioning thoroughly the Keurig brand as we expand beyond coffee and we expand to cold beverages. He's really helping as well as we build our own brand and coffee, the Green Mountain brand, the donut shop brand, our Laughing Man brand, the brands that we have that do quite well in the marketplace, Mark is helping us clarify and sharpen those. I think the other key piece, if we look at the 2.0 launch, we did not communicate effectively -- as effectively as we could have been the variety this is in the machine. And it -- there was were many consumers who thought that it only brew Green Mountain brand or Keurig-owned brands. And we didn't get the message out effectively. We didn't get it out quickly enough, and we didn't get it out broadly enough to dispel that rumor that was out there and to dispel the confusion consumers had. so Mark comes in with experience and is really helping. It will be an enormous advantage for KOLD as well as we launch KOLD and as we build that platform over time."

But I guess I'm just left with a lingering question of how we can truly have confidence that you've given yourself enough cushion in this new outlook given the recent execution. I mean, how much of what you laid out in those prepared remarks is new versus what you had planned as of January and February?

We're not going to comment beyond 2015, but we're not coming off a long-term algorithm for the company. If you look at the year itself reflecting -- certainly reflecting the first half of the year, the results in the first half of the year, we want to make sure the guidance is realistic, it is achievable and it reflects the transition we are going through. There's no inconsistency in the fact that transition we talked about last quarter is the same transition we're talking about this quarter. We're smarter now. We know what the transition elements need to be. Some of the plans were in place, many of these are new because we have a clear indication both on brewers and pods of what's actually happening in the market. And it's complex. There's no question it is complex. It Is not a simple process to transition like this. It is strategically critical that we do it, and that's why we're going through this. And if we look at lower pod volumes, given that lower installed base, it really flows from there. We don't get the installed base, particularly when you don't get it in the holiday season, which is when the brewer sell, you're going to have the challenges. It's very difficult to make it up in the rest of the year. That said, what got a bit worse was the price realization that price elasticity hit. It's competitive out there on pods, there's no question. And if you look at the mix impact we had as all of these new brands come in and the mix impact we have is real. So we're -- we think the guidance is realistic, we think it's achievable, and we're committed to the action plans."

The consumer -- the predominant message the consumer gave us, it's different between new users and current owners of Keurig. So the current owner of Keurig was obviously the one who had challenges with pod compatibility, and that was the major issue. There's really no way to go through a transition like this without going through those issues. And so our plan has been and continues to be shorten the time the consumer feels that, that challenge and that pain. And you do it by moving to the inventory as early as you can and bring in, welcoming us or any brands as you can bet there's really no way to do this transition without going through some of that. So the first thing is making sure we are clear. I mentioned earlier, we want to make sure that we are communicating very clearly that the variety is enormous, more than any 1 household needs when you have over 500 varieties and 70 plus brands. I'll tell you, the other thing we heard loud and clear from the consumer, while very small percent of consumers, a very vocal and intense, passionate consumer who really wanted the My K-Cup back. What we learned is that it's important -- the message and the signal it send, the ethos that it send is that we want to consumers to be able to brew every brand, any brand of coffee in their machine and bringing the My K-Cup back allows that. So we heard that loud and clear from the consumer. So if you look at other learnings from the consumer, those would have been the 2 critical ones. Steve, did you have another follow-up on that?"

And when we went to SAP and we went through the conversion of SAP, we had to move to 1 system. And that changed -- it changed the consumer pattern of how to order because one of them had to change the way they went through with. And that's hard for consumers. When you change the digital path that they have to follow and the click stream that they have to follow in order to order pods, you're going to lose some of that pod business, and that's what happened in digital. It's really that simple. And so we've been in the process of each month and each with consumers both on the Green Mountain side and Keurig side now as 1 keurig.com building up satisfaction ratings as customers get more and more satisfied. this is something, by the way Mark Baynes, our new CMO, is deeply into and deeply capable of really helping and managing. And again, there's a transition on that, that when you have 2 different methods of selling pods and brewers online and you convert to one, you're going to have some dissatisfied consumers as you -- and some bumps on the road as you go through this. And that's what happened in digital. We continue to be very excited about the digital business and about the things we can do online. It's a tremendous capability for us.

And so that's the first step in the evolution. And so a lot of effort went into this thought on My K-Cup. So let me explain exactly what the My K-Cup was and will be. What is was, was a terrific addition for the consumer. It wasn't used a lot. It didn't make a lot of volume. It didn't -- but it was a nice -- for a consumer, it was a nice element to have if they were given coffee as a gift and bad coffee, they put the My K-Cup in there and perhaps didn't have it in a pod. And so it was a nice convenience for a lot of our very, very loyal and heavy users. They didn't use it frequently, but they used it. And importantly, it gave them the ability to brew any brand they wanted. And so when we took it away and we took it away because that particular my K-Cup wasn't going to work with the new system as they new system had to identify the pod versus a Kraft. So we took the My K-Cup away. And quite honestly, we were wrong. We missed -- we didn't -- we underestimated it, this easiest way to shape the underestimated what the passion of the. And we didn't and we realized it, we're bringing it back because it was -- we missed it. We shouldn't have taken it away. We did, we're bringing it back."

It's by pod brand, by the brand because it's what you do for that individual brand and what role we play, whether we're purchasing coffee, whether we're roasting the coffee, grinding it, putting it in a pod, who sells it. And that really differs by brand. In some ways, it's linked to a partner but in many cases, it's by a brand. And so if you look at where we are today, we really -- it's very difficult to bring in all of the more than 25 unlicensed brands we've brought in last year and expect to see the kind of consistency in margin. There's not dramatic inconsistency, but it's not what it used to historically be, which is we -- the company used to be able to say that it was somewhat indifferent -- actually indifferent to operating profit by pod regardless of which brand. And the -- but it wouldn't be accurate to say that anymore because there is a difference. Again it's not a dramatic difference, and we had healthy profit across all brands in the system. But when you look at the value chain and you look at this the different things you do for a private-label player or a small brand, a large brand, a nationally distributed brand, global brand and their capability, you do very, very different things. In some cases, the margins may be slightly higher or slightly lower. So it's more accurate now to say that while we have very, very healthy margins across the entire portfolio, they're not identical."

Total revenue was up 2% for the quarter versus a year",1296,"Thanks, Kristi, and good afternoon, everyone.
While we are pleased to deliver earnings per share in line with our guidance for the second quarter, our top line performance was below our expectations. Total revenue was up 2% for the quarter versus a year ago and up 3% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by 14% pod volume growth that was offset by lower brewer and accessory sales.
Now Fran will detail the year-over-year drivers of the quarter in her remarks, so I'll spend my time focusing on what we're seeing in the marketplace as we continue through the Keurig 2.0 product transition. I'll also detail the actions we're taking and currently taking to position the hot platform for success ahead of the upcoming holiday season.
Let me first address brewers. With any new product introduction, there are always challenges that are front-end loaded, and our transition to 2.0 was particularly complex. Point-of-sale results were not as strong as anticipated, which led to higher levels of brewer inventory at retail and on our balance sheet. Some of this was due to consumer confusion around pod compatibility, which we've mentioned in the past. Although we're seeing improvement as we transition more formerly unlicensed brands into our manufacturing system.
Our second challenge has been the inability to address key entry level brewer price points. And third, customer feedback suggests we should reintroduce the My K-Cup accessory and enhance some brewer features.
Turning to pods. Volume in the measured channels continues to be healthy at 17% total category growth in the quarter according to IRI. However, we saw weakness in several unmeasured channels, including the specialty channels, digital and Dunkin' Donuts retail stores, which reduced total system category growth to the low teens.
With respect to our owned brand volumes, we've experienced some share loss as we focused on innovation for partner brands as they were introduced into the system. Also, our price gaps widened versus the competition.
There's one other element to note that affected our pod volume. In bringing Kraft into our system, we agreed to a multiyear transition plan for manufacturing. Today, we manufacture only a portion of Kraft's pods, and they recently launched McCafe, which we do not yet manufacturer. And while difficult to forecast with precision, we estimate that total Keurig system volume would have been a few hundred basis points higher if we were manufacturing the pods for all Kraft brands.
Having outlined where we stand, I'd now like to address our plan to get the brewer product transition behind us and how we'll adapt to compete more effectively in the fast-evolving competitive landscape within the pod category.
So let me start with brewers. First, the pricing of our 2.0 brewer portfolio has not allowed us to effectively participate in historically highest-volume Single Serve segment, the $79 to $119 retail price point. We did not have these offerings fully available in the first half of the year. We intend to address this issue with the digital launch of our K200 in May and its retail launch this summer. We are also continuing to restart the MINI at retail. And its return, combined with the K200 launch, will give us 2 strong offerings in this key price point range for the latter part of fiscal 2015 and for the upcoming holiday season.
Second. Beginning in June of this year, 2.0 brewer packaging will more prominently communicate the fact that the Keurig 2.0 brews more than 500 varieties across more than 70 brands, including the top 10 brands. We expect this to help clear up the misperception the system only brews Green Mountain or Keurig-owned brands.
Third, we are planning to reintroduce the My K-Cup accessory for the upcoming holiday season, which will allow consumers to once again brew any coffee they choose in their Keurig brewer. Our new My K-Cup accessory will work in Keurig 2.0 and importantly, will respond to the small but passionate number of consumers who expressed their strong desire to see it in the Keurig 2.0.
Finally, we'll be making a number of brewer enhancements for the holiday season, including more sizes, additional temperature control capability and easier hot water dispense feature and a continued evolution of the brew process. We expect these actions, along with incremental promotional programs with our retail partners, to bring our brewer inventory down to more typical levels over the next several quarters.
Turning to pods. Transitioning a large number of unlicensed brands into our system over a short period of time has required a significant amount of effort by our beverage team. Now that a majority of that transition work is done, they are now fully focused on reinvigorating innovation across our own brands, and we expect to see these products in the marketplace over the next several quarters.
Specifically, we began shipping in February, 2 new Green Mountain brand owner varieties and are expanding our premium offering with the launch of Green Mountain Organic, Green Mountain Reserve and our Laughing Man brand, all of which will begin shipping in the June/July time frame. We will also introduce numerous seasonal offerings in the fall under the Green Mountain Coffee brand and the Donut Shop brand to drive incremental volume.
Finally, our new packaging, which includes enhanced branding and graphics, is rolling out across our portfolio of beverages over the next several quarters. Our new packaging is tested well with stronger purchase intent and shelf visibility scores.
Other initiatives to improve pod volumes include offering larger sizes with greater variety. Specifically, we launched the new K-Mug line of coffees on keurig.com in April, which will enable consumers to brew travel mug sizes between 12 and 18 ounces. We are launching 4 new varieties on keurig.com this fall, which will expand the K-Mug line to 9 varieties. We will also continue to expand varieties in K-Carafe launching 8 new varieties this spring, and we expect to add additional K-Carafe partner brands this fall.
While the initiatives I described above on pods and brewers will address the current transition, they will require a few quarters to take hold. Therefore, we are revising our guidance to better reflect brewer sell-through trends and their associated impact on the installed base. It also factors in the pod share shifts I referenced earlier as well as a slightly accelerated level of investment in Keurig KOLD.
One last operational issue that's not factored into our guidance is incremental productivity. As we move from a coffee company to a multi-category beverage company, it's critical that our organization become more efficient and effective. To that end, we are reviewing all aspects of our operations over the next 60 to 90 days and believe we can make meaningful changes that will yield a better structure for a multi-system company. This should improve performance and allow us to fund important growth priorities.
Although we're not in a position today to discuss the plan, we will lay it out in greater detail on our third quarter earnings call.
In summary, we have some work to do with the consumer to increase the adoption of our 2.0 platform, and we expect to resolve these issues over the next several quarters. As far as the longer term, we remain very confident in our strategy and continue to see strong growth prospects for the Keurig hot system as U.S. Single Serve household penetration slowly moves closer to levels seen in other countries, where single-serve system adoption is more mature.
Combined with our forthcoming KOLD system launch, which is on track for the fall of 2015, we expect to be the leading player in the growing trend to offer premium beverage systems at home.
I'll now turn the call over to Fran to discuss the details of our second quarter and our guidance."
334622,291450257,806200,"Keurig Green Mountain, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, May 06, 2015",2015-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian. For the second quarter, we generated net sales of $1.1 billion, up 2% versus the prior year quarter and up 3% excluding currency impacts. Core Keurig Beverage System net sales increased 3% in the quarter and 4% excluding currency impacts. A",1323,"Thanks, Brian. For the second quarter, we generated net sales of $1.1 billion, up 2% versus the prior year quarter and up 3% excluding currency impacts. Core Keurig Beverage System net sales increased 3% in the quarter and 4% excluding currency impacts. As expected, brewer and accessory net sales declined 23%. Brewer volume declined 22%, due not only to a difficult comparison in the prior-year quarter, but high inventory levels at retail that negatively impacted shipments.
Brewer net price realization declined by 1 percentage point, and they were 2 percentage points of positive mix. Pod revenue grew 7%. Volume increased 14% with 1 percentage point of pricing offset by 7 percentage points of negative mix and a roughly 1 percentage point unfavorable impact from currency.
Given the always competitive pod environmental, we were not able to achieve the price realization we had expected. Pod volumes for the quarter came in below our expectation. This was due to softer-than-expected performance in certain channels such as specialty and digital, along with Dunkin' Donuts store sales performing below our expectation. Pod volumes were also affected by lower installed base growth due to weaker brewer sales and somewhat higher-than-expected consumer price elasticity at retail. In addition, the success of McCafe in the quarter had a larger-than-expected impact on volumes.
In addition to volumes, mix was worse than expected, driven by weakness in our digital channel that Brian referenced earlier, strong promotions by some of our partner brands and lower levels of innovation on our own brands.
If we break down results regionally, for the quarter, our U.S. business had revenue growth of 3% while our Canadian business declined 5%. Excluding the impact of currency, the Canadian business grew 6% for the quarter.
Moving on to a review of gross profit. For the quarter, our gross margin declined 80 basis points to 40.7% of net sales. This was largely driven by benefits from a shift in sales between brewers and pods versus the prior year and supply chain productivity, offset by higher obsolescence, higher coffee costs and negative mix. A major component of the higher obsolescence was a $10 million charge related to lower-than-anticipated sales of the Rivo brewer.
Turning to operating results. Non-GAAP SG&A increased by 8% in the quarter. As a percentage of sales, non-GAAP SG&A increased by 100 basis points to 17.8% of sales as we continue to invest in R&D ahead of our Keurig KOLD launch later this year and experienced higher expenses associated with information technology and supporting our call centers.
Our non-GAAP operating profit declined 5% for the quarter, reflecting significant investment in our upcoming Keurig KOLD platform and due to the $10 million Rivo obsolescence charge.
Our second quarter tax rate of 34.8% was favorable to our prior year period tax rate of 35.8%. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.03 came in at the midpoint of our guidance range. Non-GAAP EPS, excluding dilution from 2014 equity transactions and foreign exchange, was $1.16. The foreign exchange impact on EPS was a negative $0.05 and dilution was $0.08.
Turning to the balance sheet and free cash flow. During the second quarter, we spent approximately $624 million to repurchase shares from Lavazza and repurchased an additional 213 million of shares in the open market. Our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.4x. We generated free cash flow of $133 million year-to-date, which was below the prior year period. This was primarily due to high inventory levels and higher capital expenditures related to our new Keurig KOLD launch.
Moving on to guidance. For the third quarter, we expect net sales to be flat to up low single digits and non-GAAP EPS of $0.75 to $0.80 per share. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the 32% to 32.5% range. We expect our third quarter revenue to be impacted by several factors: negative brewer shipment growth year-over-year as we continue to work through inventory levels at retail and lap 13% shipment growth in the prior year, pod volumes affected by continued conversion of formerly unlicensed brands into the Keurig system, the launch of Dunkin' Donuts K-Cup pods at retail, continuing negative mix and elasticity to higher pricing on our own brands. The net effect of these factors is pod revenue growth slightly higher than the second quarter.
Finally, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact total revenue growth by approximately 2 percentage points.
Our third quarter EPS guidance is impacted by the following factors: we expect brewers to be a smaller percentage of mix versus the prior year period, which will positively impact margins year-over-year. This will be offset by higher 2.0 brewer costs as compared to the 1.0 brewers. Pod mix is expected to negatively impact margins. Commodities will be a greater headwind in Q3 on both a year-over-year basis and versus what we experienced in Q2. We are lapping a significant logistics productivity benefit in the prior year. Continued investment in Keurig KOLD. We fully lapped the Coca-Cola equity transaction in the second quarter and begin to lap the Lavazza equity transaction mid-third quarter.
Foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact the EPS by approximately $0.02. And finally, our guidance embeds the share repurchases that we have made year-to-date.
Now moving to our full year guidance. For fiscal 2015, we now expect flat to low single-digit net sales relative to fiscal 2014. We are revising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to a mid-single-digit decline. Our EPS guidance embeds the share repurchases.
Our revenue guidance reflects an approximately negative 2 percentage point impact from foreign exchange, a 1 point headwind due to lapping the benefit of retailer pre-ordering ahead of the year-end SAP implementation and the adverse impact from pod mix related to new brands entering the system.
The reduction in our full year revenue guidance takes into account second quarter results, lower brewer sales estimates for the balance of the year, lower pod revenue growth due to a slightly lower estimated growth rate in the installed base and higher negative mix. Please note that the prior year SAP benefit was entirely in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
With respect to gross margins, we will still see benefits from pod pricing and productivity as well as brewers compromising a smaller portion of our business versus prior year. Headwinds include: Higher commodity costs, higher costs on the Keurig 2.0 brewer versus 1.0 and negative pod mix as we continue to transition formerly unlicensed brands into the Keurig system.
With respect to coffee costs, we are now more than 95% locked for fiscal 2015, but at higher rates than fiscal 2014. Coffee costs will be a headwind for the remainder of fiscal year 2015.
We will continue to invest in our KOLD platform. With our guidance taking into account investments slightly above the high end of the previously mentioned range of $50 million to $100 million with acceleration in the back half of the year as we move closer to launch.
We anniversary-ed the Coca-Cola equity transaction dilution in the second quarter and begin to anniversary the Lavazza equity transaction dilution in the third quarter, which will positively impact the EPS growth in the second half of the year.
And finally, our non-GAAP EPS guidance includes a $0.14 negative impact from foreign exchange, a 34.5% to 35% tax rate and includes the impact of share repurchases.
From a cash flow perspective, we expect free cash flow in the range of $120 million to $170 million and capital investment in the range of $425 million to $475 million. Embedded in our capital investment guidance is North America hot platform investment within our previously mentioned 4% to 7% of revenue target with the remainder representing investment in new products and platforms.
With respect to fiscal year 2016, we will be providing our guidance, as per our typical practice, on our fourth quarter earnings call.
Now I'll turn the call back to Brian to wrap up."

As you may have seen from our announcement today, we are very excited that Pete Leemputte will be joining us as our new Chief Financial Officer effective August 17 of this year, 2015. Pete has significant financial and operational experience working at a number of public companies, most recently as CFO of Mead Johnson. Given his 12 years as a public company CFO, I'm confident that he will bring valuable perspective to Keurig.
I would also like to thank Fran for contribution to Keurig over the years. She will work with Pete through the summer to ensure a smooth transition and has agreed to stay with the company through the end of September in an advisory role.
In closing, we have an extraordinary valuable asset in our Keurig brand, and we're fortunate to have the finest beverage brand partners of any home beverage system in the world. Our current partnerships are strong, and we continue to add new ones, such as the New England coffee and Luzianne tea brands, and we expand current partner relationships such as the Dunkin' Donuts retail launch.
We are taking decisive steps to position our hot system for success over the long term and are excited to showcase Keurig KOLD at next week's investor event.
Finally, we remain confident in Keurig's ability to maintain our leadership position in the growing trend to offer premium beverage systems across multiple beverage categories.

If we look at -- if you ask the question, which you did, about the reservoir brewers, when you take away the MINI brewers and the Vue brewers, it was down about 11%. And that's about where the POS was for the quarter. And so that was slightly worse than we had thought it would be. And so when I look at that -- from that standpoint, that's where we were with the quarter in terms of POS. As we look in the next 2 quarters, we know we will promote brewers in order to get -- move the inventory through and be ready for success in the holiday season, and that's what's going to be really important to us, particularly also as we launch 200, the K200, we want to make sure that we're right in the thick of the price points that we need to be in with that K200 all the while we bring the MINI back and we continue to restock the MINI.

So when you compare it to the prior year as well as sequentially, Q2, that's when things -- also higher KOLD investment, we're really at the point where we're in a lot more of the preproduction cost of getting the plants up on the capsule -- the plant up in the capsules.

In fact, it continues to grow at a healthy rate. So we don't see a change there. We're still the leader. We're still in a very, very good position. And we see in the future short, term and midterm and long term, very, very healthy growth rates for single serve and for Keurig within it. We know that a large portion of single-serve brewer sales occur below $100. And if you look in the first half, we didn't have an offering at that price point.

So I'm a little bit surprised that the emphasis is so much on that price point. And then can you talk about the change on the marketing side? I think you hired a new person there.

If you look at the price points, you're right, Akshay, that the MINI has a lower attachment rate because it doesn't have a reservoir. and so you're accurate there. What we're excited about with the 200 is that it's going to be at that promotionally $99 price point and it does have a reservoir. It's a smaller footprint. It's a beautiful design. It's modern. It's progressive. It looks terrific, and we think it will do quite well. So it will have all the benefits of a reservoir brewer with 2.0 capability from K-Cup through Mug and Kraft. It'll be able to do all of the SKUs we have, as well, it has a full reservoir and it will be at an attractive price point. So you're -- that, we expect to have the same level of attachment that any other reservoir brewer would have. And one -- on the marketing front, you asked the question, Mark Baynes is a terrific add. He's a very seasoned and capable marketer. He is not only helping in terms of positioning thoroughly the Keurig brand as we expand beyond coffee and we expand into cold beverages. He's really helping us well as we build our own brands in coffee, the Green Mountain brand, the Donut Shop brand, our Laughing Man brand, the Barista Prima, the brands we have that do quite well in the marketplace, Mark is helping us clarify and sharpen those. I think the other key piece, if we look at the 2.0 launch, we did not communicate effectively -- as effectively as we could have been the variety that is in the machine. And it -- there were many consumers who thought that it only brewed Green Mountain brand or Keurig-owned brands. And we didn't get the message out effectively, we didn't get it out quickly enough and we didn't get it out broadly enough to dispel that rumor that was out there and to dispel the confusion consumers had. So Mark comes in with enormous experience and is really helping. It will be an enormous advantage for KOLD, as well, as we launch KOLD and as we build that platform over time."

And here we are with lower full year expectations and momentum in the marketplace that's still struggling to take hold. So I appreciate all the new initiatives that you laid out in the prepared remarks. Many of them make good sense. But I guess I'm just left with the lingering question of how we can truly have confidence that you've given yourself enough cushion in this new outlook given the recent execution. I mean how much of what you laid out in those prepared remarks is new versus what you had planned as of January and February? And what's -- and what, I guess, even as your early expectation for '16, is it too aggressive to think that we're back on algorithm by then, on your long-term algorithm?

If you look at the year itself, reflecting -- certainly reflecting the first half of the year, the results in the first half of the year, we want to make sure the guidance is realistic, it is achievable and it reflects the transition we are going through. There's no inconsistency in the fact that the transition we talked about last quarter is the same transition we're talking about this quarter. We're smarter now. We know what the transition elements need to be. Some of the plans were in place, many of these are new because we have a clear indication, both on brewers and pods, of what's actually happening in the market. And it's complex. There's no question it is complex. It Is not a simple process to transition like this. It is strategically critical that we do it, and so that's why we're going through it. And if we look at lower pod volumes, given that lower installed base, it really flows from there. When you don't get the installed base, particularly when you don't get it in the holiday season, which is when the brewer sell, you're going to have the challenges. It's very difficult to make it up in the rest of the year. That said, what got a bit worse was the price realization, that price elasticity hit. It's competitive out there on pods, there's no question. And if you look at the mix impact we've had as all of these new brands come in and the mix impact we have is real. So we're -- we think these -- the guidance is realistic, we think it's achievable, and we're committed to the action plans."

So the current owner of Keurig was obviously the one who had challenges with pod compatibility, and that was the major issue. There's really no way to go through a transition like this without going through those issues. And so our plan has been and continues to be shorten the time the consumer feels that challenge and that pain. And you do that by moving through the inventory as quickly as you can and by bringing in and welcoming in as many of the unlicensed brands as you can. But there's really no way to do this transition without going through some of that. So the first thing is making sure we are clear. I mentioned earlier, we want to make sure that we are communicating very clearly that the variety is enormous, more than any one household needs when you have over 500 varieties and 70 plus brands. I'd tell you, the other thing we heard loud and clear from the consumer, while very small percent of consumers, a very vocal and intense, passionate consumer who really wanted the My K-Cup back. What we learned is that it's important -- the message and the signal that it send, the ethos that it sends is that we want consumers to be able to brew every brand, any brand of coffee in their machine, and bringing the My K-Cup back allows that. So we heard that loud and clear from the consumer. If you look at other learnings from the consumer, those would have been the 2 critical ones. Steve, did you have another follow-up on that?"

And when we went to SAP and we went to the conversion of SAP, we had to move to one system. And that changed -- it changed the consumer pattern of how to order because one of them had to change the way they went through it. And that's hard for consumers. When you change the digital path that they have to follow and the click stream that they have to follow in order to order pods, you're going to lose some of that pod business, and that's what happened in digital. It's really that simple. And so we've been in the process of, each month, and each with consumers both on the Green Mountain side and Keurig side now as one keurig.com, building up and improving those satisfaction ratings as consumers get more and more satisfied. This is something, by the way, Mark Baynes, our new CMO, is deeply into and deeply capable of really helping and managing. And again, there's a transition on that, that when you have 2 different methods of selling pods and brewers online and you convert to one, you're going to have some dissatisfied consumers as you -- and some bumps in the road as you go through this. And that's what happened in digital. We continue to be very excited about the digital business and about the things we can do online. It's a tremendous capability for us.

What is was, was a terrific addition for the consumer. It wasn't used a lot. It didn't make a lot of volume. It didn't -- but it was a nice -- for a consumer, it was a nice element to have if they were given coffee as a gift in bag coffee, they could put the My K-Cup in there and pour the coffee in from the bag that they perhaps didn't have in a pod. And so it was a nice convenience for a lot of our very, very loyal and heavy users. They didn't use it frequently, but they used it.

That's when that will be more like a traditional cost of goods sold with the labor and overhead and the depreciation on the manufacturing equipment. So that would be in cost of goods sold. And as I said, right now, where we're starting up, we have a lot of R&D people working on the KOLD product, the whole platform, as well as getting the plant ready to start making finished goods, that's all in SG&A right now. So there will be sort of cost of goods sold in Q4, sales in Q4 and continued R&D and marketing expenses in Q4."

And if you look at that, it's again a very, very small portion of the volume, but it's an important piece of the ethos to be able to brew any coffee brand you want. Part of what we have stood for is the ability to brew an enormous variety, and that is the ultimate variety because if you have a coffee that doesn't have the pod form factor, you have it in your home, you can brew it in that way. And so that allow consumer to say, ""Okay, I can bring a single-serve brewer into my home and use any coffee I want."" And that's why we're bringing it back. It's an important component.

It's by pod brand, by the brand, because it's what you do for that individual brand and what role we play, whether we're purchasing coffee, whether we're roasting the coffee, grinding it, putting it in a pod, who sells it. And that really differs by brand. In some ways, it's linked to a partner but in many cases, it's by brand. And so if you look at where we are today, you really -- it's very difficult to bring in all of the more than 25 unlicensed brands we've brought in last year and expect to see the kind of consistency in margin. There's not dramatic inconsistency, but it's not what it used to historically be, which is we -- the company used to be able to say that it was somewhat indifferent -- actually indifferent to operating profit by pod regardless of which brand. And -- but it wouldn't be accurate to say that anymore because there is a difference. It's again, it's not a dramatic difference and we have healthy profit across all brands in the system. But when you look at the value chain and you look at the different things you do for a private-label player or a small brand, a large brand, a nationally distributed brand, a global brand and their capabilities, you do very, very different things. In some cases, the margins may be slightly higher or slightly lower. So it's more accurate now to say that while we have very, very healthy margins across the entire portfolio, they're not identical."

You were a little bit disappointed by the lack of sell-through. What did that consumer do in the December quarter? Did they buy another brewer? Are they deferring purchases? And I guess, because you would think that if it takes maybe 3 years as the reasonable life of a coffee maker that if you didn't get them this past December, that maybe it takes a while before you have another shot at them. So I'm just wondering what your view is of what the consumer did in this past December quarter."

Total revenue was up 2% for the quarter versus a year",1296,"Thanks, Kristi, and good afternoon, everyone.
While we were pleased to deliver earnings per share in line with our guidance for the second quarter, our top line performance was below our expectations. Total revenue was up 2% for the quarter versus a year ago and up 3% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by 14% pod volume growth that was offset by lower brewer and accessory sales.
Now Fran will detail the year-over-year drivers of the quarter in her remarks, so I'll spend my time focusing on what we're seeing in the marketplace as we continue through the Keurig 2.0 product transition. I'll also detail the actions we're taking and currently taking to position the hot platform for success ahead of the upcoming holiday season.
Let me first address brewers. With any new product introduction, there are always challenges that are front-end loaded, and our transition to 2.0 was particularly complex. Point-of-sale results were not as strong as anticipated, which led to higher levels of brewer inventory at retail and on our balance sheet. Some of this was due to consumer confusion around pod compatibility, which we've mentioned in the past. Although we're seeing improvement as we transition more formerly unlicensed brands into our manufacturing system.
Our second challenge has been the inability to address key entry level brewer price points. And third, customer feedback suggests we should reintroduce the My K-Cup accessory and enhance some brewer features.
Turning to pods. Volume in the measured channels continues to be healthy at 17% total category growth in the quarter according to IRI. However, we saw weakness in several unmeasured channels, including the specialty channels, digital and Dunkin' Donuts retail stores, which reduced total system category growth to the low teens.
With respect to our owned brand volumes, we've experienced some share loss as we focused on innovation for partner brands as they were introduced into the system. Also, our price gaps widened versus the competition.
There's one other element to note that affected our pod volume. In bringing Kraft into our system, we agreed to a multiyear transition plan for manufacturing. Today, we manufacture only a portion of Kraft's pods, and they recently launched McCafe, which we do not yet manufacture. And while difficult to forecast with precision, we estimate that total Keurig system volume would have been a few hundred basis points higher if we were manufacturing the pods for all Kraft brands.
Having outlined where we stand, I'd now like to address our plan to get the brewer product transition behind us and how we'll adapt to compete more effectively in the fast-evolving competitive landscape within the pod category.
So let me start with brewers. First, the pricing of our 2.0 brewer portfolio has not allowed us to effectively participate in historically highest-volume Single Serve segment, the $79 to $119 retail price point. We did not have these offerings fully available in the first half of the year. We intend to address this issue with the digital launch of our K200 in May and its retail launch this summer. We are also continuing to restart the MINI at retail. And its return, combined with the K200 launch, will give us 2 strong offerings in this key price point range for the latter part of fiscal 2015 and for the upcoming holiday season.
Second. Beginning in June of this year, 2.0 brewer packaging will more prominently communicate the fact that the Keurig 2.0 brews more than 500 varieties across more than 70 brands, including the top 10 brands. We expect this to help clear up the misperception the system only brews Green Mountain or Keurig-owned brands.
Third, we are planning to reintroduce the My K-Cup accessory for the upcoming holiday season, which will allow consumers to once again brew any coffee they choose in their Keurig brewer. Our new My K-Cup accessory will work in Keurig 2.0 and importantly, will respond to the small but passionate number of consumers who expressed their strong desire to see it in the Keurig 2.0.
Finally, we'll be making a number of brewer enhancements for the holiday season, including more sizes, additional temperature control capability and easier hot water dispense feature and a continued evolution of the brew process. We expect these actions, along with incremental promotional programs with our retail partners, to bring our brewer inventory down to more typical levels over the next several quarters.
Turning to pods. Transitioning a large number of unlicensed brands into our system over a short period of time has required a significant amount of effort by our beverage team. Now that a majority of that transition work is done, they are now fully focused on reinvigorating innovation across our own brands, and we expect to see these products in the marketplace over the next several quarters.
Specifically, we began shipping in February, 2 new Green Mountain brand Donut varieties and are expanding our premium offering with the launch of Green Mountain Organic, Green Mountain Reserve and our Laughing Man brand, all of which will begin shipping in the June/July time frame. We will also introduce numerous seasonal offerings in the fall under the Green Mountain Coffee brand and the Donut Shop brand to drive incremental volume.
Finally, our new packaging, which includes enhanced branding and graphics, is rolling out across our portfolio of beverages over the next several quarters. Our new packaging is tested well with stronger purchase intent and shelf visibility scores.
Other initiatives to improve pod volumes include offering larger sizes with greater variety. Specifically, we launched the new K-Mug line of coffees on keurig.com in April, which will enable consumers to brew travel mug sizes between 12 and 18 ounces. We are launching 4 new varieties on keurig.com this fall, which will expand the K-Mug line to 9 varieties. We will also continue to expand varieties in K-Carafe launching 8 new varieties this spring, and we expect to add additional K-Carafe partner brands this fall.
While the initiatives I described above on pods and brewers will address the current transition, they will require a few quarters to take hold. Therefore, we are revising our guidance to better reflect brewer sell-through trends and their associated impact on the installed base. It also factors in the pod share shifts I referenced earlier as well as a slightly accelerated level of investment in Keurig KOLD.
One last operational issue that's not factored into our guidance is incremental productivity. As we move from a coffee company to a multi-category beverage company, it's critical that our organization become more efficient and effective. To that end, we are reviewing all aspects of our operations over the next 60 to 90 days and believe we can make meaningful changes that will yield a better structure for a multi-system company. This should improve performance and allow us to fund important growth priorities.
Although we're not in a position today to discuss the plan, we will lay it out in greater detail on our third quarter earnings call.
In summary, we have some work to do with the consumer to increase the adoption of our 2.0 platform, and we expect to resolve these issues over the next several quarters. As far as the longer term, we remain very confident in our strategy and continue to see strong growth prospects for the Keurig hot system as U.S. Single Serve household penetration slowly moves closer to levels seen in other countries, where single-serve system adoption is more mature.
Combined with our forthcoming KOLD system launch, which is on track for the fall of 2015, we expect to be the leading player in the growing trend to offer premium beverage systems at home.
I'll now turn the call over to Fran to discuss the details of our second quarter and our guidance."

For the second quarter, we generated net sales of $1.1 billion, up 2% versus the prior year quarter and up 3% excluding currency impacts. Core Keurig Beverage System net sales increased 3% in the quarter and 4% excluding currency impacts. As expected, brewer and accessory net sales declined 23%. Brewer volume declined 22%, due not only to a difficult comparison in the prior-year quarter, but high inventory levels at retail that negatively impacted shipments.
Brewer net price realization declined by 1 percentage point, and there were 2 percentage points of positive mix. Pod revenue grew 7%. Volume increased 14% with 1 percentage point of pricing offset by 7 percentage points of negative mix and a roughly 1 percentage point unfavorable impact from currency.
Given the always competitive pod environment, we were not able to achieve the price realization we had expected. Pod volumes for the quarter came in below our expectations. This was due to softer-than-expected performance in certain channels such as specialty and digital, along with Dunkin' Donuts store sales performing below our expectations. Pod volumes were also affected by lower installed base growth due to weaker brewer sales and somewhat higher-than-expected consumer price elasticity at retail. In addition, the success of McCafe in the quarter had a larger-than-expected impact on volumes.
In addition to volumes, mix was worse than expected, driven by weakness in our digital channel that Brian referenced earlier, strong promotions by some of our partner brands and lower levels of innovation on our own brands.
If we break down results regionally, for the quarter, our U.S. business had revenue growth of 3% while our Canadian business declined 5%. Excluding the impact of currency, the Canadian business grew 6% for the quarter.
Moving on to a review of gross profit. For the quarter, our gross margin declined 80 basis points to 40.7% of net sales. This was largely driven by benefits from a shift in sales between brewers and pods versus the prior year and supply chain productivity, offset by higher obsolescence, higher coffee costs and negative mix. A major component of the higher obsolescence was a $10 million charge related to lower-than-anticipated sales of the Rivo brewer.
Turning to operating results. Non-GAAP SG&A increased by 8% in the quarter. As a percentage of sales, non-GAAP SG&A increased by 100 basis points to 17.8% of sales as we continue to invest in R&D ahead of our Keurig KOLD launch later this year and experience higher expenses associated with information technology and supporting our call centers.
Our non-GAAP operating profit declined 5% for the quarter, reflecting significant investment in our upcoming Keurig KOLD platform and due to the $10 million Rivo obsolescence charge.
Our second quarter tax rate of 34.8% was favorable to our prior year period tax rate of 35.8%. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.03 came in at the midpoint of our guidance range. Non-GAAP EPS, excluding dilution from 2014 equity transactions and foreign exchange, was $1.16. The foreign exchange impact on EPS was a negative $0.05 and dilution was $0.08.
Turning to the balance sheet and free cash flow. During the second quarter, we spent approximately $624 million to repurchase shares from Lavazza and repurchased an additional 213 million of shares in the open market. Our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.4x. We generated free cash flow of $133 million year-to-date, which was below the prior year period. This was primarily due to high inventory levels and higher capital expenditures related to our new Keurig KOLD launch.
Moving on to guidance. For the third quarter, we expect net sales to be flat to up low single digits and non-GAAP EPS of $0.75 to $0.80 per share. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the 32% to 32.5% range. We expect our third quarter revenue to be impacted by several factors: negative brewer shipment growth year-over-year as we continue to work through inventory levels at retail and lap 13% shipment growth in the prior year, pod volumes affected by continued conversion of formerly unlicensed brands into the Keurig system, the launch of Dunkin' Donuts K-Cup pods at retail, continuing negative mix and elasticity to higher pricing on our own brands. The net effect of these factors is pod revenue growth slightly higher than the second quarter.
Finally, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact total revenue growth by approximately 2 percentage points.
Our third quarter EPS guidance is impacted by the following factors: we expect brewers to be a smaller percentage of mix versus the prior year period, which will positively impact margins year-over-year. This will be offset by higher 2.0 brewer costs as compared to the 1.0 brewers. Pod mix is expected to negatively impact margins. Commodities will be a greater headwind in Q3 on both a year-over-year basis and versus what we experienced in Q2. We are lapping a significant logistics productivity benefit in the prior year. Continued investment in Keurig KOLD. We fully lapped the Coca-Cola equity transaction in the second quarter and began to lap the Lavazza equity transaction mid-third quarter.
Foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact the EPS by approximately $0.02. And finally, our guidance embeds the share repurchases that we have made year-to-date.
Now moving to our full year guidance. For fiscal 2015, we now expect flat to low single-digit net sales relative to fiscal 2014. We are revising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to a mid-single-digit decline. Our EPS guidance embeds the share repurchases.
Our revenue guidance reflects an approximately negative 2 percentage point impact from foreign exchange, a 1 point headwind due to lapping the benefit of retailer pre-ordering ahead of the year-end SAP implementation and the adverse impact from pod mix related to new brands entering the system.
The reduction in our full year revenue guidance takes into account second quarter results, lower brewer sales estimates for the balance of the year, lower pod revenue growth due to a slightly lower estimated growth rate in the installed base and higher negative mix. Please note that the prior year SAP benefit was entirely in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
With respect to gross margins, we will still see benefits from pod pricing and productivity as well as brewers compromising a smaller portion of our business versus prior year. Headwinds include higher commodity costs; higher costs on the Keurig 2.0 brewer versus 1.0; and negative pod mix as we continue to transition formerly unlicensed brands into the Keurig system.
With respect to coffee costs, we are now more than 95% locked for fiscal 2015, but at higher rates than fiscal 2014. Coffee costs will be a headwind for the remainder of fiscal year 2015.
We will continue to invest in our KOLD platform. With our current guidance taking into account investments slightly above the high end of the previously mentioned range of $50 million to $100 million with acceleration in the back half of the year as we move closer to launch.
We anniversary-ed the Coca-Cola equity transaction dilution in the second quarter and begin to anniversary the Lavazza equity transaction dilution in the third quarter, which will positively impact EPS growth in the second half of the year.
And finally, our non-GAAP EPS guidance includes a $0.14 negative impact from foreign exchange; a 34.5% to 35% tax rate; and includes the impact of share repurchases.
From a cash flow perspective, we expect free cash flow in the range of $120 million to $170 million and capital investment in the range of $425 million to $475 million. Embedded in our capital investment guidance is North America hot platform investment within our previously mentioned 4% to 7% of revenue target with the remainder representing investment in new products and platforms.
With respect to fiscal year 2016, we will be providing our guidance, as per our typical practice, on our fourth quarter earnings call.
Now I'll turn the call back to Brian to wrap up."

As you may have seen from our announcement today, we are very excited that Pete Leemputte will be joining us as our new Chief Financial Officer effective August 17 of this year, 2015. Pete has significant financial and operational experience working at a number of public companies, most recently as the CFO of Mead Johnson. Given his 12 years as a public company CFO, I'm confident that he will bring valuable perspective to Keurig.
I would also like to thank Fran for contribution to Keurig over the years. She will work with Pete through the summer to ensure a smooth transition and has agreed to stay with the company through the end of September in an advisory role.
In closing, we have an extraordinary valuable asset in our Keurig brand, and we're fortunate to have the finest beverage brand partners of any home beverage system in the world. Our current partnerships are strong, and we continue to add new ones, such as the New England coffee and Luzianne tea brands, and we expand current partner relationships such as the Dunkin' Donuts retail launch.
We are taking decisive steps to position our hot system for success over the long term and are excited to showcase Keurig KOLD at next week's investor event.
Finally, we remain confident in Keurig's ability to maintain our leadership position in the growing trend to offer premium beverage systems across multiple beverage categories.
With that, I'd like to open up the line to questions."

And that's about where the POS was for the quarter. And so that was slightly worse than we had thought it would be. And so when I look at that -- from that standpoint, that's where we were with the quarter in terms of POS. As we look in the next 2 quarters, we know we will promote brewers in order to get -- move the inventory through and be ready for success in the holiday season, and that's what's going to be really important to us, particularly also as we launch the 200 -- the K200, we want to make sure that we're right in the thick of the price points that we need to be in with that K200 all the while we bring the MINI back and we continue to restock the MINI.

In fact, it continues to grow at a healthy rate. So we don't see a change there. We're still the leader. We're still in a very, very good position. And we see in the future short, term and midterm and long term, very, very healthy growth rates for single serve and for Keurig within it.

It's progressive. It looks terrific, and we think it will do quite well. So it will have all the benefits of a reservoir brewer with 2.0 capability from K-Cup through mug and carafe. It'll be able to do all of the SKUs we have, as well, it has a full reservoir and it will be at an attractive price point. So you're -- that, we expect to have the same level of attachment that any other reservoir brewer would have. And on -- on the marketing front, you asked the question, Mark Baynes is a terrific add. He's a very seasoned and capable marketer. He is not only helping in terms of positioning thoroughly the Keurig brand as we expand beyond coffee and we expand into cold beverages. He's really helping as well as we build our own brands in coffee, the Green Mountain brand, the Donut Shop brand, our Laughing Man brand, the Barista Prima, the brands we have that do quite well in the marketplace, Mark is helping us clarify and sharpen those. I think the other key piece, if we look at the 2.0 launch, we did not communicate effectively -- as effectively as we could have been the variety that is in the machine. And it -- there were many consumers who thought that it only brewed Green Mountain brand or Keurig-owned brands. And we didn't get the message out effectively, we didn't get it out quickly enough and we didn't get it out broadly enough to dispel that rumor that was out there and to dispel the confusion consumers had. So Mark comes in with enormous experience and is really helping. It will be an enormous advantage for KOLD, as well, as we launch KOLD and as we build that platform over time."

We historically had said that we were confident that they were fairly equal in terms of an operating profit standpoint. The pods, we're somewhat indifferent in terms of which pods sell in terms of operating profit, not revenue but operating profit. We -- all of the pods we have today in the system still have healthy margins, but we can't say anymore that it's exactly they're identical because they're not identical. They're not wildly significant but we do see differences now, and we know that, we recognize that and we expected that as we brought all of the unlicensed pods in. And so we are reflecting it, but again, healthy margins across the whole system, and we have a very good business model that's a strong model."

And then more than halfway through this quarter, you gave, at least from my perspective, a similarly upbeat address at CAGNY saying that you were very, very confident 2.0 issues would be transitory and the hot platform would get back on track in a timely manner. And here we are with lower full year expectations and momentum in the marketplace that's still struggling to take hold. So I appreciate all the new initiatives that you laid out in the prepared remarks. Many of them make good sense. But I guess I'm just left with the lingering question of how we can truly have confidence that you've given yourself enough cushion in this new outlook given the recent execution. I mean how much of what you laid out in those prepared remarks is new versus what you had planned as of January and February? And what's -- and what, I guess, even is your early expectation for '16, is it too aggressive to think that we're back on algorithm by then, on your long-term algorithm? Or does that get pushed out to '17 and beyond given continued 2.0 ramp issues and new KOLD investments?"

We're not going to comment beyond 2015, but we're not coming off the long-term algorithm for the company. If you look at the year itself, reflecting -- certainly reflecting the first half of the year, the results in the first half of the year, we want to make sure the guidance is realistic, it is achievable and it reflects the transition we are going through. There's no inconsistency in the fact that the transition we talked about last quarter is the same transition we're talking about this quarter. We're smarter now. We know what the transition elements need to be. Some of the plans were in place, many of these are new because we have a clear indication, both on brewers and pods, of what's actually happening in the market. And it's complex. There's no question it is complex. It is not a simple process to transition like this. It is strategically critical that we do it, and so that's why we're going through it. And if we look at lower pod volumes, given that lower installed base, it really flows from there. When you don't get the installed base, particularly when you don't get it in the holiday season, which is when the brewers sell, you're going to have the challenges. It's very difficult to make it up in the rest of the year. That said, what got a bit worse was the price realization, that price elasticity hit. It's competitive out there on pods, there's no question. And if you look at the mix impact we've had as all of these new brands come in and the mix impact we have is real. So we're -- we think these -- the guidance is realistic, we think it's achievable, and we're committed to the action plans."

The consumer -- the predominant message the consumer gave us, it differed between new users and current owners of Keurig. So the current owner of Keurig was obviously the one who had challenges with pod compatibility, and that was the major issue. There's really no way to go through a transition like this without going through those issues. And so our plan has been and continues to be shortened, the time the consumer feels that challenge and that pain. And you do that by moving through the inventory as quickly as you can and by bringing in and welcoming in as many of the unlicensed brands as you can. But there's really no way to do this transition without going through some of that. So the first thing is making sure we are clear. I mentioned earlier, we want to make sure that we are communicating very clearly that the variety is enormous, more than any one household needs when you have over 500 varieties and 70 plus brands. I'd tell you, the other thing we heard loud and clear from the consumer, while very small percent of consumers, a very vocal and intense, passionate consumer who really wanted the My K-Cup back. What we learned is that it's important -- the message and the signal that it sends, the ethos that it sends is that we want consumers to be able to brew every brand, any brand of coffee in their machine, and bringing the My K-Cup back allows that. So we heard that loud and clear from the consumer. If you look at other learnings from the consumer, those would have been the 2 critical ones. Steve, did you have another follow-up on that?"

And when we went to SAP and we went to the conversion of SAP, we had to move to one system. And that changed -- it changed the consumer pattern of how to order because one of them had to change the way they went through it. And that's hard for consumers. When you change the digital path that they have to follow and the click stream that they have to follow in order to order pods, you're going to lose some of that pod business, and that's what happened in digital. It's really that simple. And so we've been in the process of, each month, and each with consumers both on the Green Mountain side and Keurig side now as one keurig.com, building up and improving those satisfaction ratings as consumers get more and more satisfied. This is something, by the way, Mark Baynes, our new CMO, is deeply into and deeply capable of really helping and managing. And again, there's a transition on that, that when you have 2 different methods of selling pods and brewers online and you convert to one, you're going to have some dissatisfied consumers as you -- and some bumps in the road as you go through this. And that's what happened in digital. We continue to be very excited about the digital business and about the things we can do online. It's a tremendous capability for us. Hope that gives a little more detail."

What is was, was a terrific addition for the consumer. It wasn't used a lot. It didn't make a lot of volume. It didn't -- but it was a nice -- for a consumer, it was a nice element to have if they were given coffee as a gift in bag coffee, they could put the My K-Cup in there and pour the coffee in from the bag that they perhaps didn't have in a pod. And so it was a nice convenience for a lot of our very, very loyal and heavy users. They didn't use it frequently, but they used it. And importantly, it gave them the ability to brew any brand they wanted. And so when we took it away and we took it away because that particular my K-Cup wasn't going to work with the new system as the new system had to identify the pod versus a carafe. So we took the My K-Cup away. And quite honestly, we were wrong. We missed -- we didn't -- we underestimated it, it's easiest way to say it. We underestimated the passion the consumer had for this.

Let me just explain. Years and years ago, a decade ago, when we launched the My K-Cup, it was launched originally because when Keurig Green Mountain started, it was just a handful of regional brands, small regional brands, and the thought was put a My K-Cup in there in case somebody had a brand because it didn't have major brands at that time and the thought was put a My K-Cup in there to let consumers brew coffees that weren't in the pod form factor. And it stayed. And again, like I said earlier, it -- and it's been around for a decade, a long time -- more than a decade, I think. And if you look at that, it's again a very, very small portion of the volume, but it's an important piece of the ethos to be able to brew any coffee brand you want. Part of what we have stood for is the ability to brew an enormous variety, and that is the ultimate variety because if you have a coffee that doesn't have the pod form factor, you don't have it in your home, you can brew it in that way. And so that allowed consumer to say, ""Okay, I can bring a single-serve brewer into my home and use any coffee I want."" And that's why we're bringing it back. It's an important component. And no, it doesn't have any impact on partners."

It's by pod brand, by the brand, because it's what you do for that individual brand and what role we play, whether we're purchasing coffee, whether we're roasting the coffee, grinding it, putting it in a pod, who sells it. And that really differs by brand. In some ways, it's linked to a partner but in many cases, it's by brand. And so if you look at where we are today, you really -- it's very difficult to bring in all of the more than 25 unlicensed brands we've brought in last year and expect to see the kind of consistency in margin. There's not dramatic inconsistency, but it's not what it used to historically be, which is we -- the company used to be able to say that it was somewhat indifferent -- actually indifferent to operating profit by pod regardless of which brand. And -- but it wouldn't be accurate to say that anymore because there is a difference. It's again, it's not a dramatic difference and we have healthy profit across all brands in the system. But when you look at the value chain and you look at the different things you do for a private-label player or a small brand, a large brand, a nationally distributed brand, a global brand and their capabilities, you do very, very different things. In some cases, the margins may be slightly higher or slightly lower. So it's more accurate now to say that while we have very, very healthy margins across the entire portfolio, they're not identical."

You were a little bit disappointed by the lack of sell-through. What did that consumer do in the December quarter? Did they buy another brewer? Are they deferring purchases? And I guess, because you would think that if it takes maybe 3 years is the reasonable life of a coffee maker, that if you didn't get them this past December, that maybe it takes a while before you have another shot at them.

I'll begin by stating that we are not satisfied with our financial results for the third quarter. On our last call, we described several factors that we believed would impede our growth",2222,"Thank you, Kristi, and thank you all for joining us on today's call. I'll begin by stating that we are not satisfied with our financial results for the third quarter. On our last call, we described several factors that we believed would impede our growth prospects for the next few quarters. These factors are playing out as expected and some have proven more challenging than anticipated and impacted our revenue. 
Notwithstanding the current dynamics impacting our business, our hot system remained strong with an enviable category leading position, a growing installed base, solid cash flow generation and expected fiscal year 2015 EBITDA of approximately $1.1 billion. We're also excited about the prospects for the innovative KOLD platform that we are developing and will soon be launching. Near term challenges aside, we are operating from a position of strength and are confident in our long-term business prospects. 
Importantly, we know the primary drivers that are negatively impacting our business and we are taking decisive actions to address these challenges, right size our organization and better adapt to today's rapidly evolving dynamic marketplace. Today, we are outlining a multiyear productivity program that is designed to enhance our operational effectiveness and enable us to fund incremental investment in innovation and brand building. Fran will take you through the elements of the program later on today's call. 
We have a strong balance sheet and a flexible capital structure that enables us to invest in growth and we will continue to do so, while returning meaningful levels of capital to our shareholders. Since the beginning of fiscal 2013, through the quarter -- third quarter of fiscal 2015, the company has completed over $2.1 billion in share repurchases and has returned nearly $250 million to its shareholders through dividends. As a reflection of our continued competence in the business, the Board of Directors has approved a new share repurchase authorization for an additional $1 billion for a total available authorization of nearly $1.3 billion. 
Let me now discuss the factors impacting the quarter. 5% decline in revenue in the quarter was below our expectations as we continue to experience challenging category dynamics due to slower than expected installed base growth and increased competitive activity in pods. As we bring in more previously unlicensed brands to our system, we believe other pod manufacturers have excess capacity, which has led them to respond with more aggressive pricing. Additionally, some branded partners have remained promotional. 
During the third quarter, these challenges were greater than anticipated and impacted pod volumes. Volume growth in the U.S. measured channels continues to be strong at 15% total category growth in the quarter, according to IRI. However, we continue to see weakness in several unmeasured channels, including the specialty channel and digital. These factors reduced the total U.S. At Home system category growth to the high single digits. Our U.S. At Home pod volume growth of 12% in the quarter exceeded total system category growth, reflecting the benefit of bringing previously unlicensed brands into our system and the retail expansion of Dunkin' Donuts. 
I would also note that similar to last quarter, we estimate that total Keurig system U.S. At Home shipment growth would've been a few hundred basis points higher if we were manufacturing the pods for all Kraft brands. The U.S. Away from Home business has experienced an acceleration of unlicensed activity and combined with a tough comparison versus last year's third quarter, resulted in a volume decline in the mid-20s for this segment of our business. 
We have seen a shift in the pod mix over the last year and this continued in the third quarter. Most of this was expected as we brought a large number of previously unlicensed brands into our system. Our owned and licensed share has decrease this fiscal year as we focused on making sure new partner brands were introduced with excellence while competitors have been stepping up promotions. We recognize that our own brands and our important assets and we plan to increase our focus and investment levels now that previously unlicensed brands transitions are mostly complete. 
Our priorities include making our promotions more effective and refreshing our packaging while continuing to innovate our own brands with new offerings and working to regain our fair share of distribution. Currently, our owned and licensed brands have approximately 40% share of system pods in measured channels, and we are committed to maintaining their strength and competitiveness. Improving performance will require leveraging and supporting both our owned and licensed brands as well as those of our partners because the strength of the Keurig system has always been in the breadth of consumer choice. We are fortunate to have the finest beverage brand partners of any home beverage system in the world and believe that we have created strong, long-term partnerships that are highly beneficial to ourselves, our partners, our customers and our consumers. 
We created the Keurig system and have been continually investing in, developing and enhancing the system and all of its components for the benefit of all participants for over 15 years. We also perform a wide range of services for our partners, including access to specialty channels where many partners do not have a sales infrastructure, beverage development and coffee procurement. Finally, our manufacturing scale provides an attractive cost structure as well as the flexibility to respond to the diverse needs of our partners. 
We enter each partnerships in a thoughtful manner. We carefully assess the long-term impact on the total system. While there is now more variability in operating profit per pod across the system, we will continue to manage the system as a portfolio and expect to maintain attractive pod operating margins. 
Turning to brewers. Brewer volumes were down 18% in the quarter as we continue to work through the high levels of inventory at retail. On reservoir brewers and experience lower sales of mini brewers as we continue to restock that product at retailers. Brewer price realization declined in the quarter due to investments we made in brewer promotions to work through inventory. Although brewer shipments were below our expectations in the quarter, we see signs of improvement in brewer point-of-sale data. With the reservoir brewer volumes up 3% in the quarter, excluding the mini and Vue. 
We are encouraged by the launch of our K200 line, our entry-level reservoir 2.0 brewer, which is off to a good start with positive reviews from consumers and good feedback from retailers. Despite slower installed base growth in 2015, which we now expect to be approximately 10%. We are confident that the hot platform has a long runway for growth. We believe we can accelerate brewer sales and that our long-term penetration goals are achievable. 
That said, these goals require consistent performance and smart innovation. For holiday 2015, which is our first quarter of fiscal 2016, we will have a broader portfolio with a variety of brewer models across more price points. Expect the mini to be back in wider distribution along with a variety of reservoir brewers, including the K200, which addressed key price points. We expect the My K-Cup accessory for 2.0 brewers for shipping this fall in time for the holiday. A 1.0 reservoir model, the K40, will also be offered in limited distribution. We will also debut new consumer communication, highlighting the benefits of Keurig Single Serve options as well as the broad variety in choice in our system. 
These messages will be communicated to consumers through an advertising campaign on brewer boxes and through in-store marketing. We believe these key initiatives will lead to a successful upcoming holiday season. 
Turning to an update on Keurig KOLD. We are very excited to introduce this disruptive technology to consumers in a category that is 5x the size of hot beverages in the U.S. As we have stated, we are still planning a disciplined, measured launch in the fall and now expect to begin shipping drinkmakers and pods in the late September, early October time frame. 
During the initial digital launch, we expect to have key partner brands: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Sprite, Fanta, Dr. Pepper and Canada Dry, along with the wide variety of our own carbonated and noncarbonated brands. Retail assortment during the initial launch will vary of course, dependent upon how many varieties individual retailers choose to stock, and how we choose to manage our mix in the plant. 
Post the initial launch, additional partner and owned brands and varieties will ship on a rolling basis. We intend to manage our brand mix to optimize the benefits to our partners, our retailers and most importantly, our consumers. 
From an appliance standpoint, our continued expectation is to sell hundreds of thousands of drink makers in the first 12 months of the launch. 
Let me now take a moment to discuss the additional actions that we are taking to improve our performance and position the Keurig hot and cold systems for long-term success. Today, we are detailing a multi-year productivity program that is expected to generate approximately $300 million in savings over the next 3 years with approximately $100 million of savings in fiscal 2016. We recognize that we need to take steps to actively enhance our organization's efficiency and effectiveness. As the competitive environment has become more challenging, we also need to lower our structural cost to compete efficiently, while freeing up dollars to invest in our innovation pipeline and fund incremental investment in our brands. We believe this program will make us stronger and faster and position the company well for the long-term. 
As part of this program, we will take this opportunity to stream our organizational structure. We will be combining our U.S. and Canadian businesses into 1 North American organization to be led by a head of North America. We've begun a search for the new leader in this role who will report directly to me. We are confident that we will bring on board a talented leader to fill this important role and help us lead to greater future growth and success.
As previously announced, Pete Leemputte will assume the role of Chief Financial Officer in mid-August. Pete brings over 30 years of experience in corporate finance leadership positions, most recently as CFO of Mead Johnson Nutrition company, a company that also has strong consumer brands, sold through multiple channels. I'm confident that Keurig will benefit from his knowledge and perspective and a particular area of his focus will be partnering with our commercial teams to further drive growth and improved results. 
As this will be Fran's last conference call, just want to take a moment to thank Fran for her 12 years of service and leadership to Keurig. Keurig has benefited tremendously from Fran's tirelessly commitment, her passion and integrity and action across our business. We have nothing but the highest amount of respect and gratitude for Fran, and I know I speak on behalf of everyone in this call when I say that we wish you all the best. Thank you, Fran. 
In addition, John Whoriskey, our President of U.S. sales and marketing is retiring. We want to thank John for his 13 years of service, as he has been a key part of Keurig's growth and we thank John as well. 
We are actively and decisively moving to improve our performance and our results. We'll take time likely several quarters for our efforts to impact our financial results. This is because we expect that the current pod environment will remain challenging into 2016 and the implementation of our productivity plan will ramp as the year goes on. Looking ahead, based upon our preliminary estimates for fiscal 2016, we expect the hot business to deliver modest non-GAAP earnings per share growth over fiscal 2015. This includes the benefits in the productivity program I referenced earlier and excludes any onetime charges from this program. 
We also expect the P&L investment in Keurig KOLD in 2016 will be at least $100 million and could be higher depending largely on pod manufacturing efficiencies and channel mix. We will update and provide a more detailed fiscal year 2016 outlook on the fourth quarter's earnings announcement. At present, we are not changing our longer-term earnings per share outlook for beyond 2016. When we talked about our long-term algorithm in September of 2013, the margin profile we discussed to get to our earnings growth assumed a far less competitive environment. 
So going forward, if the competitive environment markedly improves and we execute on the productivity and other initiatives I mentioned today, we believe our longer-term outlook is intact. If however, the dynamics of the marketplace stay as they are today for a prolonged period of time, we believe will be able to hit our earnings per share growth rate targets, but the margin profile that gets us there would certainly be different. We'll just have to monitor market dynamics throughout fiscal 2016. 
Before I turn it over to Fran, I want to reiterate that our pod business generates healthy cash flows with approximately $1.1 billion in EBITDA and we have a strong balance sheet. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders while investing in our future. We are the category leader. We have a focus plan and we're committed to executing that plan. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Fran."

For the third quarter, we generated net sales of $970 million, down 5% versus the prior year quarter and down 4%, excluding currency impacts. Brewer volumes declined 18%, representing unit sales below our expectations as we continued to work through high levels in inventory at retail and restock the mini. Brewer net price realization declined 6% as we had higher promotional levels in an effort to clear inventory. Brewer mix declined by 2 percentage points and foreign currency exchange rates had a negative 1% impact. Pod revenue declined 1%. Volume increased 5%, a 3 percentage points of pricing offset by 8 percentage points of negative mix and a roughly 1 percentage point unfavorable impact from currency. Pod volumes for the quarter came in below expectations. This was due to lower installed base growth, softer-than-expected performance in digital and some of our partner brands, and increased unlicensed activity in the Away from Home channel. Our At Home pod volumes increased 12% in the quarter while our Away from Home volumes declined in the mid-20s. In addition to volume, mix was slightly worse than expected, driven by weakness in our digital channel and lower share performance on our own brand. Pricing was also below our forecast due to higher than planned competitive activity. 
If we break down results regionally for the quarter, our U.S. business revenue declined 4% while our Canadian business declined 14%. Excluding the impact of currency in the Canadian business declined 3% for the quarter. 
Moving on to a review of gross profit. For the quarter, our gross margin declined 750 basis points to 36% of net sales. Excluding the $18 million charge related to lower-than-anticipated sales of 2.0 brewers, gross margin declined 560 basis points. The decline was largely driven by higher obsolescence, higher coffee costs, negative brewer mix as we sold a greater percentage of 2.0 brewers and higher logistics costs. We also experienced negative pod mix and negative price realization on brewers where we had higher promotions in an effort to lower inventory models. These negative margin drivers were partially offset by higher pod pricing and a shift in sales mix between brewers and pods. 
Turning to operating results. Non-GAAP SG&A decreased by 14% in the quarter. The percentage of sales non-GAAP SG&A decreased by 190 basis points to 17.8% of sales due to a lower incentive compensation expense, marketing expense and lower consulting fees. Our non-GAAP operating profit declined 28% for the quarter, reflecting lower gross profit, partially offset by decreases in SG&A. Third quarter tax rate of 30.2% was favorable to our prior year period tax rate of 33.9%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 includes a negative $0.02 impact from foreign exchange and a negative $0.08 impact related to the brewer write-down, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the brewer write-down, non-GAAP EPS was $0.90 a share. 
Turning to the balance sheet and free cash flow. We ended the quarter with net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.3x, free cash flow increased 9% as compared to the year-ago quarter. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $272 million was below prior year levels, primarily due to higher working capital levels and investment related to our new Keurig KOLD launch. 
Moving on to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect our net sales decline in the low teens and non-GAAP EPS of $0.70 to $0.75 per share. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the 36% to 36.5% range. We expect our fourth quarter revenue to be impacted by several factors. Prior year fourth quarter included approximately 4 percentage point benefit from retailers buying ahead of our fiscal year-end SAP implementation and a 2 percentage point negative impact of the reserve for the mini recall, netting to 2 points of difficult comparison. 
Negative brewer shipment growth year-over-year of approximately 20%. Pod volumes will be affected by the impact of lower brewer sales on the installed base, continuing elevated competitive activity, particularly in the Away from Home channel as well as a difficult comparison against SAP advanced ordering impact in the prior year. We expect minimal sales contribution from Keurig KOLD in the fourth quarter. And lastly, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact total revenue growth by approximately 2 percentage points. 
Our fourth quarter EPS guidance is impacted by the following factors. We expect brewers to be a smaller percentage of mix versus the prior year period, which will positively impact margins year-over-year. Commodities will be a headwind in Q4 on a year-over-year basis, but slightly less than Q3 '15. Pod mix is expected to negatively impact margins. Keurig KOLD launch related expenses and start-up costs in KOLD pod production and foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact the EPS by approximately $0.03. 
And finally, please note that our fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes any restructuring and onetime charges related to the productivity initiative announced today. 
Moving to our full year guidance. For fiscal 2015, we expect a net sales decline of low single to mid-single digits relative to fiscal 2014. We are revising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to a low teens decline. Our EPS guidance embeds a tax rate of 34.5% to 35% and includes an estimated $0.13 negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Our guidance excludes any restructuring and onetime charges related to the company's productivity initiatives. Additionally, our current EPS guidance takes into account KOLD investments of slightly over $100 million in fiscal 2015. 
We now expect free cash flow in the range of $150 million to $200 million and capital investment in the range of $400 million to $450 million. Embedded in our capital investment guidance is North America hot platform investment within our previously mentioned 4% to 7% of revenue target, with the remainder representing investment in new products and platforms. As Brian mentioned earlier, we will be implementing a multi-year productivity planned with the objective of reducing structural costs and adapting our organizational structure to become stronger on the ground and speed our decision making. 
Our efforts will be focused across the organization and include optimizing manufacturing efficiency to reduce conversion and packaging costs; reducing obsolescence; lowering our distribution cost; increasing the effectiveness of our promotional program; and reducing nonworking marketing spend expense. Brian gave our initial view on fiscal '16 and his remarks and I would like to comment on the first quarter of fiscal '16. As we invest behind brewer in both hot and cold, ramp production on cold pods and saved a significant costly headwinds in the first quarter, we expect our first quarter to be the most challenging from a non-GAAP EPS perspective. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Brian to wrap up."

In reality, the clogged needle exist both on 1.0 and 2.0 at about the same level. But what the 2.0 did differently, the brew engine and the algorithm is different. So if you're a consumer who had Keurig prior and you got a new one in some cases, in some locations, with some pods, it would change the way it brewed. And so you might have thought that, that was something that was different and you didn't like it and so consumers brought it back. And so those were the 2 things that drove that increase in return.

That kind of growth slowdown while still healthy for most categories, is not what we've historically experienced. And so we've added a number of brands to the system, at a time when the growth rate is slowing and everybody wants -- everybody who's in the system wants to get a bigger and bigger share of that growth, and so you've got a lot of competition going on in the system because of that, and that's healthy and that's good competition. The second piece is excess capacity. We have won a large number of unlicensed -- previously unlicensed brands into the system. And I really can't comment on the -- what happens to that capacity. Our job is to make sure we have the best brands in the system that we do everything we can for our owned and licensed brands that we support our partner brands, and make sure we continue to grow the system.

And so we're at a time when we're both transitioning our hot system and we're launching an entirely new system for the company. And so there's no question that, that is quite a transitional period for the company, we're going through. We're confident in both systems, but that's -- what can give you confidence in the hot system is that for more than 15 years, it's been the leading system here in North America. It continues to be with the strongest brands and by far, the strongest consumer brand. It has extraordinarily strong passion among consumers who love Keurig. It has excellent distribution, strong retail support and on every front, we have an advantage position in the hot system. And that position has allowed us to put EPS numbers up that grow. Now there's no question. It's more competitive today than it's been because of the slower growth in the installed base. And as we've moved more brands into the system and that excess capacity is out there. But we view that as a transitional period and we're going to get through it and we're going to be competitive, and then we're going to get through this and the hot system will continue to grow.

But really, the debate and the loss of confidence in your strategy from an investment standpoint -- investor standpoint seems to be around a structural issue in the K-Cup business, from a margin perspective. So you've talked about installed base growth slowing down, but then we're seeing some positive signs of brewer sales growth returning. So just, can you -- is this a brewer problem that you're going through? Is it both the brewer K-Cup profitability problem and the K-Cup profitability problem, does it have -- is it driven by bringing in non-licensed partners at much lower margins?

So first, I would characterize it as a brewer challenge more than a structural issue in pod margin. It's not a structural issue in pod margin. We make healthy operating margins across our portfolio today and we expect those operating margins to continue in the future. The brewer challenge is what the real issue is and when you have a tough holiday season like we did, and you don't sell more brewers, than you did the prior year, then you have the challenge. Now, yes, it's -- some will say it's still healthy growth and its 10% growth of a category, and there aren't many that are growing at that rate. But for us, we look at it and it's not growth enough. It's not satisfactory, particularly at a time when we brought in so many new brands into the system. And quite frankly, what happens is, we can bring more brands into the system faster than shelf space can expand, faster than some of the other physicals of the business can expand. And so the structural issue in pod margin, we don't see it. We see the ability to long-term generate strong operating profits in pods. Then if you look at just a couple of other items that happened this year, coffee costs hit us this year and they went the wrong way. And then as you know, we have a higher cost of the 2.0, which we're working to drive down and we'll drive that down. But those 3 pieces really are what -- are driving this transition as we go through it. But so it's brewer installed base growth, it's brewer costs and it's the coffee costs that hit us this year.

So I will mention, we've met earnings 9 quarters in a row, but we've not met our deep earnings 9 quarters in a row. We have not done that in the revenues, that's clear. It is more difficult and it's more challenging, that's not an excuse, it just is. We have a wide range of revenue per pod and it requires an exact prediction of what the mix of those pods will be. So one of the unique things in this model is while the operating profit, as we've said, is healthy across our portfolio and while it's a little wider today than it's been, the operating profit we were clear on and it's healthy. The revenue per pod is quite different across the pods and particularly, as we bought the new pods in and as we do -- we had different value and had different services for each pod, we charge a different revenue. And so our ability, quite honestly, to predict that revenue by pod, by brand, across all the channels, across all of our partners, it's not simple. That's not an excuse, that's just the reality and it's shown our inability to predict accurately our revenue growth. We are doing a number of things to get better at this. We've got plenty of models. Everyone has models. The issue is understanding how does a consumer respond to changes on the shelf? What is it that's driving -- how much does pricing matter? How much does distribution matter? How much does packaging matter? All the basics. It's understanding what's happening in the system as the system changes pretty fundamentally as we've widened the brands in the system. So certainly, as we go through this dynamic, we knew it would be a transition. I'm -- we're not at all proud. I'm certainly not proud of our inability to be precise in revenue, so that's how I'd answer it. It's not -- and so we will get better at this.

And we have a whole series of reasons why we're confident that, that will happen. First and foremost, we have a complete brewer line up out there at the right price points. So we'll have a number of brewers in the price points that are below $100. We'll also have the price points that we have out there last year. If you recall with the mini recall, and with the 2.0 launch, we did not have a sub $100 brewer. We're going to have a complete line up of brewers in those price points for the whole season. We won't have a many recall. We at least don't anticipate many recall, certainly. We will have the issue behind us of compatibility and confusion with the consumer as to what works in the system and what doesn't. We have retailer support. We have the makings of a very good holiday season and we expect that and we're working to deliver that. So those are the -- that's the biggest change and once you start the holiday that way and you start the year that way, it rolls through the rest of the year with an installed base growth that we think can be healthy, and growing versus this year. And so then we have the ability to grow pods. And with that, I'll get to your second piece of your question. The pricing on our owned brands and our licensed brands, a lot depends on who their brand competitive set is. And so we were now very, very good at looking and monitoring who are the competitive set? What are the competitive price points? We don't -- I don't want to get into pricing per se, but we're going to be competitive and we're going to be effective in making sure we can grow our brands. I will say distribution is a key focus of ours. If you look back 2010, 100% of the Keurig system was owned and licensed brands. 100% of the Keurig system was our owned and licensed brands. As we brought on all of the great partners we have, it's natural that we're going to lose some share. The shelf space gets taken by some very, very strong and powerful brands in the system and brands in the coffee category. And we've seen that, but our brands have done extraordinary well even in that environment. And so yes, there's no question, you're going to have more and more brands come into the system and that has happened. But we think from a brand standpoint, we've got the right portfolio and our owned and license brands can compete. We have also brought in a whole new group of talented people who are experts in CPG, what we call RGM revenue growth management. Yield, price yield, looking at trade spend effectiveness, and trade spend promotion, it's important to recognize that the company really didn't have promotional spending prior to 2012, 2013. We just started it. And so we have real expertise that we've now brought in that is seasoned and who know how to do trade effectiveness and trade promotion. Of course, it takes some time for them to get in and learn the system, because it's not a typical CPG model. But as they come in and learn, I'm confident that over time here, we'll get the expertise we need."

Our hot system is very, very innovative and the KOLD system is extraordinarily innovative for what's out there in the market today. For the ability, for the consumer to put in a pod, push a button and get a cold Coke or a cold Dr. Pepper, that does not exist today and have it taste great. That capability does not exist today in the marketplace. So the first point is it's extremely innovative. The second point is that when we look at the marketplace, there are -- the stores there are very different categories, hot beverages, and cold beverages are different categories. From an appliance standpoint, we want them in the area where kitchen appliances and home appliances are sold. We don't expect it to come out of the hot systems shelf space. We think it's going to be incremental, and I don't want to comment on individual shelf space. It's really about launching a new system and having a display that's impactful. I will mention one thing that it's worth knowing, and I've gone back and study pretty thoroughly the 2004 launch of the hot system. And as some of you may know or remember, there were several other hot systems launched at the same time. And I think we can all safely say that they don't exist today in any real number and they were launched by big companies. And many of the companies that launched, soon and absolutely insisted that the price be very, very low for the consumer, but it didn't have the quality that the consumer wanted. Others insisted on broadly spreading the pods and appliances everywhere at the start and retailers quickly rejected it because it didn't have the kind of turn because you can't get an installed base built big quickly enough to have friends, installed all in the grocery channel get into the pods until there's enough installed base out there. So we have the benefit of watching the 4 other systems that launched as we launched. They don't exist today in any major way in the U.S. In fact, they're not here. And so it's instructive to look at that and we've learned a lot from that and we're going to apply those learnings to KOLD. We'll get the right sampling in the stores. What matters is getting into the store and having people see this product and experience it.

I'll begin by stating that we are not satisfied with our financial results for the third quarter. On our last call, we described several factors that we believed would impede our growth prospects for the next few quarters. These factors are playing out as expected and some have proven more challenging than anticipated and impacted our revenue.
Notwithstanding the current dynamics impacting our business, our hot system remained strong with an enviable category leading position, a growing installed base, solid cash flow generation and expected fiscal year 2015 EBITDA of approximately $1.1 billion. We're also excited about the prospects for the innovative KOLD platform that we are developing and will soon be launching. Near term challenges aside, we are operating from a position of strength and are confident in our long-term business prospects. 
Importantly, we know the primary drivers that are negatively impacting our business and we are taking decisive actions to address these challenges, right size our organization and better adapt to today's rapidly evolving dynamic marketplace. Today, we are outlining a multiyear productivity program that is designed to enhance our operational effectiveness and enable us to fund incremental investment in innovation and brand building. Fran will take you through the elements of the program later on today's call. 
We have a strong balance sheet and a flexible capital structure that enables us to invest in growth and we will continue to do so, while returning meaningful levels of capital to our shareholders. Since the beginning of fiscal 2013, through the quarter -- third quarter of fiscal 2015, the company has completed over $2.1 billion in share repurchases and has returned nearly $250 million to its shareholders through dividends. As a reflection of our continued confidence in the business, the Board of Directors has approved a new share repurchase authorization for an additional $1 billion for a total available authorization of nearly $1.3 billion.
Let me now discuss the factors impacting the quarter. The 5% decline in revenue in the quarter was below our expectations as we continue to experience challenging category dynamics due to slower than expected installed base growth and increased competitive activity in pods. As we bring in more previously unlicensed brands to our system, we believe other pod manufacturers have excess capacity, which has led them to respond with more aggressive pricing. Additionally, some branded partners have remained promotional. 
During the third quarter, these challenges were greater than anticipated and impacted pod volumes. Volume growth in the U.S. measured channels continues to be strong at 15% total category growth in the quarter, according to IRI. However, we continue to see weakness in several unmeasured channels, including the specialty channel and digital. These factors reduced the total U.S. At Home system category growth to the high single digits. Our U.S. At Home pod volume growth of 12% in the quarter exceeded total system category growth, reflecting the benefit of bringing previously unlicensed brands into our system and the retail expansion of Dunkin' Donuts. 
I would also note that similar to last quarter, we estimate that total Keurig system U.S. At Home shipment growth would've been a few hundred basis points higher if we were manufacturing the pods for all Kraft brands. The U.S. Away from Home business has experienced an acceleration of unlicensed activity and combined with a tough comparison versus last year's third quarter, resulted in a volume decline in the mid-20s for this segment of our business. 
We have seen a shift in the pod mix over the last year and this continued in the third quarter. Most of this was expected as we brought a large number of previously unlicensed brands into our system. Our owned and licensed share has decreased this fiscal year as we focused on making sure new partner brands were introduced with excellence while competitors have been stepping up promotions.
We recognize that our own brands and our important assets and we plan to increase our focus and investment levels now that previously unlicensed brands transitions are mostly complete.
Our priorities include making our promotions more effective and refreshing our packaging while continuing to innovate our own brands with new offerings and working to regain our fair share of distribution. Currently, our owned and licensed brands have approximately 40% share of system pods in measured channels, and we are committed to maintaining their strength and competitiveness. Improving performance will require leveraging and supporting both our owned and licensed brands as well as those of our partners because the strength of the Keurig system has always been in the breadth of consumer choice. We are fortunate to have the finest beverage brand partners of any home beverage system in the world and believe that we have created strong, long-term partnerships that are highly beneficial to ourselves, our partners, our customers and our consumers. 
We created the Keurig system and have been continually investing in, developing and enhancing the system and all of its components for the benefit of all participants for over 15 years. We also perform a wide range of services for our partners, including access to specialty channels where many partners do not have a sales infrastructure, beverage development and coffee procurement. Finally, our manufacturing scale provides an attractive cost structure as well as the flexibility to respond to the diverse needs of our partners.
We enter each partnerships in a thoughtful manner. We carefully assess the long-term impact on the total system. While there is now more variability in operating profit per pod across the system, we will continue to manage the system as a portfolio and expect to maintain attractive pod operating margins.
Turning to brewers. Brewer volumes were down 18% in the quarter as we continue to work through the high levels of inventory at retail. On reservoir brewers and experience lower sales of MINI brewers as we continue to restock that product at retailers. Brewer price realization declined in the quarter due to investments we made in brewer promotions to work through inventory. Although brewer shipments were below our expectations in the quarter, we see signs of improvement in brewer point-of-sale data. With the reservoir brewer volumes up 3% in the quarter, excluding the MINI and Vue.
We are encouraged by the launch of our K200 line, our entry-level reservoir 2.0 brewer, which is off to a good start with positive reviews from consumers and good feedback from retailers. Despite slower installed base growth in 2015, which we now expect to be approximately 10%. We are confident that the hot platform has a long runway for growth. We believe we can accelerate brewer sales and that our long-term penetration goals are achievable.
That said, these goals require consistent performance and smart innovation. For holiday 2015, which is our first quarter of fiscal 2016, we will have a broader portfolio with a variety of brewer models across more price points. We expect the MINI to be back in wider distribution along with a variety of reservoir brewers, including the K200, which addressed key price points. We expect the My K-Cup accessory for 2.0 brewers for shipping this fall in time for the holiday. A 1.0 reservoir model, the K40, will also be offered in limited distribution. We will also debut new consumer communication, highlighting the benefits of Keurig Single Serve options as well as the broad variety in choice in our system.
These messages will be communicated to consumers through an advertising campaign on brewer boxes and through in-store marketing. We believe these key initiatives will lead to a successful upcoming holiday season. 
Turning to an update on Keurig KOLD. We are very excited to introduce this disruptive technology to consumers in a category that is 5x the size of hot beverages in the U.S. As we have stated, we are still planning a disciplined, measured launch in the fall and now expect to begin shipping drinkmakers and pods in the late September, early October time frame.
During the initial digital launch, we expect to have key partner brands: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Sprite, Fanta, Dr. Pepper and Canada Dry, along with the wide variety of our own carbonated and noncarbonated brands.
Retail assortment during the initial launch will vary of course, dependent upon how many varieties individual retailers choose to stock, and how we choose to manage our mix in the plant.
Post the initial launch, additional partner and owned brands and varieties will ship on a rolling basis. We intend to manage our brand mix to optimize the benefits to our partners, our retailers and most importantly, our consumers.
From an appliance standpoint, our continued expectation is to sell hundreds of thousands of drink makers in the first 12 months of the launch.
Let me now take a moment to discuss the additional actions that we are taking to improve our performance and position the Keurig hot and cold systems for long-term success. Today, we are detailing a multi-year productivity program that is expected to generate approximately $300 million in savings over the next 3 years with approximately $100 million of savings in fiscal 2016. We recognize that we need to take steps to actively enhance our organization's efficiency and effectiveness. As the competitive environment has become more challenging, we also need to lower our structural cost to compete efficiently, while freeing up dollars to invest in our innovation pipeline and fund incremental investment in our brands. We believe this program will make us stronger and faster and position the company well for the long-term.
As part of this program, we will take this opportunity to stream our organizational structure. We will be combining our U.S. and Canadian businesses into one North American organization to be led by a head of North America. We've begun a search for the new leader in this role who will report directly to me. We are confident that we will bring on board a talented leader to fill this important role and help us lead to greater future growth and success.
As previously announced, Pete Leemputte will assume the role of Chief Financial Officer in mid-August. Pete brings over 30 years of experience in corporate finance leadership positions, most recently as CFO of Mead Johnson Nutrition company, a company that also has strong consumer brands, sold through multiple channels. I'm confident that Keurig will benefit from his knowledge and perspective and a particular area of his focus will be partnering with our commercial teams to further drive growth and improved results.
As this will be Fran's last conference call, I just want to take a moment to thank Fran for her 12 years of service and leadership to Keurig. Keurig has benefited tremendously from Fran's tirelessly commitment, her passion and integrity and action across our business. We have nothing but the highest amount of respect and gratitude for Fran, and I know I speak on behalf of everyone on this call when I say that we wish you all the best. Thank you, Fran.
In addition, John Whoriskey, our President of U.S. sales and marketing is retiring. We want to thank John for his 13 years of service, as he has been a key part of Keurig's growth and we thank John as well.
We are actively and decisively moving to improve our performance and our results. It will take time likely several quarters for our efforts to impact our financial results. This is because we expect that the current pod environment will remain challenging into 2016 and the implementation of our productivity plan will ramp as the year goes on.
Looking ahead, based upon our preliminary estimates for fiscal 2016, we expect the hot business to deliver modest non-GAAP earnings per share growth over fiscal 2015. This includes the benefits from the productivity program, I referenced earlier, and excludes any onetime charges from this program.
We also expect the P&L investment in Keurig KOLD in 2016 will be at least $100 million and could be higher depending largely on pod manufacturing efficiencies and channel mix. We will update and provide a more detailed fiscal year 2016 outlook on the fourth quarter's earnings announcement.
At present, we are not changing our longer-term earnings per share outlook for beyond 2016. When we talked about our long-term algorithm in September of 2013, the margin profile we discussed to get to our earnings growth assumed a far less competitive environment.
So going forward, if the competitive environment markedly improves and we execute on the productivity and other initiatives, I mentioned today, we believe our longer-term outlook is intact. If however, the dynamics of the marketplace stay as they are today for a prolonged period of time, we believe we'll be able to hit our earnings per share growth rate targets, but the margin profile that gets us there would certainly be different. We'll just have to monitor market dynamics throughout fiscal 2016.
Before I turn it over to Fran, I want to reiterate that our hot business generates healthy cash flows with approximately $1.1 billion in EBITDA and we have a strong balance sheet. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders while investing in our future. We are the category leader. We have a focus plan and we're committed to executing that plan. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Fran."

For the third quarter, we generated net sales of $970 million, down 5% versus the prior year quarter and down 4%, excluding currency impacts. Brewer volumes declined 18%, representing unit sales below our expectations as we continued to wor",1113,"Thanks, Brian. For the third quarter, we generated net sales of $970 million, down 5% versus the prior year quarter and down 4%, excluding currency impacts. Brewer volumes declined 18%, representing unit sales below our expectations as we continued to work through high levels in inventory at retail and restock the MINI. Brewer net price realization declined 6% as we had higher promotional levels in an effort to clear inventory. Brewer mix declined by 2 percentage points and foreign currency exchange rates had a negative 1% impact. Pod revenue declined 1%. Volume increased 5%, with 3 percentage points of pricing offset by 8 percentage points of negative mix and a roughly 1 percentage point unfavorable impact from currency.
Pod volumes for the quarter came in below expectations. This was due to lower installed base growth, softer-than-expected performance in digital and some of our partner brands, and increased unlicensed activity in the Away from Home channel. Our At Home pod volumes increased 12% in the quarter while our Away from Home volumes declined in the mid-20s.
In addition to volume, mix was slightly worse than expected, driven by weakness in our digital channel and lower share performance on our own brand. Pricing was also below our forecast due to higher than planned competitive activity. 
If we break down results regionally for the quarter, our U.S. business revenue declined 4% while our Canadian business declined 14%. Excluding the impact of currency, the Canadian business declined 3% for the quarter.
Moving on to a review of gross profit. For the quarter, our gross margin declined 750 basis points to 36% of net sales. Excluding the $18 million charge related to lower-than-anticipated sales of 2.0 brewers, gross margin declined 560 basis points. The decline was largely driven by higher obsolescence, higher coffee costs, negative brewer mix as we sold a greater percentage of 2.0 brewers and higher logistics costs. We also experienced negative pod mix and negative price realization on brewers where we had higher promotions in an effort to lower inventory models. These negative margin drivers were partially offset by higher pod pricing and a shift in sales mix between brewers and pods.
Turning to operating results. Non-GAAP SG&A decreased by 14% in the quarter. As a percentage of sales non-GAAP SG&A decreased by 190 basis points to 17.8% of sales due to a lower incentive compensation expense, marketing expense and lower consulting fees. Our non-GAAP operating profit declined 28% for the quarter, reflecting lower gross profit, partially offset by decreases in SG&A. Our third quarter tax rate of 30.2% was favorable to our prior year period tax rate of 33.9%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 includes a negative $0.02 impact from foreign exchange and a negative $0.08 impact related to the brewer write-down, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the brewer write-down, non-GAAP EPS was $0.90 a share. 
Turning to the balance sheet and free cash flow. We ended the quarter with net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.3x, free cash flow increased 9% as compared to the year-ago quarter. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $272 million was below prior year levels, primarily due to higher working capital levels and investment related to our new Keurig KOLD launch. 
Moving on to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect net sales decline in the low teens and non-GAAP EPS of $0.70 to $0.75 per share. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the 36% to 36.5% range. We expect our fourth quarter revenue to be impacted by several factors. The prior year fourth quarter included approximately 4 percentage point benefit from retailers buying ahead of our fiscal year-end SAP implementation and a 2 percentage point negative impact of the reserve for the MINI recall, netting to 2 points of difficult comparison.
Negative brewer shipment growth year-over-year of approximately 20%. Pod volumes will be affected by the impact of lower brewer sales on the installed base, continuing elevated competitive activity, particularly in the Away from Home channel as well as a difficult comparison against SAP advanced ordering impact in the prior year. We expect minimal sales contribution from Keurig KOLD in the fourth quarter. And lastly, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact total revenue growth by approximately 2 percentage points.
Our fourth quarter EPS guidance is impacted by the following factors. We expect brewers to be a smaller percentage of mix versus the prior year period, which will positively impact margins year-over-year. Commodities will be a headwind in Q4 on a year-over-year basis, but slightly less than Q3 '15. Pod mix is expected to negatively impact margins. Keurig KOLD launch related expenses and start-up costs in KOLD pod production and foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact the EPS by approximately $0.03.
And finally, please note that our fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes any restructuring and onetime charges related to the productivity initiative announced today.
Moving to our full year guidance. For fiscal 2015, we expect a net sales decline of low single to mid-single digits relative to fiscal 2014. We are revising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to a low teens decline. Our EPS guidance embeds a tax rate of 34.5% to 35% and includes an estimated $0.13 negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Our guidance excludes any restructuring and onetime charges related to the company's productivity initiatives. Additionally, our current EPS guidance takes into account KOLD investments of slightly over $100 million in fiscal 2015.
We now expect free cash flow in the range of $150 million to $200 million and capital investment in the range of $400 million to $450 million. Embedded in our capital investment guidance is North America hot platform investment within our previously mentioned 4% to 7% of revenue target, with the remainder representing investment in new products and platforms. As Brian mentioned earlier, we will be implementing a multi-year productivity plan with the objective of reducing structural costs and adapting our organizational structure to become stronger on the ground and speed our decision making.
Our efforts will be focused across the organization and include optimizing manufacturing efficiency to reduce conversion and packaging costs; reducing obsolescence; lowering our distribution cost; increasing the effectiveness of our promotional program; and reducing nonworking marketing spend. Brian gave our initial view of -- on fiscal '16 in his remarks, and I would like to comment on the first quarter of fiscal '16. As we invest behind brewers in both hot and cold, ramp production on cold pods and face a significant costly headwinds in the first quarter, we expect our first quarter to be the most challenging from a non-GAAP EPS perspective.
Now I'll turn the call back to Brian to wrap up."

And I guess, related to that, one of the things that we had heard through the quarter is that returns have been a little bit abnormally high on the 2.0.

We expect the holiday season here in 2015 in a few months to be stronger than last year. So I want to make that point clear, we expect it to be stronger. That's -- it's critical to growing the installed base. On the second question, we have seen higher returns on 2.0. Initially, we saw higher returns and we are clear on what drove those returns. Early on, it was about the compatibility. And then as we moved from compatibility, it became the -- there's what some call a clogged needle. In reality, the clogged needle exist both on 1.0 and 2.0 at about the same level. But what the 2.0 did differently, the brew engine and the algorithm is different. And so if you're a consumer who had Keurig prior and you got a new one in some cases, in some locations, with some pods, it would change the way it brewed.

That kind of growth slowdown while still healthy for most categories, is not what we've historically experienced. And so we've added a number of brands to the system, at a time when the growth rate is slowing and everybody wants -- everybody who's in the system wants to get a bigger and bigger share of that growth, and so you've got a lot of competition going on in the system because of that, and that's healthy and that's good competition. The second piece is excess capacity. We have won a large number of unlicensed -- previously unlicensed brands into the system. And I really can't comment on the -- what happens to that capacity. Our job is to make sure we have the best brands in the system that we do everything we can for our owned and licensed brands that we support our partner brands, and make sure we continue to grow the system.

And then if you look at the productivity initiatives we're doing, we know that there's -- there are productivity opportunities that we can take in the hot system that can help offset some of that competitive environment and ensure that we get the kind of modest EPS growth that we talked about. And so we're at a time when we're both transitioning our hot system and we're launching an entirely new system for the company. And so there's no question that, that is quite a transitional period for the company, we're going through. We're confident in both systems, but that's -- what can give you confidence in the hot system is that for more than 15 years, it's been the leading system here in North America. It continues to be with the strongest brands and by far, the strongest consumer brand. It has extraordinarily strong passion among the consumers who love Keurig. It has excellent distribution, strong retail support and on every front, we have an advantage position in the hot system. And that position has allowed us to put EPS numbers up that grow. Now there's no question. It's more competitive today than it's been because of the slower growth in the installed base. And as we've moved more brands into the system and that excess capacity is out there. But we view that as a transitional period, and we're going to get through it, and we're going to be competitive, and then we're going to get through this and the hot system will continue to grow.

Coming into this quarter, I thought the issue with the earnings trajectory was related to weak brewer sales and larger year-over-year losses on brewers because of more discounting and effective marketing et cetera. But really, the debate and the loss of confidence in your strategy from an investment standpoint -- investor standpoint seems to be around a structural issue in the K-Cup business, from a margin perspective. So you've talked about installed base growth slowing down, but then we're seeing some positive signs of brewer sales growth returning. So just, can you -- like is this a brewer problem that you're going through? Is it both the brewer K-Cup profitability problem and the K-Cup profitability problem, does it have -- is it driven by bringing in non-licensed partners at much lower margins? Just your competition commentary makes it sound like margins in the K-Cup business have peaked and are about to go on a major downward trend. So just can you clarify that?"

First, I would characterize it as a brewer challenge more than a structural issue in pod margin. It's not a structural issue in pod margin. We make healthy operating margins across our portfolio today, and we expect those healthy operating margins to continue in the future. The brewer challenge is what the real issue is and when you have a tough holiday season like we did, and you don't sell more brewers, than you did the prior year, you have the challenge. Now, yes, it's -- some will say it's still healthy growth and its 10% growth of a category, and there aren't many either growing at that rate. But to us, we look at it unless it's not growth enough. It's not satisfactory, and particularly at a time when we brought in so many new brands into the system. And quite frankly, what happens is, we can bring more brands into the system faster than shelf space can expand, faster than some of the other physicals of the business can expand. And so the structural issue in pod margin, we don't see it. We see the ability to long-term generate strong operating profits in pods. Then if you look at just a couple of other items that happened this year, coffee costs hit us this year and they went the wrong way. And then as you know, we have a higher cost of the 2.0, which we're working to drive down and we'll drive that down. But those 3 pieces really are what -- are driving this transition as we go through it. But so it's brewer installed base growth, it's brewer costs and it's the coffee costs that hit us this year.

We're going to have a launch that we think is a launch that allows us to grow it appropriately, and not overspend and not be imprudent in the way we spend in terms of CapEx or any other kind of operating expense for this business. We've spend enough money to build the footprint as I mentioned. And I think we're doing it the right way. So we don't think delaying the KOLD launch is the right answer."

So I will mention, we've met earnings 9 quarters in a row, but we've not met our beat earnings 9 quarters in a row. We have not done that on revenues in the last 3 quarters, that's clear. There is -- it is more difficult and it's more challenging, that's not an excuse, it just is. We have a wide range of revenue per pod and it requires an exact prediction of what the mix of those pods will be. So one of the unique things in this model is while the operating profit, as we've said, is healthy across our portfolio and while it's a little wider today than it's been, the operating profit we were clear on and that's healthy. The revenue per pod is quite different across the pods and particularly, as we bought the new pods in and as we do -- we had different value and had different services for each pod, we charge a different revenue. And so our ability, quite honestly, to predict that revenue by pod, by brand, across all the channels, across all of our partners, it's not simple. That's not an excuse, that's just the reality and it's shown in our inability to predict accurately our revenue growth. We are doing a number of things to get better at this. We've got plenty of models. Everyone has models. The issue is understanding how does a consumer respond to changes on the shelf? What is it that's driving -- how much does pricing matter? How much does distribution matter? How much does packaging matter? All the basics. It's understanding what's happening in the system as the system changes pretty fundamentally as we've widened the brands in the system. So certainly, as we go through this dynamic, we knew it would be a transition. I'm -- we're not at all proud. I'm certainly not proud of our inability to be precise in revenue, and so that's how I'd answer it. It's not -- so we will get better at this. I'm not going to promise that we're going to get instantly better at this, but we're going to get better at the revenue forecasting, but we've got a lot of work to do."

And when you start slower, being able to predict that installed base and being able to predict what it means for each quarter, that's what we're going through on the revenue front.

We did call out that it's hard to predict how much of the brewers that were sold were going to increase the installed base and how many of the brewers we're replacing.

And we have a whole series of reasons why we're confident that, that will happen. First and foremost, we have a complete brewer line up out there at the right price points. So we'll have a number of brewers in the price points that are below $100. We'll also have the price points that we have out there last year. If you recall with the MINI recall, and with the 2.0 launch, we did not have a sub $100 brewer. We're going to have a complete line up of brewers in those price points for the whole season. We won't have a many recall. We at least don't anticipate many recall, certainly. We will have the issue behind us of compatibility and confusion with the consumer as to what works in the system and what doesn't. We have retailer support. We have the makings of a very good holiday season and we expect that and we're working to deliver that. So those are the -- that's the biggest change and once you start the holiday that way and you start the year that way, it rolls through the rest of the year with an installed base growth that we think can be healthy, and growing versus this year. And so then we have the ability to grow pods. And with that, I'll get to your second piece of your question. The pricing on our owned brands and our licensed brands, a lot depends on who their brand competitive set is. And so we are now very, very good at looking and monitoring who are the competitive set? What are our competitive points? We don't -- I don't want to get into pricing per se, but we're going to be competitive and we're going to be effective in making sure we can grow our brands. I will say distribution is a key focus of ours. If you look back 2010, 100% of the Keurig system was owned and licensed brands. 100% of the Keurig system was our owned and licensed brands. As we brought on all of the great partners we have, it's natural that we're going to lose some share. The shelf space gets taken by some very, very strong and powerful brands in the system and brands in the coffee category. And we've seen that, but our brands have done extraordinary well even in that environment. And so yes, there's no question, you're going to have more and more brands come into the system and that has happened. But we think from a brand standpoint, we've got the right portfolio and our owned and license brands can compete. We have also brought in a whole new group of talented people who are experts in CPG, what we call RGM revenue growth management. Yield, price yield, looking at trade spend effectiveness, and trade spend promotion, it's important to recognize that the company really didn't have promotional spending prior to 2012, 2013. We just started it. And so we have real expertise that we've now brought in that is seasoned and who know how to do trade effectiveness and trade promotion. Of course, it takes some time for them to get in and learn the system, because it's not a typical CPG model. But as they come in and learn, I'm confident that over time here, we'll get the expertise we need."

Our hot system is very, very innovative and the cold system is extraordinarily innovative for what's out there in the market today. For the ability, for the consumer to put in a pod, push a button and get a cold Coke or a cold Dr. Pepper, that does not exist today and have it taste great. That capability does not exist today in the marketplace. So the first point is it's extremely innovative. The second point is that when we look at the marketplace, there are -- the stores are -- they are very different categories, hot beverages, and cold beverages are different categories. From an appliance standpoint, we want them in the area where kitchen appliances and home appliances are sold. We don't expect it to come out of the hot systems shelf space. We think it's going to be incremental, and I don't want to comment on individual shelf space. It's really about launching a new system and having a display that's impactful. I will mention one thing that it's worth knowing, and I've gone back and studied pretty thoroughly the 2004 launch of the hot system. And as some of you may know or remember, there were several other hot systems launched at the same time. And I think we can all safely say that they don't exist today in any real number and they were launched by big companies. And many of the companies that launched, assumed and absolutely insisted that the price be very, very low for the consumer, but it didn't have the quality the consumer wanted. Others insisted on broadly spreading the pods and appliances everywhere at the start and retailers quickly rejected it because it didn't have the kind of turn because you can't get an installed base built big quickly enough to have [indiscernible], all the grocery channel get into the pods until there's enough installed base out there. So we have the benefit of watching the 4 other systems that launched as we launched. They don't exist today in any major way in the U.S. In fact, they're not here. And so it's instructive to look at that and we've learned a lot from that and we're going to apply those learnings to KOLD. We'll get the right sampling in the stores. What matters is getting into the store and having people see this product and experience it. We have a benefit today that there's 20 million plus Keurig households already out there, who know and love Keurig and who want -- and who know the benefit of Keurig and they want that applied to cold beverages. So we're going to start slow, we're going to be disciplined and we're very excited about the KOLD launch."

Notwithstanding the current dynamics impacting our business, our hot system remained strong with an enviable category-leading position, a growing installed base, solid cash flow generation and expected fiscal year 2015 EBITDA of approximately $1.1 billion. We're also excited about the prospects for the innovative KOLD platform that we are developing and will soon be launching. Near term challenges aside, we are operating from a position of strength and are confident in our long-term business prospects. 
Importantly, we know the primary drivers that are negatively impacting our business, and we are taking decisive actions to address these challenges, rightsize our organization and better adapt to today's rapidly evolving dynamic marketplace. Today, we are outlining a multiyear productivity program that is designed to enhance our operational effectiveness and enable us to fund incremental investment in innovation and brand building. Fran will take you through the elements of the program later on today's call. 
We have a strong balance sheet and a flexible capital structure that enables us to invest in growth, and we will continue to do so while returning meaningful levels of capital to our shareholders. Since the beginning of fiscal 2013, through the quarter -- third quarter of fiscal 2015, the company has completed over $2.1 billion in share repurchases and has returned nearly $250 million to its shareholders through dividends. As a reflection of our continued confidence in the business, the Board of Directors has approved a new share repurchase authorization for an additional $1 billion for a total available authorization of nearly $1.3 billion.
Let me now discuss the factors impacting the quarter. The 5% decline in revenue in the quarter was below our expectations as we continue to experience challenging category dynamics due to slower than expected installed base growth and increased competitive activity in pods. As we bring in more previously unlicensed brands to our system, we believe other pod manufacturers have excess capacity, which has led them to respond with more aggressive pricing. Additionally, some branded partners have remained promotional. 
During the third quarter, these challenges were greater than anticipated and impacted pod volumes. Volume growth in the U.S. measured channels continues to be strong at 15% total category growth in the quarter, according to IRI. However, we continue to see weakness in several unmeasured channels, including the specialty channel and digital. These factors reduced the total U.S. At Home system category growth to the high single digits. Our U.S. At Home pod volume growth of 12% in the quarter exceeded total system category growth, reflecting the benefit of bringing previously unlicensed brands into our system and the retail expansion of Dunkin' Donuts. 
I would also note that similar to last quarter, we estimate that total Keurig system U.S. At Home shipment growth would've been a few hundred basis points higher if we were manufacturing the pods for all Kraft brands. The U.S. Away from Home business has experienced an acceleration of unlicensed activity, and combined with a tough comparison versus last year's third quarter, resulted in a volume decline in the mid-20s for this segment of our business. 
We have seen a shift in the pod mix over the last year and this continued in the third quarter. Most of this was expected, as we brought a large number of previously unlicensed brands into our system. Our owned and licensed share has decreased this fiscal year as we focused on making sure new partner brands were introduced with excellence, while competitors have been stepping up promotions.
We recognize that our own brands are important assets and we plan to increase our focus and investment levels now that previously unlicensed brands transitions are mostly complete.
Our priorities include making our promotions more effective and refreshing our packaging while continuing to innovate our own brands with new offerings and working to regain our fair share of distribution. Currently, our owned and licensed brands have approximately 40% share of system pods in measured channels, and we are committed to maintaining their strength and competitiveness. Improving performance will require leveraging and supporting both our owned and licensed brands as well as those of our partners because the strength of the Keurig system has always been in the breadth of consumer choice. We are fortunate to have the finest beverage brand partners of any home beverage system in the world and believe that we have created strong, long-term partnerships that are highly beneficial to ourselves, our partners, our customers and our consumers. 
We created the Keurig system and have been continually investing in, developing and enhancing the system and all of its components for the benefit of all participants for over 15 years. We also perform a wide range of services for our partners, including access to specialty channels where many partners do not have a sales infrastructure, beverage development and coffee procurement. Finally, our manufacturing scale provides an attractive cost structure as well as the flexibility to respond to the diverse needs of our partners.
We enter each partnership in a thoughtful manner. We carefully assess the long-term impact on the total system. While there is now more variability in operating profit per pod across the system, we will continue to manage the system as a portfolio and expect to maintain attractive pod operating margins.
Turning to brewers. Brewer volumes were down 18% in the quarter as we continue to work through the high levels of inventory at retail on reservoir brewers and experience lower sales of MINI brewers as we continue to restock that product at retailers. Brewer price realization declined in the quarter due to investments we made in brewer promotions to work through inventory. Although brewer shipments were below our expectations in the quarter, we see signs of improvement in brewer point-of-sale data with the reservoir brewer volumes up 3% in the quarter, excluding the MINI and Vue.
We are encouraged by the launch of our K200 line, our entry-level reservoir 2.0 brewer, which is off to a good start with positive reviews from consumers and good feedback from retailers. Despite slower installed base growth in 2015, which we now expect to be approximately 10%, we are confident that the hot platform has a long runway for growth. We believe we can accelerate brewer sales and that our long-term penetration goals are achievable.
That said, these goals require consistent performance and smart innovation. For holiday 2015, which is our first quarter of fiscal 2016, we will have a broader portfolio with a variety of brewer models across more price points. We expect the MINI to be back in wider distribution along with a variety of reservoir brewers, including the K200, which address key price points. We expect the My K-Cup accessory for 2.0 brewers to begin shipping this fall, in time for the holiday. A 1.0 reservoir model, the K40, will also be offered in limited distribution. We will also debut new consumer communication, highlighting the benefits of Keurig Single Serve options as well as the broad variety and choice in our system.
These messages will be communicated to consumers through an advertising campaign on brewer boxes and through in-store marketing. We believe these key initiatives will lead to a successful upcoming holiday season. 
Turning to an update on Keurig KOLD. We are very excited to introduce this disruptive technology to consumers in a category that is 5x the size of hot beverages in the U.S. As we have stated, we are still planning a disciplined, measured launch in the fall, and now expect to begin shipping drinkmakers and pods in the late September, early October time frame.
During the initial digital launch, we expect to have key partner brands, Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Sprite, Fanta, Dr. Pepper and Canada Dry, along with the wide variety of our own carbonated and noncarbonated brands.
Retail assortment during the initial launch will vary of course, dependent upon how many varieties individual retailers choose to stock, and how we choose to manage our mix in the plant.
Post the initial launch, additional partner and owned brands and varieties will ship on a rolling basis. We intend to manage our brand mix to optimize the benefits to our partners, our retailers and most importantly, our consumers.
From an appliance standpoint, our continued expectation is to sell hundreds of thousands of drink makers in the first 12 months of the launch.
Let me now take a moment to discuss the additional actions that we are taking to improve our performance and position the Keurig hot and cold systems for long-term success. Today, we are detailing a multi-year productivity program that is expected to generate approximately $300 million in savings over the next 3 years, with approximately $100 million of savings in fiscal 2016. We recognize that we need to take steps to actively enhance our organization's efficiency and effectiveness. As the competitive environment has become more challenging, we also need to lower our structural cost to compete efficiently, while freeing up dollars to invest in our innovation pipeline and fund incremental investment in our brands. We believe this program will make us stronger and faster and position the company well for the long-term.
As part of this program, we will take this opportunity to stream our organizational structure. We will be combining our U.S. and Canadian businesses into one North American organization to be led by a head of North America. We've begun a search for the new leader in this role, who will report directly to me. We are confident that we will bring on board a talented leader to fill this important role and help us lead to greater future growth and success.
As previously announced, Pete Leemputte will assume the role of Chief Financial Officer in mid-August. Pete brings over 30 years of experience in corporate finance leadership positions, most recently as CFO of Mead Johnson Nutrition company, a company that also has strong consumer brands, sold through multiple channels. I'm confident that Keurig will benefit from his knowledge and perspective, and a particular area of his focus will be partnering with our commercial teams to further drive growth and improve results.
As this will be Fran's last conference call, I just want to take a moment to thank Fran for her 12 years of service and leadership to Keurig. Keurig has benefited tremendously from Fran's tireless commitment, her passion and integrity and action across our business. We have nothing but the highest amount of respect and gratitude for Fran, and I know I speak on behalf of everyone on this call when I say that we wish you all the best. Thank you, Fran.
In addition, John Whoriskey, our President of U.S. Sales and Marketing, is retiring. We want to thank John for his 13 years of service, as he has been a key part of Keurig's growth, and we thank John as well.
We are actively and decisively moving to improve our performance and our results. It will take time, likely several quarters, for our efforts to impact our financial results. This is because we expect that the current pod environment will remain challenging into 2016, and the implementation of our productivity plan will ramp as the year goes on.
Looking ahead, based upon our preliminary estimates for fiscal 2016, we expect the hot business to deliver modest non-GAAP earnings per share growth over fiscal 2015. This includes the benefits from the productivity program I referenced earlier, and excludes any onetime charges from this program.
We also expect the P&L investment in Keurig KOLD in 2016 will be at least $100 million and could be higher, depending largely on pod manufacturing efficiencies and channel mix. We will update and provide a more detailed fiscal year 2016 outlook on the fourth quarter's earnings announcement.
At present, we are not changing our longer-term earnings per share outlook for beyond 2016. When we talked about our long-term algorithm in September of 2013, the margin profile we discussed to get to our earnings growth assumed a far less competitive environment.
So going forward, if the competitive environment markedly improves and we execute on the productivity and other initiatives I mentioned today, we believe our longer-term outlook is intact. If, however, the dynamics of the marketplace stay as they are today for a prolonged period of time, we believe we'll be able to hit our earnings per share growth rate targets, but the margin profile that gets us there would certainly be different. We'll just have to monitor market dynamics throughout fiscal 2016.
Before I turn it over to Fran, I want to reiterate that our hot business generates healthy cash flows with approximately $1.1 billion in EBITDA, and we have a strong balance sheet. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders while investing in our future. We are the category leader. We have a focused plan and we're committed to executing that plan. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Fran."
334622,306997321,850357,"Keurig Green Mountain, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian. For the third quarter, we generated net sales of $970 million, down 5% versus the prior year quarter and down 4% excluding currency impacts. Brewer volumes declined 18%, representing unit sales below our expectations as we continued to work",1110,"Thanks, Brian. For the third quarter, we generated net sales of $970 million, down 5% versus the prior year quarter and down 4% excluding currency impacts. Brewer volumes declined 18%, representing unit sales below our expectations as we continued to work through high levels of inventory at retail and restock the MINI. Brewer net price realization declined 6%, as we had higher promotional levels in an effort to clear inventory. Brewer mix declined by 2 percentage points and foreign currency exchange rates had a negative 1% impact. Pod revenue declined 1%. Volume increased 5%, with 3 percentage points of pricing offset by 8 percentage points of negative mix and a roughly 1 percentage point unfavorable impact from currency.
Pod volumes for the quarter came in below expectations. This was due to lower installed base growth, softer-than-expected performance in digital and some of our partner brands, and increased unlicensed activity in the Away from Home channel. Our At Home pod volumes increased 12% in the quarter, while our Away from Home volumes declined in the mid-20s.
In addition to volume, mix was slightly worse than expected, driven by weakness in our digital channel and lower share performance on our owned brands. Pricing was also below our forecast, due to higher than planned competitive activity. 
If we break down results regionally for the quarter, our U.S. business revenue declined 4% while our Canadian business declined 14%. Excluding the impact of currency, the Canadian business declined 3% for the quarter.
Moving on to a review of gross profit. For the quarter, our gross margin declined 750 basis points to 36% of net sales. Excluding the $18 million charge related to lower-than-anticipated sales of 2.0 brewers, gross margin declined 560 basis points. The decline was largely driven by higher obsolescence; higher coffee costs; negative brewer mix, as we sold a greater percentage of 2.0 brewers; and higher logistics costs. We also experienced negative pod mix and negative price realization on brewers where we had higher promotions in an effort to lower inventory models. These negative margin drivers were partially offset by higher pod pricing and a shift in sales mix between brewers and pods.
Turning to operating results. Non-GAAP SG&A decreased by 14% in the quarter. As a percentage of sales, non-GAAP SG&A decreased by 190 basis points to 17.8% of sales due to a lower incentive compensation expense, marketing expense and lower consulting fees. Our non-GAAP operating profit declined 28% for the quarter, reflecting lower gross profit, partially offset by decreases in SG&A. Our third quarter tax rate of 30.2% was favorable to our prior-year period tax rate of 33.9%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 includes a negative $0.02 impact from foreign exchange and a negative $0.08 impact related to the brewer write-down. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the brewer write-down, non-GAAP EPS was $0.90 a share. 
Turning to the balance sheet and free cash flow. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.3x, free cash flow increased 9% as compared to the year-ago quarter. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $272 million was below prior-year levels, primarily due to higher working capital levels and investment related to our new Keurig KOLD launch. 
Moving on to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect a net sales decline in the low teens and non-GAAP EPS of $0.70 to $0.75 per share; we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 36% to 36.5% range; we expect our fourth quarter revenue to be impacted by several factors: the prior-year fourth quarter included approximately 4 percentage point benefit from retailers buying ahead of our fiscal year-end SAP implementation and a 2 percentage point negative impact of the reserve for the MINI recall, netting to 2 points of difficult comparison; negative brewer shipment growth year-over-year of approximately 20%; pod volumes will be affected by the impact of lower brewer sales on the installed base, continuing elevated competitive activity, particularly in the Away from Home channel, as well as a difficult comparison against SAP advanced ordering impact in the prior year; we expect minimal sales contribution from Keurig KOLD in the fourth quarter; and lastly, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact total revenue growth by approximately 2 percentage points.
Our fourth quarter EPS guidance is impacted by the following factors: We expect brewers to be a smaller percentage of mix versus the prior-year period, which will positively impact margins year-over-year; commodities will be a headwind in Q4 on a year-over-year basis, but slightly less than Q3 '15; pod mix is expected to negatively impact margins; Keurig KOLD launch-related expenses and start-up costs and KOLD pod production; and foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact the EPS by approximately $0.03.
And finally, please note that our fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes any restructuring and onetime charges related to the productivity initiative announced today.
Moving to our full year guidance. For fiscal 2015, we expect a net sales decline of low single to mid-single digits relative to fiscal 2014. We are revising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to a low teens decline. Our EPS guidance embeds a tax rate of 34.5% to 35%, and includes an estimated $0.13 negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Our guidance excludes any restructuring and onetime charges related to the company's productivity initiatives. Additionally, our current EPS guidance takes into account KOLD investments of slightly over $100 million in fiscal 2015.
We now expect free cash flow in the range of $150 million to $200 million and capital investment in the range of $400 million to $450 million. Embedded in our capital investment guidance is North America hot platform investment within our previously mentioned 4% to 7% of revenue target, with the remainder representing investment in new products and platforms. As Brian mentioned earlier, we will be implementing a multi-year productivity plan with the objective of reducing structural costs and adapting our organizational structure to become stronger on the ground and speed our decision-making.
Our efforts will be focused across the organization and include: optimizing manufacturing efficiency to reduce conversion and packaging costs, reducing obsolescence, lowering our distribution cost, increasing the effectiveness of our promotional program, and reducing nonworking marketing spend. Brian gave our initial view of -- on fiscal '16 in his remarks, and I would like to comment on the first quarter of fiscal '16. As we invest behind brewers in both hot and cold, ramp production on KOLD pods and face a significant coffee cost headwind in the first quarter, we expect our first quarter to be the most challenging from a non-GAAP EPS perspective.
Now I'll turn the call back to Brian to wrap up."

And I guess, related to that, one of the things that we had heard through the quarter is that returns have been a little bit abnormally high on the 2.0. And I see that in the balance sheet or on the cash flow statement, the reserve for returns has gone up.

That's -- it's critical to growing the installed base. On the second question, we have seen higher returns on 2.0. Initially, we saw higher returns and we are clear on what drove those returns. Early on, it was about the compatibility. And then as we moved from compatibility, it became the -- there's what some call a clogged needle. In reality, the clogged needle exists both on 1.0 and 2.0 at about the same level. But what the 2.0 did differently, the brew engine and the algorithm is different. And so if you're a consumer who had Keurig prior and you got a new one, in some cases, in some locations, with some pods, it would change the way it brewed. And so you might have thought that, that was something that was different and you didn't like it and so consumers brought it back. And so those were the 2 things that drove that increase in returns. So yes, we did see it. So I want to make sure I answered those 2 questions."

The second piece though, and perhaps the more important piece overall, is that if we have a terrific system that continues to grow the installed base at healthy rates, if we have the kind of cost advantage we believe we have today given our scale and the scope, if we have partnership relationships that are long term and partnerships that are truly mutually beneficial, we believe the partnerships will stay like they have all along.

The 2 factors are when the installed base growth slows versus -- we've been growing in the 20 plus, 25 plus, 30 plus range in the last few years and it's about 10% year-to-date. That kind of growth slowdown, while still healthy for most categories, is not what we've historically experienced. And so we've added a number of brands to the system at a time when the growth rate is slowing and everybody wants -- everybody who's in the system wants to get a bigger and bigger share of that growth, and so you've got a lot of competition going on in the system because of that, and that's healthy and that's good competition. The second piece is excess capacity. We have won a large number of unlicensed -- previously unlicensed brands into the system. And I really can't comment on the -- what happens to that capacity. Our job is to make sure we have the best brands in the system, that we do everything we can for our owned and licensed brands, that we support our partner brands, and make sure we continue to grow the system.

And then if you look at the productivity initiatives we're doing, we know that there's -- there are productivity opportunities that we can take in the hot system that can help offset some of that competitive environment and ensure that we get the kind of modest EPS growth that we talked about. And so we're at a time when we're both transitioning our hot system and we're launching an entirely new system for the company. And so there's no question that, that is quite a transitional period for the company we're going through. We're confident in both systems, but that's -- what can give you confidence in the hot system is that for more than 15 years, it's been the leading system here in North America. It continues to be, with the strongest brands and, by far, the strongest consumer brand. It has extraordinarily strong passion among the consumers who love Keurig. It has excellent distribution, strong retail support and on every front, we have an advantaged position in the hot system. And that position has allowed us to put EPS numbers up that grow. Now there's no question. It's more competitive today than it's been because of the slower growth in the installed base, and as we've moved more brands into the system and that excess capacity is out there. But we view that as a transitional period, and we're going to get through it, and we're going to be competitive, and then we're going to get through this and the hot system will continue to grow. Importantly, we believe the hot system has the potential to reach the goals, and we've mentioned it, the 50 million households we think is a realistic goal and we're not even halfway there yet."

Coming into this quarter, I thought the issue with the earnings trajectory was related to weak brewer sales and larger year-over-year losses on brewers because of more discounting and ineffective marketing et cetera. But really, the debate and the loss of confidence in your strategy from an investment standpoint -- investor standpoint seems to be around a structural issue in the K-Cup business, from a margin perspective. So you've talked about installed base growth slowing down, but then we're seeing some positive signs of brewer sales growth returning. So just, can you -- like is this a brewer problem that you're going through? Is it both a brewer/K-Cup profitability problem? And the K-Cup profitability problem, does it have -- is it driven by bringing in non-licensed partners at much lower margins? Just your competition commentary makes it sound like margins in the K-Cup business have peaked and are about to go on a major downward trend. So just can you clarify that?"

First, I would characterize it as a brewer challenge more than a structural issue in pod margin. It's not a structural issue in pod margin. We make healthy operating margins across our portfolio today, and we expect those healthy operating margins to continue in the future. The brewer challenge is what the real issue is. And when you have a tough holiday season like we did, and you don't sell more brewers than you did the prior year, you have the challenge. Now, yes, it's -- some will say it's still healthy growth and its 10% growth of a category, and there aren't many that are growing at that rate. But to us, we look at it as it's not growth enough. It's not satisfactory, and particularly at a time when we brought in so many new brands into the system. And quite frankly, what happens is, we can bring more brands into the system faster than shelf space can expand, faster than some of the other physicals of the business can expand. And so the structural issue in pod margin, we don't see it. We see the ability to long-term generate strong operating profits in pods. Then if you look at just a couple of other items that happened this year, coffee costs hit us this year and they went the wrong way. And then as you know, we have a higher cost of the 2.0, which we're working to drive down and we'll drive that down. But those 3 pieces really are what are driving this transition as we go through it. But so it's brewer installed base growth, it's brewer costs and it's the coffee costs that hit us this year. Those are the fundamentals. The pod margins are healthy and will continue to be healthy."

There is -- it is more difficult and it's more challenging, that's not an excuse, it just is. We have a wide range of revenue per pod and it requires an exact prediction of what the mix of those pods will be. So one of the unique things in this model is while the operating profit, as we've said, is healthy across our portfolio and while it's a little wider today than it's been, the operating profit we were clear on and that's healthy. The revenue per pod is quite different across the pods, and particularly, as we bought the new pods in and as we do -- we had different value and had different services for each pod, we charge a different revenue. And so our ability, quite honestly, to predict that revenue by pod, by brand, across all the channels, across all of our partners, it's not simple. That's not an excuse, that's just the reality and it's shown in our inability to predict accurately our revenue growth. We are doing a number of things to get better at this. We've got plenty of models. Everyone has models. The issue is understanding how does a consumer respond to changes on the shelf? What is it that's driving -- how much does pricing matter? How much does distribution matter? How much does packaging matter? All the basics. It's understanding what's happening in the system as the system changes, pretty fundamentally, as we've widened the brands in the system.

And when you start slower, being able to predict that installed base and being able to predict what it means for each quarter, that's what we're going through on the revenue front.

And I think just over the course of this year, I think it has been difficult coming off of the holiday season. We did call out that it's hard to predict how much of the brewers that were sold were going to increase the installed base and how many of the brewers we're replacing. So that also has impacted somewhat our ability to be predictable in terms of trying to assess what the installed base has grown, and therefore, how much the overall -- how much do we forecast for the pod volume growth."

And we have a whole series of reasons why we're confident that, that will happen. First and foremost, we have a complete brewer line up out there at the right price points. So we'll have a number of brewers in the price points that are below $100. We'll also have the price points that we had out there last year. If you recall, with the MINI recall, and with the 2.0 launch, we did not have a sub-$100 brewer. We're going to have a complete line-up of brewers in those price points for the whole season. We won't have a MINI recall. We at least don't anticipate MINI recall, certainly. We will have the issue behind us of compatibility and confusion with the consumer as to what works in the system and what doesn't. We have retailer support. We have the makings of a very good holiday season, and we expect that and we're working to deliver that. So those are the -- that's the biggest change. And once you start the holiday that way and you start the year that way, it rolls through the rest of the year with an installed base growth that we think can be healthy and growing versus this year. And so then we have the ability to grow pods. And with that, I'll get to your second piece of your question. The pricing on our owned brands and our licensed brands, a lot depends on who their brand competitive set is. And so we are now very, very good at looking and monitoring who are the competitive set? What are our price points? We don't -- I don't want to get into pricing per se, but we're going to be competitive and we're going to be effective in making sure we can grow our brands. I will say distribution is a key focus of ours. If you look back, 2010, 100% of the Keurig system was owned and licensed brands. 100% of the Keurig system was our owned and licensed brands. As we brought on all of the great partners we have, it's natural that we're going to lose some share. The shelf space gets taken by some very, very strong and powerful brands in the system and brands in the coffee category. And we've seen that, but our brands have done extraordinarily well even in that environment. And so yes, there's no question, you're going to have more and more brands come into the system, and that has happened. But we think from a brand standpoint, we've got the right portfolio and our owned and license brands can compete. We have also brought in a whole new group of talented people who are experts in CPG, what we call, RGM, revenue growth management, yield, price yield, looking at trade spend effectiveness, and trade spend promotion. It's important to recognize that the company really didn't have promotional spending prior to 2012, 2013. We just started it. And so we have real expertise that we've now brought in that is seasoned and who know how to do trade effectiveness and trade promotion. Of course, it takes some time for them to get in and learn the system, because it's not a typical CPG model. But as they come in and learn, I'm confident that over time here, we'll get the expertise we need."

Our hot system is very, very innovative and the KOLD system is extraordinarily innovative for what's out there in the market today. For the ability, for the consumer to put in a pod, push a button and get a cold Coke or a cold Dr. Pepper, that does not exist today and have it taste great. That capability does not exist today in the marketplace. So the first point is it's extremely innovative. The second point is that when we look at the marketplace, there are -- the stores are -- they are very different categories. Hot beverages and cold beverages are different categories. From an appliance standpoint, we want them in the area where kitchen appliances and home appliances are sold. We don't expect it to come out of the hot systems shelf space. We think it's going to be incremental, and I don't want to comment on individual shelf space. It's really about launching a new system and having a display that's impactful. I will mention one thing that it's worth knowing, and I've gone back and studied pretty thoroughly the 2004 launch of the hot system. And as some of you may know or remember, there were several other hot systems launched at the same time. And I think we can all safely say that they don't exist today in any real number, and they were launched by big companies. And many of the companies that launched assumed and absolutely insisted that the price be very, very low for the consumer, but it didn't have the quality the consumer wanted. Others insisted on broadly spreading the pods and appliances everywhere at the start, and retailers quickly rejected it because it didn't have the kind of turn because you can't get an installed base built big quickly enough to have, for instance, all the grocery channel get into the pods until there's enough installed base out there. So we have the benefit of watching the 4 other systems that launched as we launched. They don't exist today in any major way in the U.S. In fact, they're not here. And so it's instructive to look at that, and we've learned a lot from that and we're going to apply those learnings to KOLD. We'll get the right sampling in the stores. What matters is getting into the store, having people see this product and experience it. We have a benefit today in that there's 20-million-plus Keurig households already out there, who know and love Keurig and who want -- and who know the benefit of Keurig and they want that applied to cold beverages. So we're going to start slow, we're going to be disciplined and we're very excited about the KOLD launch."

I'll start this afternoon with a brief overview of our 2015 financial results, followed by comments on current market conditions and our outlook for 2016 before Pete provides further details",2136,"Thank you, Kristi, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I'll start this afternoon with a brief overview of our 2015 financial results, followed by comments on current market conditions and our outlook for 2016 before Pete provides further details on the numbers. I'll then wrap up with a few comments on 2016 priorities. 
Looking at the big picture, our results for the quarter and for the year reflect the competitive and dynamic marketplace in which we are operating and the steps we are taking to position our company for the future. We're making progress on our cost-reduction efforts and we continue to generate strong cash flows. And while market conditions are challenging in the near term, we are confident we are taking the right actions to position our company for longer-term growth and shareholder value creation. 
For the fourth quarter, we generated revenues within our guidance range and earnings came in above the range we estimated in our last call at $0.85 per share, on the benefits of our cost-reduction efforts as well as a lower effective tax rate. Free cash flow for fiscal year 2015 was above our guidance at $344 million. Importantly, free cash flow for our hot business grew $200 million year-over-year. Our goal is to continually proactively manage the business to maximize cash flow efficiency in order to build on this momentum. 
We continue to return substantial cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. From our third quarter earnings report to today, we've repurchased $350 million worth of common shares. In addition, we announced this afternoon that our board increased the dividend by 13% to an annualized rate of $1.30 per share. These actions reflect our confidence in the strong cash flow generation capacity of the company and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. 
As we highlighted on our last earnings call, we continue to see a competitive and dynamic marketplace resulting in some near-term challenges in our business as we continue the Keurig brewer transition as well as increasing competitive activity in pods. While expect some of these headwinds will continue in 2016, we are focused on executing against the solid holiday season plan that we believe will better position us for the future. 
In addition, we continue to rationalize our infrastructure to the current demand environment, highlighted by our 3-year, $300 million productivity initiative. We continue to expect to realize about $100 million in savings in 2016. Now I'd like to review some of the key factors impacting results and our forward outlook. 
Based on our latest surveys and models, we estimate that the U.S. At Home installed base of active single serve brewers grew by 8% in 2015 to just over $21 million appliances. While installed base growth remains quite healthy, the rate of growth slowed in 2015. Now it's important to note that in general, not all brewers we ship end up increasing our active installed base. This is because retailers hold a certain amount of inventory, consumers can return a brewer, they might replace an existing appliance or in some cases, the appliance is never used at all. 
In previous years, we generally saw from 45% to 50% of U.S. At Home shipments contribute to growth in the installed base. During 2015, that rate came in significantly below that 40% to 50% due to a number of factors. First was the weak holiday season last year. Specifically, lower consumer purchases means fewer new and incremental users. Second, there were greater replacements of existing Keurig brewers. Our consumers are very loyal to our brand and some wanted to shift to the latest technology. The trade up doesn't increase our installed base number. We expect that this factor by itself would diminish over time. Third, the average life of a brewer is between 3 to 4 years. We are now seeing the anniversary of strong appliance unit sales in prior years, leading to a larger absolute number of replacements in the installed base during 2015. Fourth, we saw an increase in the return rates as compared to prior years due primarily to consumer confusion with pod compatibility, particularly early on in fiscal 2015 with the launch of 2.0. We believe this initial launch factor will have a more limited impact in 2016 with improved communication and packaging, and with the recent relaunch of the Keurig My K-Cup. Finally, the many product action had more of an impact than we originally expected. Additional research has shown that some consumers are more likely to enter the single serve category at a lower price point, more in line with our MINI product offering. With the MINI in very limited distribution as a result of the product action we took and the K200 not launching until late spring, we simply didn't have a strong low-priced product lineup during the first half of our fiscal year. 
Looking ahead, we entered the 2015 holiday season in a much stronger position. We have a broader portfolio of brewer models across more price points with stronger offerings in the key sub $100 category. The MINI brewer is back in broad distribution and we have reduced its price to $79 to drive adoption with consumer looking for Keurig convenience and quality in a lower-priced offering. 
Our small footprint, K 200 entry-level 2.0 brewer, is also available this holiday season in a variety of colors with strong promotional plans. The K200 has been quite well received by consumers and has average ratings above 4 stars. This model has exceeded our initial expectations and is now the highest volume Keurig brewers sold in the single service marketplace. We will continue to offer our premium models for consumers looking for a larger reservoir and more features. 
On the marketing front, our new advertising campaign, your favorite, your way, kicked off in October. The campaign leverages a lifestage strategy, it demonstrates the benefit of single serve versus drip coffee to consumers as they move into their first apartment, become parents or move to a new city. The campaign is multi-platform with television spots across multiple dayparts, including 9 of the top 10 ranked primetime shows. We also have a strong digital campaigns, including custom programs with Hulu and Yahoo. Additionally, we are continuing to message the variety and choice in the Keurig system on the box and through in-store marketing. 
Importantly, we are delivering both increased effectiveness and productivity in our marketing investment as a result of consolidating our media agencies earlier in fiscal 2015. Looking to fiscal 2016, we expect that the actions we are taking will lead to some recovery in the percentage of our U.S. At Home shipments that contribute to an increase brewer installed base. While strong unit volume growth in the past 3 to 4 years will continue to impact the number of deactivations, we also expect to see lower price points in both the MINI and the K200 to bring new consumers in the single serve category. 
In addition, the relaunch of My K-Cup gives consumers to brew their favorite beverages in the Keurig system. Our current expectation is that the U.S. At Home installed base will grow in the mid- to high-single-digits in fiscal 2016. 
There's been some concern noted by the overall marketplace in recent weeks about the strength of consumer spending this holiday season. While we of course, are not immune to overall market trends, we believe that an improving mix of new consumers to the Keurig single serve coffee platform could help mitigate any impact from weaker economic growth. 
More broadly, despite the current environment, we do believe that our core hot platform has plenty of whitespace to drive longer-term growth. We remain the category leader in single serve with an installed base that's growing and we fully expect single serve to continue gaining share of total coffeemakers over time. 
Turning to pods. Lower brewer installed base growth in fiscal 2015 as well as excess capacity at other pod manufacturers, created challenging category dynamics, which we continue to experience in the fourth quarter. Volume growth in U.S. measured channels was 13% in the quarter. We continue to see weakness in the specialty and digital channels, bringing total U.S. At Home category growth in the quarter to approximately 7%. Against that 7% growth in pod consumption, our total pod shipments declined 4% in the quarter with U.S. At Home volumes down 3% as we faced a difficult shipment comparison year-over-year. Notably, we typically see a build in channel pod inventories during our fiscal fourth quarter as colder temperatures become the norm and the holiday season approaches. The heavy build last year was attributed in part to the preordering by customers in advance of our SAP implementation which started in early 2014. 
After further analysis, we also believe there were additional factors at work in the fourth quarter of 2014, including the need for new partners to the Keurig system to build their in-house inventory, some pre-buying ahead of our November price increase and retailers planning for a big holiday on the 2.0 system. As a result of all these factors, we believe the 7% growth in the retail demand for pods in the fourth quarter of 2015 is the best measure of underlying performance of the category. 
For 2016, we are focusing -- forecasting U.S. At Home pod volumes to grow in line with installed base growth. Pod pricing remains competitive as other pod manufacturers have excess capacity. We have also seen downward price pressure on the part of other brands in the marketplace which may be due in part to coffee prices, where the fee price has fallen by about 40% in the past year. 
As I mentioned, on our last call, we have seen a mix shift this year away from owned and licensed brands, which continued in the fourth quarter, which was expected as we brought previously unlicensed brands into our system and expanded our partnership with Dunkin' Donuts. You will recall that prior to 2015, Dunkin had previously sold K-cups in their retail outlets only. But this popular brand is now fully available in broad distribution. We will continue to manage our pod business as a portfolio, supporting both our owned and licensed brands as well as those of our partners. 
Recent innovation on our owned brands includes Green Mountain Organics, Green Mountain Coffee House Beverages and Laughing Man, which are all available on keurig.com and are in the process of expanding retail distribution throughout 2016. In the terms of partner brands, we added Community Coffee, Miley Food and Elite, while starting to transition the Kraft brands into our system, in addition to the Dunkin expansion. 
The strength of the Keurig system has always been the variety, choice and convenience we provide to consumers, and its these very facts that we believe will continue to drive long-term growth in both brewers and pods. 
Turning to an update on Keurig KOLD. In terms of cold, we are pleased to launch the product this fall. These are very early days and we caution the 2016 will be a year of launch and learn. This is the exciting new technology and we intend to test different methods of marketing, both retail and digital as well as pricing during the upcoming year to guide us as we build this new category and this new technology. We believe that experiencing the excitement of the system and the fresh cold taste of the beverages is critical to driving consumer acceptance. 
As a result, you'll see us staff for live demos in retail stores and malls as well as build awareness with mobile vans and pop-up destinations with our Keurig KOLD cube. What that means in terms of numbers? Sales for the first 12 months of the launch will likely be in the range of 60,000 to 100,000 units based on what we see today. Our early read from consumers is positive. 
On a taste profile of the beverage from both our partner brands and our new owned brands. Rita and Tina's, and Unit Street Lounge cocktail mixers have just launched on keurig.com, adding to our portfolio of Kraft and fountain style sodas, 0 and low-calorie flavored saltzers and waters, sports hydration drinks and iced teas. We have always viewed Keurig KOLD as a long-term multi-phased rollout. It is very early in the launch and we're taking the time necessary to learn from retailers and consumers to maximize the opportunity for long-term success. 
We expect to continually improve the appliance, its footprint and price point over time, and our development efforts on those fronts continue. What we will be disciplined and pragmatic in our approach to investment levels over the long-term, and we will invest only as marketplace success dictates. 
With that, I'll pass this call over to Pete."
334622,315883135,906032,"Keurig Green Mountain, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2015",2015-11-18,"Earnings Calls","Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian. I'm glad to be here and look forward to working with our shareholders and the investment community in my new role at Keurig. I'll start with some details on the fourth quarter before turning my attention to our outlook for 2016, and then wr",2841,"Thanks, Brian. I'm glad to be here and look forward to working with our shareholders and the investment community in my new role at Keurig. I'll start with some details on the fourth quarter before turning my attention to our outlook for 2016, and then wrap up with some comments on our balance sheet and free cash flow. Please note that the numbers I referenced will largely be our non-GAAP figures, unless otherwise noted. You can reference our press release for a full reconciliation with the GAAP results. 
So turning to the quarter. We generated net sales of $1.04 billion compared to $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, and within the range detailed in our last conference call. Excluding currency impacts, sales were lower by 11%. The stronger dollar added a further 2% to the decline and reported sales were off by 13%. Brewer and accessory sales were down 32% with pod sales down 9%. Let me highlight some of the most important drivers of fourth quarter sales starting with brewers. 
Brewer volumes were 20% lower than 2014, in line with our expectations. Volumes were impacted by retailer inventory fluctuation. We're comparing against the retail sell-in associated with the Keurig 2.0 will launch in the prior year, along with continuing efforts to clear excess brewer inventory at retail this year. Partially offsetting is the MINI product action, which reduced sales in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
In addition to volumes, mix reduced brewer sales by 10%, driven by the lower price K200 model in greater unit sales of the MINI brewer. It's important to note that the K200 launched in the spring of 2015 and was not included in the 2014 retail sell-in for the 2.0. And the MINI brewer had an elevated impact on mix in the fourth quarter 2015 as we're comparing against the sales reserve taken for the product action in the prior year quarter. 
As we move through 2016, we expect that brewer mix will improve noticeably from this fourth quarter level, particularly as we compare against the growing MINI and K200 volumes seen during the second half of 2015. Finally, brewer pricing in the fourth quarter declined by 1% and foreign exchange negatively impacted brewer sales by 1 additional percentage point. We intend to have a heavier mix of promotional support for brewers during the 2015 holiday season and have reduced the price of the MINI. Lower brewer pricing will therefore, be much more pronounced in the first quarter of 2016 than the levels seen in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Keep in mind that the promotional investments, along with a stronger product lineup at lower price points, is targeted to bring new and incremental users into our installed base. Turning to pods. The sales decline of 9% in the quarter was composed of a 4% lower volume and a 6% decrease in mix. This was partially offset by a 2% increase in net pricing. Foreign exchange, negatively impacted pod sales by 2%. 
It's clear that the fourth quarter volume comparison versus 2014 was impacted by retailers ordering pods more aggressively last year, ahead of our SAP implementation. But as Brian noted, we believe that the retailer loaded went beyond the SAP implementation with additional channel builds for the 2.0 launch, and for the price increase we took last November, and for the new and expanding brands coming into the Keurig system.
As a result, we believe that the 7% growth in consumer demand for pods in the U.S. At Home marketplace during the fourth quarter is the best metric for viewing the health of the category and our pod business. In 2016, we expect pod volume growth to track the mid- to high single-digit increase in our brewer installed base. Finally, note the Away from Home pod environment remains competitive, with volume decline in the low teens during the quarter. 
Unfavorable mix for our owned and licensed brands reduced pod sales by about 6% in the fourth quarter, a better trend than the 8% mix impact seen in the third quarter of 2015. You may recall we started to bring in new partners to the Keurig system in a meaningful way during the fourth quarter of 2014. So the year-over-year mix comparisons has started to ease somewhat as a result. 
Note that our partner expansion continued into the second half of 2015 when Dunkin' Donuts broader retail distribution to KOLD, so the mix back arriving for new entrants to the Keurig system will remain a bit unfavorable until we get into the second half of 2016. Additionally, our shipment mix can also be influenced by share changes at retail. Pricing actions by competitors could result in higher or lower share for our owned and licensed brands in 2016. We'll obviously, be watching this closely. 
Turning to profitability. Non-GAAP gross margin was down 300 basis points in the quarter with higher coffee costs accounting for almost 3/4 of the decline versus 2014. On a sequential basis looking forward, we expect that coffee costs reflected in our cost of goods sold will remain at this high level during the first quarter of 2016 before starting to decline in the second quarter with a more noticeable drop in the second half of 2016. 
On a full year basis, we will see a slight benefit from lower coffee costs in 2016 compared to 2015. A second factor influencing our non-GAAP gross margins in the fourth quarter and accounting for 1 quarter of the decline versus the prior year is an $8.6 million obsolescence charge or $0.04 per share for the write-down of our inventory of both commercial brewers. Please note that non-GAAP gross profit excludes a $20 million noncash pretax charge related to both and other packaging lines. 
On a full year basis, obsolescence charges reduced non-GAAP gross margins by 160 basis points, or almost $0.30 per share in 2015 versus 2014. While brewer obsolescence was 1 key factor, a significant portion of these charges came from pods as well. We have started an important effort toward reducing pod obsolescence cost by tightening our management of inventories in order to limit product aging beyond its stated useful life among other actions. 
We can see that our year-end inventory of pods is about 20% below the levels seen in 2014. Not only have we generated enhanced cash flow from these actions, but we will also see a significant benefit to our bottom line through reduced obsolescence expense in 2016. Finally, I want to point out that we saw favorable trend in sales returns for brewers in the fourth quarter, a first for 2015. This is the result of retailer mix and we believe, the reflection of the four-star plus rating carried by our 200 brewer. We expect additional progress in fiscal 2016. 
Just a brief word on operating expenses. Non-GAAP SG&A declined 20% in the quarter or 120 basis points when measured as a percentage of sales, driven by lower marketing expense, headcount and variable incentive accruals. Note that we are driving greater efficiency from our marketing investments through consolidation of our media agencies. 
Keep in mind that fourth quarter non-GAAP SG&A expense, excludes $16 [ph] million in pretax restructuring charges related to our previously announced productivity program. These expenses are primarily employee severance costs and all but $4 million are expected to be cash expenditures. Looking at earnings per share. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.85 in the quarter, above the range shared in our last conference call with lower operating expenses and a lower effective tax rate as the key drivers. 
The $0.85 per share compares to $0.94 in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Already described the key operational factors, but note we saw the benefit from a lower share base and a lower effective tax rate offset in part by the stronger dollar which unfavorably impacted EPS by about $0.03. 
On a full year basis, non-GAAP EPS of $3.56 compared to $3.97 in 2014. The fourth quarter effective tax rate or ETR, came in at 22.3%, down from 35.2% in 2014. This is the result of nonrecurring tax benefits related to the prior year returns that totaled about $0.04 per share. On a full year basis, the 2015 ETR stood at 33.6% versus 35.4% in the prior year. We currently expect the 2016 full year tax rate to range from 33% to 33.5% in 2016. Although some quarter variability is to be expected. 
Turning to guidance. For fiscal 2016, we expect net sales on a constant currency basis to be flat-to-up in the low single digits over fiscal 2015. We currently expect foreign currency exchange rates to negatively impact net sales growth by about 1%. Our non-GAAP earnings outlook is $3.25 to $3.35 per share and includes an estimated unfavorable $0.16 impact from foreign currency based on current exchange rates. 
Key drivers that are expected to impact the range of outcomes on EPS are installed base growth, the competitive environment in pods, the pace of cold consumer adoption, as well as the rate at which we are able to scale cold pod production. And finally, the level of share repurchase. 
Our revenue guidance is based on the following expectations. The U.S. At Home installed base growth in the mid- to high-single-digits. Lower average revenue per unit for brewers coming from a combination of product mix and in some cases, lower pricing. As I mentioned earlier, we introduced the K200 entry-level 2.0 reservoir brewer model in the second half of 2015, and we also expect stronger shipments on the MINI in 2016 as we lap last year's product action, both of which will impact mix. 
Brewer pricing will be impacted by the list price decrease on the MINI and promotional investments we've made on select models to further drive adoption. The pod marketplace remains competitive, which affects pricing, particularly as we have significant coffee inflation relative to current spot price in the first half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect negative pod mix, especially in the first half, as we do not lap the Dunkin' Donuts expansion of pods to retail until the second half. 
On a full year basis, we expect to see a lower unfavorable impact from mix on our pods, sales growth than what we experienced in 2015. Gross margins in 2016 will have a number of puts and takes. We will see headwinds from a higher sales mix of 2.0 versus 1.0 brewers, price investments on brewers and pods and pod mix. KOLD is also expected to have an impact given that we are in the start up phase of the launch with inefficiencies as we bring up new manufacturing lines. 
There are also some noticeable tailwinds as well. Coffee costs are about 90% locked for 2016, and we will see slightly lower cost on a full year basis but with significant variability by quarter. Reduced obsolescence expenses in sales returns will also be positive, and we've targeted approximately $100 million in productivity cost reductions with savings more heavily weighted towards cost of goods sold versus SG&A. Key areas of focus are manufacturing efficiency, lower distribution costs and increasing the effectiveness of our promotional programs and marketing spend. 
We expect our income statement investment in Keurig KOLD on a pretax basis to center around $125 million in 2016 compared to approximately $100 million in 2015, and is dependent on consumer adoption of the platform, channel mix and pod manufacturing efficiencies. The majority of the 2016 investment relates to fixed costs such as depreciation, research and development, plant start-up and sales and marketing launch costs. Remember that this is a long-term rollout, which will likely see sales volatility from period to period. The introduction of Keurig KOLD is expected to positively impact revenue growth by less than 1 percentage point. 
Finally, our non-GAAP EPS guidance includes a 33% to 33.5% tax rate and additional share repurchases. Given that we are managing the business on an annual basis, we will not be giving quarterly guidance moving forward. That being said, we will highlight key factors influencing quarterly trends as appropriate. Higher coffee costs will impact the first quarter by about $0.13 per share compared to the prior year. Investments in brewer promotional spend, a heavier mix of the K200 and the MINI, and the greater mix towards 2.0 versus 1.0 brewers will also be additional factors experienced in the first quarter. 
We expect noticeably higher non-GAAP EPS in the remaining 3 quarters of 2016 as lower coffee costs roll into our cost of goods sold and the Q1 seasonal mix shifts away from heavier brewer sales. In addition, we expect lower obsolescence expense in the remaining quarters of 2016, and our productivity initiative should deliver greater savings. One last point on guidance. Given the volatility and competitive dynamics, we're continuing to see in our business plus the investments we're making to drive longer-term growth, we believe it's prudent to solely provide annual guidance metrics rather than a longer term algorithm. 
It's important to know that our overriding goal is to reaccelerate revenue growth, maximize productivity and drive earnings growth and cash flow. Now while we work through the transition issues we've discussed at length, we're committed to allocating significant capital to share repurchases and dividend growth. 
Wrapping up with some comments on our balance sheet and free cash flow. We were pleased that free cash flow of $344 million was above our guidance due to improved discipline around working capital with both inventories and receivables coming in lower than forecast. Importantly, free cash flow for our core hot business was up approximately $200 million year-over-year, and our goal is to continue managing the business to maximize cash flow efficiency. 
Capital expenditures for the year stood at $411 million, with CapEx for our hot business at approximately 4% of sales, down from about 6% in fiscal 2014. We did an exceptional job at driving higher operating efficiencies on our pod manufacturing lines for our hot business, yet limited the need for additional manufacturing capacity. A little over half of our capital spending in 2015 was associated with manufacturing capacity for KOLD. 
In my short time here, it's obvious there are opportunities for reduction in working capital. During 2015, we averaged 18.7% of sales invested in net working capital, excluding cash, up from 13.2% in 2014. The higher appliance inventories we carried over from a weak holiday season last year, was a critical factor, and we have a long supply chain from Asia for our appliances. But there are opportunities across the board to free up cash flow for the company. We started to make progress in the fourth quarter. But this will continue to be an important focus moving forward. 
We expect free cash flow to fall in the range of $420 million to $50 million in fiscal 2016. Capital spending is expected to fall in the range of $225 million to $275 million, down from $411 million in 2015 and significantly lower CapEx for KOLD. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to total about $290 million, up from $265 million in 2015. The increase in D&A is all attributed to depreciation and this additional expense is reflected in our non-GAAP earnings. 
Our strong cash flow and balance sheet allows us to return significant cash to shareholders both in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Following a 15% increase in dividends for fiscal 2015, the board authorized an additional 13% increase to an annual dividend of $1.30 per share for 2016. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $150 million in shares and continue to be active in the market following the close of our fiscal year. Since then, we've bought back an additional $235 million in common stock, bringing our total share repurchases post the third quarter earnings report to $350 million. This equates to 6.4 million shares or about 4% of our total shares outstanding and an average price of about $55 per share. We have $914 million left on our share repurchase authorization as of today, and we intend to be active in the market as we move through 2016. 
Before turning the call back to Brian, let me note that I accepted the CFO position of Keurig Green Mountain because of the opportunity I saw for value creation for shareholders and the roll I might have in driving that. After 3 months on the job full time, I'm more convinced than ever of that potential. While our category continues to experience the tougher competitive environment, Keurig is the leading brand in single serve coffee in North America. We have grown very quickly and as a result, there are real opportunities in a number of important areas, including lower brewer costs, improved pod manufacturing productivity, greater efficiencies in our traded marketing spend and product innovation. While change always takes time, I'm delighted to be a member of the Keurig team and we'll remain focused on that. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian to wrap up."

Or was it more the quality perception or the confusion issue. I'm just trying to understand why we need to promote as aggressively to sort of bring consumers into the market? Is it just a matter of you got to grab their attention again and price to actually do it, or was there something else in terms of the overall cost of the system that was a gating factor for people to adopt?"

One, the MINI returning in full distribution is a real help and we've got new insights this year as the MINI went away as to exactly who the MINI brings into the system, and it brings new users into the system, and that's the first thing. And while we knew that a bit, we didn't really see its impact until it went away. The My K-cup is another factor that really helps bring new users in the system because they say okay, I can continue to hold on to the bag coffee that I have, but I can also try a MINI for a fairly low price, less than $100. So I think the MINI is one factor. The other thing is that the price points we reflected in the K200 this holiday season and the K40 in this holiday season with certain customers is also really driving the same issue. It's -- we're realizing that the price point -- and we've said this for a bit now, the sub $100 price point is important to get new users and then we want to have premium models where consumers can trade up and loyal Keurig users can step in the models with better features and larger reservoirs. So I think that is the mix we want. We have the right brewer lineup now for the season. We have the right price point, we have the My K-Cup back. We don't have the 2.0 launch confusion that we faced last year, and we have lower return rates. So with that, we're rolling into this holiday season."

And as for first quarter shipments for us, I'd say we are very confident that we should see a higher retail sales for brewers compared to the prior year. A number of reasons for optimism is there, including the fact that all the pod compatibility issues that we were dealing with a year ago are largely behind us. We believe, we've got that four-star plus rating on the K200 that should help us as well. How that translates into our own shipment level will be dependent on the retailer inventory situation. I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves and start to forecast that. But you won't -- I think one thing we can say for certain, you won't see the sort of volume drag that you've seen for the last 3 quarters of the company in terms of our shipments in the first quarter of 2016."

We've seen the only thing that drives attachment rate difference is the presence of a reservoir or non-reservoir brewer, so it's not necessarily a price point. But what happens is a MINI, a non-reservoir brewer tends to have a lower attachment rate than a reservoir brewer. So when we take -- and often the K40 or the K200 at an attractive price, we don't see any change in attachment rate at all. The MINI, now that it's back, will be more normal levels for us. So we don't see lower price points in effect driving attachment rate lower and we've not really seen that our attachment rate has been a very steady -- because the second piece of the question was about really, the quality of the installed base that comes in with a lower brewer, lower. I'm going to answer that in 2 ways. I mean, both are encouraging for us. First, we don't see that a lower price point consumer brewers is less impact in terms of pod consumption we see about the same. The other thing we would say is while the mix of the brand may differ, we don't see a difference in actual consumption of pods. So the -- we've not seen a decrease or a change at all in the quality of the installed base. I think we are learning more and more how to target households that are heavy coffee households, but we have a lot more to do to get that right and to be more precise with that. We have much, much more to do on the marketing side than on the commercial side to make that right. So the attachment rate is -- it fluctuates at the same level, it has fluctuated for the last number of years. And so we have not seen that yet. But we would expect as we grow, we're going to have to grow the installed base. We're going to have more and more sharply focused on ensuring the quality of the installed base we bring in is equally strong or even stronger."

And frankly, I told Brian this and I have intended to retire and this opportunity came along. And I really like the strategy of the company and I do see single-serve as the future of the beverage world. I like the fact that it's got a very strong growth history behind it. We're going to be working to reinvigorate that this year on the pod side with some very specific actions that we're taking and we also have the balance sheet to finance that growth moving forward. I think probably out of anything, and this is not a surprise, a company that's grown as fast as Keurig has had plenty of opportunities for process improvement as anyone would expect. And that's going to be a key focus of mine, I think as we move through 2016. And I think I can actively help build that. There was a question on forecasting. We can do some more work on that despite some of the challenges of having a bigger external volume base for our pods. And I think two, just some of the discipline and rigor around some of the investment spending, I think is something else I would want to focus on. I think we're under levered, and we have the flexibility to use our balance sheet to return cash to shareholders. And also to invest in future growth for the company, and want to see us put some of that to work. And I had a pretty heavy focus on cash flow generation. I mentioned working capital. I think that's a pretty bright area, and it takes time. We've got a complicated supply base here on the appliance side even though it's not that big of a portion of our overall sales and with the supply chain as long as we've got. But there are things that we can do, and I will say even here in the fourth quarter, we've taken a much more active role in trying to make sure we're getting delivery of brewers on a just-in-time basis as opposed to building inventories before we need them. So cash flow focus is something else I'll be focusing on."

So I don't want to focus on the penetration rates because I think the holiday season will -- the consumers will speak to that. But can you -- you can help us with the profitability side? So Brian said before that the issue with profitability had -- is basically on the brewer side of the business and not on the pods. And that's a major disconnect with what sort of the investment community is pricing into the stock right now. You do give a pretty detailed gross profit bridge, which tells you that pod mix was a $40 million hit for the year, which is not that significant. So can you just help us? I mean, where is pod profitability? I mean 2013 Investor Day generally speaking, it's at 50% margins. A lot has happened since then, with new partners coming in. Where is pod profitability and sort of, can that be maintained at reasonable levels going forward? That's my first question. The second one, it relates to profitability, but it's about the partnerships. So Brian, you've said, partnerships and innovation go hand in hand. And, obviously, you had a big product launch this past year. It didn't go as well as planned. It's taken write-downs on view, on revo and now on bolt. So where does that leave the partnerships from a long-term basis in terms of how strong they are?"

I think there's a number of levers that any company can have for dealing with it. And you heard me mention to the level of obsolete -- obsolescence charges that we experienced on the pod side went up significantly last year. Also, in terms of operating efficiencies on pod manufacturing, we grew that last year and we have plans to continue to manage that. I think when you look at pod profitability on a per pod basis, a penny profit as you might call it, that isn't how I think about it. I think of it from a margin percentage basis and I do think that there's -- we've seen a little bit of erosion in that and the mix effect was real for the year, so don't get me wrong. But that was to be expected, and that was largely expected by the company because you're bringing in a lot more -- we brought in quite a few private label brands as well as additional partners and we all know we make more money per pod on our owned and licensed brands. If you listen to what I've said, we fully expect that mix effect to be mitigated in the new year because we're going to start to lap some of those comparisons and I think that transition that we've gone through is one of the real key drivers there. But if we keep our focus on OEE, obsolescence and can maintain a disciplined pricing environment with partners as well, we should be in pretty good shape."

And you're right, we've long believed that they go hand in hand. The strength of our system, since its outset, has been the multi-branded open architecture. And in fact, the consumers can have a wide variety of choice. And it goes where it takes innovation to drop partners in and to keep partners in, and we've been quite successful at that. And then it -- the partnerships and the innovation build upon one another. And so we are confident that our system will continue to be the innovation leader that we maintained strong partnerships, that we can offer the right amount of choice and variety of the consumer. And that's what we've been able to do. So we look at the fact that the portfolio, we address our brands at the portfolio. We know that we need to build our own brands. We need our partner brands to be strong. We look at this year, the coffee prices this year, were no question a big drag on our profitability. And that certainly improves as we move through 2016. But the portfolio is what matters. We have a strong portfolio of owned and licensed brands. We have a strong portfolio of brands and private label brands. We now have the choice we need in the system to offer to every consumer, the right opportunities to try and drink new beverages. We'll continue to expand, appropriately expand the brands we have and the varieties that we have. So partnerships and innovation will go hand in hand. When you're an innovation company, not everything works perfectly, and you try some and you quickly get out of them. And we've done a couple of those. There's no question. We could've executed and should've executed 2.0 better. We learned. We move forward. And that's what we're doing here. And so it's about execution and operational detail when it comes to appliances, when it comes to productivity, when it comes to everything we're doing. But I'll end there, Akshay.

They are genuinely surprised that it's KOLD and it's carbonated as it is, and the convenience is delivering and that's the most important thing that we're delivering a terrific beverage and we do. That's the most important piece. But we're also learning a lot about what needs to improve and what we can improve and we know the first product we put out in the new technology is never going to be perfect.

They want all the brands they're used to drinking just like they have in Keurig hot, they want a broader variety of beverages. So each of these is being addressed and will get addressed both from a machine standpoint and the pod standpoint. But it doesn't happen on the very first machine we're going to learn and we're going to improve.

I'll start this afternoon with a brief overview of our 2015 financial results, followed by comments on current market conditions and our outlook for 2016 before Pete provides further details",2135,"Thank you, Kristi, and thank you, everyone for joining us today. I'll start this afternoon with a brief overview of our 2015 financial results, followed by comments on current market conditions and our outlook for 2016 before Pete provides further details on the numbers. I'll then wrap up with a few comments on 2016 priorities. 
Looking at the big picture, our results for the quarter and for the year reflect the competitive and dynamic marketplace in which we are operating and the steps we are taking to position our company for the future. We're making progress on our cost-reduction efforts and we continue to generate strong cash flows. And while market conditions are challenging in the near term, we are confident we are taking the right actions to position our company for longer-term growth and shareholder value creation.
For the fourth quarter, we generated revenues within our guidance range and earnings came in above the range we estimated in our last call at $0.85 per share, on the benefits of our cost-reduction efforts as well as a lower effective tax rate. Free cash flow for fiscal year 2015 was above our guidance at $344 million. Importantly, free cash flow for our hot business grew $200 million year-over-year. Our goal is to continually proactively manage the business to maximize cash flow efficiency in order to build on this momentum. 
We continue to return substantial cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. From our third quarter earnings report to today, we've repurchased $350 million worth of common shares. In addition, we announced this afternoon that our board increased the dividend by 13% to an annualized rate of $1.30 per share. These actions reflect our confidence in the strong cash-flow generation capacity of the company and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. 
As we highlighted on our last earnings call, we continue to see a competitive and dynamic marketplace, resulting in some near-term challenges in our business as we continue the Keurig brewer transition as well as increasing competitive activity in pods. While we expect that some of these headwinds will continue in 2016, we are focused on executing against the solid holiday season plan that we believe will better position us for the future. 
In addition, we continue to rationalize our infrastructure to the current demand environment, highlighted by our 3-year, $300 million productivity initiative. We continue to expect to realize about $100 million in savings in 2016. 
Now I'd like to review some of the key factors impacting results and our forward outlook. 
Based on our latest surveys and models, we estimate that the U.S. At Home installed base of active single-serve brewers grew by 8% in 2015 to just over $21 million appliances. While the installed base growth remains quite healthy, the rate of growth slowed in 2015. Now it's important to note that in general, not all brewers we ship end up increasing our active installed base. This is because retailers hold a certain amount of inventory, consumers can return a brewer, they might replace an existing appliance or, in some cases, the appliance is never used at all. 
In previous years, we generally saw from 45% to 50% of U.S. At Home shipments contribute to growth in the installed base. During 2015, that rate came in significantly below that 40% to 50% due to a number of factors. First was the weak holiday season last year. Specifically, lower consumer purchases means fewer new and incremental users. Second, there were greater replacements of existing Keurig brewers. Our consumers are very loyal to our brand and some wanted to shift to the latest technology. A trade up doesn't increase our installed base number. We expect that this factor by itself would diminish over time. Third, the average life of a brewer is between 3 to 4 years. We are now seeing the anniversary of strong appliance unit sales from prior years, leading to a larger absolute number of replacements in the installed base during 2015. Fourth, we saw an increase in the return rates as compared to prior years due primarily to consumer confusion with pod compatibility, particularly early on in fiscal 2015 with the launch of 2.0. We believe this initial launch factor will have a more limited impact in 2016 with improved communication and packaging, and with the recent relaunch of the Keurig My K-Cup. Finally, the MINI product action had more of an impact than we originally expected. Additional research has shown that some consumers are more likely to enter the single-serve category at a lower price point, more in line with our MINI product offering. With the MINI in very limited distribution as a result of the product action we took and the K200 not launching until late spring, we simply didn't have a strong low-priced product lineup during the first half of our fiscal year. 
Looking ahead, we entered the 2015 holiday season in a much stronger position. We have a broader portfolio of brewer models across more price points, with stronger offerings in the key sub-$100 category. The MINI brewer is back in broad distribution and we have reduced its price to $79 to drive adoption with consumers looking for Keurig convenience and quality in a lower-priced offering. 
Our small footprint, K200 entry-level, 2.0 brewer, is also available this holiday season in a variety of colors with strong promotional plans. The K200 has been quite well received by consumers and has average ratings above 4 stars. This model has exceeded our initial expectations and is now the highest volume Keurig brewers sold in the single service marketplace. We will continue to offer our premium models for consumers looking for a larger reservoir and more features.  
On the marketing front, our new advertising campaign, YOUR FAVORITES. YOUR WAY. kicked off in October. The campaign leverages a life-stage strategy that demonstrates the benefit of single serve versus drip coffee to consumers as they move into their first apartment, become parents or move to a new city. The campaign is multi-platform, with television spots across multiple dayparts, including 9 of the top 10 ranked primetime shows. We also have a strong digital campaign, including custom programs with Hulu and Yahoo. Additionally, we are continuing to message the variety and choice in the Keurig system on the box and through in-store marketing.  Importantly, we are delivering both increased effectiveness and productivity in our marketing investment as the result of consolidating our media agencies earlier in fiscal 2015. 
Looking to fiscal 2016, we expect that the actions we are taking will lead to some recovery in the percentage of our U.S. At Home shipments that contribute to an increased brewer installed base. While strong unit volume growth in the past 3 to 4 years will continue to impact the number of deactivations, we also expect to see lower price points in both the MINI and the K200 to bring new consumers in the single-serve category.  In addition, the relaunch of My K-Cup gives consumers the ability to brew all their favorite beverages in the Keurig system. Our current expectation is that the U.S. At Home installed base will grow in the mid- to high single digits in fiscal 2016. 
There's been some concern noted by the overall marketplace in recent weeks about the strength of consumer spending this holiday season. While we, of course, are not immune to overall market trends, we believe that an improving mix of new consumers to the Keurig single-serve coffee platform could help mitigate any impact from weaker economic growth.  More broadly, despite the current environment, we do believe that our core hot platform has plenty of whitespace to drive longer-term growth. We remain the category leader in single serve, with an installed base that's growing, and we fully expect single serve to continue gaining share of total coffeemakers over time. 
Turning to pods. Lower brewer installed base growth in fiscal 2015 as well as excess capacity at other pod manufacturers, created challenging category dynamics which we continue to experience in the fourth quarter. 
Volume growth in U.S. measured channels was 13% in the quarter. We continued to see weakness in the specialty and digital channels, bringing total U.S. At Home category growth in the quarter to approximately 7%. Against that 7% growth in pod consumption, our total pod shipments declined 4% in the quarter, with U.S. At Home volumes down 3% as we faced a difficult shipment comparison year-over-year. Notably, we typically see a build in channel pod inventories during our fiscal fourth quarter as colder temperatures become the norm and the holiday season approaches. The heavy build last year was attributed in part to the preordering by customers in advance of our SAP implementation which started in early 2014. 
After further analysis, we also believe there were additional factors at work in the fourth quarter of 2014, including the need for new partners to the Keurig system to build their in-house inventory, some pre-buying ahead of our November price increase and retailers planning for a big holiday on the 2.0 system. As a result of all these factors, we believe the 7% growth in the retail demand for pods in the fourth quarter of 2015 is the best measure of underlying performance of the category. 
For 2016, we are focusing -- forecasting U.S. At Home pod volumes to grow in line with installed base growth. Pod pricing remains competitive as other pod manufacturers have excess capacity. 
We have also seen downward price pressure on the part of other brands in the marketplace, which may be due in part to coffee prices, where the seed price has fallen by about 40% in the past year. 
As I mentioned, on our last call, we have seen a mix shift this year away from owned and licensed brands, which continued in the fourth quarter. This was expected as we brought previously unlicensed brands into our system and expanded our partnership with Dunkin' Donuts. You will recall that prior to 2015, Dunkin had previously sold K-cups in their retail outlets only. But this popular brand is now fully available in broad distribution. We will continue to manage our pod business as a portfolio, supporting both our owned and licensed brands as well as those of our partners. 
Recent innovation on our owned brands includes Green Mountain organics, Green Mountain Coffeehouse beverages and Laughing Man, which are all available on keurig.com and are in the process of expanding retail distribution throughout 2016.  In the terms of partner brands, we added Community Coffee, Reily Foods and illy while starting to transition the Kraft brands into our system, in addition to the Dunkin expansion. 
The strength of the Keurig system has always been the variety, choice and convenience we provide to consumers, and its these very facts that we believe will continue to drive long-term growth in both brewers and pods. 
Turning to an update on Keurig KOLD. In terms of KOLD, we are pleased to launch the product this fall. These are very early days, and we caution that 2016 will be a year of launch and learn. This is the exciting new technology, and we intend to test different methods of marketing, both retail and digital as well as pricing during the upcoming year to guide us as we build this new category and this new technology. We believe that experiencing the excitement of the system and the fresh cold taste of the beverages is critical to driving consumer acceptance.  As a result, you'll see us staff for live demos in retail stores and malls as well as build awareness with mobile vans and pop-up destinations with our Keurig KOLD cube. 
What that means in terms of numbers? Sales for the first 12 months of the launch will likely be in the range of 60,000 to 100,000 units based on what we see today. Our early read from consumers is positive on the taste profile of the beverage for both our partner brands and our new owned brands. 
Rita & Tina's, and Union St. Lounge cocktail mixers have just launched on keurig.com, adding to our portfolio of Kraft and fountain-style sodas, 0 and low-calorie flavored seltzers and waters, sports hydration drinks and iced teas. 
We have always viewed Keurig KOLD as a long-term multiphase rollout. It is very early in the launch, and we're taking the time necessary to learn from retailers and consumers to maximize the opportunity for long-term success.  We expect to continually improve the appliance, its footprint and price point over time, and our development efforts on those fronts continue. But we will be disciplined and pragmatic in our approach to investment levels over the long-term, and we will invest only as marketplace success dictates. 
With that, I'll pass this call over to Pete."
334622,315883135,906090,"Keurig Green Mountain, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2015",2015-11-18,"Earnings Calls","Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian. I'm glad to be here and look forward to working with our shareholders and the investment community in my new role at Keurig. I'll start with some details on the fourth quarter before turning my attention to our outlook for 2016, and then wr",2843,"Thanks, Brian. I'm glad to be here and look forward to working with our shareholders and the investment community in my new role at Keurig. I'll start with some details on the fourth quarter before turning my attention to our outlook for 2016, and then wrap up with some comments on our balance sheet and free cash flow. 
Please note that the numbers I reference will largely be our non-GAAP figures, unless otherwise noted. You can reference our press release for a full reconciliation with the GAAP results. 
So turning to the quarter, we generated net sales of $1.04 billion compared to $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, and within the range detailed in our last conference call. Excluding currency impacts, sales were lower by 11%. The stronger dollar added a further 2% to the decline, and reported sales were off by 13%. Brewer and accessory sales were down 32%, with pod sales down 9%. 
Let me highlight some of the most important drivers of fourth quarter sales starting with brewers.  Brewer volumes were 20% lower than 2014, in line with our expectations. Volumes were impacted by retailer inventory fluctuations. We're comparing against the retail sell-in associated with the Keurig 2.0 launch in the prior year, along with continuing efforts to clear excess brewer inventory at retail this year. Partially offsetting is the MINI product action, which reduced sales in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
In addition to volumes, mix reduced brewer sales by 10%, driven by the lower-priced K200 model and greater unit sales of the MINI brewer. It's important to note that the K200 launched during the spring of 2015 and was not included in the 2014 retail sell-in for the 2.0. And the MINI brewer had an elevated impact on mix in the fourth quarter of 2015 as we're comparing against the sales reserve taken for the product action in the prior-year quarter. 
As we move through 2016, we expect that brewer mix will improve noticeably from this fourth quarter level, particularly as we compare against the growing MINI and K200 volumes seen during the second half of 2015. 
Finally, brewer pricing in the fourth quarter declined by 1%,  and foreign exchange negatively impacted brewer sales by 1 additional percentage point. We intend to have a heavier mix of promotional support for brewers during the 2015 holiday season and have reduced the price of the MINI. Lower brewer pricing will therefore, be much more pronounced in the first quarter of 2016 than the levels seen in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Keep in mind that the promotional investments, along with a stronger product lineup at lower price points, is targeted to bring new and incremental users into our installed base. 
Turning to pods. The sales decline of 9% in the quarter was composed of a 4% lower volume and a 6% decrease in mix. This was partially offset by a 2% increase in net pricing. Foreign exchange negatively impacted pod sales by 2%. 
It's clear that the fourth quarter volume comparison versus 2014 was impacted by retailers ordering pods more aggressively last year, ahead of our SAP implementation. But as Brian noted, we believe that the retailer load-in went beyond the SAP implementation, with additional channel builds for the 2.0 launch and for the price increase we took last November and for the new and expanding brands coming into the Keurig system.  As a result, we believe that the 7% growth in consumer demand for pods in the U.S. At Home marketplace during the fourth quarter is the best metric for viewing the health of the category and our pod business. 
In 2016, we expect pod volume growth to track the mid- to high single-digit increase in our brewer installed base. 
Finally, note the Away from Home pod environment remains competitive, with volume declines in the low teens during the quarter. 
Unfavorable mix for our owned and licensed brands reduced pod sales by about 6% in the fourth quarter, a better trend than the 8% mix impact seen in the third quarter of 2015. You may recall we started to bring in new partners to the Keurig system in a meaningful way during the fourth quarter of 2014, so the year-over-year mix comparisons has started to ease somewhat as a result. 
Note that our partner expansion continued into the second half of 2015 when Dunkin' Donuts' broader retail distribution took hold. So the mixed pack arising from new entrants to the Keurig system will remain a bit unfavorable until we get into the second half of 2016. 
Additionally, our shipment mix could also be influenced by share changes at retail. Pricing actions by competitors could result in higher or lower share for our owned and licensed brands in 2016. We'll obviously be watching this closely. 
Turning to profitability. Non-GAAP gross margin was down 300 basis points in the quarter, with higher coffee costs accounting for almost 3/4 of the decline versus 2014. On a sequential basis looking forward, we expect that coffee costs reflected in our cost of goods sold will remain at this high level during the first quarter of 2016 before starting to decline in the second quarter with a more noticeable drop in the second half of 2016.  On a full year basis, we will see a slight benefit from lower coffee costs in 2016 compared to 2015. 
A second factor influencing our non-GAAP gross margins in the fourth quarter and accounting for 1 quarter of the decline versus the prior year is an $8.6 million obsolescence charge, or $0.04 per share, for the write-down of our inventory of BOLT commercial brewers. Please note that non-GAAP gross profit excludes a $20 million noncash pretax charge related to BOLT and other packaging lines. 
On a full year basis, obsolescence charges reduced non-GAAP gross margins by 160 basis points, or almost $0.30 per share, in 2015 versus 2014. While brewer obsolescence was one key factor, a significant portion of these charges came from pods as well. We have started an important effort toward reducing pod obsolescence costs by tightening our management of inventories in order to limit product aging beyond its stated useful life, among other actions. 
You can see that our year-end inventory of pods is about 20% below the levels seen in 2014. Not only have we generated enhanced cash flow from these actions, but we will also see a significant benefit to our bottom line through reduced obsolescence expense in 2016. 
Finally, I want to point out that we saw favorable trend in sales returns for brewers in the fourth quarter, a first for 2015. This is the result of retailer mix, and we believe, a reflection of the 4-star-plus rating carried by our 200 brewer. We expect additional progress in fiscal 2016. 
Just a brief word on operating expenses. Non-GAAP SG&A declined 20% in the quarter, or 120 basis points, when measured as a percentage of sales, driven by lower marketing expense, headcount and variable incentive accruals. Note that we are driving greater efficiency from our marketing investments through consolidation of our media agencies. 
Keep in mind that fourth quarter non-GAAP SG&A expense, excludes $16 million in pretax restructuring charges related to our previously announced productivity program. These expenses are primarily employee severance costs, and all but $4 million are expected to be cash expenditures. 
Looking at earnings per share. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.85 in the quarter, above the range shared in our last conference call, with lower operating expenses and a lower effective tax rate as the key drivers.  The $0.85 per share compares to $0.94 in the fourth quarter of the prior year. I've already described the key operational factors, but note, we saw the benefit from a lower share base and a lower effective tax rate, offset in part by the stronger dollar which unfavorably impacted EPS by about $0.03. 
On a full year basis, non-GAAP EPS of $3.56 compared to $3.97 in 2014. 
The fourth quarter effective tax rate, or ETR, came in at 22.3%, down from 35.2% in 2014. This is the result of non-recurring tax benefits related to the prior-year returns that totaled about $0.04 per share. On a full year basis, the 2015 ETR stood at 33.6% versus 35.4% in the prior year. We currently expect the 2016 full year tax rate to range from 33% to 33.5% in 2016, although some quarter variability is to be expected. 
Turning to guidance. For fiscal 2016, we expect next sales -- net sales on a constant currency basis to be flat to up in the low single digits over fiscal 2015. We currently expect foreign currency exchange rates to negatively impact net sales growth by about 1%.  Our non-GAAP earnings outlook is $3.25 to $3.35 per share and includes an estimated unfavorable $0.16 impact from foreign currency based on current exchange rates. 
Key drivers that are expected to impact the range of outcomes on EPS are installed base growth, the competitive environment in pods, the pace of KOLD consumer adoption as well as the rate at which we are able to scale KOLD pod production, and finally, the level of share repurchase. 
Our revenue guidance is based on the following expectations. The U.S. At Home installed base growth in the mid- to high single digits, lower average revenue per unit for brewers coming from a combination of product mix and, in some cases, lower pricing. As I mentioned earlier, we introduced the K200 entry-level 2.0 reservoir brewer model in the second half of 2015, and we also expect stronger shipments on the MINI in 2016 as we lap last year's product action, both of which will impact mix.  Brewer pricing will be impacted by the list price decrease on the MINI and promotional investments we've made on select models to further drive adoption. 
The pod marketplace remains competitive, which affects pricing, particularly as we have significant coffee inflation relative to current spot price in the first half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect negative pod mix, especially in the first half, as we do not lap the Dunkin' Donuts expansion of pods to retail until the second half. 
On a full year basis, we expect to see a lower unfavorable impact from mix on our pods sales growth than what we experienced in 2015. 
Gross margins in 2016 will have a number of puts and takes. We will see headwinds from a higher sales mix of 2.0 versus 1.0 brewers, price investments on brewers and pods and pod mix. KOLD is also expected to have an impact, given that we are in the startup phase of the launch, with inefficiencies as we bring up new manufacturing lines. 
There are also some noticeable tailwinds as well. Coffee costs are about 90% locked for 2016, and we will see slightly lower costs on a full year basis, but with significant variability by quarter. Reduced obsolescence expenses and sales returns will also be positive, and we have targeted approximately $100 million in productivity cost reductions, with savings more heavily weighted toward cost of goods sold versus SG&A. 
Key areas of focus are manufacturing efficiency, lower distribution costs and increasing the effectiveness of our promotional programs and marketing spend. 
We expect our income statement investment in Keurig KOLD on a pretax basis to center around $125 million in 2016 compared to approximately $100 million in 2015, and is dependent on consumer adoption of the platform, channel mix and pod manufacturing efficiencies. 
The majority of the 2016 investment relates to fixed costs, such as depreciation, research and development, plant startup and sales and marketing launch costs. Remember that this is a long-term rollout, which will likely see sales volatility from period to period. The introduction of Keurig KOLD is expected to positively impact revenue growth by less than 1 percentage point. 
Finally, our non-GAAP EPS guidance includes a 33% to 33.5% tax rate and additional share repurchases. 
Given that we are managing the business on an annual basis, we will not be giving quarterly guidance moving forward. That being said, we will highlight key factors influencing quarterly trends as appropriate. 
Higher coffee costs will impact the first quarter by about $0.13 per share compared to the prior year. Investments in brewer promotional spend, a heavier mix of the K200 and the MINI, and a greater mix towards 2.0 versus 1.0 brewers will also be additional factors experienced in the first quarter. 
We expect noticeably higher non-GAAP EPS in the remaining 3 quarters of 2016, as lower coffee costs roll into our cost of goods sold and the Q1 seasonal mix shifts away from heavier brewer sales. In addition, we expect lower obsolescence expense in the remaining quarters of 2016, and our productivity initiative should deliver greater savings. 
One last point on guidance. Given the volatility and competitive dynamics we're continuing to see in our business plus the investments we're making to drive longer-term growth, we believe it's prudent to solely provide annual guidance metrics rather than a longer-term algorithm.  It's important to know that our overriding goal is to reaccelerate revenue growth, maximize productivity and drive earnings growth and cash flow. And while we work through the transition issues we've discussed at length, we're committed to allocating significant capital to share repurchases and dividend growth. 
Wrapping up with some comments on our balance sheet and free cash flow. We were pleased that free cash flow of $344 million was above our guidance due to improved discipline around working capital, with both inventories and receivables coming in lower than forecast. Importantly, free cash flow for our core hot business was up approximately $200 million year-over-year, and our goal is to continue managing the business to maximize cash flow efficiency. 
Capital expenditures for the year stood at $411 million, with CapEx for our hot business at approximately 4% of sales, down from about 6% in fiscal 2014. 
We did an exceptional job at driving higher operating efficiencies on our pod manufacturing lines for our hot business that limited the need for additional manufacturing capacity. A little over half of our capital spending in 2015 was associated with manufacturing capacity for KOLD. 
In my short time here, it's obvious there are opportunities for reduction in working capital. During 2015, we averaged 18.7% of sales invested in net working capital, excluding cash, up from 13.2% in 2014. The higher appliance inventories we carried over from a weak holiday season last year was a critical factor, and we have a long supply chain from Asia for our appliances. But there are opportunities across the board to free up cash flow for the company. We started to make progress in the fourth quarter, but this will continue to be an important focus moving forward. 
We expect free cash flow to fall in the range of $420 million to $500 million in fiscal 2016. Capital spending is expected to fall in the range of $225 million to $275 million, down from $411 million in 2015, and significantly lower CapEx for KOLD. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to total about $290 million, up from $265 million in 2015. The increase in D&A is all attributed to depreciation, and this additional expense is reflected in our non-GAAP earnings. 
Our strong cash flow and balance sheet allows us to return significant cash to shareholders, both in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Following a 15% increase in dividends for fiscal 2015, the board authorized an additional 13% increase to an annual dividend of $1.30 per share for 2016. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $150 million in shares and continued to be active in the market following the close of our fiscal year. Since then, we've bought back an additional $235 million in common stock, bringing our total share repurchases, post the third quarter earnings report, to $350 million. This equates to 6.4 million shares, or about 4% of our total shares outstanding, at an average price of about $55 per share. We have $914 million left on our share repurchase authorization as of today, and we intend to be active in the market as we move through 2016. 
Before turning the call back to Brian, let me note that I accepted the CFO position at Keurig Green Mountain because of the opportunity I saw for value creation for shareholders and the role I might have in driving that. After 3 months on the job full time, I'm more convinced than ever of that potential. 
While our category continues to experience a tougher competitive environment, Keurig is the leading brand in single-serve coffee in North America. We have grown very quickly, and as a result, there are real opportunities in a number of important areas, including lower brewer costs, improved pod manufacturing productivity, greater efficiencies in our trade and marketing spend and product innovation. 
While change always takes time, I'm delighted to be a member of the Keurig team, and we'll remain focused on that. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian to wrap up."

One, the MINI returning in full distribution is a real help. And we've got new insight this year as the MINI went away as to exactly who the MINI brings into the system, and it brings new users into the system. And that's the first thing. And while we knew that a bit, we didn't really see its impact until it went away. The My K-cup is another factor that really helps bring new users in the system because they say, ""Okay, I can continue to hold on to the bagged coffee that I have, but I can also try a MINI for a fairly low price, less than $100."" So I think the MINI is one factor. The other thing is that the price points we've reflected in the K200 this holiday season and the K40 in this holiday season with certain customers is also really driving the same issue. It's -- we're realizing that the price point -- and we've said this for a bit now, the sub-$100 price point is important to get new users and then we want to have premium models, where consumers can trade up and loyal Keurig users can step into models with better features and larger reservoirs. So we think that is the mix we want. We have the right brewer lineup now for the season. We have the right price points. We have the My K-Cup back. We don't have the 2.0 launch confusion that we faced last year, and we have lower return rates. So with that, we're rolling into this holiday season."

And related to that, do you still expect shipments will be positive in the first quarter versus last year? And I guess, if I could just pile one more. As you rely -- and this is kind of a follow-up for the earlier question, if you rely more and more on those low-priced brewers to grow the install base, what does that imply about the future attachment rate, the ability to maintain historical pricing and still grow? Essentially, is the quality of today's incremental household the same as it was in the past? And do you have data that people actually trade-up from what you're labeling entry-level products to sort of higher end -- presumably higher attachment rate, better economic-type products?"

We believe that there were hundreds of thousands of excess brewers in the channel when the holiday season ended. And we had higher inventories too. So it was a significant factor that's -- at the end of the first quarter. And what we've seen are lower shipments for the remaining 3 quarters of the year, which has affected our shipments and made some of the comparisons a bit tougher compared to the prior year. We think they're in better shape at this point in time. Whether they're absolutely there or not will also be dependent on the holiday season for 2015, so I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves on that front. And as for first quarter shipments for us, I'd say we are very confident that we should see higher retail sales for brewers compared to the prior year. A number of reasons for optimism is there, including the fact that all the pod compatibility issues that we were dealing with a year ago are largely behind us, we believe. We've got that 4-plus -- 4-star-plus rating on the K200. That should help us as well. How that translates into our own shipment level will be dependent on the retailer inventory situation. I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves and start to forecast that. But you won't -- I think one thing we can say for certain, you won't see the sort of volume drag that you've seen for the last 3 quarters of the company in terms of our shipments in the first quarter of 2016."

We've seen the only thing that drives attachment rate difference is the presence of a reservoir or non-reservoir brewer. So it's not necessarily a price point. But what happens is, a MINI, a non-reservoir brewer tends to have a lower attachment rate than a reservoir brewer. So when we take and offer the K40 or the K200 at an attractive price, we don't see any change in attachment rate at all. The MINI, now that it's back, will be more at normal levels for us. So we don't see lower price points, in effect, driving attachment rate lower. And we've not really seen that our attachment rate has been very steady, because -- the second piece of the question was about really, is the quality of the installed base that comes in with a lower brewer, lower? I'm going to answer that 2 ways. And -- both are encouraging for us. First, we don't see that a lower-price point consumer brews is less. In fact, in terms of pod consumption, we see about the same. The other thing we would say is, while the mix of the brand may differ, we don't see a difference in actual consumption of pods. So the -- we've not seen a decrease or a change at all in the quality of the installed base. I think we are learning more and more how to target households that are heavy coffee households, but we have a lot more to do to get that right and to be more precise with that. We have much, much more to do on the marketing side and on the commercial side to make that right. So the attachment rate is -- it fluctuates at the same level it's has fluctuated for the last number of years, and so we have not seen that yet. But we would expect as we grow, we're going to have to grow the installed base. We're going to have more and more sharply focused on ensuring that the quality of the installed base we bring in is equally strong or even stronger."

And frankly, I told Brian this, and I have intended to retire and this opportunity came along. And I really liked the strategy of the company, and I do see single serve as the future of the beverage world. I like the fact that it's got a very strong growth history behind it. We're going to be working to reinvigorate that this year on the pod side with some very specific actions that we're taking. And we also have the balance sheet to finance that growth moving forward. I think probably out of anything, and this is not a surprise, a company that's grown as fast as Keurig has, has plenty of opportunities for process improvement, as anyone would expect. And that's going to be a key focus of mine, I think, as we move through 2016. And I think I can actively help build that. There was a question on forecasting. We can do some more work on that despite some of the challenges of having a bigger external volume base for our pods. And I think two, just some of the discipline and rigor around investments -- investment spending, I think, is something else that I would want to focus on. I think we're under-levered, and we have the flexibility to use our balance sheet to return cash to shareholders. And also to invest in future growth for the company, and want to see us put some of that to work. And I have a pretty heavy focus on cash flow generation. I mentioned working capital, I think that's a pretty ripe area. And it takes time. We've got a complicated supply base here on the appliance side, even though it's not that big of a portion of our overall sales, and with the supply chain as long as we've got. But there are things that we can do, and I will say even here in the fourth quarter, we've taken a much more active role in trying to make sure we're getting delivery of brewers on a just-in-time basis as opposed to building inventories before we need them. So cash flow focus is something else I'll be focusing on."

So I don't want to focus on the penetration rates because I think the holiday season will -- that consumers will speak to that. But can you -- you can help us with the profitability side? So Brian said before that the issue with profitability had -- is basically on the brewer side of the business and not on the pods, and that's a major disconnect with what sort of the investment community is pricing into the stock right now. You do give a pretty detailed gross profit bridge, which tells you that pod mix was a $40 million hit for the year, which is not that significant. So can you just help us? I mean, where is pod profitability? 2013 Investor Day, generally speaking, it's said 50% margins. A lot has happened since then, with new partners coming in. Where is pod profitability and sort of, can that be maintained at reasonable levels going forward? That's my first question. And the second one, it relates to profitability, but it's about the partnerships. So Brian, you've said, partnerships and innovation go hand in hand. And obviously, you had a big product launch this past year, it didn't go as well as planned, it's taken write-downs on Vue, on Rivo and now on BOLT. So where does that leave the partnerships from a long-term basis in terms of how strong they are?"

I think there's a number of levers that any company can have for dealing with it. And you heard me mention too the level of obsolete -- obsolescence charges that we experienced on the pod side went up significantly last year. Also, in terms of operating efficiencies on pod manufacturing, we grew that last year and we have plans to continue to manage that. I think when you look at pod profitability on a per-pod basis, a penny profit, as you might call it, that isn't how I think about it. I think of it from a margin percentage basis. And I do think that there's -- we've seen a little bit of erosion in that, but -- and the mix effect was real for the year, so don't get me wrong. But that was to be expected, and it was largely expected by the company because you're bringing in a lot more -- we brought in quite a few private label brands as well as additional partners, and we all know we make more money per pod on our own -- owned and licensed brands. If you listen to what I said, we fully expect that mix effect to be mitigated in the new year, because we're going to start to lap some of those comparisons, and I think that transition that we've gone through is one of the real key drivers there. But if we keep our focus on OEE, obsolescence and can maintain a disciplined pricing environment with partners as well, we should be in pretty good shape."

And you're right, we've long believed that they go hand in hand. The strength of our system, since its outset, has been the multi-branded open architecture. And in fact, the consumers can have a wide variety of choice. And it flows where it takes innovation to drop partners in and to keep partners in, and we've been quite successful at that. And then it -- the partnerships and the innovation build upon one another. And so we are confident that our system [indiscernible] continue to be the innovation leader, that we maintain strong partnerships, that we can offer the right amount of choice and variety to the consumer. And that's what we've been able to do. So we look at the fact that the portfolio, we address our brands in the portfolio, we know that we need to build our own brands, we need our partner brands to be strong. We look at this year, the coffee prices this year, were, no question, a big drag on our profitability. And that certainly improves as we move through 2016. But the portfolio is what matters. We have a strong portfolio of owned and licensed brands. We have a strong portfolio of partner brands, private label brands. We now have the choice we need in the system to offer to every consumer the right opportunities to try and drink new beverages. We'll continue to expand -- appropriately expand the brands we have and the varieties we have. So partnerships and innovation will go hand in hand. When you're an innovation company, not everything works perfectly, and you try some and you quickly get out of them. And we've done a couple of those, there's no question. We could've executed and should've executed 2.0 better. We learned. We moved forward. And that's what we're doing here. And so it's about execution and operational detail when it comes to appliances, when it comes to productivity, when it comes to everything we're doing. But I'll end there, Akshay.

They are genuinely surprised that it's KOLD and as carbonated as it is, and the convenience its delivering. And that's the most important thing, that we're delivering a terrific beverage, and we do.

I'll start this afternoon with a brief overview of our 2015 financial results, followed by comments on current market conditions and our outlook for 2016 before Pete provides further details",2134,"Thank you, Kristi, and thank you, everyone for joining us today. I'll start this afternoon with a brief overview of our 2015 financial results, followed by comments on current market conditions and our outlook for 2016 before Pete provides further details on the numbers. I'll then wrap up with a few comments on 2016 priorities. 
Looking at the big picture, our results for the quarter and for the year reflect the competitive and dynamic marketplace in which we are operating and the steps we are taking to position our company for the future. We're making progress in our cost-reduction efforts and we continue to generate strong cash flows. And while market conditions are challenging in the near term, we are confident we are taking the right actions to position our company for longer-term growth and shareholder value creation.
For the fourth quarter, we generated revenues within our guidance range and earnings came in above the range we estimated in our last call at $0.85 per share, on the benefits of our cost-reduction efforts as well as a lower effective tax rate. Free cash flow for fiscal year 2015 was above our guidance at $344 million. Importantly, free cash flow for our hot business grew $200 million year-over-year. Our goal is to continually proactively manage the business to maximize cash flow efficiency in order to build on this momentum. 
We continue to return substantial cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. From our third quarter earnings report to today, we've repurchased $350 million worth of common shares. In addition, we announced this afternoon that our board increased the dividend by 13% to an annualized rate of $1.30 per share. These actions reflect our confidence in the strong cash-flow generation capacity of the company and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. 
As we highlighted on our last earnings call, we continue to see a competitive and dynamic marketplace, resulting in some near-term challenges in our business as we continue the Keurig brewer transition as well as increasing competitive activity in pods. While we expect that some of these headwinds will continue in 2016, we are focused on executing against a solid holiday season plan that we believe will better position us for the future. 
In addition, we continue to rationalize our infrastructure to the current demand environment, highlighted by our 3-year, $300 million productivity initiative. We continue to expect to realize about $100 million in savings in 2016. 
Now I'd like to review some of the key factors impacting results and our forward outlook. 
Based on our latest surveys and models, we estimate that the U.S. At Home installed base of active single-serve brewers grew by 8% in 2015 to just over $21 million appliances. While installed base growth remains quite healthy, the rate of growth slowed in 2015. Now, it's important to note that in general, not all brewers we ship end up increasing our active installed base. This is because retailers hold a certain amount of inventory, consumers can return a brewer, they might replace an existing appliance or, in some cases, the appliance is never used at all. 
In previous years, we generally saw from 45% to 50% of U.S. At Home shipments contribute to growth in the installed base. During 2015, that rate came in significantly below that 40% to 50% due to a number of factors. First was the weak holiday season last year. Specifically, lower consumer purchases means fewer new and incremental users. Second, there were greater replacements of existing Keurig brewers. Our consumers are very loyal to our brand and some wanted to switch to the latest technology. A trade up doesn't increase our installed base number. We expect that this factor by itself would diminish over time. Third, the average life of a brewer is between 3 to 4 years. We are now seeing the anniversary of strong appliance unit sales from prior years, leading to a larger absolute number of replacements in the installed base during 2015. Fourth, we saw an increase in the return rates as compared to prior years due primarily to consumer confusion with pod compatibility, particularly early on in fiscal 2015 with the launch of 2.0. We believe this initial launch factor will have a more limited impact in 2016 with improved communication and packaging, and with the recent relaunch of the Keurig My K-Cup. Finally, the MINI product action had more of an impact than we originally expected. Additional research has shown that some consumers are more likely to enter the single-serve category at a lower price point, more in line with our MINI product offering. With the MINI in very limited distribution as a result of the product action we took and the K200 not launching until late spring, we simply didn't have a strong low-priced product lineup during the first half of our fiscal year. 
Looking ahead, we entered the 2015 holiday season in a much stronger position. We have a broader portfolio of brewer models across more price points, with stronger offerings in the key sub-$100 category. The MINI brewer is back in broad distribution and we have reduced its price to $79 to drive adoption, with consumers looking for Keurig convenience and quality in a lower-priced offering. 
Our small footprint, K200 entry-level, 2.0 brewer, is also available this holiday season in a variety of colors with strong promotional plans. The K200 has been quite well received by consumers and has average ratings above 4 stars. This model has exceeded our initial expectations and is now the highest volume Keurig brewers sold in the single service marketplace. We will continue to offer our premium models for consumers looking for a larger reservoir and more features.  
On the marketing front, our new advertising campaign, ""YOUR FAVORITES. YOUR WAY."" kicked off in October. The campaign leverages a life-stage strategy that demonstrates the benefit of single serve versus drip coffee to consumers as they move into their first apartment, become parents or move to a new city. The campaign is multi-platform, with television spots across multiple dayparts, including 9 of the top 10 ranked primetime shows. We also have a strong digital campaign, including custom programs with Hulu and Yahoo. Additionally, we are continuing to message the variety and choice in the Keurig system on the box and through in-store marketing.  Importantly, we are delivering both increased effectiveness and productivity in our marketing investment as a result of consolidating our media agencies earlier in fiscal 2015. 
Looking to fiscal 2016, we expect that the actions we are taking will lead to some recovery in the percentage of our U.S. At Home shipments that contribute to an increased brewer installed base. While strong unit volume growth in the past 3 to 4 years will continue to impact the number of deactivations, we also expect to see lower price points in both the MINI and the K200 to bring new consumers into the single-serve category.  In addition, the relaunch of My K-Cup gives consumers the ability to brew all their favorite beverages in the Keurig system. Our current expectation is that the U.S. At Home installed base will grow in the mid- to high single digits in fiscal 2016. 
There's been some concern noted by the overall marketplace in recent weeks about the strength of consumer spending this holiday season. While we, of course, are not immune to overall market trends, we believe that an improving mix of new consumers to the Keurig single-serve coffee platform could help mitigate any impact from weaker economic growth.  More broadly, despite the current environment, we do believe that our core hot platform has plenty of whitespace to drive longer-term growth. We remain the category leader in single serve, with an installed base that's growing, and we fully expect single serve to continue gaining share of total coffeemakers over time. 
Turning to pods. Lower brewer installed base growth in fiscal 2015, as well as excess capacity at other pod manufacturers, created challenging category dynamics which we continue to experience in the fourth quarter. 
Volume growth in U.S. measured channels was 13% in the quarter. We continued to see weakness in the specialty and digital channels, bringing total U.S. At Home category growth in the quarter to approximately 7%. Against that 7% growth in pod consumption, our total pod shipments declined 4% in the quarter, with U.S. At Home volumes down 3% as we faced a difficult shipment comparison year-over-year. Notably, we typically see a build in channel pod inventories during our fiscal fourth quarter as colder temperatures become the norm and the holiday season approaches. The heavy build last year was attributed in part to the preordering by customers in advance of our SAP implementation which started in early 2014. 
After further analysis, we also believe there were additional factors at work in the fourth quarter of 2014, including the need for new partners to the Keurig system to build their in-house inventory, some pre-buying ahead of our November price increase and retailers planning for a big holiday on the 2.0 system. As a result of all these factors, we believe the 7% growth in the retail demand for pods in the fourth quarter of 2015 is the best measure of underlying performance of the category. 
For 2016, we are focusing -- forecasting U.S. At Home pod volumes to grow in line with installed base growth. Pod pricing remains competitive as other pod manufacturers have excess capacity. 
We have also seen downward price pressure on the part of other brands in the marketplace, which may be due in part to coffee prices, where the seed price has fallen by about 40% in the past year. 
As I mentioned on our last call, we have seen a mix shift this year away from owned and licensed brands, which continued in the fourth quarter. This was expected as we brought previously unlicensed brands into our system and expanded our partnership with Dunkin' Donuts. You will recall that prior to 2015, Dunkin had previously sold K-cups in their retail outlets only. But this popular brand is now fully available in broad distribution. We will continue to manage our pod business as a portfolio, supporting both our owned and licensed brands, as well as those of our partners. 
Recent innovation on our owned brands includes Green Mountain Organics, Green Mountain Coffeehouse beverages and Laughing Man, which are all available on keurig.com and are in the process of expanding retail distribution throughout 2016.  In the terms of partner brands, we added Community Coffee, Reily Foods and illy while starting to transition the Kraft brands into our system, in addition to the Dunkin expansion. 
The strength of the Keurig system has always been the variety, choice and convenience we provide to consumers, and its these very facts that we believe will continue to drive long-term growth in both brewers and pods. 
Turning to an update on Keurig KOLD. In terms of KOLD, we are pleased to launch the product this fall. These are very early days, and we caution that 2016 will be a year of launch and learn. This is the exciting new technology, and we intend to test different methods of marketing, both retail and digital, as well as pricing during the upcoming year to guide us as we build this new category and this new technology. We believe that experiencing the excitement of the system and the fresh cold taste of the beverages is critical to driving consumer acceptance. As a result, you'll see us staff for live demos in retail stores and malls, as well as build awareness with mobile vans and pop-up destinations with our Keurig KOLD cube. 
What that means in terms of numbers? Sales for the first 12 months of the launch will likely be in the range of 60,000 to 100,000 units based on what we see today. Our early read from consumers is positive on the taste profile of the beverage for both our partner brands and our new owned brands. 
Rita & Tina's, and Union St. Lounge cocktail mixers have just launched on keurig.com, adding to our portfolio of Kraft and fountain-style sodas, 0 and low-calorie flavored seltzers and waters, sports hydration drinks and iced teas. 
We have always viewed Keurig KOLD as a long-term multiphase rollout. It is very early in the launch, and we're taking the time necessary to learn from retailers and consumers to maximize the opportunity for long-term success. We expect to continually improve the appliance, its footprint and price point over time, and our development efforts on those fronts continue. But we will be disciplined and pragmatic in our approach to investment levels over the long-term, and we will invest only as marketplace success dictates. 
With that, I'll pass this call over to Pete."
334622,315883135,906148,"Keurig Green Mountain, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2015",2015-11-18,"Earnings Calls","Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian. I'm glad to be here and look forward to working with our shareholders and the investment community in my new role at Keurig. I'll start with some details on the fourth quarter before turning my attention to our outlook for 2016, and then wr",2842,"Thanks, Brian. I'm glad to be here and look forward to working with our shareholders and the investment community in my new role at Keurig. I'll start with some details on the fourth quarter before turning my attention to our outlook for 2016, and then wrap up with some comments on our balance sheet and free cash flow. 
Please note that the numbers I reference will largely be our non-GAAP figures, unless otherwise noted. You can reference our press release for a full reconciliation with the GAAP results. 
So turning to the quarter, we generated net sales of $1.04 billion compared to $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, and within the range detailed in our last conference call. Excluding currency impacts, sales were lower by 11%. The stronger dollar added a further 2% to the decline, and reported sales were off by 13%. Brewer and accessory sales were down 32%, with pod sales down 9%. 
Let me highlight some of the most important drivers of fourth quarter sales starting with brewers. Brewer volumes were 20% lower than 2014, in line with our expectations. Volumes were impacted by retailer inventory fluctuations. We're comparing against the retail sell-in associated with the Keurig 2.0 launch in the prior year, along with continuing efforts to clear excess brewer inventory at retail this year. Partially offsetting is the MINI product action, which reduced sales in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
In addition to volumes, mix reduced brewer sales by 10%, driven by the lower-priced K200 model and greater unit sales of the MINI brewer. It's important to note that the K200 launched during the spring of 2015 and was not included in the 2014 retail sell-in for the 2.0. And the MINI brewer had an elevated impact on mix in the fourth quarter of 2015 as we're comparing against the sales reserve taken for the product action in the prior-year quarter. 
As we move through 2016, we expect that brewer mix will improve noticeably from this fourth quarter level, particularly as we compare against the growing MINI and K200 volumes seen during the second half of 2015. 
Finally, brewer pricing in the fourth quarter declined by 1%, and foreign exchange negatively impacted brewer sales by 1 additional percentage point. We intend to have a heavier mix of promotional support for brewers during the 2015 holiday season and have reduced the price of the MINI. Lower brewer pricing will, therefore, be much more pronounced in the first quarter of 2016 than the levels seen in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Keep in mind that the promotional investments, along with a stronger product lineup at lower price points, is targeted to bring new and incremental users into our installed base. 
Turning to pods. The sales decline of 9% in the quarter was composed of a 4% lower volume and a 6% decrease in mix. This was partially offset by a 2% increase in net pricing. Foreign exchange negatively impacted pod sales by 2%. 
It's clear that the fourth quarter volume comparison versus 2014 was impacted by retailers ordering pods more aggressively last year, ahead of our SAP implementation. But as Brian noted, we believe that the retailer load-in went beyond the SAP implementation, with additional channel builds for the 2.0 launch and for the price increase we took last November and for the new and expanding brands coming into the Keurig system. As a result, we believe that the 7% growth in consumer demand for pods in the U.S. At Home marketplace during the fourth quarter is the best metric for viewing the health of the category and our pod business. 
In 2016, we expect pod volume growth to track the mid- to high single-digit increase in our brewer installed base. 
Finally, note the Away from Home pod environment remains competitive, with volume declines in the low teens during the quarter. 
Unfavorable mix for our owned and licensed brands reduced pod sales by about 6% in the fourth quarter, a better trend than the 8% mix impact seen in the third quarter of 2015. You may recall we started to bring in new partners to the Keurig system in a meaningful way during the fourth quarter of 2014, so the year-over-year mix comparisons have started to ease somewhat as a result. 
Note that our partner expansion continued into the second half of 2015 when Dunkin' Donuts' broader retail distribution took hold. So the mixed pack arising from new entrants to the Keurig system will remain a bit unfavorable until we get into the second half of 2016. 
Additionally, our shipment mix could also be influenced by share changes at retail. Pricing actions by competitors could result in higher or lower share for our owned and licensed brands in 2016. We'll obviously be watching this closely. 
Turning to profitability. Non-GAAP gross margin was down 300 basis points in the quarter, with higher coffee costs accounting for almost 3/4 of the decline versus 2014. On a sequential basis looking forward, we expect that coffee costs reflected in our cost of goods sold will remain at this high level during the first quarter of 2016 before starting to decline in the second quarter with a more noticeable drop in the second half of 2016. On a full year basis, we will see a slight benefit from lower coffee costs in 2016 compared to 2015. 
A second factor influencing our non-GAAP gross margins in the fourth quarter and accounting for 1 quarter of the decline versus the prior year is an $8.6 million obsolescence charge, or $0.04 per share, for the write-down of our inventory of BOLT commercial brewers. Please note that non-GAAP gross profit excludes a $20 million noncash pretax charge related to BOLT and other packaging lines. 
On a full year basis, obsolescence charges reduced non-GAAP gross margins by 160 basis points, or almost $0.30 per share, in 2015 versus 2014. While brewer obsolescence was one key factor, a significant portion of these charges came from pods as well. We have started an important effort toward reducing pod obsolescence costs by tightening our management of inventories in order to limit product aging beyond its stated useful life, among other actions. 
You can see that our year-end inventory of pods is about 20% below the levels seen in 2014. Not only have we generated enhanced cash flow from these actions, but we will also see a significant benefit to our bottom line through reduced obsolescence expense in 2016. 
Finally, I want to point out that we saw a favorable trend in sales returns for brewers in the fourth quarter, a first for 2015. This is the result of retailer mix, and we believe, a reflection of the 4-star-plus rating carried by our 200 brewer. We expect additional progress in fiscal 2016. 
Just a brief word on operating expenses. Non-GAAP SG&A declined 20% in the quarter, or 120 basis points, when measured as a percentage of sales, driven by lower marketing expense, headcount and variable incentive accruals. Note that we are driving greater efficiency from our marketing investments through consolidation of our media agencies. 
Keep in mind the fourth quarter non-GAAP SG&A expense, excludes $16 million in pretax restructuring charges related to our previously announced productivity program. These expenses are primarily employee severance costs, and all but $4 million are expected to be cash expenditures. 
Looking at earnings per share. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.85 in the quarter, above the range shared in our last conference call, with lower operating expenses and a lower effective tax rate as the key drivers.  The $0.85 per share compares to $0.94 in the fourth quarter of the prior year. I've already described the key operational factors, but note, we saw the benefit from a lower share base and a lower effective tax rate, offset in part by the stronger dollar which unfavorably impacted EPS by about $0.03. On a full year basis, non-GAAP EPS of $3.56 compared to $3.97 in 2014. 
The fourth quarter effective tax rate, or ETR, came in at 32.3%, down from 35.2% in 2014. This is the result of nonrecurring tax benefits related to the prior-year returns that totaled about $0.04 per share. On a full year basis, the 2015 ETR stood at 33.6% versus 35.4% in the prior year. We currently expect the 2016 full year tax rate to range from 33% to 33.5% in 2016, although some quarter variability is to be expected. 
Turning to guidance. For fiscal 2016, we expect next sales -- net sales on a constant-currency basis to be flat to up in the low single digits over fiscal 2015. We currently expect foreign currency exchange rates to negatively impact net sales growth by about 1%. Our non-GAAP earnings outlook is $3.25 to $3.45 per share and includes an estimated unfavorable $0.16 impact from foreign currency based on current exchange rates. 
Key drivers that are expected to impact the range of outcomes on EPS are: Installed base growth; the competitive environment in pods; the pace of KOLD consumer adoption as well as the rate at which we are able to scale KOLD pod production; and finally, the level of share repurchase. 
Our revenue guidance is based on the following expectations: The U.S. At Home installed base growth in the mid- to high single digits; lower average revenue per unit for brewers coming from a combination of product mix and, in some cases, lower pricing. As I mentioned earlier, we introduced the K200 entry-level 2.0 reservoir brewer model in the second half of 2015, and we also expect stronger shipments on the MINI in 2016 as we lap last year's product action, both of which will impact mix.  Brewer pricing will be impacted by the list price decrease on the MINI and promotional investments we've made on select models to further drive adoption. 
The pod marketplace remains competitive, which affects pricing, particularly as we have significant coffee inflation relative to current spot price in the first half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect negative pod mix, especially in the first half, as we do not lap the Dunkin' Donuts expansion of pods to retail until the second half. On a full year basis, we expect to see a lower unfavorable impact from mix on our pods sales growth than what we experienced in 2015. 
Gross margins in 2016 will have a number of puts and takes. We will see headwinds from a higher sales mix of 2.0 versus 1.0 brewers, price investments on brewers and pods and pod mix. KOLD is also expected to have an impact, given that we are in the startup phase of the launch, with inefficiencies as we bring up new manufacturing lines. 
There are also some noticeable tailwinds as well. Coffee costs are about 90% locked for 2016, and we will see slightly lower costs on a full year basis, but with significant variability by quarter. Reduced obsolescence expenses and sales returns will also be positives, and we've targeted approximately $100 million in productivity cost reductions, with savings more heavily weighted toward cost of goods sold versus SG&A. 
Key areas of focus are manufacturing efficiency, lower distribution costs and increasing the effectiveness of our promotional programs and marketing spend. 
We expect our income statement investment in Keurig KOLD on a pretax basis to center around $125 million in 2016 compared to approximately $100 million in 2015, and is dependent on consumer adoption of the platform, channel mix and pod manufacturing efficiencies. 
The majority of the 2016 investment relates to fixed costs, such as depreciation, research and development, plant startup and sales and marketing launch costs. Remember that this is a long-term rollout, which will likely see sales volatility from period to period. The introduction of Keurig KOLD is expected to positively impact revenue growth by less than 1 percentage point. 
Finally, our non-GAAP EPS guidance includes a 33% to 33.5% tax rate and additional share repurchases. 
Given that we are managing the business on an annual basis, we will not be giving quarterly guidance moving forward. That being said, we will highlight key factors influencing quarterly trends as appropriate. 
Higher coffee costs will impact the first quarter by about $0.13 per share compared to the prior year. Investments in brewer promotional spend, a heavier mix of the K200 and the MINI, and a greater mix towards 2.0 versus 1.0 brewers will also be additional factors experienced in the first quarter. 
We expect noticeably higher non-GAAP EPS in the remaining 3 quarters of 2016, as lower coffee costs roll into our cost of goods sold and the Q1 seasonal mix shifts away from heavier brewer sales. In addition, we expect lower obsolescence expense in the remaining quarters of 2016, and our productivity initiative should deliver greater savings. 
One last point on guidance. Given the volatility and competitive dynamics we're continuing to see in our business, plus the investments we're making to drive longer-term growth, we believe it's prudent to solely provide annual guidance metrics rather than a longer-term algorithm.  It's important to know that our overriding goal is to reaccelerate revenue growth, maximize productivity and drive earnings growth and cash flow. And while we work through the transition issues we've discussed at length, we're committed to allocating significant capital to share repurchases and dividend growth. 
Wrapping up with some comments on our balance sheet and free cash flow. We were pleased that free cash flow of $344 million was above our guidance due to improved discipline around working capital, with both inventories and receivables coming in lower than forecast. Importantly, free cash flow for our core hot business was up approximately $200 million year-over-year, and our goal is to continue managing the business to maximize cash flow efficiency. 
Capital expenditures for the year stood at $411 million, with CapEx for our hot business at approximately 4% of sales, down from about 6% in fiscal 2014. 
We did an exceptional job at driving higher operating efficiencies on our pod manufacturing lines for our hot business that limited the need for additional manufacturing capacity. A little over half of our capital spending in 2015 was associated with manufacturing capacity for KOLD. 
In my short time here, it's obvious there are opportunities for reduction in working capital. During 2015, we averaged 18.7% of sales invested in net working capital, excluding cash, up from 13.2% in 2014. The higher appliance inventories we carried over from a weak holiday season last year was a critical factor, and we have a long supply chain from Asia for our appliances. But there are opportunities across the board to free up cash flow for the company. We've started to make progress in the fourth quarter, but this will continue to be an important focus moving forward. 
We expect free cash flow to fall in the range of $420 million to $500 million in fiscal 2016. Capital spending is expected to fall in the range of $225 million to $275 million, down from $411 million in 2015, on significantly lower CapEx for KOLD. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to total about $290 million, up from $265 million in 2015. The increase in D&A is all attributed to depreciation, and this additional expense is reflected in our non-GAAP earnings. 
Our strong cash flow and balance sheet allows us to return significant cash to shareholders, both in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Following a 15% increase in dividends for fiscal 2015, the board authorized an additional 13% increase to an annual dividend of $1.30 per share for 2016. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $150 million in shares and continued to be active in the market following the close of our fiscal year. Since then, we've bought back an additional $235 million in common stock, bringing our total share repurchases, post the third quarter earnings report, to $350 million. This equates to 6.4 million shares, or about 4% of our total shares outstanding, at an average price of about $55 per share. We have $914 million left on our share repurchase authorization as of today, and we intend to be active in the market as we move through 2016. 
Before turning the call back to Brian, let me note that I accepted the CFO position at Keurig Green Mountain because of the opportunity I saw for value creation for shareholders and the role I might have in driving that. After 3 months on the job full time, I'm more convinced than ever of that potential. 
While our category continues to experience a tougher competitive environment, Keurig is the leading brand in single-serve coffee in North America. We have grown very quickly and, as a result, there are real opportunities in a number of important areas, including lower brewer costs, improved pod manufacturing productivity, greater efficiencies in our trade and marketing spend and product innovation. 
While change always takes time, I'm delighted to be a member of the Keurig team, and will remain focused on that. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian to wrap up."

One, the MINI returning in full distribution is a real help. And we've got new insight this year as the MINI went away as to exactly who the MINI brings into the system, and it brings new users into the system. And that's the first thing. And while we knew that a bit, we didn't really see its impact until it went away. The My K-cup is another factor that really helps bring new users in the system because they say, ""Okay, I can continue to hold on to the bagged coffee I have, but I can also try a MINI for a fairly low price, less than $100."" So I think the MINI is one factor. The other thing is that the price points we've reflected in the K200 this holiday season and the K40 in this holiday season at certain customers is also really driving the same issue. It's -- we're realizing that the price point -- and we've said this for a bit now, the sub-$100 price point is important to get new users and then we want to have premium models, where consumers can trade up and loyal Keurig users can step into models with better features and larger reservoirs. So we think that's the mix we want. We have the right brewer lineup now for the season. We have the right price points. We have the My K-Cup back.

And to the extent that the visibility is different, why is that? And what do you think it will take to close any gaps?

Now, it just so happens that, I think, too, when you look at our mix, as was talked about throughout the last year, partners are an increasing piece of the overall volume that we manufacture, so that tends to, I think, exacerbate the issue as you're -- as we're doing our forecasting. That being said, I think there are some good opportunities here for better aligning forecasts with partners. I know some of the new folks that have come in to run the U.S. business are putting a very, very high emphasis on that. And I think that we can do better, but it'll take a little bit of time to get there."

As you rely -- and this is kind of a follow-up to the earlier question, if you rely more and more on those low-priced brewers to grow the installed base, what does that imply about the future attachment rate, the ability to maintain historical pricing and still grow? Essentially, is the quality of today's incremental household the same as it was in the past? And do you have data that people actually trade-up from what you're labeling entry-level products to sort of higher end, presumably higher attachment rate, better economic-type products?"

We believe that there were hundreds of thousands of excess brewers in the channel when the holiday season ended. And we had higher inventories too. So it was a significant factor; that's at the end of the first quarter. And what we've seen are lower shipments for the remaining 3 quarters of the year, which has affected our shipments and made some of the comparisons a bit tougher compared to the prior year. We think they're in better shape at this point in time. Whether they're absolutely there or not will also be dependent on the holiday season for 2015, so I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves on that front. And as for first quarter shipments for us, I'd say we are very confident that we should see higher retail sales for brewers compared to the prior year. A number of reasons for optimism there, including the fact that all the pod compatibility issues that we were dealing with a year ago are largely behind us, we believe. We've got that 4-plus -- 4-star-plus rating on the K200. That should help us as well. How that translates into our own shipment level will be dependent on the retailer inventory situation. I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves and start to forecast that. But you won't -- I think one thing we can say for certain, you won't see the sort of volume drag that you've seen for the last 3 quarters for the company in terms of our shipments in the first quarter of 2016."

We've seen the only thing that drives attachment rate difference is the presence of a reservoir or non-reservoir brewer. So it's not necessarily a price point. But what happens is a MINI, a non-reservoir brewer, tends to have a lower attachment rate than a reservoir brewer. So when we take and offer the K40 or the K200 at an attractive price, we don't see any change in attachment rate at all. The MINI, now that it's back, will be more at normal levels for us. So we don't see lower price points, in effect, driving attachment rate lower. And we've not really seen that; our attachment rate has been very steady. Because the second piece of the question was about really, is the quality of the installed base that comes in with a lower brewer, lower? I'm going to answer that 2 ways. And both are encouraging for us. First, we don't see that a lower-price point consumer brews less. In fact, in terms of pod consumption, we see about the same. The other thing we would say is, while the mix of the brand may differ, we don't see a difference in actual consumption of pods. So the -- we've not seen a decrease or a change at all in the quality of the installed base. I think we are learning more and more how to target households that are heavy coffee households, but we have a lot more to do to get that right and to be more precise with that. We have much, much more to do on the marketing side and on the commercial side to make that right. So the attachment rate is -- it fluctuates at the same level it's fluctuated for the last number of years, and so we have not seen that yet. But we would expect as we grow, we're going to have to -- and grow the installed base, we're going to have be more and more sharply focused on ensuring that the quality of the installed base we bring in is equally as strong or even stronger."

First, I'm here because I think it's a great company with great people, and that really stuck with me. And frankly, I've told Brian this, and I have intended to retire and this opportunity came along. And I really liked the strategy of the company, and I do see single serve as the future of the beverage world. I like the fact that it's got a very strong growth history behind it. We're going to be working to reinvigorate that this year on the pod side with some very specific actions that we're taking. And we also have the balance sheet to finance that growth moving forward. I think probably out of anything, and this is not a surprise, a company that's grown as fast as Keurig has, has plenty of opportunities for process improvement, as anyone would expect. And that's going to be a key focus of mine, I think, as we move through 2016. And I think I can actively help build that. There was a question on forecasting. We can do some more work on that despite some of the challenges of having a bigger external volume base for our pods. And I think too, just some of the discipline and rigor around investments -- investment spending, I think, is something else that I would want to focus on. I think we're under-levered, and we have the flexibility to use our balance sheet to return cash to shareholders. And also to invest in future growth for the company, and want to see us put some of that to work. And I have a pretty heavy focus on cash flow generation. I mentioned working capital; I think that's a pretty ripe area. And it takes time. We've got a complicated supply base here on the appliance side, even though it's not that big of a portion of our overall sales, and with the supply chain as long as we've got. But there are things that we can do, and I will say even here in the fourth quarter, we've taken a much more active role in trying to make sure we're getting delivery of brewers on a just-in-time basis as opposed to building inventories before we need them. So cash flow focus is something else I'll be focusing on."

So I don't want to focus on the penetration rates because I think the holiday season will -- that consumers will speak to that. But can you -- you can help us with the profitability side? So Brian said before that the issue with profitability had -- is basically on the brewer side of the business and not on the pods, and that's a major disconnect with what sort of the investment community is pricing into the stock right now. You do give a pretty detailed gross profit bridge, which tells you that pod mix was a $40 million hit for the year, which is not that significant. So can you just help us? I mean, where is pod profitability? 2013 Investor Day, generally speaking, it said 50% margins. A lot has happened since then, with new partners coming in. Where is pod profitability and sort of, can that be maintained at reasonable levels going forward? That's my first question. And the second one, it relates to profitability, but it's about the partnerships. So Brian, you said partnerships and innovation go hand in hand. And obviously, you had a big product launch this past year, it didn't go as well as planned, it's taken write-downs on Vue, on Rivo and now on BOLT. So where does that leave the partnerships from a long-term basis in terms of how strong they are?"

I think there's a number of levers that any company can have for dealing with it. And you heard me mention too the level of obsolete -- obsolescence charges that we experienced on the pod side went up significantly last year. Also, in terms of operating efficiencies on pod manufacturing, we grew that last year and we have plans to continue to manage that. I think when you look at pod profitability on a per-pod basis, a penny profit, as you might call it, that isn't how I think about it. I think of it from a margin percentage basis. And I do think that there's -- we've seen a little bit of erosion in that, but it's -- and the mix effect was real for the year, so don't get me wrong. But that was to be expected, and it was largely expected by the company because you're bringing in a lot more -- we brought in quite a few private label brands as well as additional partners, and we all know we make more money per pod on our own -- owned and licensed brands. If you listen to what I said, we fully expect that mix effect to be mitigated in the new year, because we're going to start to lap some of those comparisons, and I think that transition that we've gone through is one of the real key drivers there. But if we keep our focus on OEE, obsolescence and can maintain a disciplined pricing environment with partners as well, we should be in pretty good shape."

And you're right, we've long believed that they go hand in hand. The strength of our system, since its outset, has been the multi-branded open architecture and the fact that consumers can have a wide variety of choice. And it flows where it takes innovation to drop partners in and to keep partners in, and we've been quite successful at that. And then it -- the partnerships and the innovation build upon one another. And so we are confident that our system of continue to be the innovation leader, that we maintain strong partnerships, that we can offer the right amount of choice and variety to consumer. And that's what we've been able to do. So we look at the fact that the portfolio, we address our brands in the portfolio, we know that we need to build our own brands, we need our partner brands to be strong. We look at this year, the coffee prices this year, were, no question, a big drag on our profitability. And that certainly improves as we move through 2016. But the portfolio is what matters. We have a strong portfolio of owned and licensed brands. We have a strong portfolio of partner brands, private label brands. We now have the choice we need in the system to offer to every consumer the right opportunities to try and drink new beverages. We'll continue to expand -- appropriately expand the brands we have and the varieties we have. So partnerships and innovation will go hand in hand. When you're an innovation company, not everything works perfectly, and you try some and you quickly get out of them. And we've done a couple of those, there's no question. We could have executed and should have executed 2.0 better. We learned. We moved forward. And that's what we're doing here. And so it's about execution and operational detail when it comes to appliances, when it comes to productivity, when it comes to everything we're doing. But I'll end there, Akshay. Partnership and innovation is really how the system was built, and it will be the strength of our future as well."
