Our fourth quarter revenues were $2.74 billion, a sequential increase of 6.2%, including revenues from TriZetto. Excluding the impact of the TriZetto acquisition, we posted sequential growth of 3.1% in Q4, which includes a negative currency impact of 1.1%. For the full year 2014, including TriZetto, we delivered $10.26 billion of revenue, which represented growth of 16.1% over 2013.
As you are aware, we revised our full year guidance -- growth guidance at the time of our Q2 earnings release on account of client-specific issues and delayed ramp-ups in some projects. As it's clear from our strong performance during Q3 and Q4, those client and project-specific issues are now behind us and, as we enter 2015, we are encouraged by the strength of the demand environment and how well-positioned we are to capture the market opportunity.
For the full year 2015, we expect to deliver at least $12.21 billion of revenue, which represents full year growth of at least 19%, after a 2% currency headwind. Adjusting for the impact of TriZetto and currency movement, this guidance reflects strong revenue growth in our underlying business and is roughly in line with our 2014 growth. Karen will provide you with full details of our expected financial performance shortly.
I'd like to spend the next few minutes providing you a perspective on the trends that we saw last year and how these are impacting the demand environment going forward and how Cognizant is positioned to address the market opportunity.
Let me start with the demand environment. For many quarters, we've been talking to you about a once-in-a-decade shift driven by digital technologies that are putting industries and businesses at a crossroads. While there have been big technology shifts in the past, the current digital area is different in 2 very fundamental ways.
First, technology has moved from automating transactions to instrumenting all aspects of our lives. Sensors are being embedded everywhere, which implies that physical environments are becoming more intelligent and almost everything is becoming a source of data. It's estimated that by 2020, there will be 50 billion connected devices, generating 50x the data that is being generated today. The only way to harness this ecosystem is to advance forms of automation and technology.
The second difference is that the pace of change is like nothing we've ever seen before. In the past, technology evolution was characterized by brief periods of very intense innovation, followed by long periods of incremental improvement. Today, innovation cycles have compressed so dramatically that business leaders around the world have to think of innovation and improvement simultaneously. This challenge to achieve both efficiency and innovation is what we call the dual mandate, and we believe companies must simultaneously focus on both of these. On the one hand, large parts of the world economy are yet to return to robust and sustainable growth, which means we have to help our clients conserve capital by providing efficiencies and productivity, while also helping them build variable cost structures so that they are better able to match their costs with revenue and demand. On the other hand, we have to help them reinvent and reimagine their businesses and build the skills and capabilities required to make digital come alive. This is driving a significant demand for newer services in the areas such as mobility, data and security. A McKinsey study highlights this demand, indicating a potential shortage in the U.S. of up to 190,000 data scientists by 2018.
Clients need a partner who has the ability to integrate and execute end-to-end transformations driving both efficiency and innovation, and I'm confident that Cognizant is that partner for our clients in 2015 and beyond.
Now let me explain in some more detail how we're bringing all our capabilities together to help our clients on both sides of the dual mandate.
The first thing we're working on is driving best-in-class delivery across all of our service lines. We're continually improving each and every one of our services to bring capital and operating efficiencies to our clients. We have a relentless focus on bringing in tools and techniques to measure and improve delivery across the lifecycle, so clients can benefit from best-in-class operations. And we continue to drive efficiencies by investing in our delivery network, tapping new sources of talent and also driving process automation by providing advanced technologies across our lines of service.
The second area in which we are focused is the end-to-end productivity achieved by bringing multiple services and service capabilities together. For example, we are increasingly packaging application and infrastructure services together to take advantage of the synergies for managing these layers of the stack in combination. Our engagement with Health Net announced last year is an excellent example of an end-to-end solution, which includes applications and infrastructure as well as Business Process Services. Our ability to extract end-to-end synergies will allow us to reduce Health's Net G&A spend and improve quality of service.
Another example of the work we are doing to drive end-to-end productivity is our work in developing shared industry platforms. We're increasingly bringing together applications, cloud and Business Process Services to create industry utilities, benefiting multiple customers in an industry. In this process, we have created new commercial models where we can charge clients on the outcome or output we deliver to them. The platforms from TriZetto and Health Net will enable us to offer these new delivery models in healthcare at scale.
Third, where best-in-class delivery and multiservice integration and industry platforms help us drive efficiency for our clients, on the innovation front we made significant investments and saw great traction for digital solutions this past year. Business transformation at scale in the digital era requires approaches, skills and capabilities that are different from traditional IT Services. For several years, we have been working with our clients on new solutions driven by social, mobile, analytics and cloud technologies. This experience has helped us create a comprehensive, integrated approach to transform our clients' businesses into digital enterprises. We've been working with CEOs to strategically rethink business models, with business leaders to digitize business processes and with CIOs to create the foundational technologies and security for the digital age. We have multidisciplinary teams that bring together consultants, digital technologists, designers, business process experts and data scientists to create cohesive digital solutions for clients. We are organically building on our heritage of data, industry expertise, knowledge of SMAC technologies and legacy systems, complemented by digital acquisitions like ITIS, Cadient and Odyssey.
And finally, to further enhance our offerings to clients, we continue to invest in new capabilities to make sure that we stay well ahead of the curve. We are particularly focused on the next generation of game changing technologies, such as instrumentation with ultra low cost sensors, embedded software, 3G printing, advanced cybersecurity and many areas of artificial intelligence.
These are exciting times to be in the technology industry. The pace of change and innovation is breathtaking. Over the next decade, organizations around the world will raise to deploy new technologies for competitor advantage and better service. The world is becoming more technology-intensive, and I'm excited about the opportunity that this represents for our clients and for Cognizant.
In closing, let me say that 2014 was a significant year for us. We completed 20 years of strong growth, expanding to over 200,000 talented associates and now have operations in more than 40 countries globally. We've created a solid platform for growth, and I'm confident that given our entrepreneurial culture and our ability to adapt to change, we are well-positioned for the next stage of our journey. 
I'd like to hand it over to Gordon now to discuss our performance and then to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll return later for the Q&A. Over to you, Gordon."

Before I get into the details of the quarter, I'll first discuss the status of the integration and revenue synergies of the TriZetto acquisition and then provide some additional color on the current demand environment.As announced prev",1421,"Thank you, Frank. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I'll first discuss the status of the integration and revenue synergies of the TriZetto acquisition and then provide some additional color on the current demand environment.
As announced previously, we closed the $2.8 billion acquisition of TriZetto on November 20. At this point, client account teams have been integrated and detailed plans are in place to begin to drive revenue synergies this year. We have a team of people dedicated to the integration and the various synergy tracks we outlined several months back. We have identified at a granular level the path to achieving the $1.5 billion of synergy opportunities over the next 5 years and remain confident in our ability to deliver that result based on the many exciting opportunities we see.
First, we anticipate picking up incremental projects integrating TriZetto's platforms clients. Second, we think there's an opportunity to cross sell our BPS, hosting and consulting services into the TriZetto clients where we currently don't have relationships. Finally, the longer-term opportunity goes beyond that. The combination of TriZetto's platforms with our services and program management capabilities will allow us to create end-to-end platform-based solutions for their clients. At a time of significant disruption in the healthcare industry, regulatory reform, aging populations, increasing price competition, demands for transparency and new technologies, these end-to-end solutions are gaining traction. We are receiving numerous inquiries from CEOs and COOs at our clients. They are proactively reaching out to us, starting conversations about combined Cognizant and TriZetto solutions. These clients are intrigued by how these comprehensive platform-based solutions can create compelling value propositions for their companies.
Let me now comment on the overall demand environment and our performance across industry segments and geographies during the fourth quarter. We are pleased with strong revenue performance during the fourth quarter despite unfavorable currency movement. As Francisco mentioned earlier, excluding the impact of TriZetto, revenue grew 3.1% over quarter 3, which includes a negative currency impact of 1.1%. The demand environment remained strong as reflected in our strong order pipeline and the pickup of deal activity over the past couple of quarters, and reflects clients' growing demand for achieving both efficiency and innovation on 1 platform.
From an industry perspective, our Banking and Financial Services segment grew 3.6% sequentially and 12.4% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued strong growth in our insurance practice, where there's a growing interest in end-to-end managed services.
On the banking side, underlying demand drivers remained consistent through 2014, cost optimization and vendor consolidation, regulatory compliance, real-time risk monitoring and fraud and trade surveillance. We expect many of these drivers to continue in 2015, but with an increased focus on newer technologies in digital and automation.
Our Healthcare segment, which consists primarily of our payer, pharmaceutical, biotech, medical device clients and now our TriZetto business, grew 17.9% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. Excluding TriZetto, the healthcare segment grew 5.6% sequentially. As we've discussed over the course of 2014, our payer sector took a more cautious approach to investment during the year. Longer-term, the payer sector is undergoing fundamental change driven by a changing regulatory environment, increasing focus on medical cost and the consumerization of healthcare. We believe this fundamental change creates longer-term opportunities for which we are well-positioned to capture.
Within the pharmaceutical segment, we've seen another quarter of strong sequential growth driven by cost optimization and vendor consolidation as well as increased traction in BPS, especially with clinical and commercial operations. Finally our acquisition of Cadient is helping drive the digital agenda with our pharmaceutical clients as Cadient is seen as leading the market in Digital Marketing Solutions.
Our retail manufacturing segment was essentially flat when compared to the third quarter and up 9% over Q4 of 2013. Q4 is typically a slow quarter for this segment, given the lockdown of IT systems during the holiday season and the number of furloughs that occurred at year-end. However, we are seeing improved demand particularly in the areas of modernizing supply chains as well as digital and e-commerce engagements.
Our other segment, which includes high-tech, communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 1.2% sequentially and 23.3% year-over-year, primarily driven by further penetration with our existing clients. We are seeing good traction through our ITIS acquisition, with our communications and media and entertainment clients as traditional cable, broadcast and telecom network environments move towards a wide range of digital video services.
Let me now turn to a discussion of our Horizon 2 service lines, where we continue to be pleased with the market traction we are realizing. Our BPS practice saw continued traction during the quarter, largely on the ramp-up of a number of wins in prior quarters across financial services, insurance and healthcare. BPS is a critical component of bringing operative efficiencies to our clients. Increasingly, this has delivered through solutions leveraging technology and advanced automation. Demand for our vertically aligned business processes such as membership enrollment and revenue cycle management healthcare and claims processing and mortgage services and insurance and financial services remains strong.
Cognizant infrastructure services had another strong quarter. We're seeing solid demand from clients looking to simplify and automate their infrastructure through newer delivery models, often incorporating highly automated managed services and newer technology such as our hybrid cloud and mobility solutions. Additionally, solutions integrating infrastructure and applications management are gaining traction.
Cognizant Business Consulting, or CBC, continued its pace of above-average growth as transformational engagements, which require clients to rethink and reimagine their strategy and operating models, are driving strong demand. Within today's environment, clients are expecting consulting to grow beyond strategy and to be included within integrated solutions, incorporating design, technology and implementation. CBC is on the frontlines of our digital engagements with over 60% of deals in their 2015 pipeline having a digital component, focusing particularly on 3 key areas: enhancing the customer experience, modernizing and simplifying supply chains and transforming underlying technologies for their digital environment.
Our Horizon 3 offerings include new technologies and new delivery models as well as new markets. A new area seeing especially a strong traction is our public sector practice. The strength is driven by leveraging our commercial expertise, particularly in banking and healthcare, and offering our full suite of services across all 3 horizons.
From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 7.7% sequentially and 17.4% year-over-year. Excluding TriZetto, North America was up 3.6% over the third quarter.
Revenue from Europe was up 0.6% compared to quarter 3, including a negative 4.4% currency impact. Revenue was up 10.7% over a year ago. Continental Europe was up just under 1% sequentially, including a negative 4.7% currency impact. We expect solid growth in the continent over coming years as we increasingly benefit from the structural shift towards larger, multiyear outsourcing programs.
The Rest of World continued to show good growth, up 4.5% sequentially and 22.3% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in key markets such as Australia and the Middle East.
2014 was a strong year from a business operations perspective. In our 20th year, our reputation of being an employer of choice was further strengthened across the globe. We crossed the 200,000 employee mark. We continue to include and hire some of the best talent from around the world, both from the lateral market and from leading universities in 17 countries. With newer skills needed to address opportunities fueled by digital, we have aggressively expanded recruitment into areas such as analytics and digital solution design.
Additionally, the accretion of TriZetto, ITIS, Cadient and ODC in 2014 have brought in world-class talent in areas of product engineering, video engineering, mobility, digital marketing and other skills critical to transformations that clients are seeing. We saw a downward trend with attrition during the year, evidence of our ability to engage, train, develop, recognize and retain our associates. We were pleased that Cognizant was ranked #1 for the second year in a row in the Association for Talent Development's 2014 Best Awards Program. 
Additionally, our annual business effectiveness survey of employees showed results improving from the prior year, a validation of our sustained focus on employee retention while driving high levels of customers centricity.
As we enter 2015, I believe that we are well-positioned to capture the evolving market opportunities. Our investments and expanded capabilities in markets, combined with the strongest workforce in our history, gives us confidence in delivering strong growth despite the current currency headwinds.

Fourth quarter revenue of $2.74 billion included approximately $80.6 million associated with TriZetto and representing growth of 6.2% sequentially and 16.4% year-over-year.
Non-GAAP operating margin which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.4%, within our target range of 19% to 20%.
During the quarter, we adjusted our estimate of 2014 incentive compensation downward to reflect the margin impact of accelerated hiring and other investments. This revision positively impacted our Q4 operating margin by approximately 2 percentage points.
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.67 exceeded our previous guidance by $0.04. For the full year 2014, revenue of $10.26 billion represented growth of 16.1% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 20.2%, and non-GAAP EPS was $2.60.
Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 54% and 46% of revenue, respectively, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 8% sequentially and 26% year-over-year, while Outsourcing Services were up 5% sequentially and grew 7% from Q4 a year ago. 
During the quarter, $45 million of revenue from TriZetto was included in consulting and technology services and $35 million was included in outsourcing.
For the full year, consulting and technology services and Outsourcing Services represented 53% and 47% of revenue, respectively.
During the fourth quarter, 36% of our revenue came from fixed price contracts and, as expected, overall pricing was stable.
As part of the TriZetto acquisition, we added both payer and provider clients, including more than 245,000 providers. As such, the customer account is no longer as relevant a metric for measuring our core performance, so we will no longer be providing that going forward. We will, however, continue to provide the number of strategic accounts, which we have defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue. We added 7 strategic customers in the quarter, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 271.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for a total cost of approximately $58 million. To date, we have repurchased approximately 35.2 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.2 billion under the share repurchase authorization of $2 billion and have approximately $814 million remaining unutilized.  Our fully diluted share count increased slightly to 612.8 million shares for the quarter.
As a result of the TriZetto acquisition, we are modifying our DSO calculation. The DSO formula will continue to include total accounts receivable, but will now be net of the uncollected portion of deferred revenues. Total receivables were $2.3 billion at end of the quarter, and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 70 days. Under the previous calculation, the DSO for Cognizant, excluding TriZetto, would have been 75 days, a decrease of approximately 2 days from the last quarter.
The unbilled portion of our receivable balance was approximately $325 million, down from $338 million at the end of Q3. We billed approximately 56% of the Q4 unbilled balance in January. The decrease in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables.
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the fourth quarter with approximately $3.8 billion of cash and short-term investments, down by approximately $844 million from the quarter ending September 30, and up by approximately $27 million from the year-ago period.
As mentioned previously, we closed the acquisition of TriZetto during the quarter. The funding for this acquisition came from a combination of cash on hand and debt priced at LIBOR plus 100 basis points. At the end of the quarter, our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1.6 billion, including approximately $650 million, which was drawn on our revolver to fund intercompany payments at the end of the year. Including this debt, financing activities were approximately a $1.6 billion worth of cash during the quarter.
During the fourth quarter, operating activities generated approximately $324 million of cash. Investing activities were a use of cash of $2.53 billion. This included $2.68 billion for acquisitions and capital expenditures of approximately $75 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures for the full year were approximately $213 million.
Let me now provide some color on our business and operating metrics for the quarter and for the rest of the year. During the quarter, we added approximately 11,800 employees, including approximately 3,770 associates from the acquisition of TriZetto. And we ended the quarter with approximately 211,500 employees globally. Approximately 198,000 of our employees were service delivery staff.
Excluding the TriZetto associates, 33% of our new hires were direct college hires, while 67% were lateral hires of experienced professionals. 
Annualized attrition of 14.5% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, improved 110 basis points from Q3 of this year. Attrition levels are something that we continue to monitor very closely, and we are pleased by the sequential decline in this metric.
Utilization declined on a sequential basis as we on-boarded our new hires. Offshore utilization was approximately 69%. Offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who are now training program was approximately 76% and on-site utilization was approximately 92% during the quarter.
As we spoke about last quarter, there has been significant fluctuations in global exchange rates this year. For example, as of February 3, the euro had depreciated roughly 18% against the U.S. dollar versus where it was a year ago. The guidance that we provide is based on the exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. Based on current exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar, our guidance includes a 2% headwind to 2015  year-over-year growth.
With that in mind, for the full year 2015, we expect revenue to be at least $12.21 billion, which represents growth of at least 19%.
For the first quarter of 2015, we expect to deliver revenue of at least $2.88 billion.
During the first quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%.
For the first quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.69. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 612.9 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25.6%.
We expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $2.91 for the full year. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 612.9 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.4%.

I think when we talked about the acquisition previously, we mentioned that they're about a $720 million run rate, which is essentially where they landed for 2014, but a lot of that revenue is back ended. So think about them as give or take about a $720 million company growing mid-single digits has been historically their growth rate and you back to what your guidance is. In terms of Health Net, I'll let Frank and Gordon talk a little bit more about the actual contract and what's happening there, but in terms of guidance, as we had talked about previously, we expect that we will get regulatory clearance by about the middle of the year.

When you look at the digital opportunity from a skill standpoint, there are, I would say, 2 tracks in a sense. You got a set of foundational technologies that you need to deploy for clients. And building out foundational technology skills, I would say, follows a similar process to what Cognizant has historically done when it comes to building out new technology capability areas. So we have great partnerships and alliances with technology providers, very deep partnerships. We've got Cognizant Academy that recruits, trains, cross trains, cross skills our teams on foundational technologies. But equally importantly, Ed, what we find in the digital world is that it's not just about technology. To really make digital come live, you have to bring together these cross-functional, multifunctional teams that include consultants, technologists, data scientists, designers and, of course, folks who understand the client and the client context. And the skills like designers and data scientists are skills that we are both building organically internally but also recruiting heavily for in the marketplace. And also as you've seen from some of the acquisitions that we did in 2014, we're also looking at inorganic ways to grow those capabilities. And I think you'll continue to see us pushing forward on all those fronts that I just mentioned as we go into '15 and we continue to build out the digital capabilities at Cognizant."

So a couple of things, as we said in our prepared remarks, we remain quite confident of achieving our $1.5 billion of revenue synergies over the next 5 years. As we said when we did the acquisition, that is back-end loaded because the biggest piece of that comes from selling the integrated deals and, obviously, there's a long lead time on that. But also, as we said, we're actually seeing quite a bit of interest in that, so the pipeline is building. Going forward, you will not see us break out TriZetto revenue because what's TriZetto, what's Cognizant, very quickly becomes blurred prettily when you think about services revenue and BPO revenue. So we are managing it as part of our healthcare practice going forward. Obviously, we want to break it out as people understood what organic growth was for 2015. Revenue synergies for 2015, as we said when we did the deal, are certainly more modest than they'll be in future years and it would be heavily weighted towards services work, which even prior to the acquisition, we had the leading practice and obviously that's further strengthened now and we certainly feel good about the pipeline there. On the operating margins, our target remains 19% to 20%. We have bounced above 20% a little bit. Each time we did that, we did reaffirm that we do not want to be above 20%. So certainly our expectation is we would be in the 19% to 20% range for 2015 and our guidance assumes that. And I would certainly encourage people in their models to assume we're in the 19% to 20% range."

But I think, as we had said previously, with the ramp-up of some of the new contracts we signed this year, including Health Net and then the big insurance contract and the boardwork contract and others that we talked about earlier in the year, we would expect outsourcing revenue to recover a little bit as we go into 2015."

Let me address that. So as we said when we did the TriZetto acquisition, the TriZetto business that we acquired has become part of the Cognizant healthcare business but continues to operate as a relatively standalone unit within the healthcare business. Now obviously we're focused on the synergy opportunities from an execution standpoint and, as Gordon said, those synergy opportunities in the short run are around the services business and the BPO business that we can generate together. But the core product, the TriZetto product set, that capability remains a separate unit run by the management team that came to us when we did the TriZetto acquisition, and they continue to execute against the product roadmap that they had laid out for their customers and for now for our customers before the acquisition. So we are keeping the platform very much as a standalone unit. We will continue to invest in it as we had in -- as the plan had been in the past. If anything, we feel like we might be able to accelerate some aspects of the product roadmap because of our development capability and so on and so forth. But we clearly recognize that the rhythm of a software business is different from the rhythm of a services business. And so we're keeping it as a standalone unit within the healthcare -- the bigger healthcare business unit so that we protect that culture and we continue to make the -- create the necessary focus, I would say, around the software product business."

I don't think we're seeing budgets down overall. We are actually seeing sort of flat to modestly up budgets. So I think Gartner predicted or the Gartner's projection from January of this year was sort of 2.4%, 2.5% increase in budgets. That's sort of consistent with what we're seeing. Clearly, there is a shift going on within budgets, and I think that's really the more important trend for -- to focus on. What we are seeing is that this dual mandate that we've been speaking about for so long is really playing out in budgets where because overall budgets are call it flat to modestly up, the pressure that it creates for organizations is to really get more done with those essentially same budget dollars. And so what that means is that on one side, clients continue to look for ways to drive greater degrees of efficiency and effectiveness, kind of what we call the run better side of the equation, so that they can invest those dollars in deploying new digital and other capabilities, that's sort of the run different side of the equation. Clearly, in financial services, regulatory compliance initiatives are consuming a significant amount of our clients' budgets. I think this is anecdotal. I would say that the most intense period of that was probably last year. I think as we go into '15, when I look at our financial services institutions, it's not to say that the regulatory compliance then goes away, but I think it's -- I would say it's become more stable. I don't see it increasing as a percent of overall budgets. And so that started to create a degree of stability within our financial services clients where I start to see more focus and attention being turned to digital initiatives and initiatives that I consider to be ones that will drive competitiveness and top line growth for financial services. So I actually am seeing a positive shift in financial services more towards innovation and growth as regulatory compliance stabilizes and becomes a better and well more understood level of spending. I don't know, Gordon, if there's anything you want to add to that."

But on a non-GAAP basis, think about it as roughly being in line with company average margin going forward. FX has a little bit of an impact on margin, but fairly nominal. It's mainly a revenue issue with the FX headwinds that we had both in Q4 and that we are forecasting as we move into 2015. In terms of the segment margin, obviously, we have done a lot of hiring in the last 6 months, and that obviously puts pressure on margin until those folks become fully billable. Utilization ticked down both in Q3 and Q4. We would expect for that to stabilize in 2015, as we've talked about utilization will go up and down a little bit based on hiring and based on growth opportunities that we see in the company. But we would expect utilization to stabilize and margins to stabilize accordingly with that. And so then as we move into 2015, really nothing unusual.

In terms of SMAC, we don't -- SMAC has been kind of folded into the broader digital initiatives, which and within digital what we're seeing is it crosses all of our businesses, all of our accounts, so becomes very difficult to say it's in a specific amount because it touches everything. So we don't have any further update on that other than to say, clearly, there's healthy SMAC demand within digital and digital we are seeing permeate across all 3 horizons currently."

Let me start by saying that I think that as I said in my prepared comments, one of the trends that I'm quite excited about is this notion of clients looking to us in various forms to create these large integrated deals that include apps, infrastructure and Business Process Services. And those -- and sometimes those, like in the case of Health Net, those are relatively standalone. In other cases, we see migrating potentially to a shared industry utility type of model, which I think TriZetto and Health Net will enable going forward. After the announcement of the TriZetto acquisition, I would say that we've seen an increase in conversations with clients about the potential of those kinds of deals. I would characterize the pipeline of those deals as relatively early stage at this point. But certainly an active set of conversation's going on right now with prospects around what those kinds of deal structures might look like. I would remind you that the Health Net deal, the sales cycle was probably in the order of -- Health Net had been a Cognizant client for 10 years, close to 10 years, and the sales cycle on this particular transaction was close to 3 years. My hope is that when we look at the TriZetto opportunity that we're not looking at 3 year sale cycles. But I would still set the expectations that it's 18 to 20 months before we start to see those kinds of transactions. These are large complicated deals that involve a lot of structuring and a lot of groundwork with clients. But I think all of the elements are there. I feel very good about how we are positioned to do those deals. And I think that the Health Net transaction serves as somewhat of a beacon that others will emulate."

Our fourth quarter revenues were $2.74 billion, a sequential increase of 6.2%, including revenues from TriZetto. Excluding the impact of the TriZetto acquisition, we posted sequential growth of 3.1% in Q4, which includes a negative currency impact of 1.1%. For the full year 2014, including TriZetto, we delivered $10.26 billion of revenue, which represented growth of 16.1% over 2013.
As you are aware, we revised our full year guidance -- growth guidance at the time of our Q2 earnings release on account of client-specific issues and delayed ramp-ups in some projects. As is clear from our strong performance during Q3 and Q4, those client- and project-specific issues are now behind us, and as we enter 2015, we are encouraged by the strength of the demand environment and how well positioned we are to capture the market opportunity.
For the full year 2015, we expect to deliver at least $12.21 billion of revenue, which represents full year growth of at least 19%, after a 2% currency headwind. Adjusting for the impact of TriZetto and currency movement, this guidance reflects strong revenue growth in our underlying business and is roughly in line with our 2014 growth. Karen will provide you with full details of our expected financial performance shortly.
I'd like to spend the next few minutes providing you a perspective on the trends that we saw last year and how these are impacting the demand environment going forward and how Cognizant is positioned to address the market opportunity. Let me start with the demand environment. For many quarters, we've been talking to you about a once-in-a-decade shift driven by digital technologies that are putting industries and businesses at a crossroads. 
While there have been big technology shifts in the past, the current digital era is different in 2 very fundamental ways. First, technology has moved from automating transactions to instrumenting all aspects of our lives. Sensors are being embedded everywhere, which implies that physical environments are becoming more intelligent and almost everything is becoming a source of data. It's estimated that by 2020, there will be 50 billion connected devices generating 50x the data that is being generated today. The only way to harness this ecosystem is through advanced forms of automation and technology.
The second difference is that the pace of change is like nothing we've ever seen before. In the past, technology evolution was characterized by brief periods of very intense innovation, followed by long periods of incremental improvement. Today, innovation cycles have compressed so dramatically that business leaders around the world have to think of innovation and improvement simultaneously. This challenge to achieve both efficiency and innovation is what we call the dual mandate, and we believe companies must simultaneously focus on both of these. 
On the one hand, large parts of the world economy are yet to return to robust and sustainable growth, which means we have to help our clients conserve capital by providing efficiencies in productivity, while also helping them build variable cost structures so that they are better able to match their costs with revenue and demand. On the other hand, we have to help them reinvent and reimagine their businesses and build the skills and capabilities required to make digital come alive. This is driving a significant demand for newer services in areas such as mobility, data and security. 
A McKinsey study highlights this demand, indicating a potential shortage in the U.S. of up to 190,000 data scientists by 2018. Clients need a partner who has the ability to integrate and execute end-to-end transformations driving both efficiency and innovation, and I'm confident that Cognizant is that partner for our clients in 2015 and beyond.
Now let me explain in some more detail how we're bringing all our capabilities together to help our clients on both sides of the dual mandate. The first thing we're working on is driving best-in-class delivery across all of our service lines. We're continually improving each and every one of our services to bring capital and operating efficiencies to our clients. We have relentless focus on bringing in tools and techniques to measure and improve delivery across the life cycle so clients can benefit from best-in-class operations. And we continue to drive efficiencies by investing in our delivery network, tapping new sources of talent and also driving process automation by applying advanced technologies across our lines of service.
The second area in which we are focused is the end-to-end productivity achieved by bringing multiple services and service capabilities together. For example, we are increasingly packaging application and infrastructure services together to take advantage of the synergies for managing these layers of the stack in combination. Our engagement with Health Net, announced last year, is an excellent example of an end-to-end solution which includes applications and infrastructure as well as Business Process Services. Our ability to extract end-to-end synergies will allow us to reduce Health's Net G&A spend and improve quality of service.
Another example of the work we are doing to drive end-to-end productivity is our work in developing shared industry platforms. We're increasingly bringing together applications, cloud and Business Process Services to create industry utilities, benefiting multiple customers in an industry. In this process, we have created new commercial models where we can charge clients on the outcome or output we deliver to them. The platforms from TriZetto and Health Net will enable us to offer these new delivery models in health care at scale.
Third, where best-in-class delivery and multiservice integration and industry platforms help us drive efficiency for our clients. On the innovation front, we made significant investments and saw great traction for digital solutions this past year. Business transformation at scale in the digital era requires approaches, skills and capabilities that are different from traditional IT services. For several years, we have been working with our clients on new solutions driven by social, mobile, analytics and cloud technologies. This experience has helped us create a comprehensive, integrated approach to transform our clients' businesses into digital enterprises. 
We've been working with CEOs to strategically rethink business models, with business leaders to digitize business processes and with CIOs to create the foundational technologies and security for the digital age. We have multidisciplinary teams that bring together consultants, digital technologists, designers, business process experts and data scientists to create cohesive digital solutions for clients. We're organically building on our heritage of data, industry expertise, knowledge of SMAC technologies and legacy systems, complemented by digital acquisitions like itaas, Cadient and Odecee.
And finally, to further enhance our offerings to clients, we continue to invest in new capabilities to make sure that we stay well ahead of the curve. We're particularly focused on the next generation of game-changing technologies, such as instrumentation with ultralow-cost sensors, embedded software, 3G printing, advanced cybersecurity and many areas of artificial intelligence.
These are exciting times to be in the technology industry. The pace of change and innovation is breathtaking. Over the next decade, organizations around the world will race to deploy new technologies for competitive advantage and better service. The world is becoming more technology-intensive, and I'm excited about the opportunity that this represents for our clients and for Cognizant.
In closing, let me say that 2014 was a significant year for us. We completed 20 years of strong growth, expanding to over 200,000 talented associates and now have operations in more than 40 countries globally. We've created a solid platform for growth, and I'm confident that given our entrepreneurial culture and our ability to adapt to change, we're well positioned for the next phase of our journey. 
I'd like to hand it over to Gordon now to discuss our performance and then to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll return later for the Q&A. Over to you, Gordon."

Before I get into the details of the quarter, I'll first discuss the status of the integration and revenue synergies of the TriZetto acquisition and then provide some additional color on the current demand environment.As announced prev",1425,"Thank you, Frank. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I'll first discuss the status of the integration and revenue synergies of the TriZetto acquisition and then provide some additional color on the current demand environment.
As announced previously, we closed the $2.8 billion acquisition of TriZetto on November 20. At this point, client account teams have been integrated and detailed plans are in place to begin to drive revenue synergies this year. We have a team of people dedicated to the integration and the various synergy tracks we outlined several months back. We have identified at a granular level the path to achieving the $1.5 billion of synergy opportunities over the next 5 years and remain confident in our ability to deliver that result based on the many exciting opportunities we see.
First, we anticipate picking up incremental projects integrating TriZetto's platforms for payer clients. Second, we think there's an opportunity to cross-sell our BPS, hosting and consulting services into the TriZetto clients where we currently don't have relationships. Finally, the longer-term opportunity goes beyond that. The combination of TriZetto's platforms with our services and program management capabilities will allow us to create end-to-end platform-based solutions for payer clients. At a time of significant disruption in the health care industry, regulatory reform, aging populations, increasing price competition, demands for transparency and new technologies, these end-to-end solutions are gaining traction. 
We are receiving numerous inquiries from CEOs and COOs at our clients. They are proactively reaching out to us, starting conversations about combined Cognizant and TriZetto solutions. These clients are intrigued by how these comprehensive platform-based solutions can create compelling value propositions for their companies.
Let me now comment on the overall demand environment and our performance across industry segments and geographies during the fourth quarter. We're pleased with the strong revenue performance during the fourth quarter despite unfavorable currency movement. As Francisco mentioned earlier, excluding the impact of TriZetto, revenue grew 3.1% over quarter 3, which includes a negative currency impact of 1.1%. The demand environment remained strong as reflected in our strong order pipeline and the pickup of deal activity over the past couple of quarters and reflects clients' growing demand for achieving both efficiency and innovation on 1 platform.
From an industry perspective, our Banking and Financial Services segment grew 3.6% sequentially and 12.4% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued strong growth in our insurance practice, where there's a growing interest in end-to-end managed services. On the Banking side, underlying demand drivers remained consistent through 2014: cost optimization and vendor consolidation, regulatory compliance, real-time risk monitoring and fraud and trade surveillance. We expect many of these drivers to continue in 2015, but with an increased focus on newer technologies in digital and automation.
Our Healthcare segment, which consists primarily of our payer, pharmaceutical, biotech, medical device clients and now our TriZetto business, grew 17.9% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. Excluding TriZetto,  the Healthcare segment grew 5.6% sequentially. As we've discussed over the course of 2014, our payer sector took a more cautious approach to investment during the year. Longer term, the payer sector is undergoing fundamental change driven by a changing regulatory environment, increasing focus on medical cost and the consumerization of health care. We believe this fundamental change creates longer-term opportunities for which we are well positioned to capture.
Within the pharmaceutical segment, we've seen another quarter of strong sequential growth driven by cost optimization and vendor consolidation as well as increased traction in BPS, especially with clinical and commercial operations. Finally, our acquisition of Cadient is helping drive the digital agenda with our pharmaceutical clients as Cadient is seen as leading the market in digital marketing solutions.
Our Retail/Manufacturing segment was essentially flat when compared to the third quarter and up 9% over Q4 of 2013. Q4 is typically a slow quarter for this segment given the lockdown of IT systems during the holiday season and the number of furloughs that occur at year-end. However, we are seeing improved demand particularly in areas of modernizing supply chains as well as digital and e-commerce engagements.
Our Other segment, which includes high tech, communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 1.2% sequentially and 23.3% year-over-year primarily driven by further penetration with our existing clients. We are seeing good traction through our itaas acquisition with our communications and media and entertainment clients as traditional cable, broadcast and telecom network environments move towards a wide range of digital video services.
Let me now turn to a discussion of our Horizon 2 service lines, where we continue to be pleased with the market traction we're realizing. Our BPS practice saw continued traction during the quarter, largely on the ramp-up of a number of wins in prior quarters across Financial Services, insurance and Healthcare. BPS is a critical component of bringing operative efficiencies to our clients. Increasingly, this has delivered through solutions leveraging technology and advanced automation. Demand for our vertically aligned business processes, such as membership enrollment and revenue cycle management in Healthcare and claims processing and mortgage services in insurance and Financial Services, remains strong.
Cognizant infrastructure services had another strong quarter. We're seeing solid demand from clients looking to simplify and automate their infrastructure through newer delivery models, often incorporating highly automated managed services and newer technology, such as our hybrid cloud and mobility solutions. Additionally, solutions integrating infrastructure and applications management are gaining traction.
Cognizant Business Consulting or CBC continued its pace of above-average growth as transformational engagements which require clients to rethink and reimagine their strategy and operating models are driving strong demand. Within today's environment, clients are expecting consulting to go beyond strategy and to be included within integrated solutions, incorporating design, technology and implementation. CBC is on the front lines of our digital engagements, with over 60% of deals in their 2015 pipeline having a digital component, focusing particularly on 3 key areas: enhancing the customer experience, modernizing and simplifying supply chains and transforming underlying technologies for the digital environment.
Our Horizon 3 offerings include new technologies and new delivery models as well as new markets. A new area seeing especially strong traction is our public sector practice. The strength is driven by leveraging our commercial expertise, particularly in Banking and Healthcare, and offering our full suite of services across all 3 horizons.
From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 7.7% sequentially and 17.4% year-over-year. Excluding TriZetto, North America was up 3.6% over the third quarter. Revenue from Europe was up 0.6% compared to quarter 3, including a negative 4.4% currency impact. Revenue was up 10.7% over a year ago. Continental Europe was up just under 1% sequentially, including a negative 4.7% currency impact. We expect solid growth in the continent over coming years as we increasingly benefit from the structural shift towards larger multiyear outsourcing programs. The rest of world continued to show good growth, up 4.5% sequentially and 22.3% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in key markets such as Australia and the Middle East.
2014 was a strong year from a business operations perspective. In our 20th year, our reputation of being an employer of choice was further strengthened across the globe. We crossed the 200,000 employee mark. We continue to recruit and hire some of the best talent from around the world, both from the lateral market and from leading universities in 17 countries. With newer skills needed to address opportunities fueled by digital, we have aggressively expanded recruitment into areas such as analytics and digital solution design. Additionally, the acquisition of TriZetto, itaas, Cadient and Odecee in 2014 have brought in world-class talent in areas of product engineering, video engineering, mobility, digital marketing and other skills critical to transformations that clients are seeing. 
We saw a downward trend with attrition during the year, evidence of our ability to engage, train, develop, recognize and retain our associates. We were pleased that Cognizant was ranked #1 for the second year in a row in the Association for Talent Development's 2014 BEST Awards program.  Additionally, our annual business effectiveness survey of employees showed results improving from the prior year, a validation of our sustained focus on employee retention while driving high levels of customers centricity.
As we enter 2015, I believe that we're well positioned to capture the evolving market opportunities. Our investments in expanded capabilities and markets, combined with the strongest workforce in our history, gives us confidence in delivering strong growth despite the current currency headwinds.
Now let me have Karen provide more color on the financial details of our performance. Karen?"

Fourth quarter revenue of $2.74 billion included approximately $80.6 million associated with TriZetto and represented growth of 6.2% sequentially and 16.4% year-over-year.  
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.4%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. During the quarter, we adjusted our estimate of 2014 incentive compensation downward to reflect the margin impact of accelerated hiring and other investments. This revision positively impacted our Q4 operating margin by approximately 2 percentage points. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.67 exceeded our previous guidance by $0.04. 
For the full year 2014, revenue of $10.26 billion represented growth of 16.1% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 20.2%, and non-GAAP EPS was $2.60.
Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 54% and 46% of revenue, respectively, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 8% sequentially and 26% year-over-year, while outsourcing services were up 5% sequentially and grew 7% from Q4 a year ago. During the quarter, $45 million of revenue from TriZetto was included in consulting and technology services and $35 million was included in outsourcing. 
For the full year, consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 53% and 47% of revenue, respectively. During the fourth quarter, 36% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable.
As part of the TriZetto acquisition, we added both payer and provider clients, including more than 245,000 providers. As such, the customer count is no longer as relevant a metric for measuring our core performance, so we will no longer be providing that going forward. We will, however, continue to provide the number of strategic accounts, which we have defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue. We added 7 strategic customers in the quarter, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 271.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for a total cost of approximately $58 million. To date, we have repurchased approximately 35.2 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.2 billion under the share repurchase authorization of $2 billion and have approximately $814 million remaining unutilized. Our fully diluted share count increased slightly to 612.8 million shares for the quarter.
As a result of the TriZetto acquisition, we are modifying our DSO calculation. The DSO formula will continue to include total accounts receivable, but will now be net of the uncollected portion of deferred revenues. Total receivables were $2.3 billion at the end of the quarter, and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 70 days. Under the previous calculation, the DSO for Cognizant, excluding TriZetto, would have been 75 days, a decrease of approximately 2 days from the last quarter.
The unbilled portion of our receivable balance was approximately $325 million, down from $338 million at the end of Q3. We billed approximately 56% of the Q4 unbilled balance in January. The decrease in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables.
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the fourth quarter with approximately $3.8 billion of cash and short-term investments, down by approximately $844 million from the quarter ending September 30 and up by approximately $27 million from the year-ago period.
As mentioned previously, we closed the acquisition of TriZetto during the quarter. The funding for this acquisition came from a combination of cash on hand and debt priced at LIBOR plus 100 basis points. At the end of the quarter, our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1.6 billion, including approximately $650 million, which was drawn on our revolver to fund intercompany payments at the end of the year. Including this debt, financing activities were approximately $1.6 billion worth of cash during the quarter.
During the fourth quarter, operating activities generated approximately $324 million of cash. Investing activities were a use of cash of $2.53 billion. This included $2.68 billion for acquisitions and capital expenditures of approximately $75 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures for the full year were approximately $213 million.
Let me now provide some color on our business and operating metrics for the quarter and for the rest of the year. During the quarter, we added approximately 11,800 employees, including approximately 3,770 associates from the acquisition of TriZetto, and we ended the quarter with approximately 211,500 employees globally. Approximately 198,000 of our employees were service delivery staff. Excluding the TriZetto associates, 33% of our new hires were direct college hires, while 67% were lateral hires of experienced professionals. 
Annualized attrition of 14.5% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, improved 110 basis points from Q3 of this year. Attrition levels are something that we continue to monitor very closely, and we are pleased by the sequential decline in this metric.
Utilization declined on a sequential basis as we onboarded our new hires. Offshore utilization was approximately 69%. Offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was approximately 76%, and on-site utilization was approximately 92% during the quarter.
As we spoke about last quarter, there have been significant fluctuations in global exchange rates this year. For example, as of February 3, the euro had depreciated roughly 18% against the U.S. dollar versus where it was a year ago. The guidance that we provide is based on the exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. 
Based on current exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar, our guidance includes a 2% headwind to 2015 year-over-year growth. With that in mind, for the full year 2015, we expect revenue to be at least $12.21 billion, which represents growth of at least 19%. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect to deliver revenue of at least $2.88 billion. During the first quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%.
For the first quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.69. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 612.9 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25.6%.
We expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $2.91 for the full year. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 612.9 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.4%.

So can you talk a little bit about what you're actually including in your '15 outlook for that?

So for TriZetto, keep in mind that, obviously, their primary revenue is software, so Q4 tends to be very, very strong for them. It is, by far, their strongest quarter of the year. I think when we talked about the acquisition previously, we mentioned that they're about a $720 million run rate, which is essentially where they landed for 2014, but a lot of that revenue is back ended. So think about them as, give or take, about a $720 million company growing mid-single digits, has been historically their growth rate. And that would fetch you back into what our guidance is. In terms of Health Net, I'll let Frank and Gordon talk a little bit more about the actual contract and what's happening there. But in terms of guidance, as we had talked about previously, we expect that we will get regulatory clearance by about the middle of the year. And so we do have baked into our full year guidance what the increase in the Health Net revenue would be from that point forward."

And I'll just add to that, Darrin. Look, it's Frank. At a big-picture level, the -- if you recall the strategic rationale behind the TriZetto acquisition, was premised on the fact that the health care landscape is undergoing very strong significant structural shifts due to not just the reform law, but associated cost pressures, shifting responsibilities between payers and providers. And we think all of these things together create great growth opportunity for us. I think you saw some of that in the fourth quarter. I was very encouraged by the level of activity and dialogue that we saw in Q4 around the combined Cognizant, TriZetto proposition, with interest from clients and clients talking to us about the combined opportunities. So I think a great start to the combined relationship, and I expect to see increased momentum as we go into '15."

And building out foundational technology skills, I would say, follows a similar process to what Cognizant has historically done when it comes to building out new technology capability areas. So we have great partnerships and alliances with technology providers, very deep partnerships. We've got Cognizant Academy that recruits, trains, cross-trains, cross-skills our teams on foundational technologies. But equally importantly, Ed, in -- what we find in the digital world is that it's not just about technology. To really make digital come alive, you have to bring together these cross-functional, multifunctional teams that include consultants, technologists, data scientists, designers and of course, folks who understand the client and the client context. And the skills like designers and data scientists are skills that we are both building organically internally but also recruiting heavily for in the marketplace. And also, as you've seen from some of the acquisitions that we did in 2014, we're also looking at inorganic ways to grow those capabilities. And I think you'll continue to see us pushing forward on all those fronts that I just mentioned as we go into '15 and we continue to build out the digital capabilities at Cognizant."

As we said in our prepared remarks, we remain quite confident of achieving our $1.5 billion of revenue synergies over the next 5 years. As we said when we did the acquisition, that is back-end loaded because the biggest piece of that comes from selling the integrated deals, and obviously, there's a long lead time on that. But also, as we said, we're actually seeing quite a bit of interest in that, so the pipeline is building. Going forward, you will not see us break out TriZetto revenue because what's TriZetto, what's Cognizant very quickly becomes blurred particularly when you think about services revenue and BPO revenue. So we are managing it as part of our Healthcare practice going forward. Obviously, we want to break it out as people understood what organic growth was for 2015. Revenue synergies for 2015, as we said when we did the deal, are certainly more modest than they'll be in future years and will be heavily weighted towards services work, which we -- even prior to the acquisition, we had the leading practice. And obviously, that's further strengthened now, and we certainly feel good about the pipeline there. On the operating margins, our target remains 19% to 20%. We have bounced above 20% a little bit. Each time we did that, we did reaffirm that we do not want to be above 20%. So certainly, our expectation is we would be in the 19% to 20% range for 2015, and our guidance assumes that. And I would certainly encourage people in their models to assume we're in the 19% to 20% range."

So as we said when we did the TriZetto acquisition, the TriZetto business that we acquired has become part of the Cognizant Healthcare business but continues to operate as a relatively stand-alone unit within that -- within the Healthcare business. Now obviously, we're focused on the synergy opportunities from an execution standpoint, and as Gordon said, those synergy opportunities in the short run are around the services business and the BPO business that we can generate together. But the core product, the TriZetto product set, that capability remains a separate unit run by the management team that came to us when we did the TriZetto acquisition, and they continue to execute against the product road map that they had laid out for their customers, and for -- now for our customers, before the acquisition. So we are keeping the platform very much as a stand-alone unit. We will continue to invest in it as we had in -- as the plan had been in the past. If anything, we feel like we might be able to accelerate some aspects of the product road map because of our development capability and so on and so forth. But we clearly recognize that the rhythm of a software business is different from the rhythm of a services business. And so we're keeping it as a stand-alone unit within the Healthcare -- the bigger Healthcare business unit so that we protect that culture and we continue to make the -- create the necessary focus, I would say, around the software product business."

I don't think we're seeing budgets down overall. We are actually seeing sort of flat to modestly up budgets. So I think Gartner predicted -- or the Gartner's projection from January of this year was sort of 2.4%, 2.5% increase in budgets. That's sort of consistent with what we're seeing. Clearly, there is a shift going on within budgets, and I think that's really the more important trend to focus on. What we are seeing is that this dual mandate that we've been speaking about for so long is really playing out in budgets where, because overall budgets are, call it, flat to modestly up, the pressure that it creates for organizations is to really get more done with those essentially same budget dollars. And so what that means is that, on 1 side, clients continue to look for ways to drive greater degrees of efficiency and effectiveness, kind of what we call the run better side of the equation, so that they can invest those dollars in deploying new digital and other capabilities. That's sort of the run different side of the equation. Clearly, in Financial Services, regulatory compliance initiatives are consuming a significant amount of our clients' budgets. I think this is anecdotal. I would say that the most intense period of that was probably last year. I think, as we go into '15, when I look at our financial services institutions, it's not to say that the regulatory compliance spend goes away, but I think it's -- I would say it's become more stable. I don't see it increasing as a percent of overall budgets. And so that started to create a degree of stability within our financial services clients where I start to see more focus and attention being turned to digital initiatives and initiatives that I consider to be ones that will drive competitiveness and top line growth for Financial Services. So I actually am seeing a positive shift in Financial Services, more towards innovation and growth as regulatory compliance stabilizes and becomes a better and well  -- a more understood level of spending.

On a GAAP basis, because of all the acquisition amortization, obviously, that would be dilutive. But on a non-GAAP basis, think about it as being roughly in line with company average margin going forward. FX has a little bit of an impact on margin, but fairly nominal. It's mainly a revenue issue with the FX headwinds that we had both in Q4 and that we're forecasting as we move into 2015. In terms of the segment margin, obviously, we have done a lot of hiring in the last 6 months, and that obviously puts pressure on margin until those folks become fully billable. Utilization ticked down both in Q3 and Q4. We would expect for that to stabilize in 2015. As we've talked about, utilization will go up and down a little bit based on hiring and based on growth opportunities that we see in the company. But we would expect utilization to stabilize and margins to stabilize accordingly with that. And so then as we move into 2015, really nothing unusual.

So pricing, this -- over the past couple of quarters, has been stable, and I think that's a reasonable assumption going forward. You may see some divergence. Certainly, pricing in digital will be higher than in traditional apps maintenance, but the people cost more there as well. So when you net it all out, I think a reasonably stable price environment is the way to think about it. In terms of wage inflation, we do our wage increases later in the year, and certainly, we'll make sure that we're competitive with what others do. But I would expect, given the supply -- the strong supply, that wage increases will be relatively modest compared to prior year. But in the end, we will certainly match what others do. So -- but I would expect others to be fairly disciplined in their wage increases."

Let me take that. Let me step -- start by saying that I think that, as I said in my prepared comments, one of the trends that I'm quite excited about is this notion of clients looking to us in various forms to create these large integrated deals that include apps, infrastructure and Business Process Services. And those -- and sometimes those -- like in the case of Health Net, those are relatively standalone. In other cases, we see migrating potentially to a shared industry utility type of model, which I think TriZetto and Health Net will enable going forward. After the announcement of the TriZetto acquisition, I would say that we've seen an increase in conversations with clients about the potential of those kinds of deals. I would characterize the pipeline of those deals as relatively early stage at this point. But certainly, an active set of conversation is going on right now with prospects around what those kinds of deal structures might look like. I would remind you that the Health Net deal, the sales cycle was probably in the order of -- Health Net had been a Cognizant client for 10 years -- close to 10 years, and the sales cycle on this particular transaction was close to 3 years. My hope is that when we look at the TriZetto opportunity that we're not looking at 3-year sale cycles, but I would still set the expectations that it's 18 to 20 months before we start to see those kinds of transactions. These are large complicated deals that involve a lot of structuring and a lot of groundwork with clients. But I think all of the elements are there. I feel very good about how we're positioned to do those deals, and I think that the Health Net transaction serves as somewhat of a beacon that others will emulate."

Our fourth quarter revenues were $2.74 billion, a sequential increase of 6.2%, including revenues from TriZetto. Excluding the impact of the TriZetto acquisition, we posted sequential growth of 3.1% in Q4, which includes a negative currency impact of 1.1%. For the full year 2014, including TriZetto, we delivered $10.26 billion of revenue, which represented growth of 16.1% over 2013.
As you are aware, we revised our full year guidance -- growth guidance at the time of our Q2 earnings release on account of client-specific issues and delayed ramp-ups in some projects. As is clear from our strong performance during Q3 and Q4, those client- and project-specific issues are now behind us, and as we enter 2015, we are encouraged by the strength of the demand environment and how well-positioned we are to capture the market opportunity.
For the full year 2015, we expect to deliver at least $12.21 billion of revenue, which represents full year growth of at least 19%, after a 2% currency headwind. Adjusting for the impact of TriZetto and currency movement, this guidance reflects strong revenue growth in our underlying business and is roughly in line with our 2014 growth. Karen will provide you with full details of our expected financial performance shortly.
I'd like to spend the next few minutes providing you a perspective on the trends that we saw last year and how these are impacting the demand environment going forward and how Cognizant is positioned to address the market opportunity. Let me start with the demand environment. For many quarters, we've been talking to you about a once-in-a-decade shift driven by digital technologies that are putting industries and businesses at a crossroads. 
While there have been big technology shifts in the past, the current digital era is different in 2 very fundamental ways. First, technology has moved from automating transactions to instrumenting all aspects of our lives. Sensors are being embedded everywhere, which implies that physical environments are becoming more intelligent and almost everything is becoming a source of data. It's estimated that by 2020, there will be 50 billion connected devices generating 50x the data that is being generated today. The only way to harness this ecosystem is through advanced forms of automation and technology.
The second difference is that the pace of change is like nothing we've ever seen before. In the past, technology evolution was characterized by brief periods of very intense innovation, followed by long periods of incremental improvement. Today, innovation cycles have compressed so dramatically that business leaders around the world have to think of innovation and improvement simultaneously. This challenge to achieve both efficiency and innovation is what we call the dual mandate, and we believe companies must simultaneously focus on both of these. 
On the one hand, large parts of the world economy are yet to return to robust and sustainable growth, which means we have to help our clients conserve capital by providing efficiencies in productivity, while also helping them build variable cost structures so that they are better able to match their costs with revenue and demand. On the other hand, we have to help them reinvent and reimagine their businesses and build the skills and capabilities required to make digital come alive. This is driving a significant demand for newer services in areas such as mobility, data and security. 
A McKinsey study highlights this demand, indicating a potential shortage in the U.S. of up to 190,000 data scientists by 2018. Clients need a partner who has the ability to integrate and execute end-to-end transformations driving both efficiency and innovation, and I'm confident that Cognizant is that partner for our clients in 2015 and beyond.
Now let me explain in some more detail how we're bringing all our capabilities together to help our clients on both sides of the dual mandate. The first thing we're working on is driving best-in-class delivery across all of our service lines. We're continually improving each and every one of our services to bring capital and operating efficiencies to our clients. We have relentless focus on bringing in tools and techniques to measure and improve delivery across the life cycle so clients can benefit from best-in-class operations. And we continue to drive efficiencies by investing in our delivery network, tapping new sources of talent and also driving process automation by applying advanced technologies across our lines of service.
The second area in which we are focused is the end-to-end productivity achieved by bringing multiple services and service capabilities together. For example, we are increasingly packaging application and infrastructure services together to take advantage of the synergies for managing these layers of the stack in combination. Our engagement with Health Net, announced last year, is an excellent example of an end-to-end solution which includes applications and infrastructure as well as Business Process Services. Our ability to extract end-to-end synergies will allow us to reduce Health Net's G&A spend and improve quality of service.
Another example of the work we are doing to drive end-to-end productivity is our work in developing shared industry platforms. We're increasingly bringing together applications, cloud and Business Process Services to create industry utilities, benefiting multiple customers in an industry. In this process, we have created new commercial models where we can charge clients on the outcome or output we deliver to them. The platforms from TriZetto and Health Net will enable us to offer these new delivery models in health care at scale.
Third, where best-in-class delivery and multiservice integration and industry platforms help us drive efficiency for our clients. On the innovation front, we made significant investments and saw great traction for digital solutions this past year. Business transformation at scale in the digital era requires approaches, skills and capabilities that are different from traditional IT services. For several years, we have been working with our clients on new solutions driven by social, mobile, analytics and cloud technologies. This experience has helped us create a comprehensive, integrated approach to transform our clients' businesses into digital enterprises. 
We've been working with CEOs to strategically rethink business models, with business leaders to digitize business processes and with CIOs to create the foundational technologies and security for the digital age. We have multidisciplinary teams that bring together consultants, digital technologists, designers, business process experts and data scientists to create cohesive digital solutions for clients. We're organically building on our heritage of data, industry expertise, knowledge of SMAC technologies and legacy systems, complemented by digital acquisitions like itaas, Cadient and Odecee.
And finally, to further enhance our offerings to clients, we continue to invest in new capabilities to make sure that we stay well ahead of the curve. We're particularly focused on the next generation of game-changing technologies, such as instrumentation with ultralow-cost sensors, embedded software, 3D printing, advanced cybersecurity and many areas of artificial intelligence.
These are exciting times to be in the technology industry. The pace of change and innovation is breathtaking. Over the next decade, organizations around the world will race to deploy new technologies for competitive advantage and better service. The world is becoming more technology-intensive, and I'm excited about the opportunity that this represents for our clients and for Cognizant.
In closing, let me say that 2014 was a significant year for us. We completed 20 years of strong growth, expanding to over 200,000 talented associates and now have operations in more than 40 countries globally. We've created a solid platform for growth, and I'm confident that given our entrepreneurial culture and our ability to adapt to change, we're well-positioned for the next phase of our journey. 
I'd like to hand it over to Gordon now to discuss our performance and then to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll return later for the Q&A. Over to you, Gordon."
386024,281793474,754572,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2015",2015-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Frank. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I'll first discuss the status of the integration and revenue synergies of the TriZetto acquisition and then provide some additional color on the current demand environment.As announced prev",1423,"Thank you, Frank. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I'll first discuss the status of the integration and revenue synergies of the TriZetto acquisition and then provide some additional color on the current demand environment.
As announced previously, we closed the $2.8 billion acquisition of TriZetto on November 20. At this point, client account teams have been integrated and detailed plans are in place to begin to drive revenue synergies this year. We have a team of people dedicated to the integration and the various synergy tracks we outlined several months back. We have identified at a granular level the path to achieving the $1.5 billion of synergy opportunities over the next 5 years and remain confident in our ability to deliver that result based on the many exciting opportunities we see.
First, we anticipate picking up incremental projects integrating TriZetto's platforms for payer clients. Second, we think there's an opportunity to cross-sell our BPS, hosting and consulting services into the TriZetto clients where we currently don't have relationships. Finally, the longer-term opportunity goes beyond that. The combination of TriZetto's platforms with our services and program management capabilities will allow us to create end-to-end platform-based solutions for payer clients. At a time of significant disruption in the health care industry, regulatory reform, aging populations, increasing price competition, demands for transparency and new technologies, these end-to-end solutions are gaining traction. 
We are receiving numerous inquiries from CEOs and COOs at our clients. They are proactively reaching out to us, starting conversations about combined Cognizant and TriZetto solutions. These clients are intrigued by how these comprehensive platform-based solutions can create compelling value propositions for their companies.
Let me now comment on the overall demand environment and our performance across industry segments and geographies during the fourth quarter. We're pleased with the strong revenue performance during the fourth quarter despite unfavorable currency movement. As Francisco mentioned earlier, excluding the impact of TriZetto, revenue grew 3.1% over quarter 3, which includes a negative currency impact of 1.1%. The demand environment remained strong as reflected in our strong order pipeline and the pickup of deal activity over the past couple of quarters and reflects clients' growing demand for achieving both efficiency and innovation on 1 platform.
From an industry perspective, our Banking and Financial Services segment grew 3.6% sequentially and 12.4% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued strong growth in our insurance practice, where there's a growing interest in end-to-end managed services. On the Banking side, underlying demand drivers remained consistent through 2014: cost optimization and vendor consolidation, regulatory compliance, real-time risk monitoring and fraud and trade surveillance. We expect many of these drivers to continue in 2015, but with an increased focus on newer technologies in digital and automation.
Our Healthcare segment, which consists primarily of our payer, pharmaceutical, biotech, medical device clients and now our TriZetto business, grew 17.9% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. Excluding TriZetto, the Healthcare segment grew 5.6% sequentially. As we've discussed over the course of 2014, our payer sector took a more cautious approach to investment during the year. Longer term, the payer sector is undergoing fundamental change driven by a changing regulatory environment, increasing focus on medical cost and the consumerization of health care. We believe this fundamental change creates longer-term opportunities for which we are well-positioned to capture.
Within the pharmaceutical segment, we've seen another quarter of strong sequential growth driven by cost optimization and vendor consolidation as well as increased traction in BPS, especially with clinical and commercial operations. Finally, our acquisition of Cadient is helping drive the digital agenda with our pharmaceutical clients as Cadient is seen as leading the market in digital marketing solutions.
Our Retail/Manufacturing segment was essentially flat when compared to the third quarter and up 9% over Q4 of 2013. Q4 is typically a slow quarter for this segment given the lockdown of IT systems during the holiday season and the number of furloughs that occurred at year-end. However, we are seeing improved demand particularly in areas of modernizing supply chains as well as digital and e-commerce engagements.
Our Other segment, which includes high tech, communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 1.2% sequentially and 23.3% year-over-year primarily driven by further penetration with our existing clients. We are seeing good traction through our itaas acquisition with our communications and media and entertainment clients as traditional cable, broadcast and telecom network environments move towards a wide range of digital video services.
Let me now turn to a discussion of our Horizon 2 service lines, where we continue to be pleased with the market traction we're realizing. Our BPS practice saw continued traction during the quarter, largely on the ramp-up of a number of wins in prior quarters across Financial Services, insurance and Healthcare. BPS is a critical component of bringing operative efficiencies to our clients. Increasingly, this has delivered through solutions leveraging technology and advanced automation. Demand for our vertically aligned business processes, such as membership enrollment and revenue cycle management in Healthcare and claims processing and mortgage services in insurance and Financial Services, remains strong.
Cognizant infrastructure services had another strong quarter. We're seeing solid demand from clients looking to simplify and automate their infrastructure through newer delivery models, often incorporating highly automated managed services and newer technology, such as our hybrid cloud and mobility solutions. Additionally, solutions integrating infrastructure and applications management are gaining traction.
Cognizant Business Consulting, or CBC, continued its pace of above-average growth as transformational engagements, which require clients to rethink and reimagine their strategy and operating models, are driving strong demand. Within today's environment, clients are expecting consulting to go beyond strategy and to be included within integrated solutions, incorporating design, technology and implementation. CBC is on the front lines of our digital engagements, with over 60% of deals in their 2015 pipeline having a digital component, focusing particularly on 3 key areas: enhancing the customer experience, modernizing and simplifying supply chains and transforming underlying technologies for the digital environment.
Our Horizon 3 offerings include new technologies and new delivery models as well as new markets. A new area seeing especially strong traction is our public sector practice. The strength is driven by leveraging our commercial expertise, particularly in Banking and Healthcare, and offering our full suite of services across all 3 horizons.
From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 7.7% sequentially and 17.4% year-over-year. Excluding TriZetto, North America was up 3.6% over the third quarter. Revenue from Europe was up 0.6% compared to quarter 3, including a negative 4.4% currency impact. Revenue was up 10.7% over a year ago. Continental Europe was up just under 1% sequentially, including a negative 4.7% currency impact. We expect solid growth in the continent over coming years as we increasingly benefit from the structural shift towards larger multiyear outsourcing programs. The rest of world continued to show good growth, up 4.5% sequentially and 22.3% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in key markets such as Australia and the Middle East.
2014 was a strong year from a business operations perspective. In our 20th year, our reputation of being an employer of choice was further strengthened across the globe. We crossed the 200,000 employee mark. We continue to recruit and hire some of the best talent from around the world, both from the lateral market and from leading universities in 17 countries. With newer skills needed to address opportunities fueled by digital, we have aggressively expanded recruitment into areas such as analytics and digital solution design. Additionally, the acquisition of TriZetto, itaas, Cadient and Odecee in 2014 have brought in world-class talent in areas of product engineering, video engineering, mobility, digital marketing and other skills critical to transformations that clients are seeing. 
We saw a downward trend with attrition during the year, evidence of our ability to engage, train, develop, recognize and retain our associates. We were pleased that Cognizant was ranked #1 for the second year in a row in the Association for Talent Development's 2014 BEST Awards program.  Additionally, our annual business effectiveness survey of employees showed results improving from the prior year, a validation of our sustained focus on employee retention while driving high levels of customer centricity.
As we enter 2015, I believe that we're well-positioned to capture the evolving market opportunities. Our investments in expanded capabilities and markets, combined with the strongest workforce in our history, gives us confidence in delivering strong growth despite the current currency headwinds.
Now let me have Karen provide more color on the financial details of our performance. Karen?"

Fourth quarter revenue of $2.74 billion included approximately $80.6 million associated with TriZetto and represented growth of 6.2% sequentially and 16.4% year-over-year.

Fourth quarter revenue of $2.74 billion included approximately $80.6 million associated with TriZetto and represented growth of 6.2% sequentially and 16.4% year-over-year.  
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.4%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. During the quarter, we adjusted our estimate of 2014 incentive compensation downward to reflect the margin impact of accelerated hiring and other investments. This revision positively impacted our Q4 operating margin by approximately 2 percentage points. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.67 exceeded our previous guidance by $0.04. 
For the full year 2014, revenue of $10.26 billion represented growth of 16.1% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 20.2%, and non-GAAP EPS was $2.60.
Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 54% and 46% of revenue, respectfully, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 8% sequentially and 26% year-over-year, while outsourcing services were up 5% sequentially and grew 7% from Q4 a year ago. During the quarter, $45 million of revenue from TriZetto was included in consulting and technology services and $35 million was included in outsourcing. 
For the full year, consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 53% and 47% of revenue, respectfully. During the fourth quarter, 36% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable.
As part of the TriZetto acquisition, we added both payer and provider clients, including more than 245,000 providers. As such, the customer count is no longer as relevant a metric for measuring our core performance, so we will no longer be providing that going forward. We will, however, continue to provide the number of strategic accounts, which we have defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue. We added 7 strategic customers in the quarter, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 271.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for a total cost of approximately $58 million. To date, we have repurchased approximately 35.2 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.2 billion under the share repurchase authorization of $2 billion and have approximately $814 million remaining unutilized. Our fully diluted share count increased slightly to 612.8 million shares for the quarter.
As a result of the TriZetto acquisition, we are modifying our DSO calculation. The DSO formula will continue to include total accounts receivable, but will now be net of the uncollected portion of deferred revenues. Total receivables were $2.3 billion at the end of the quarter, and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 70 days. Under the previous calculation, the DSO for Cognizant, excluding TriZetto, would have been 75 days, a decrease of approximately 2 days from the last quarter.
The unbilled portion of our receivable balance was approximately $325 million, down from $338 million at the end of Q3. We billed approximately 56% of the Q4 unbilled balance in January. The decrease in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables.
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the fourth quarter with approximately $3.8 billion of cash and short-term investments, down by approximately $844 million from the quarter ending September 30 and up by approximately $27 million from the year-ago period.
As mentioned previously, we closed the acquisition of TriZetto during the quarter. The funding for this acquisition came from a combination of cash on hand and debt priced at LIBOR plus 100 basis points. At the end of the quarter, our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1.6 billion, including approximately $650 million, which was drawn on our revolver to fund intercompany payments at the end of the year. Including this debt, financing activities were approximately a $1.6 billion source of cash during the quarter.
During the fourth quarter, operating activities generated approximately $324 million of cash. Investing activities were a use of cash of $2.53 billion. This included $2.68 billion for acquisitions and capital expenditures of approximately $75 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures for the full year were approximately $213 million.
Let me now provide some color on our business and operating metrics for the quarter and for the rest of the year. During the quarter, we added approximately 11,800 employees, including approximately 3,770 associates from the acquisition of TriZetto, and we ended the quarter with approximately 211,500 employees globally. Approximately 198,000 of our employees were service delivery staff. Excluding the TriZetto associates, 33% of our new hires were direct college hires, while 67% were lateral hires of experienced professionals. 
Annualized attrition of 14.5% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, improved 110 basis points from Q3 of this year. Attrition levels are something that we continue to monitor very closely, and we are pleased by the sequential decline in this metric.
Utilization declined on a sequential basis as we onboarded our new hires. Offshore utilization was approximately 69%. Offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was approximately 76%, and on-site utilization was approximately 92% during the quarter.
As we spoke about last quarter, there have been significant fluctuations in global exchange rates this year. For example, as of February 3, the euro had depreciated roughly 18% against the U.S. dollar versus where it was a year ago. The guidance that we provide is based on the exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. 
Based on current exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar, our guidance includes a 2% headwind to 2015 year-over-year growth. With that in mind, for the full year 2015, we expect revenue to be at least $12.21 billion, which represents growth of at least 19%. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect to deliver revenue of at least $2.88 billion. During the first quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%.
For the first quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.69. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 612.9 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25.6%.
We expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $2.91 for the full year. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 612.9 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.4%.

So for TriZetto, keep in mind that, obviously, their primary revenue is software, so Q4 tends to be very, very strong for them. It is, by far, their strongest quarter of the year. I think when we talked about the acquisition previously, we mentioned that they were about a $720 million run rate, which is essentially where they landed for 2014, but a lot of that revenue is back ended. So think about them as, give or take, about a $720 million company growing mid-single digits, has been historically their growth rate. And that would let you back into what our guidance is. In terms of Health Net, I'll let Frank and Gordon talk a little bit more about the actual contract and what's happening there. But in terms of guidance, as we had talked about previously, we expect that we will get regulatory clearance by about the middle of the year. And so we do have baked into our full year guidance what the increase in the Health Net revenue would be from that point forward."

At a big-picture level, the -- if you recall the strategic rationale behind the TriZetto acquisition, was premised on the fact that the health care landscape is undergoing very strong significant structural shifts due to not just the reform law, but associated cost pressures, shifting responsibilities between payers and providers. And we think all of these things together create great growth opportunity for us. I think you saw some of that in the fourth quarter. I was very encouraged by the level of activity and dialogue that we saw in Q4 around the combined Cognizant, TriZetto proposition, with interest from clients and clients talking to us about the combined opportunities. So I think a great start to the combined relationship, and I expect to see increased momentum as we go into '15."

And building out foundational technology skills, I would say, follows a similar process to what Cognizant has historically done when it comes to building out new technology capability areas. So we have great partnerships and alliances with technology providers, very deep partnerships. We've got Cognizant Academy that recruits, trains, cross-trains across skills our teams on foundational technologies. But equally importantly, Ed, in -- what we find in the digital world is that it's not just about technology. To really make digital come alive, you have to bring together these cross-functional, multifunctional teams that include consultants, technologists, data scientists, designers and of course, folks who understand the client and the client context. And the skills like designers and data scientists are skills that we are both building organically internally but also recruiting heavily for in the marketplace. And also, as you've seen from some of the acquisitions that we did in 2014, we're also looking at inorganic ways to grow those capabilities. And I think you'll continue to see us pushing forward on all those fronts that I just mentioned as we go into '15 and we continue to build out the digital capabilities at Cognizant."

As we said in our prepared remarks, we remain quite confident of achieving our $1.5 billion of revenue synergies over the next 5 years. As we said when we did the acquisition, that is back-end loaded because the biggest piece of that comes from selling the integrated deals, and obviously, there's a long lead time on that. But also, as we said, we're actually seeing quite a bit of interest in that, so the pipeline is building. Going forward, you will not see us break out TriZetto revenue because what's TriZetto, what's Cognizant very quickly becomes blurred particularly when you think about services revenue and BPO revenue. So we are managing it as part of our Healthcare practice going forward. Obviously, we want to break it out as people understood what organic growth was for 2015. Revenue synergies for 2015, as we said when we did the deal, are certainly more modest than they'll be in future years and will be heavily weighted towards services work, which we -- even prior to the acquisition, we had the leading practice. And obviously, that's further strengthened now, and we certainly feel good about the pipeline there. 
On the operating margins, our target remains 19% to 20%. We have bounced above 20% a little bit. Each time we did that, we did reaffirm that we do not want to be above 20%. So certainly, our expectation is we would be in the 19% to 20% range for 2015, and our guidance assumes that.

Now obviously, we're focused on the synergy opportunities from an execution standpoint, and as Gordon said, those synergy opportunities in the short run are around the services business and the BPO business that we can generate together. But the core product, the TriZetto product set, that capability remains a separate unit run by the management team that came to us when we did the TriZetto acquisition, and they continue to execute against the product road map that they had laid out for their customers, and for -- now for our customers, before the acquisition. So we are keeping the platform very much as a stand-alone unit. We will continue to invest in it as we had in -- as the plan had been in the past. If anything, we feel like we might be able to accelerate some aspects of the product road map because of our development capability and so on and so forth. But we clearly recognize that the rhythm of a software business is different from the rhythm of a services business.

I don't think we're seeing budgets down overall. We are actually seeing sort of flat to modestly up budgets. So I think Gartner predicted -- or the Gartner's projection from January of this year was sort of 2.4%, 2.5% increase in budgets. That's sort of consistent with what we're seeing. Clearly, there is a shift going on within budgets, and I think that's really the more important trend to focus on. What we are seeing is that this dual mandate that we've been speaking about for so long is really playing out in budgets where, because overall budgets are, call it, flat to modestly up, the pressure that it creates for organizations is to really get more done with those essentially same budget dollars. And so what that means is that, on 1 side, clients continue to look for ways to drive greater degrees of efficiency and effectiveness, kind of what we call the run better side of the equation, so that they can invest those dollars in deploying new digital and other capabilities. That's sort of the run different side of the equation. Clearly, in Financial Services, regulatory compliance initiatives are consuming a significant amount of our clients' budgets. I think -- this is anecdotal -- I would say that the most intense period of that was probably last year. I think, as we go into '15, when I look at our financial services institutions, it's not to say that the regulatory compliance spend goes away, but I think it's -- I would say it's become more stable. I don't see it increasing as a percent of overall budgets. And so that's started to create a degree of stability within our financial services clients where I start to see more focus and attention being turned to digital initiatives and initiatives that I consider to be ones that will drive competitiveness and top line growth for Financial Services. So I actually am seeing a positive shift in Financial Services, more towards innovation and growth as regulatory compliance stabilizes and becomes a better and well  -- a more understood level of spending. I don't know, Gordon, if there's anything you want to add to that."

So in terms of the impact on overall margin percent, it's nominal. So it's really just about the revenue growth there. That's obviously on a non-GAAP basis. On a GAAP basis, because of all the acquisition amortization, obviously, that would be dilutive. But on a non-GAAP basis, think about it as being roughly in line with company average margin going forward. FX has a little bit of an impact on margin, but fairly nominal. It's mainly a revenue issue with the FX headwinds that we had both in Q4 and that we're forecasting as we move into 2015. In terms of the segment margin, obviously, we have done a lot of hiring in the last 6 months, and that obviously puts pressure on margin until those folks become fully billable. Utilization ticked down both in Q3 and Q4. We would expect for that to stabilize in 2015. As we've talked about, utilization will go up and down a little bit based on hiring and based on growth opportunities that we see in the company. But we would expect utilization to stabilize and margins to stabilize accordingly with that. And so then as we move into 2015, really nothing unusual. It really is about stabilizing utilization, integrating TriZetto, but as we said, that generally runs in line with company average, and continuing to ensure that we're driving for industry-leading growth."

Let me step -- start by saying that I think that, as I said in my prepared comments, one of the trends that I'm quite excited about is this notion of clients looking to us in various forms to create these large integrated deals that include apps, infrastructure and Business Process Services. And those -- and sometimes those -- like in the case of Health Net, those are relatively standalone. In other cases, we see migrating potentially to a shared industry utility type of model, which I think TriZetto and Health Net will enable going forward. After the announcement of the TriZetto acquisition, I would say that we've seen an increase in conversations with clients about the potential of those kinds of deals. I would characterize the pipeline of those deals as relatively early stage at this point. But certainly, an active set of conversation is going on right now with prospects around what those kinds of deal structures might look like. I would remind you that the Health Net deal, the sales cycle was probably in the order of -- Health Net had been a Cognizant client for 10 years -- close to 10 years, and the sales cycle on this particular transaction was close to 3 years. My hope is that when we look at the TriZetto opportunity that we're not looking at 3-year sale cycles, but I would still set the expectations that it's 18 to 20 months before we start to see those kinds of transactions. These are large complicated deals that involve a lot of structuring and a lot of groundwork with clients. But I think all of the elements are there. I feel very good about how we're positioned to do those deals, and I think that the Health Net transaction serves as somewhat of a beacon that others will emulate."

We had another great quarter and a solid start to 2015. Our first quarter revenue was $2.91 billion. This represented a sequential increase of 6.2% after a negative currency impact of 1.1%. Our sequential growth was well ahead of our previous guidance and was driven by strong organic growth in our core business coupled with solid in line performance in the TriZetto business. Non-GAAP operating margin was 19.80%, at the higher-end of our targeted range of 19% to 20%.
Based on our current visibility and strong sales pipeline, we are pleased to increase our full year revenue guidance to at least $12.24 billion and non-GAAP EPS guidance to $2.93, which reflects our strong overperformance during quarter 1.
Our results this quarter and our guidance for the full year are a clear reflection that we are well-positioned to serve the needs of our clients. As I've said in the past, we are in the midst of a once-in-a-decade shift in the technology landscape, which is creating significant opportunities for services firms that have the right portfolio. Our results demonstrate that our strategy, investments and solutions are strongly aligned with the evolving market demand. Today, more than ever, our client are grappling with the dual mandate and our run better run different value proposition is resonating well with them.
On one side of the dual mandate, the shift towards digital is front and center for our clients. Our digital offerings are seeing strong traction in the market. In addition, as clients deploy digital technologies, it's creating demand for our traditional services in areas such as legacy modernization and integration. Gordon will give you examples of some of our leading-edge digital work in a few moments.
On the other side of the dual mandate, clients continue to drive down costs in their core operations. We see this manifested in 2 ways. First, clients are adopting our traditional service offerings more broadly and driving demand for integrated multiservice deals. And second, we're seeing clients exploring new frontiers of cost and operating efficiency through new as a service utility models.
As we saw this scenario unfold over the past few years, we embedded in the company a systematic capability in the form of our Three Horizon model to rapidly identify changing market demands and capitalize on them. As a result, we now have a solid comprehensive portfolio of services for the current needs of our as well as a robust mechanism to ensure that we have the organizational agility to make the right investments to remain relevant to clients going forward.
On the digital front, our differentiated approach that we call digital works have seen great traction and recent digital acquisitions like Cadient, Odecee and itaas have helped to round out our digital services and geographic footprint.
Beyond digital, we have a number of other high-growth businesses. Our investment over the past several years in business process, infrastructure and consulting services has paid off, and these practices continue to be solid drivers of growth. Each of these practices has the potential to be a multibillion-dollar revenue source for the company. This quarter, I'm particularly pleased with the growth of Infrastructure services, which crossed the $1 billion annual run rate mark.
And finally, I'm very excited about our portfolio of as a service utility offerings that we've built through acquisitions like TriZetto and Source Net, client transactions like Health Net and our own organic efforts with client such as TransCelerate. 
Let me spend the next few minutes providing more detail around the key trends that we see shaping demand. I'll then turn it over to Gordon to provide deeper insights on what we see across our business segments and to Karen for details on the financials.
The first key trend shaping demand is a shift towards digital, which is a priority for our clients because it's a priority for their customers. Having worked with clients on hundreds of digital projects, it's very clear to us that winning in the new digital era requires a new engagement model. Clients need a partner who can bring new capabilities in design, data science and digital technology in addition to a deep understanding of a clients business, operating model and technology landscape. Clients recognize that they often do not have in-house capabilities in all these areas and are looking to deepen relationships with partners who have invested for the digital landscape.
Furthermore, what's interesting and important to note is that the shift to a digital enterprise is in turn driving demand for our traditional services. No digital transformation is complete without integration with the enterprise as legacy systems and business process. Existing IT infrastructure, systems and applications and business processes often need to be retooled to accommodate the explosion of users, data, devices and sensors that often accompany digital deployments. Clients continue to look for new ways to drive down the cost of operations in their core business in order to remain competitive and to fund their digital transformation. As I mentioned, we are seeing clients broadening and deepening their use of our services often through multiservice solutions. In these situations, our broad portfolio of services is critical to provide a comprehensive solution to a client.
We're also pushing beyond traditional delivery models in creating as a service utility -- industry utilities that provide clients a low-cost high-efficiency shared capability and variable cost structure. By bringing together applications, cloud and Business Process Services to create industry utilities, we're helping clients by distributing high fixed cost across multiple customers in an industry.
These are clearly exciting times in our industry and we believe that Cognizant is well positioned to be the partner client who will turn to in transforming their businesses.
With that, I'll turn it over to Gordon, and I'll be back to take your questions. Gordon?"

Before I provide more detail on our industry services and geographic segments, let me offer some color on how the shift to a digital enterprise is driving greater demand for our traditional services and is, in many cases, changing how we deliver these services. 
Clients are reconsidering how they manage their traditional investments in technology and business processes as they are keen to drive higher levels of efficiencies and fund their transition to digital enterprises. Often, this is manifested in integrated multiservice line deals. As Francisco said, we're seeing a stepped up demand for new business models such as, as a service utility or platform based models, which help clients create variable cost structures, enhance efficiency and drive agility and time-to-market.
Let me explain this a bit further with some recent examples. Integrated multiservice solutions typically include a combination of consulting, IT Services, BPO services and infrastructure services to drive higher levels of efficiency, agility and innovation. We recently entered into a strategic partnership with CNO Financial Group to transform its IT capabilities for its current subsidiaries, enhancing agent and customer experience. These subsidiaries include well-known brands like Bankers Life, Colonial Penn and Washington National. This deal encompasses multiple IT functions, spanning applications maintenance, application development, testing and select IT Infrastructure Services. In addition to delivering annual expense savings to CNO, this partnership will innovatively help CNO Financial to better compete in the underserved Middle Market.
Another example is how we are combining our Finance and Accounting automation and enterprise analytic capabilities for Truck Insurance, a leading insurer in the Nordics, to drive end to end and accountability for data compliance as well as financial reporting, thus improving risk assessments and governance.
Lastly, as Francisco mentioned, we are increasingly bringing together applications, infrastructure and business processes to create industry utilities benefiting people customers in an industry. This approach of helping clients from setting strategy to transforming business operations to managing technology needs is helping us establish even greater mindshare and market leadership.
Let me now move to a detailed commentary of our individual industry practices. Our Banking and Financial Services segment grew 3.6% sequentially and 13.4% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued strong growth in our insurance practice. Within banking, clients remained focused on cost optimization and vendor consolidation, regulatory compliance and cyber security. In addition, there's an increase focus on newer technologies and digital and automation, particularly in areas to improvement customer experience and drive digital and customer self-service.
An example of our work in digital is the program for investments in India. We're helping this client to digitally transform its entire vehicle finance business by reengineering business processes, digitizing workflows and developing multichannel applications to drive real-time decision-making, improve customer experience and enhance operational efficiencies.
And for a leading bank in the U.S., we're helping build the branch of the future, by providing seamless multichannel integration and in lobby digital applications, so we can provide customers with compelling, real-time, personalized experience.
Our Healthcare segment, which consists primarily of our payer, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, grew 13.8% sequentially and 42.7% year-over-year, including the impact of TriZetto. 
Our payer clients continue to take a cautious approach to spending. Cost optimization is still a key driver, while clients are also looking to leverage analytics to drive profitability and improve customer retention. The payer sector is undergoing fundamental changes, driven by changing regulatory environment, increasing focus on medical cost and the consumerization of health care. We believe these changes create longer-term opportunities that we are well-positioned to capture.
The integration of TriZetto is on track and our combined offerings are clearly resonating with clients. We've moved aggressively to increase staffing. We've added 500 consultants who are either already deployed or trained and ready to deploy to assist in driving revenue synergies. In addition, we've added 300 people to our global delivery centers to accelerate product development on TriZetto platforms.
This action is already paying off. In the first quarter alone, we were selected for synergy deals with a total contract value of $200 million, with a number of additional deals in our pipeline. We are in active discussions with a number of payers about integrated solutions, leveraging TriZetto platforms and our service capabilities. As you can see, we are well on our way to generating the $1.5 billion of revenue synergies that we spoke about at the time of acquisition.
Moving onto our pharmaceutical business, we continue to see a trend towards multiservice deals across infrastructure and IT services, leveraging cloud technologies and platforms. Additionally, we are seeing steady demand driven by vendor consolidation and cost optimization across many existing and new clients.
We're quite pleased with the traction we're seeing from our acquisition of Cadient, where we've added 9 new logos since closing the acquisition late last year.
Recently, Otsuka Pharmaceutical, a U.S. Pharmaceutical research and development company, publicly highlighted a work Cadient delivered in helping it to develop and deploy a highly innovative approach to communicating with clinical trial investigators using iPads and large-format touchscreen technology. Additionally, we are proud that Cadient recently won a prestigious life sciences industry marketing award that is further validation of the value we are providing to clients.
Our retail and manufacturing segment was up 2.7% sequentially and 7.2% year-over-year. We are seeing early signs of improved demand following a soft 2014, particularly in areas of modernizing supply chains as well as digital and e-commerce engagements.
For large retail in Southeast Asia, we're implementing a digital e-commerce platform to deliver seamless omnichannel shopping experience for their customers. This will allow more efficient retail management and a better understanding of customer preferences and purchasing history.
And for many other retailers around the world, we're helping them exceed customer expectations with the latest digital technologies. For example, we're partnering with a major U.S. clothing manufacturer to redesign their stores. We're helping a prominent retailer in the Asia Pacific to provide a seamless multichannel shopping experience. And we're supporting a leading U.S. discount retailer in using the cloud to deliver superior services at its 8,000 stores.
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech, communications and information media and entertainment clients was up 2.6% sequentially and 19% year-over-year, driven primarily by improved discretionary spending at our high-tech clients. Partnering with Google, we're helping a major workforce solutions and servicing company reengineer how they approach, search and match talent against demand, creating a new paradigm around finding the right candidate. As transactions increasingly become video-enabled, we're seeing strong demand for services provided through our itaas acquisition with our communications and media and entertainment clients, as well as a growing demand among clients in other industries such as banking and retail.
Let me now turn to our Horizon 2 service lines. We continue to be pleased with the market traction we are realizing here. Our Business Process Services or BPS practice saw continued success during the quarter, largely on the ramp-up of a number of wins in prior quarters across financial services, insurance and healthcare. BPS is a critical component in bringing operational efficiencies to our clients. Increasingly, this is delivered through solutions leveraging technology and robotic automation.
Through the acquisition of TriZetto, we gained a strong robotic automation platform with artificial intelligence and machine learning capability. This platform is now part of our suite of automation platforms within our robotics process automation practice. This practice focuses on automating both technology and business processes where physical labor is replaced with digital labor. The business outcomes includes faster processing times with fewer errors, virtually unlimited scalability and lower cost of ownership, along with the ability to make more timely business decisions through automated enabled -- automation-enabled analytics.
Let me give you an example. We use this platform to help a major U.S. healthcare payer in their claims processing organization. The client was initially expecting a 6-month project to clear claims backlogs primarily by using additional people for processing. We were able to implement a robotic process automation solution in 6 weeks and clear the backlog in just 1 additional week.
Cognizant infrastructure services had another strong quarter. Clients are looking for solutions which drive simplifications and predictable operations to accelerate their IT transformation. Increasingly, this has been delivered through multiservice solutions, often combining applications and infrastructure as well as the use of newer technologies such as our hybrid cloud and mobility solutions.
Cognizant was recently named a top IT infrastructure transformation consulting provider by Canidae Consulting Research and Advisory. The report highlighted our strong capabilities in IT infrastructure transformation strategy and roadmap development, advisory services across data center and storage transformation, workplace transformation, business continuity and death [ph] disaster recovery and IT infrastructure security. 
Cognizant Business Consulting, or CBC, continues to take a lead role in many of our transformation deals, helping architected deals and drive change management in our clients' businesses. As we mentioned last quarter, over 60% of CBC's pipeline has a digital component. For example, we're helping a major U.S. hotel and casino operator utilize Big Data and analytics to speed up and improve decision-making across all aspects of their business.
From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 7.4% sequentially and 24.8% year-over-year. Our European operations recorded strong growth when viewed from a local currency perspective. As you know, the European currencies have declined significantly against the U.S. dollar during the first quarter. Revenue from Europe was up 0.2% compared to the fourth quarter after a 4.8% negative currency impact.
Continental Europe declined 2.9% sequentially after a 6.3% negative currency impact. We expect solid growth in the continent over the coming years as we increasingly benefit from the structural shift towards larger multiyear outsourcing programs. 
Finally, we saw good traction in the rest of the world, which was up 7.6% sequentially after a 2.8% negative currency impact. Growth was driven primarily by strength in key markets such as India and the Middle East.
We are pleased with the strength of our performance across industries, service lines and the geographies we serve. With that, let me ask Karen to provide more color on the financial details of the strong performance."

First quarter revenue of $2.91 billion represented growth of 6.2% sequentially and 20.2% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, we had a $30 million negative currency headwind, which impacted revenue growth by 110 basis points.
Non-GAAP operating margin which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses was 19.8%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.71 exceeded guidance by $0.02. 
Consulting and technology services and Outsourcing Services represented 56% and 44% of revenue, respectively, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 10% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. Outsourcing Services were up 1% sequentially and grew 8% from Q1 a year ago.
During the first quarter, 36% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts and, as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 7 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 278.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 400,000 shares for a total cost of approximately $25 million. To date, we have repurchased approximately 35.6 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.2 billion under our share repurchase authorization of $2 billion and have approximately $789 million remaining unutilized. Our fully diluted share count increased slightly to 613.9 million shares during the quarter.
Total receivables were $2.1 billion at the end of the quarter and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 73 days. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $388 million, up from $325 million at the end of Q4. We billed approximately 51% of the Q1 unbilled balance in April. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables.
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.35 billion of cash and short-term investments, down by approximately $425 million from the quarter ending December 31, and down by approximately $515 million from the year-ago period. Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter, including approximately $100 million outstanding on our revolver.
Financing activities were approximately a $557 million use of cash during the quarter, with almost all of this going to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Operating activities generated approximately $189 million and capital expenditures were approximately $58 million during the quarter.
Let me now provide some color on our business and operating metrics. During the quarter, we added approximately 6,200 employees and we ended the quarter with approximately 217,700 employees globally. Approximately 204,000 of our employees are service delivery staff. Annualized attrition of 14% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, improved by 10 basis points year-over-year. Utilization was essentially flat on a sequential basis. Offshore utilization was approximately 70%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was approximately 7% and on-site utilization was approximately 92% during the quarter.
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q2 and for the rest of the year. As Frank mentioned, we are increasing our full year revenue and our non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect the stronger performance during quarter 1. Therefore, we are revising our full year guidance to at least $12.24 billion, representing revenue growth of at least 19.3% over 2014. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing guidance and does not include additional potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year.
For the second quarter of 2015, we expect to deliver revenue of at least $3.01 billion.
During the second quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%.
For Q2, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.72. Non-GAAP EPS excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613.5 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.6%.
We are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.2 to at least $2.93. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.4%.

It's a fully integrated companywide approach to helping clients with digital transformation. And on top of that, as the trend towards digital picks up momentum, it's driving demand for our core traditional services, which is, in turn, fueling growth again for us. And it's very important that we are able and I think the driver of demand for us that we are able to offer that to the clients end to end ability to zero transformation and then pick up the deman on the other side with the traditional legacy modernization. So I think it's strong performance in digital. We feel like we've got a great position in the industry that we serve.

We talked to you a quarter or 2 ago about these 3 large deals that will all be in the outsourcing space, including Health Net, that will start to ramp up. But I think what's important here also is to understand the underlying trend of what's going on. As we -- as clients go through this big investment cycle around digital and start to focus a lot of energy and attention on implementing new digital capabilities in their organizations, there's an actual shift a little bit away from doing what I consider to be the more discretionary aspects of maintenance work. So you're not going to invest substantially in supporting or enhancing rather an existing application if it's going to be replaced or supplanted by a new digital capability. And so you're going to see a little bit of that, I would suspect, as we go through this which may manifest itself in a little bit more lumpiness in discretionary versus outsourcing in the coming quarters. I think it's important to understand what's driving that. In the net, I view it as a very positive thing, because it's estimate that we are winning in digital, we're helping our clients transform their businesses, clients may be investing a little bit less than that and maintaining more enhancing existing systems and that's okay because we're picking it up on the digital side."

I think, put it into 3 buckets, input-based pricing, output-based pricing and outcome-based pricing. Clearly, clients are comfortable on the shift from input to output-based, so moving to fixed price to managed services and so forth. What quite intriguing is as clients are now starting to thinking about outcome-based pricing. We did this in a large healthcare deal that we announced where the client is going to pay per member per month, irregardless of what are the volumes involved in supporting those clients. We think that is the way to future and particularly these end to end solutions that we're talking about, where we provide everything from the applications to the infrastructure through the Business Process Services. So it's taking Software-as-a-Service one step further and actually providing the transaction services around it. In the end, there will be a continuum. Some people will still want on premise custom applications and we'll continue to do that in our traditional business. Some clients will want a SaaS model, clearly TriZetto supports that. Some will want a full end to end solutions, we'll have that through the Health Net platform as well as the TriZetto platform. So we're feeling quite good about how the migration is happening across these spectrums of ways to engage. Pricing on the end-to-end solution and SaaS, obviously there are scale efficiencies there. So when you first start out with the new offering, until you gain scale, even if your pricing is fine, there'll be some pressure on margin, and that's normal, that's exactly the way that should work where you're making that upfront investment. But then as you gain scale, we feel pretty good about it. So overall, as Karen mentioned, pricing is stable, which is in this environment I think is good. Clients are focused far less on the rate card, much more on what's the cost of ownership. So if we can demonstrate best-in-class delivery, constantly lowering the cost of ownership through productivity through automation, clients are very happy. And I think that's one of the reasons on the traditional side of the business we continue to do quite well."

Let me try and take a stab at it. I think, usually what you'll see is clients looking at -- a typical client scenario is that they would have of a larger client, that they would have 4, 5 sizable scale players working for them and then a very long tail of smaller providers that are each individually relatively small, but collectively make up a significant amount of the client's spend. And so what we typically see is client saying from that we'll go down to maybe 3, sometimes 2 suppliers and importantly, of the big ones and then importantly, we'll cut the tail substantially. And so there's a lot of emphasis across our clients on consolidating what's been called a long tail of suppliers, the smaller suppliers that have an ecosystem of the client. I would say and that sometimes and obviously there's an economic component of this, which is clients looking at better total cost of ownership. And I think that's important because very often, we get confused between the pricing versus the total cost of ownership but clients really are realizing that this is a total cost of ownership game. Very often when we see these vendor consolidation kinds of conversations with clients, they are accompanied with conversations about moves to managed services. And that's I would say a very, very common theme. So it's not just a pure we'll give you more volume and reduce price in some way, shape or form. The clients recognize that we need to have levers like move to Managed Services, which allows us to drive greater productivity across the greater volume and therefore protect our margin and improve our service quality for them. And then the last thing I would say, Ed, is that it's not just a question of volume and price, there are other considerations that clients look at, particularly around things like security and the idea that dealing with a smaller number of players allows them to manage the security environment a little bit more tightly so that they have less exposure from that standpoint."

So it's sort of end to end from being able to understand what your customers' customer is looking for, all the way through creating a digital capability, that end to end process has to be agile in the broader sense of the word agile, which is that you got to be able to do rapid iteration, you've got to be able to very quickly bring new functionality to market. You've got to have the ability to test that in real time and make sure that it's meeting the needs of the client and if not, backtrack out of that to be able to change course. All of that have to happen in very short cycle. That requires the traditional agile development. It requires a new approach to the processes we use for development and testing.

We had another great quarter and a solid start to 2015. Our first quarter revenues were $2.91 billion. This represented a sequential increase of 6.2% after a negative currency impact of 1.1%. Our sequential growth was well ahead of our previous guidance and was driven by strong organic growth in our core business, coupled with solid in line performance in the TriZetto business. Non-GAAP operating margin was 19.8%, at the higher end of our targeted range of 19% to 20%.
Based on our current visibility and strong sales pipeline, we're pleased to increase our full year revenue guidance to at least $12.24 billion and non-GAAP EPS guidance to $2.93, which reflects our strong overperformance during quarter 1.
Our results this quarter and our guidance for the full year are a clear reflection that we are well positioned to serve the needs of our clients. As I've said in the past, we are in the midst of a once-in-a-decade shift in the technology landscape, which is creating significant opportunities for services firms that have the right portfolio. Our results demonstrate that our strategy, investments and solutions are strongly aligned with the evolving market demand. Today, more than ever, our clients are grappling with the dual mandate, and our run better, run different value proposition is resonating well with them.
On one side of the dual mandate, the shift towards digital is front and center for our clients. Our digital offerings are seeing strong traction in the market. In addition, as clients deploy digital technologies, it's creating demand for our traditional services in areas such as legacy modernization and integration. Gordon will give you examples of some of our leading-edge digital work in a few moments.
On the other side of the dual mandate, clients continue to drive down costs in their core operations. We see this manifested in 2 ways: first, clients are adopting our traditional service offerings more broadly and driving demand for integrated multiservice deals; and second, we're seeing clients exploring new frontiers of cost and operating efficiency through new as-a-service utility models.
As we saw this scenario unfold over the past few years, we embedded in the company a systematic capability in the form of our Three Horizon model to rapidly identify changing market demands and capitalize on them. As a result, we now have a solid comprehensive portfolio of services for the current needs of our clients as well as a robust mechanism to ensure that we have the organizational agility to make the right investments to remain relevant to clients going forward.
On the digital front, our differentiated approach that we call Digital Works has seen great traction, and recent digital acquisitions like Cadient, Odecee and itaas have helped to round out our digital services and geographic footprint.
Beyond digital, we have a number of other high-growth businesses. Our investment over the past several years in business process, infrastructure and consulting services has paid off, and these practices continue to be solid drivers of growth. Each of these practices has the potential to be a multibillion-dollar revenue source for the company. This quarter, I'm particularly pleased with the growth of Infrastructure Services, which crossed the $1 billion annual run rate mark.
And finally, I'm very excited about our portfolio of as-a-service utility offerings that we've built through acquisitions like TriZetto and SourceNet, client transactions like Health Net and our own organic efforts with clients such as TransCelerate. 
Let me spend the next few minutes providing more detail around the key trends that we see shaping demand. I'll then turn it over to Gordon to provide deeper insights on what we see across our business segments and to Karen for details on the financials.
The first key trend shaping demand is a shift towards digital, which is a priority for our clients because it's a priority for their customers. Having worked with clients on hundreds of digital projects, it's very clear to us that winning in the new digital era requires a new engagement model. Clients need a partner who can bring new capabilities in design, data science and digital technology in addition to a deep understanding of a client's business, operating model and technology landscape. Clients recognize that they often do not have in-house capabilities in all these areas and are looking to deepen relationships with partners who have invested for the digital landscape. 
Furthermore, what's interesting and important to note is that the shift to a digital enterprise is in turn driving demand for our traditional services. No digital transformation is complete without integration with the enterprise as legacy systems and business processes. Existing IT infrastructure, systems and applications and business processes often need to be retooled to accommodate the explosion of users, data, devices and sensors that often accompany digital deployments. Clients continue to look for new ways to drive down the cost of operations in their core business in order to remain competitive and to fund their digital transformation. As I mentioned, we're seeing clients broadening and deepening their use of our services often through multiservice solutions. In these situations, our broad portfolio of services is critical to provide a comprehensive solution to a client.
We're also pushing beyond traditional delivery models in creating as-a-service utility -- industry utilities that provide clients a low-cost, high-efficiency shared capability and variable cost structure. By bringing together applications, cloud and Business Process Services to create industry utilities, we're helping clients by distributing high fixed costs across multiple customers in an industry.
These are clearly exciting times in our industry, and we believe that Cognizant is well positioned to be the partner clients will turn to in transforming their businesses.
With that, I'll turn it over to Gordon, and I'll be back to take your questions. Gordon?"
386024,290802367,802494,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 04, 2015",2015-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation","Executives","Good morning, Francisco, and thank you. Before I provide more detail on our industry services and geographic segments, let me offer some color on how the shift to a digital enterprise is driving greater demand for our traditional services and is, in many",1677,"Good morning, Francisco, and thank you. Before I provide more detail on our industry services and geographic segments, let me offer some color on how the shift to a digital enterprise is driving greater demand for our traditional services and is, in many cases, changing how we deliver these services. 
Clients are reconsidering how they manage their traditional investments in technology and business processes as they are keen to drive higher levels of efficiencies and fund their transition to digital enterprises. Often, this is manifested in integrated multiservice line deals. As Francisco said, we're seeing a stepped-up demand for new business models such as, as-a-service utility or platform-based models, which help clients create variable cost structures, enhance efficiency and drive agility and time-to-market.
Let me explain this a bit further with some recent examples. Integrated multiservice solutions typically include a combination of consulting, IT Services, BPO services and infrastructure services to drive higher levels of efficiency, agility and innovation. We recently entered into a strategic partnership with CNO Financial Group to transform its IT capabilities for its insurance subsidiaries, enhancing agent and customer experience. These subsidiaries include well-known brands like Bankers Life, Colonial Penn and Washington National. This deal encompasses multiple IT functions spanning applications maintenance, application development, testing and select IT Infrastructure Services. In addition to delivering annual expense savings to CNO, this partnership will innovatively help CNO Financial to better compete in the underserved middle market.
Another example is how we're combining our finance and accounting automation and enterprise analytic capabilities for Truck Insurance, a leading insurer in the Nordics, to drive end-to-end accountability for data compliance as well as financial reporting, thus improving risk assessments and governance.
Lastly, as Francisco mentioned, we are increasingly bringing together applications, infrastructure and business processes to create industry utilities benefiting multiple customers in an industry. This approach of helping clients from setting strategy to transforming business operations to managing technology needs is helping us establish even greater mind share and market leadership.
Let me now move to a detailed commentary of our individual industry practices. Our Banking and Financial Services segment grew 3.6% sequentially and 13.4% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued strong growth in our insurance practice. Within Banking, clients remained focused on cost optimization and vendor consolidation, regulatory compliance and cyber security. In addition, there's an increased focus on newer technologies in digital and automation, particularly in areas to improve customer experience and drive digital customer self-service. An example of our work in digital is the program for Chola Investments in India. We're helping this client to digitally transform its entire vehicle finance business by reengineering business processes, digitizing workflows and developing multi-channel applications to drive real-time decision-making, improve customer experience and enhance operational efficiencies.
And for a leading bank in the U.S., we're helping build the branch of the future by providing a seamless multi-channel integration and in-lobby digital applications so we can provide customers with a compelling, real-time, personalized experience.
Our Healthcare segment, which consists primarily of our payer, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, grew 13.8% sequentially and 42.7% year-over-year, including the impact of TriZetto. Our payer clients continue to take a cautious approach to spending. Cost optimization is still a key driver, while clients are also looking to leverage analytics to drive profitability and improve customer retention. The payer sector is undergoing fundamental changes, driven by changing regulatory environment, increasing focus on medical costs and the consumerization of health care. We believe these changes create longer-term opportunities that we are well positioned to capture.
The integration of TriZetto is on track, and our combined offerings are clearly resonating with clients. We've moved aggressively to increase staffing. We've added 500 consultants who are either already deployed or trained and ready to deploy to assist in driving revenue synergies. In addition, we've added 300 people to our global delivery centers to accelerate product development on TriZetto platforms.
This action is already paying off. In the first quarter alone, we were selected for synergy deals with a total contract value of $200 million with a number of additional deals in our pipeline. We are in active discussions with a number of payers about integrated solutions, leveraging TriZetto's platforms and our service capabilities. As you can see, we're well on our way to generating the $1.5 billion of revenue synergies that we spoke about at the time of acquisition.
Moving on to our pharmaceutical business. We continue to see a trend towards multiservice deals across infrastructure and IT services leveraging cloud technologies and platforms. Additionally, we're seeing steady demand driven by vendor consolidation and cost optimization across many existing and new clients. We're quite pleased with the traction we're seeing from our acquisition of Cadient, where we've added 9 new logos since closing the acquisition late last year.
Recently, Otsuka Pharmaceutical, a U.S. pharmaceutical research and development company, publicly highlighted the work Cadient delivered in helping it to develop and deploy a highly innovative approach to communicating with clinical trial investigators using iPads and large-format touchscreen technology. Additionally, we're proud that Cadient recently won a prestigious life sciences industry marketing award that is further validation of the value we're providing to clients.
Our retail and manufacturing segment was up 2.7% sequentially and 7.2% year-over-year. We are seeing early signs of improved demand following a soft 2014, particularly in areas of modernizing supply chains as well as digital and e-commerce engagements. For large retail in Southeast Asia, we're implementing a digital e-commerce platform to deliver a seamless omnichannel shopping experience for their customers. This will allow more efficient retail management and a better understanding of customer preferences and purchasing history.
And for many other retailers around the world, we're helping them exceed customer expectations with the latest digital technologies. For example, we're partnering with a major U.S. clothing manufacturer to redesign their stores. We're helping a prominent retailer in Asia Pacific to provide a seamless multichannel shopping experience. And we're supporting a leading U.S. discount retailer in using the cloud to deliver superior services at its 8,000 stores.
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech, communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 2.6% sequentially and 19% year-over-year, driven primarily by improved discretionary spending at our high-tech clients. Partnering with Google, we're helping a major workforce solutions and servicing company reengineer how they approach, search and match talent against demand, creating a new paradigm around finding the right candidate. As transactions increasingly become video-enabled, we're seeing strong demand for services provided through our itaas acquisition with our communications and media and entertainment clients as well as a growing demand among clients in other industries, such as banking and retail.
Let me now turn to our Horizon 2 service lines. We continue to be pleased with the market traction we're realizing here. Our Business Process Services, or BPS practice, saw continued success during the quarter, largely on the ramp-up of a number of wins in prior quarters across financial services, insurance and health care. BPS is a critical component in bringing operational efficiencies to our clients. Increasingly, this is delivered through solutions leveraging technology and robotic automation.
Through the acquisition of TriZetto, we gained a strong robotic automation platform with artificial intelligence and machine learning capability. This platform is now part of our suite of automation platforms within our robotics process automation practice. This practice focuses on automating both technology and business processes, where physical labor is replaced with digital labor. The business outcomes include faster processing times with fewer errors, virtually unlimited scalability and lower cost of ownership, along with the ability to make more timely business decisions through automated enabled -- automation-enabled analytics. Let me give you an example. We use this platform to help a major U.S. health care payer in their claims processing organization. The client was initially expecting a 6-month project to clear claims backlogs, primarily by using additional people for processing. We were able to implement a robotic process automation solution in 6 weeks and cleared the backlog in just 1 additional week.
Cognizant Infrastructure Services had another strong quarter. Clients are looking for solutions, which drive simplification and predictable operations to accelerate their IT transformation. Increasingly, this is being delivered through multiservice solutions, often combining applications and infrastructure, as well as the use of newer technologies, such as our hybrid cloud and mobility solutions.
Cognizant was recently named a Top IT Infrastructure Transformation Consulting Provider by Kennedy Consulting Research and Advisory. The report highlighted our strong capabilities in IT infrastructure transformation strategy and roadmap development, advisory services across data center and storage transformation, workplace transformation, business continuity and disaster recovery and IT infrastructure security. 
Cognizant Business Consulting, or CBC, continues to take a lead role in many of our transformation deals, helping architect the deals and drive change management in our clients' businesses. As we mentioned last quarter, over 60% of CBC's pipeline has a digital component. For example, we're helping a major U.S. hotel and casino operator utilize big data and analytics to speed up and improve decision-making across all aspects of their business.
From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 7.4% sequentially and 24.8% year-over-year. Our European operations recorded strong growth when viewed from a local currency perspective. As you know, the European currencies have declined significantly against the U.S. dollar during the first quarter. Revenue from Europe was up 0.2% compared to the fourth quarter after a 4.8% negative currency impact. Continental Europe declined 2.9% sequentially after a 6.3% negative currency impact. We expect solid growth in the continent over the coming years as we increasingly benefit from the structural shift towards larger, multi-year outsourcing programs. 
Finally, we saw good traction in the rest of the world, which was up 7.6% sequentially after a 2.8% negative currency impact. Growth was driven primarily by strength in key markets, such as India and the Middle East.
We're pleased with the strength of our performance across industries, service lines and the geographies we serve. 
With that, let me ask Karen to provide more color on the financial details of the strong performance."

First quarter revenue of $2.91 billion represented growth of 6.2% sequentially and 20.2% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, we had a $30 million negative currency headwind, which impacted revenue growth by 110 basis points.
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.8%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.71 exceeded guidance by $0.02. 
Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 56% and 44% of revenue, respectively, for the quarter. consulting and technology services increased 10% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. Outsourcing services were up 1% sequentially and grew 8% from Q1 a year ago.
During the first quarter, 36% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 7 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 278.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 400,000 shares for a total cost of approximately $25 million. To date, we have repurchased approximately 35.6 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.2 billion under our share repurchase authorization of $2 billion and have approximately $789 million remaining unutilized. Our fully diluted share count increased slightly to 613.9 million shares during the quarter.
Total receivables were $2.1 billion at the end of the quarter, and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 73 days. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $388 million, up from $325 million at the end of Q4. We billed approximately 51% of the Q1 unbilled balance in April. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables.
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.35 billion of cash and short-term investments, down by approximately $425 million from the quarter ending December 31, and down by approximately $515 million from the year-ago period. Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter, including approximately $100 million outstanding on our revolver.
Financing activities were approximately a $557 million use of cash during the quarter, with almost all of this going to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Operating activities generated approximately $189 million, and capital expenditures were approximately $58 million during the quarter.
Let me now provide some color on our business and operating metrics. During the quarter, we added approximately 6,200 employees, and we ended the quarter with approximately 217,700 employees globally. Approximately 204,000 of our employees are service delivery staff. Annualized attrition of 14% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, improved by 10 basis points year-over-year. Utilization was essentially flat on a sequential basis. Offshore utilization was approximately 70%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was approximately 76%. And on-site utilization was approximately 92% during the quarter.
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q2 and for the rest of the year. As Frank mentioned, we are increasing our full year revenue and our non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect the strong performance during quarter 1. Therefore, we are revising our full year guidance to at least $12.24 billion, representing revenue growth of at least 19.3% over 2014. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing guidance and does not include additional potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. 
For the second quarter of 2015, we expect to deliver revenue of at least $3.01 billion. During the second quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%.
For Q2, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.72. Non-GAAP EPS excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613.5 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.6%.
We are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.2 to at least $2.93. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.4%.

We talked to you 1 quarter or 2 ago about these 3 large deals that will all be in the outsourcing space, including Health Net, and that will start to ramp up. But I think what's important here also is to understand the underlying trend of what's going on. As we -- as clients go through this big investment cycle around digital and start to focus a lot of energy and attention on implementing new digital capabilities in their organizations, there's a natural shift a little bit away from doing what I consider to be the more discretionary aspects of maintenance work. So you're not going to invest substantially in supporting or enhancing rather an existing application if it's going to be replaced or supplanted by a new digital capability. And so you're going to see a little bit of that, I would suspect, as we go through this, which may manifest itself in a little bit more lumpiness in discretionary versus outsourcing in the coming quarters. I think it's important to understand what's driving that. In the Net, I view it as a very positive thing because it says to me that we're winning in digital. We're helping our clients transform their businesses. Clients may be investing a little bit less than that and maintaining or enhancing existing systems, and that's okay because we're picking it up on the digital side."

I think put it into 3 buckets: input-based pricing, output-based pricing and outcome-based pricing. Clearly, clients are comfortable on the shift from input- to output-based, so moving to fixed price to managed services and so forth. What we're finding quite intriguing is as clients are now starting to think about outcome-based pricing. We did this in the large health care deal that we announced, where the client's going to pay per member per month irregardless of what are the volumes involved in supporting those clients. We think that is the way the future and particularly, these end-to end solutions that we're talking about where we provide everything from the applications to the infrastructure, to the Business Process Services. So it's taking Software as a Service one step further and actually providing the transaction services around it. In the end, there'll be a continuum. Some people will still want on-premise custom applications, and we'll continue to do that in our traditional business. Some clients will want a SaaS model. Clearly, TriZetto supports that. Some will want a full end-to-end solution. We'll have that through the Health Net platform as well as the TriZetto platform. So we're feeling quite good about how the migration is happening across this spectrums of ways to engage. Pricing on the end-to-end solutions and SaaS. Obviously, there are scale efficiencies there. So when you first start out with the new offering, until you gain scale, even if your pricing is fine, you'll -- there'll be some pressure on margin, and that's normal. That's exactly the way that should work, where you're making that upfront investment. But then as you gain scale, we feel pretty good about it. So overall, as Karen mentioned, pricing is stable, which is in this environment, I think, is good. Clients are focused far less on the rate card, much more on what is the cost of ownership. So if we can demonstrate best-in-class delivery, constantly lowering the cost of ownership through productivity, through automation, clients are very happy. And I think that's one of the reasons, on the traditional side of the business, we continue to do quite well."

Let me try and take a stab at it. I think, usually, what you'll see is clients looking at -- a typical client scenario is that they would have, of a larger client, is they'd have 4, 5 sizable scale players working for them and then a very long tail of smaller providers that are each individually relatively small, but collectively make up a significant amount of the client's spend. And so what we typically see is clients saying from that, we'll go down to maybe 3, sometimes 2 suppliers and importantly -- of the big ones. And then importantly, we'll cut the tail substantially. And so there's a lot of emphasis across our clients on consolidating what's been called a long tail of suppliers or the smaller suppliers that have an ecosystem with the client. I would say that sometimes -- and obviously, there's an economic component of this, which is clients looking at better total cost of ownership. And I think that's important because very often, we get confused between the pricing versus the total cost of ownership. But clients really are realizing that this is a total cost of ownership game. Very often, when we see these vendor consolidation kinds of conversations with clients, they are accompanied with conversations about moves to managed services. And that's, I would say, a very, very common theme. So it's not just a pure we'll give you more volume and reduce price in some way, shape or form. The clients recognize that we need to have levers like the move to managed services, which allows us to drive greater productivity across a greater volume and therefore, protect our margin and improve our service quality for them. And then the last thing I would say, Ed, is that it's not just a question of volume and price. There are other considerations that clients look at, particularly around things like security and the idea that dealing with a smaller number of players allows them to manage the security environment a little bit more tightly so that they have less exposure from that standpoint."

As I said in my prepared comments, as we've done hundreds of digital projects at this point, it's very clear to us now that truly being successful in digital is not just about applying traditional approaches and methodologies to a new paradigm. It requires a whole new engagement model. What I mean by that is that you need -- to really truly build the digital businesses, you need to bring together a new set of skills and capabilities, and these are typically in areas like data science, design and of course, the digital technology skills. You've got to bring those new capabilities together with traditional capabilities in consulting, in strategy and deep domain expertise. And you've got to be able to bring these talents together -- people with these talents together to create very short-cycle rapid bursts of innovation so that you can respond to the changing market demands very, very quickly. That requires a new engagement model, and that is what is embodied in our Digital Works approach and methodology that we've now infused across the company. And so we feel like we are several steps ahead of key competitors on building out the methodology, on having a real approach that we've tested -- road-tested with many, many clients and of course, building out the core fundamental capabilities in these new areas that you need to be successful in digital."

We think that we've got a terrific engine to both recruit talent in the marketplace and to train talent and scale up in certain areas. Let me talk a little bit about both of those. And I think, first of all, in terms of our ability to recruit around the world, as you know, it's always been a core competency of Cognizant. But I think the fact that our brand is extremely strong around the world from a -- in the recruitment markets, the fact that the company performance has been solid over the last several years and the fact that we are winning in digital creates a great platform for us to recruit the best talent in the world. And I think we've built a phenomenal set of leadership in digital in these new areas, in all of the new areas that I mentioned. And I'm confident that, that leadership team will, in turn, be able to attract and scale that -- their respective teams. In addition to that, in the digital technology areas, we think that our traditional consultants can -- we can retrain and rescale. And in fact, we already are, particularly with those that we need, where the real scale is, is on the integration between the new digital world and the traditional environment. And so in that space where a lot of the scale requirement is, we are both recruiting, but we're also retraining and cross-training. So we -- I feel good that we've got a road map going forward to be able to address the skills issue."

You've got to be able to very quickly bring new functionality to market. You've got to have the ability to test that in real time and make sure that it's meeting the needs of the client and if not, backtrack out of that to be able to change course.

We had another great quarter and a solid start to 2015. Our first quarter revenues were $2.91 billion. This represented a sequential increase of 6.2% after a negative currency impact of 1.1%. Our sequential growth was well ahead of our previous guidance and was driven by strong organic growth in our core business, coupled with solid in-line performance in the TriZetto business. Non-GAAP operating margin was 19.8%, at the higher end of our targeted range of 19% to 20%.
Based on our current visibility and strong sales pipeline, we're pleased to increase our full year revenue guidance to at least $12.24 billion and non-GAAP EPS guidance to $2.93, which reflects our strong overperformance during quarter 1.
Our results this quarter and our guidance for the full year are a clear reflection that we are well positioned to serve the needs of our clients. As I've said in the past, we are in the midst of a once-in-a-decade shift in the technology landscape, which is creating significant opportunities for services firms that have the right portfolio. Our results demonstrate that our strategy, investments and solutions are strongly aligned with the evolving market demand. Today, more than ever, our clients are grappling with the dual mandate, and our run better, run different value proposition is resonating well with them.
On one side of the dual mandate, the shift towards digital is front and center for our clients. Our digital offerings are seeing strong traction in the market. In addition, as clients deploy digital technologies, it's creating demand for our traditional services in areas such as legacy modernization and integration. Gordon will give you examples of some of our leading-edge digital work in a few moments.
On the other side of the dual mandate, clients continue to drive down costs in their core operations. We see this manifested in 2 ways: first, clients are adopting our traditional service offerings more broadly and driving demand for integrated multiservice deals; and second, we're seeing clients exploring new frontiers of cost and operating efficiency through new as-a-service utility models.
As we saw this scenario unfold over the past few years, we embedded in the company a systematic capability in the form of our Three Horizon model to rapidly identify changing market demands and capitalize on them. As a result, we now have a solid comprehensive portfolio of services for the current needs of our clients, as well as a robust mechanism to ensure that we have the organizational agility to make the right investments to remain relevant to clients going forward.
On the digital front, our differentiated approach that we call Digital Works has seen great traction, and recent digital acquisitions like Cadient, Odecee and itaas have helped to round out our digital services and geographic footprint.
Beyond digital, we have a number of other high-growth businesses. Our investment over the past several years in business process, infrastructure and consulting services has paid off, and these practices continue to be solid drivers of growth. Each of these practices has the potential to be a multibillion-dollar revenue source for the company. This quarter, I'm particularly pleased with the growth of Infrastructure Services, which crossed the $1 billion annual run rate mark.
And finally, I'm very excited about our portfolio of as-a-service utility offerings that we've built through acquisitions like TriZetto and SourceNet, client transactions like Health Net and our own organic efforts with clients such as TransCelerate. 
Let me spend the next few minutes providing more detail around the key trends that we see shaping demand. I'll then turn it over to Gordon to provide deeper insights on what we see across our business segments and to Karen for details on the financials.
The first key trend shaping demand is a shift towards digital, which is a priority for our clients because it's a priority for their customers. Having worked with clients on hundreds of digital projects, it's very clear to us that winning in the new digital era requires a new engagement model. Clients need a partner who can bring new capabilities in design, data science and digital technology, in addition to a deep understanding of a client's business, operating model and technology landscape. Clients recognize that they often do not have in-house capabilities in all these areas and are looking to deepen relationships with partners who have invested for the digital landscape. 
Furthermore, what's interesting and important to note is that the shift to a digital enterprise is in turn driving demand for our traditional services. No digital transformation is complete without integration with the enterprise's legacy systems and business processes. Existing IT infrastructure, systems and applications and business processes often need to be retooled to accommodate the explosion of users, data, devices and sensors that often accompany digital deployments. Clients continue to look for new ways to drive down the cost of operations in their core business in order to remain competitive and to fund their digital transformation. As I mentioned, we're seeing clients broadening and deepening their use of our services, often through multiservice solutions. In these situations, our broad portfolio of services is critical to provide a comprehensive solution to a client.
We're also pushing beyond traditional delivery models in creating as-a-service utility -- industry utilities that provide clients a low-cost, high-efficiency shared capability and variable cost structure. By bringing together applications, cloud and business process services to create industry utilities, we're helping clients by distributing high fixed costs across multiple customers in an industry.
These are clearly exciting times in our industry, and we believe that Cognizant is well positioned to be the partner clients will turn to in transforming their businesses.
With that, I'll turn it over to Gordon, and I'll be back to take your questions. Gordon?"

Before I provide more detail on our industry services and geographic segments, let me offer some color on how the shift to a digital enterprise is driving greater demand for our traditional services and is, in many",1680,"Good morning, Francisco, and thank you. Before I provide more detail on our industry services and geographic segments, let me offer some color on how the shift to a digital enterprise is driving greater demand for our traditional services and is, in many cases, changing how we deliver these services. 
Clients are reconsidering how they manage their traditional investments in technology and business processes, as they are keen to drive higher levels of efficiencies and fund their transition to digital enterprises. Often, this is manifested in integrated multiservice line deals. As Francisco said, we're seeing a stepped-up demand for new business models such as as-a-service utility or platform-based models, which help clients create variable cost structures, enhance efficiency and drive agility and time to market.
Let me explain this a bit further with some recent examples. Integrated multiservice solutions typically include a combination of consulting, IT Services, BPO services and infrastructure services to drive higher levels of efficiency, agility and innovation. We recently entered into a strategic partnership with CNO Financial Group to transform its IT capabilities for its insurance subsidiaries, enhancing agent and customer experience. These subsidiaries include well-known brands like Bankers Life, Colonial Penn and Washington National. This deal encompasses multiple IT functions spanning applications maintenance, application development, testing and select IT infrastructure services. In addition to delivering annual expense savings to CNO, this partnership will innovatively help CNO Financial to better compete in the underserved middle market.
Another example is how we're combining our finance and accounting automation and enterprise analytic capabilities for Truck Insurance, a leading insurer in the Nordics, to drive end-to-end accountability for data compliance as well as financial reporting, thus improving risk assessments and governance.
Lastly, as Francisco mentioned, we are increasingly bringing together applications, infrastructure and business processes to create industry utilities benefiting multiple customers in an industry. This approach of helping clients from setting strategy to transforming business operations to managing technology needs is helping us establish even greater mind share and market leadership.
Let me now move to a detailed commentary of our individual industry practices. Our Banking and Financial Services segment grew 3.6% sequentially and 13.4% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued strong growth in our insurance practice. Within Banking, clients remained focused on cost optimization and vendor consolidation, regulatory compliance and cyber security. In addition, there's an increased focus on newer technologies in digital and automation, particularly in areas to improve customer experience and drive digital customer self-service. An example of our work in digital is the program for Chola Investments in India. We're helping this client to digitally transform its entire vehicle finance business by reengineering business processes, digitizing workflows and developing multi-channel applications to drive real-time decision-making, improve customer experience and enhance operational efficiencies.
And for a leading bank in the U.S., we're helping build the branch of the future by providing a seamless multi-channel integration and in-lobby digital applications so we can provide customers with a compelling, real-time, personalized experience.
Our Healthcare segment, which consists primarily of our payer, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, grew 13.8% sequentially and 42.7% year-over-year, including the impact of TriZetto. Our payer clients continue to take a cautious approach to spending. Cost optimization is still a key driver, while clients are also looking to leverage analytics to drive profitability and improve customer retention. The payer sector is undergoing fundamental changes, driven by changing regulatory environment, increasing focus on medical costs and the consumerization of health care. We believe these changes create longer-term opportunities that we are well positioned to capture.
The integration of TriZetto is on track, and our combined offerings are clearly resonating with clients. We have moved aggressively to increase staffing. We've added 500 consultants who are either already deployed or trained and ready to deploy to assist in driving revenue synergies. In addition, we've added 300 people to our global delivery centers to accelerate product development on TriZetto platforms.
This action is already paying off. In the first quarter alone, we were selected for synergy deals with a total contract value of $200 million, with a number of additional deals in our pipeline. We are in active discussions with a number of payers about integrated solutions, leveraging TriZetto's platforms and our service capabilities. As you can see, we're well on our way to generating the $1.5 billion of revenue synergies that we spoke about at the time of acquisition.
Moving on to our pharmaceutical business. We continue to see a trend towards multiservice deals across infrastructure and IT services, leveraging cloud technologies and platforms. Additionally, we're seeing steady demand driven by vendor consolidation and cost optimization across many existing and new clients. We're quite pleased with the traction we're seeing from our acquisition of Cadient, where we've added 9 new logos since closing the acquisition late last year.
Recently, Otsuka Pharmaceutical, a U.S. pharmaceutical research and development company, publicly highlighted the work Cadient delivered in helping it to develop and deploy a highly innovative approach to communicating with clinical trial investigators using iPads and large-format touchscreen technology. Additionally, we're proud that Cadient recently won a prestigious life sciences industry marketing award that is further validation of the value we're providing to clients.
Our Retail and Manufacturing segment was up 2.7% sequentially and 7.2% year-over-year. We are seeing early signs of improved demand following a soft 2014, particularly in areas of modernizing supply chains as well as digital and e-commerce engagements. For a large retailer in Southeast Asia, we're implementing a digital e-commerce platform to deliver a seamless omnichannel shopping experience for their customers. This will allow more efficient retail management and a better understanding of customer preferences and purchasing history.
And for many other retailers around the world, we're helping them exceed customer expectations with the latest digital technologies. For example, we're partnering with a major U.S. clothing manufacturer to redesign their stores. We're helping a prominent retailer in Asia Pacific to provide a seamless multichannel shopping experience. And we're supporting a leading U.S. discount retailer in using the cloud to deliver superior services at its 8,000 stores.
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech, communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was up 2.6% sequentially and 19% year-over-year, driven primarily by improved discretionary spending at our high-tech clients. Partnering with Google, we're helping a major workforce solutions and servicing company reengineer how they approach, search and match talent against demand, creating a new paradigm around finding the right candidate. As transactions increasingly become video-enabled, we're seeing strong demand for services provided through our itaas acquisition with our communications and media and entertainment clients, as well as a growing demand among clients in other industries, such as banking and retail.
Let me now turn to our Horizon 2 service lines. We continue to be pleased with the market traction we're realizing here. Our Business Process Services, or BPS practice, saw continued success during the quarter, largely on the ramp-up of a number of wins in prior quarters across financial services, insurance and health care. BPS is a critical component in bringing operational efficiencies to our clients. Increasingly, this is delivered through solutions leveraging technology and robotic automation.
Through the acquisition of TriZetto, we gained a strong robotic automation platform with artificial intelligence and machine learning capability. This platform is now part of our suite of automation platforms within our robotics process automation practice. This practice focuses on automating both technology and business processes, where physical labor is replaced with digital labor. The business outcomes include faster processing times with fewer errors, virtually unlimited scalability and lower cost of ownership, along with the ability to make more timely business decisions through automated enabled -- automation-enabled analytics. Let me give you an example. We use this platform to help a major U.S. health care payer in their claims processing organization. The client was initially expecting a 6-month project to clear claims backlogs, primarily by using additional people for processing. We were able to implement a robotic process automation solution in 6 weeks and cleared the backlog in just 1 additional week.
Cognizant Infrastructure Services had another strong quarter. Clients are looking for solutions which drive simplification and predictable operations to accelerate their IT transformation. Increasingly, this is being delivered through multiservice solutions, often combining applications and infrastructure, as well as the use of newer technologies, such as our hybrid cloud and mobility solutions.
Cognizant was recently named a Top IT Infrastructure Transformation Consulting Provider by Kennedy Consulting Research and Advisory. The report highlighted our strong capabilities in IT infrastructure transformation strategy and roadmap development, advisory services across data center and storage transformation, workplace transformation, business continuity and disaster recovery and IT infrastructure security. 
Cognizant Business Consulting, or CBC, continues to take a lead role in many of our transformation deals, helping architect the deals and drive change management in our clients' businesses. As we mentioned last quarter, over 60% of CBC's pipeline has a digital component. For example, we're helping a major U.S. hotel and casino operator utilize big data and analytics to speed up and improve decision-making across all aspects of their business.
From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 7.4% sequentially and 24.8% year-over-year. Our European operations recorded strong growth when viewed from a local currency perspective. As you know, the European currencies have declined significantly against the U.S. dollar during the first quarter. Revenue from Europe was up 0.2% compared to the fourth quarter after a 4.8% negative currency impact. Continental Europe declined 2.9% sequentially after a 6.3% negative currency impact. We expect solid growth in the continent over the coming years as we increasingly benefit from the structural shift towards larger, multi-year outsourcing programs. 
Finally, we saw good traction in the rest of the world, which was up 7.6% sequentially after a 2.8% negative currency impact. Growth was driven primarily by strength in key markets such as India and the Middle East.
We're pleased with the strength of our performance across industries, service lines and the geographies we serve. 
With that, let me have Karen provide more color on the financial details of this strong performance."

First quarter revenue of $2.91 billion represented growth of 6.2% sequentially and 20.2% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, we had a $30 million negative currency headwind, which impacted revenue growth by 110 basis points.
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.8%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.71 exceeded guidance by $0.02. 
Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 56% and 44% of revenue, respectively, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 10% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. Outsourcing services were up 1% sequentially and grew 8% from Q1 a year ago.
During the first quarter, 36% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 7 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 278.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 400,000 shares for a total cost of approximately $25 million. To date, we have repurchased approximately 35.6 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.2 billion under our share repurchase authorization of $2 billion and have approximately $789 million remaining unutilized. Our fully diluted share count increased slightly to 613.9 million shares during the quarter.
Total receivables were $2.1 billion at the end of the quarter, and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 73 days. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $388 million, up from $325 million at the end of Q4. We billed approximately 51% of the Q1 unbilled balance in April. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables.
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.35 billion of cash and short-term investments, down by approximately $425 million from the quarter ending December 31, and down by approximately $515 million from the year-ago period. Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter, including approximately $100 million outstanding on our revolver.
Financing activities were approximately a $557 million use of cash during the quarter, with almost all of this going to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Operating activities generated approximately $189 million, and capital expenditures were approximately $58 million during the quarter.
Let me now provide some color on our business and operating metrics. During the quarter, we added approximately 6,200 employees, and we ended the quarter with approximately 217,700 employees globally. Approximately 204,000 of our employees are service delivery staff. Annualized attrition of 14% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, improved by 10 basis points year-over-year. Utilization was essentially flat on a sequential basis. Offshore utilization was approximately 70%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was approximately 76%. And on-site utilization was approximately 92% during the quarter.
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q2 and for the rest of the year. As Frank mentioned, we are increasing our full year revenue and our non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect the strong overperformance during quarter 1. Therefore, we are revising our full year guidance to at least $12.24 billion, representing revenue growth of at least 19.3% over 2014. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing guidance and does not include additional potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. 
For the second quarter of 2015, we expect to deliver revenue of at least $3.01 billion. During the second quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%.
For Q2, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.72. Non-GAAP EPS excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613.5 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.6%.
We are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.02 to at least $2.93. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26.4%.

We talked to you a quarter or 2 ago about these 3 large deals that will all be in the outsourcing space, including Health Net, and that will start to ramp up. But I think what's important here also is to understand the underlying trend of what's going on. As we -- as clients go through this big investment cycle around digital and start to focus a lot of energy and attention on implementing new digital capabilities in their organizations, there's a natural shift a little bit away from doing what I consider to be the more discretionary aspects of maintenance work. So you're not going to invest substantially in supporting or enhancing rather an existing application if it's going to be replaced or supplanted by a new digital capability. And so you're going to see a little bit of that, I would suspect, as we go through this, which may manifest itself in a little bit more lumpiness in discretionary versus outsourcing in the coming quarters. I think it's important to understand what's driving that. In the net, I view it as a very positive thing, because it says to me that we're winning in digital. We're helping our clients transform their businesses. Clients may be investing a little bit less in that, in maintaining or enhancing existing systems, and that's okay because we're picking it up on the digital side."

I think put it into 3 buckets: input-based pricing, output-based pricing and outcome-based pricing. Clearly, clients are comfortable on the shift from input- to output-based, so moving to fixed price to managed services and so forth. What we're finding quite intriguing is as clients are now starting to think about outcome-based pricing. We did this in the large health care deal that we announced, where the client's going to pay per member per month irregardless of what are the volumes involved in supporting those clients. We think that is the wave of the future and particularly, these end-to end solutions that we're talking about, where we provide everything from the applications to the infrastructure, to the business process services. So it's taking Software as a Service one step further and actually providing the transaction services around it. In the end, there'll be a continuum. Some people will still want on-premise custom applications, and we'll continue to do that in our traditional business. Some clients will want a SaaS model. Clearly, TriZetto supports that. Some will want a full end-to-end solution. We'll have that through the Health Net platform as well as the TriZetto platform. So we're feeling quite good about how the migration is happening across this spectrums of ways to engage. Pricing on the end-to-end solutions and SaaS. Obviously, there are scale efficiencies there. So when you first start out with a new offering, until you gain scale, even if your pricing is fine, you'll -- there'll be some pressure on margin, and that's normal. That's exactly the way that should work, where you're making that upfront investment. But then as you gain scale, we feel pretty good about it. So overall, as Karen mentioned, pricing is stable, which is, in this environment, I think is good. Clients are focused far less on the rate card, much more on what is the cost of ownership. So if we can demonstrate best-in-class delivery, constantly lowering the cost of ownership through productivity, through automation, clients are very happy. And I think that's one of the reasons, on the traditional side of the business, we continue to do quite well."

In the pharmaceutical industry, last year was very tough because of the drug patent cliffs that clients were facing. This year, you are seeing movements in the pharmaceutical space towards vendor consolidation, towards shared services. So even though it's still a tough economic environment, we are seeing clients make very thoughtful and transformative decisions, and we're just incredibly well positioned to assist them in that. On the payer side, obviously, TriZetto was a game-changer. We already had a strong practice. Now we have just an incredible practice that payers across the board look to Cognizant to solve some of their toughest problems, whether it be on the cost side or on the innovation side, controlling medical management costs. So I think we're incredibly well positioned to help those payer clients and have a material impact on the delivery of health care in America and the cost of health care delivery in America."

We're always looking for acquisitions that help us with new -- or geographies, where we're under penetrated, deepening our industry skills or expertise or new technology areas. I'd expect with digital being such a big theme at this point, we will continue to look at that very closely as a potential space for M&A across geographies and particular technology or skill areas in the digital space. And then as we've said, I'm very pleased with how the TriZetto acquisition has gone.

Let me try and take a stab at it. I think, usually, what you'll see is clients looking at -- a typical client scenario is that they would have, of a larger client, is they'd have 4, 5 sizable scale players working for them and then a very long tail of smaller providers that are each individually relatively small, but collectively make up a significant amount of the client's spend. And so what we typically see is clients saying from that, we'll go down to maybe 3, sometimes 2 suppliers and importantly -- of the big ones. And then importantly, will cut the tail substantially. And so there's a lot of emphasis across our clients on consolidating what's been called a long tail of suppliers or the smaller suppliers that have an ecosystem with the client. I would say that sometimes -- and obviously, there's an economic component of this, which is clients looking at better total cost of ownership. And I think that's important because very often, we get confused between the pricing versus the total cost of ownership. But clients really are realizing that this is a total cost of ownership game. Very often, when we see these vendor consolidation kinds of conversations with clients, they are accompanied with conversations about moves to managed services. And that's, I would say, a very, very common theme. So it's not just a pure, we'll give you more volume and reduce price in some way, shape or form. The clients recognize that we need to have levers like the move to managed services, which allows us to drive greater productivity across a greater volume and therefore, protect our margin and improve our service quality for them. And then the last thing I would say, Ed, is that it's not just a question of volume and price. There are other considerations that clients look at, particularly around things like security and the idea that dealing with a smaller number of players allows them to manage the security environment a little bit more tightly so that they have less exposure from that standpoint."

In terms, again, of the core business, core business continues to be margin-neutral to us. But as we talked about in Gordon's comments, we've obviously added about 500 people to really help drive those revenue synergies and another 300 people to work on the development of the platform.

It requires a whole new engagement model. What I mean by that is that you need -- to really truly build the digital businesses, you need to bring together a new set of skills and capabilities, and these are typically in areas like data science, design, and of course, the digital technology skills. You've got to bring those new capabilities together with traditional capabilities in consulting, in strategy and deep domain expertise. And you've got to be able to bring these talents together -- people with these talents together to create very short-cycle, rapid bursts of innovation so that you can respond to the changing market demands very, very quickly.

Thanks for joining us today. This was a tremendous quarter. In fact, in dollar terms, we have the strongest sequential revenue growth in our history, exceeding both our expectations and our guidance. This come",1182,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. This was a tremendous quarter. In fact, in dollar terms, we have the strongest sequential revenue growth in our history, exceeding both our expectations and our guidance. This comes on the heels of strong performance in Q1. We've got a great portfolio of offerings, and as a result, we're seeing robust demand for services, a trend that has continued to accelerate from the first quarter.
Our Q2 revenue was $3.09 billion, up 6% or $174 million over Q1. Non-GAAP operating margin of 20.2% slightly exceeded our targeted range of 19% to 20%.
Similar to Q1, we saw very robust underlying demand across the geographies and industries that we serve. Our pace of hiring throughout 2014 and during the first quarter of 2015 ensured that we were prepared to capture this demand as it emerged. This is a clear reflection of the strength of our business model that enables us to make investments in anticipation of evolving demand.
I'm pleased to say that we're increasing our full year revenue guidance for the second time this year to at least $12.33 billion and our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance to at least $3. Our performance in the first half of this year gives us strong confidence in this guidance despite the restructuring of our contract with Health Net.
The underlying drivers of our revenue growth in Q2 remained consistent with the trends that we've seen in prior quarters. As we said before, market dynamics are creating a dual mandate, whereby clients continue to push hard for operational efficiency while driving digital transformation and innovation at scale. Our run better, run different value proposition continues to resonate well with clients, and as a result, demand for our services remain strong.
Dual mandate is also driving a fundamental change in the way IT and operations budgets are allocated. Clients are recalibrating their spending, moving dollars from lights on maintenance and operations projects to new digital initiatives. This shift is good for us, because we're in a strong position to capture the enormous opportunity that are emerging from the transition to digital business. Through our investments in new solutions and services, we are enabling clients to enhance efficiencies and productivity while simultaneously reimagining their businesses and building new capabilities to succeed in the digital era.
To fully address the run better, run different needs of our clients, we're investing in 4 key areas. First, we are enabling our clients to be best-in-class when it comes to running their and operating their core systems and business processes. As such, we're constantly optimizing our traditional services as well as investing in new services to enable clients to achieve higher levels of operational efficiency. We are doing this by finding new ways to simplify and automate clients' core processes, IT applications and IT infrastructure. Across our applications, Infrastructure and Business Process Services, we are creating new delivery models such as shared services and industry utilities. To help us enhance these delivery models, we're deploying automated software engineering, artificial intelligence and other tools for advanced automation. Our homegrown automation tools like and automatica, combined with the tools that we obtained from the acquisition of TriZetto, place us in a strong competitive position to deliver these new models.
The second area where we're investing is in capabilities that enable our clients to drive digital transformation at scale. As digital technologies become mainstream, organizations must continuously innovate to deploy these technologies to drive market differentiation and performance. For Cognizant, digital is more than just technology. Digital for us means the ability to connect technology, data science, devices, design and business strategy to change the business process or a customer experience. And given the pace of technology change, our clients not only want single-point digital solutions but have a need to innovate on a continuous basis and make innovation a part of the organization's DNA, what we refer to as innovation at scale. Cognizant is among the few companies that can provide comprehensive digital innovation at an enterprise scale. We do this with our Cognizant Digital Works accelerator methodology, which is comprised of 3 elements. The first is the Digital Works idea lab, where we work with clients to create an approach to imagine the digital future of a business process or a customer experience and to identify a series of specific digital opportunities or ideas based on their vision of the future. Once the ideas have been prioritized, the second step is to design and prototype specific digital solutions in our Digital Works laboratory, which is a physical space where Cognizant works directly with clients to bring together designers, strategists and technologists to visualize, plan and prototype the new digital initiatives.
And finally, in the Digital Works foundry, we work with clients to scale up their digital initiatives by rearchitecting legacy environments, connecting new solutions to existing systems and creating supporting capabilities in areas like in rapid software engineering and security, which are necessary to bring digital ideas to enterprise scale. We find that our integrated Digital Works approach combining design, strategy, technology and industry expertise, coupled with the physical space for co- innovation, plays to our strengths and is distinctive in the market.
A third area of investment is in our consulting practice, which is an integral part of our value proposition. Cognizant Business Consulting continues to take a lead role in many of our transformation engagements by helping architect solutions and drive ongoing change management to ensure success in our clients' businesses. Our consultants bring tremendous expertise in industries and functional areas, and we continue to build on that strength. In addition, our consulting practice is deeply integrated with our technology capability and our Business Process Services. Across clients business, technology and operating model transformations, our consulting practice plays an important role through capabilities such as IT, business and digital strategy, operational improvement, programming change management and process redesign.
Our fourth key area of investment is platform-based solutions and industry utilities that enable clients to achieve new efficiency frontiers and, at the same time, deploy digital technologies more quickly. We've spoken to you in the past about the trend we've seen towards newer as-a-service utility models and platform-based solutions, which distribute fixed costs across multiple customers in an industry. These models not only drive efficiency but can also enable enterprises to run differently by deploying digital technologies, enabling more rapid time to value.
With that summary of our 4 key areas of investment, let me close by saying that our willingness to invest in and explore new commercial models, make bold decisions about investing early in new technologies and our recognized thought leadership has provided us with solid foundation and a strong platform for growth. Given Cognizant's strong entrepreneurial culture and our ability to adapt to change, I'm confident that we are well-positioned for the next phase of our journey.
I'll hand the call over to Gordon to discuss our performance and then to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll return later for Q&A. Over to you, Gordon."
386024,306254245,849043,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Francisco. We are very pleased with our performance for the first half of 2015. As Francisco said, we've been well-positioned to take advantage of a strong underlying demand environment. The mix of services and capabilities within our portfolio",1438,"Thank you, Francisco. We are very pleased with our performance for the first half of 2015. As Francisco said, we've been well-positioned to take advantage of a strong underlying demand environment. The mix of services and capabilities within our portfolio enable us to benefit from the current shifts in client spending priorities. As noted previously, clients are focused on driving efficiency of operations and on driving down their cost of operations in order to remain competitive and to fund their digital transformations.
Let me now provide some more context on performance within our individual industry practices. Our Banking and Financial Services segment grew 7.7% sequentially and 18.1% year-over-year, driven by strength in both banking and insurance.
Within banking, growth was broad-based across our clients, who remain focused on cost optimization, vendor consolidation, regulatory compliance and cyber security. In addition, there is an increased focus on automation and digital, particularly in areas that improve customer experience and customer self-service.
Within insurance, we continue to see strong demand for solutions which help transform both the claims and underwriting processes, delivering both greater efficiencies and improved customer service. For example, during Q2, Cognizant helped a leading U.K. bank to conceptualize, design and build an innovative new solution for its mortgage business. This engagement involved creating new digital channels for mortgage processing by intermediaries. The end result was a significant increase in the volume of business from brokers and as much as a 75% reduction in the time it takes for new broker on-boarding.
Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients grew 2.1% sequentially and 39% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase includes the impact to TriZetto. As the healthcare landscape is changing rapidly, we continue to see our payer clients take a cautious approach to spending. An increased focus on medical costs, consumerization and a changing regulatory environment is driving consolidation as well as an ongoing search for solutions that fundamentally change the business model and economics of healthcare management. Given our prominence in the healthcare industry and long history of helping healthcare clients during times of consolidation, we believe that we are well-positioned to partner with our clients as they navigate these transitions.
An example of industry consolidation is the proposed acquisition of Health Net by Centene announced in early July. As a result of the acquisition, we do not expect that the 7-year master service agreement with Health Net covering end-to-end administrative services will be implemented. However, with our existing relationship extended through 2020, we're pleased to say that Cognizant will remain a key strategic technology and operations partner to Health Net. In addition, we negotiated the right to license from Health Net certain intellectual property. We expect to leverage that IP, along with TriZetto's software and Cognizant's assets, to continue to drive our platform-based solutions.
Looking onto our life sciences business, we continue to see a trend towards multiservice deals, leveraging cloud technologies and platforms. Lumenis, a world leader in medical devices, deployed Cognizant's proprietary platform MedVantage, a cloud-based integrated complaint management solution that we built on the force.com platform. By seamlessly integrating with Lumenis' existing Salesforce.com infrastructure, MedVantage enables Lumenis to provide its stakeholders improved service, efficiency and reporting. The MedVantage is a good example of how we closely collaborate and work with cloud-based providers to enhance functionality.
Our retail manufacturing segment was up 5.4% sequentially and 12.4% year-over-year. We continue to see an improving demand environment, particularly around modernizing supply chains as well as driving digital and multichannel commerce solutions.
On the manufacturing logistics side, we're working with a major auto manufacturer to integrate Apple Watch and other wearables into their vehicles, providing better analytics and insight and ultimately driving a better customer experience. IN designing the solution we brought together our multidisciplinary capabilities, including product engineering, embedded systems and Internet of Things as well as analytics for enhanced customer experience.
Another example is the work we're doing for one of India's leading engineering conglomerates to modernize its technology landscape and help digitally transform its businesses to deliver innovative products, provide superior customer service and drive growth. This is a good example of how we leverage our global expertise to penetrate new markets and drive new areas of growth.
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech, communications, information, media and entertainment clients, was up 11.5% sequentially and 20.3% year-over-year, driven by strong demand across all areas.
Let me now turn to our Horizon 2 service lines. We continue to be pleased with the market traction we're seeing across all 3 service lines: Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Infrastructure Services and Cognizant Business Process Services. Each of these grew faster than the company average. 
As Frank mentioned earlier, Cognizant Business Consulting, or CBC, continues to be a critical competitive differentiator for us. Today, in approximately 70% of consulting deals, CBC competes primarily against Tier 1 global consulting firms. In addition to standalone consulting engagements, CBC today leads many of our transformation deals, helping architect the deals, reengineer processes and drive change management in our clients' businesses.
Reflecting our growing strength in consulting, Cognizant was recently named a leader in the Forrester Wave Business Transformation Consultancies Report. Cognizant is 1 of just 5 global companies to be named a leader. We were recognized through the investments made in high-quality assets for large-scale business transformations, including building up software and other reusable assets that position us to exploit the long-term trend towards asset-based consulting.
Cognizant Business Process Services, or BPS, saw continued success during the quarter, led by work in insurance, healthcare and financial services. Outsourcing of business processes is a crucial component of bringing operational efficiencies to our clients, and increasingly, technology and automation are integral part of this solution. 
Cognizant Infrastructure Services continues to see robust growth, primarily in solutions that drive simplification, predictable operations and accelerated delivery. Increasingly, this is being delivered by combining applications and infrastructure and enabled by newer technologies such as the hybrid cloud.
From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 5.8% sequentially and 25.7% year-over-year. Our European operations recorded strong growth. Compared to the first quarter, revenue from Europe was up 5.5% sequentially, while the U.K. grew 4.4%. Continental Europe grew 7.3% sequentially. Despite recent macro headlines, our pipeline in Europe continues to be strong.
Finally, we saw continued strong traction in the rest of the world, which was up 10.7% sequentially. Growth was driven primarily by strength in markets such as India and Australia.
For the second quarter, we were successful in growing our revenue by a record $174 million sequentially while keeping our global headcount essentially flat. During 2014 and the first quarter of 2015, we hired aggressively. We did this hiring as well as significant workforce retraining to ensure that we would be ahead of the curve and having the right skills and resources in place to meet the growing demand -- client demand for digital transformation. These investments have clearly positioned us to capitalize on the surging demand environment, leading to record revenue growth for the second quarter.
After the staff investments in 2014 and Q1 of this year, totaling approximately 46,000 net additions, we have opportunity to drive utilization back up to a more appropriate level while meeting client demand, and we moved well down this path during the second quarter. This has freed up dollars to fund our annual compensation increments and investments in our business, while meeting our margin commitments we have set for our shareholders.
While attrition is historically seasonally higher in the second quarter due to the timing of bonus payouts and associates leaving for higher education, second quarter annualized attrition this year at 19% was higher than normal. Although higher attrition was an industrywide phenomenon this quarter, we are working to improve our retention levels through a number of employee engagement initiatives. Due to our industry-leading growth, we know that we provide career opportunities that most other simply cannot. As we have transitioned more towards digital services these past few years, we've been working with our employees to provide clear career paths and role expectations as well as rescaling our people for the next-generation demand. We're implementing programs to ensure that we will have a highly motivated and engaged workforce who share in our success and understand the tremendous career opportunities that we offer. Over time, we're confident that our attrition numbers will trend down towards more historic levels.
We are pleased with the strength of our performance across industries, service lines and geographies that we served during the second quarter. With that, let me have Karen now provide more color on the financial details of the strong performance."

Second quarter revenue of $3.09 billion represented growth of 6% sequentially and 22.6% year-over-year. While currencies are relatively stable on a sequential basis, on a year-over-year basis we had a $75 million or 300 basis point negative impact to revenue growth due to currency.
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses was 20.2%, slightly above our target range of 19% to 20%. This positions us well to absorb wage inflation and promotions that take effect in Q3 while still being able to continue to invest in the business.
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.79 exceeded guidance by $0.07. The Q2 tax rate was lower than anticipated due to the favorable settlement of a discrete tax item during the quarter.
Consulting and technology services and Outsourcing Services represented 57% and 43% of revenue, respectfully, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 8% sequentially and 35% year-over-year. Outsourcing Services were up 3% sequentially and grew 9% from Q2 a year ago.
During Q2, we saw a continuation of the trend that we have seen in recent quarters whereby clients are shifting spend from legacy application maintenance towards discretionary spending, including digital and other transformational projects.
During the second quarter, 35% of our revenue came from fix-priced contracts and, as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 7 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 285.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.4 million shares for a total cost of approximately $153 million. To date, we have repurchased approximately 38 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.4 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion and have approximately $600 million remaining unutilized. Our fully diluted share count remained unchanged at 613.9 million shares in the quarter.
Total receivables were $2.5 billion at end of the quarter, and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 71.9 days. This is down from 73 days in Q1. The unbilled portion of our receivable balance was approximately $387 million, down slightly from $388 million at the end of Q1. We billed approximately 50% of the Q2 unbilled balance in July.
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.57 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $217 million from the quarter ending March 31 and down by approximately $563 million from the year-ago period. Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter, including $100 million outstanding on our revolver.
Operating activities generated approximately $456 million, financing activities were approximately $149 million use of cash during the quarter and capital expenditures were approximately $76 million during the quarter.
Let me now provide some color on our business and operating metrics. During the quarter, we added approximately 300 net employees, and we ended the quarter with approximately 218,000 employees globally. Approximately 204,000 of our employees were service delivery staff.
As expected, utilization was up on a sequential basis. Offshore utilization increased by almost 300 basis points to approximately 73%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was approximately 78%, and on-site utilization was approximately 93% during the quarter.
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q3 and the full year. As Frank mentioned, we are increasing our full year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect the robust demand environment and the strong overperformance during quarter 2 in spite of the anticipated loss of $100 million in incremental revenue from Health Net. We are revising our full year revenue guidance to at least $12.33 billion, representing revenue growth of at least 20.1% over 2014. This does anticipate slower growth in the second half of this year to cover additional downside risks or disruption due to potential M&A activity amongst our clients. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not include additional potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year.
For the third quarter of 2015, we expect to deliver revenue of at least $3.14 billion. During the third quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. Due to the impact of wage increases and promotions, which are effective in Q3, we would not expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be above this range for the remainder of the year.
For Q3, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.75. Non-GAAP EPS excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613.9 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%. We are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.07 to at least $3. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613.9 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25.2%.

Even without that, we raised guidance $20 million beyond the Q2 beat [ph]. Those -- nothing specific that concerns us in the second half of the year. However, obviously, there's a lot of M&A activity going on right now. So we certainly want to have an abundance of caution in case we get surprised by something as the year goes on.

I would start by at the very 50,000-foot level and say, look, there's clearly a trend around the world across businesses and governments to become more technology-intensive, not less technology-intensive. So if you think about that as sort of the big proxy for demand, then I would say that to the extent that we are enablers of helping our clients be more technology-intensive, the demand environment is strong at the 50,000-foot level. When I look at the more micro level perhaps, what I would say, Ashwin, is that there are couple of different things which I think are driving demand in digital, which I think are instructive to answer your question. The first is that, as I said before, it's less now about helping a client with a point digital solution and much more about helping clients innovate at scale and sort of adopt continuous innovation. So that sort of creates for us an opportunity and we are doing with this with some clients around building an operating model around continuous innovation. So there's a revenue stream there, if you will, that we think we can leverage on a much more continuous basis. That's point number one I'd make. The point number two, which is I think very important, is that whenever we've seen these big technology shifts, whether it's the digital shift we are seeing now, the Internet shift that we saw about a decade ago or the client service shifts that we saw a decade before that, there's always a big imperative that clients have around integrating the new technology capability, digital in this case, with the legacy. And that means a lot of work around legacy modernization, a lot of work around new architectures, a lot of work around wrapping the legacy with the components that are necessary to support digital business. And so net-net, I do think that there's plenty of demand here and the opportunity for us to offset the efficiencies that we're seeing in the traditional business with discretionary and new digital projects is definitely there."

There's a lot of change going on in that industry, whether it's M&A or regulatory change, consumerization and all that. When we look at our positioning in the market, we feel very good about that. We look at who our clients are, how our clients look to us for not just execution but advice on how to both run their businesses better and for innovation. We feel very good about that. And equally importantly, the change in -- the Health Net acquisition does not in any way impact our strategy, our belief that the industry or portions of it will move to end-to-end solutions. So the type of deal that we did with Health Net, we think those deals are still out there. We are actively talking to clients about that. So certainly, the Health Net restructuring was a little bit of a setback for us but in no way changes our strategy and everything we've seen in the market, everything that's happening with the TriZetto integration makes us feel that we are absolutely making the right decisions on our strategy. And the payer side is a little soft right now for external reasons, but that's a cycle. And that's the reason we have a portfolio of businesses.

There's going to be a lot of pressure on the cost side, which we think will serve to our favor. But I think that pressure will manifest itself and look at how do you change processes, how do you change the way you do business. And because of our consulting capability, we'll be very well-positioned for that. So what we don't know obviously is there's some short-term freezes in decision-making. At this point, we've not seen any of that. But as I mentioned earlier, clearly, we baked that into our guidance. So we have that cushion, in case some of that happens.

And that's frankly because the businesses in Europe, as you know, continue to face slow economic growth -- macroeconomic growth environments. And so there's a continued pressure there. And of course, as we've said in the past, Ed, the businesses on the continent, if I could make a generalization, haven't outsourced the run-the-business kind of things as much as their counterparts in say the U.K. or in the U.S. So there's upside there. Having said that, I would say that many of the countries in Europe are very digital -- digitally aware, digitally savvy. And if you include the U.K., the penetrations of digital technologies like mobile and so on and so forth in many of these countries, in some of these countries, are deeper than they are in the U.S. So there is a strong demand for digital in Europe as well. So we're really seeing in the continent this dual mandate of run better and run different playing out, and the demand there I would say is quite evenly based."

In general, if you look at our demand patterns, Q2 tends to be strongest quarter if you go back historically. And the reason for that is that our clients are by and large on a calendar budget cycle. And clients tend to have their budgets finalized some time during the first quarter. So the second quarter is the quarter year where you get essentially the full quarter impact of the discretionary spending based on budgets that have been approved by the clients. So generally speaking, Q2 tends to be the strongest quarter. Q3 is a good -- historically has been a good quarter but not quite as strong as the second quarter. And then Q4 tapers off as the year winds down. So that's been our historical demand pattern. Last year was a little different because of the impact of the acquisition of TriZetto in the third and fourth quarters. You saw some of that, so we have to strip that out from the numbers.

And then also we had the TriZetto acquisition, which kicked in at around November 20. So that was about $80 million of growth in Q4 of last year. So this year, we would expect a much more traditional pattern with Q2 being the strongest, Q3 a little bit slower and then Q4 would be a little bit different than our historical pattern. Historically, our core business slows down quite significantly in Q4, but we will have the TriZetto. Obviously, Q4 is their strongest quarter typically given the nature of their business.

We're also looking for acquisitions just in general to get us into certain parts of the world where we don't have as strong a footprint as we would like. I would probably single out or point to Asia as being one area where you'll see us potentially do some acquisitions to strengthen our position in key markets in Asia. We've already done, as you know, the acquisition of Odecee in Australia, which was both a digital acquisition and also help to strengthen our presence in Australia. So that's the -- I would say that's sort of the color that I can provide on the pipeline. And of course, we continue to be active and keeping our eyes open as assets become available.

I view that as that's good operational discipline. And what we want to make sure is that we have the dollars available to make the long-term investments rather than not having operational excellence. So clearly, we slowed down hiring. That's good for employees, because our bench is getting a little big. I think some employees were saying, hey, where's the learning if I'm sitting on the bench. So we've taken our bench down substantially, which I think is very good for employees. Other things such as travel, we need to walk the talk. We talk to our clients about being digital, being virtual. Our use of whether it's videoconferencing or other collaboration tools create great opportunities for people not to be on airplanes all the time. It's interesting. As we slowed down travel, our video usage went up 40%. That's great. Interact with clients on that. So part of that is, yes, it's great to save the money so we can invest in the future, but it's also important that we are walking the talk on what the future looks like."

If you look at the sort of dynamics of outsourcing, you have a few things going on. You have parts of the world, like I said earlier, like Continental Europe that are still first time outsources. So that's one I would say on the positive side. The second positive driver is that you've got parts of outsourcing, like Business Process Services and Infrastructure Services, where penetration rates are still relatively low. So that's another positive driver of demand. So those are the positives. Then you look at what's offsetting that and you say, clearly, clients are shifting budgets from lights on maintenance over to digital. And so that pulls demand down on the outsourcing side. But as well as you're well-positioned to take it upon the digital side, which we feel like we are very strong Christian, you pick up both dollars and potentially pick up more because it's not always a dollar for dollar swap that happens there. So net-net, how does that all net out in terms of the trend line over the next few quarters? It's very hard to make a prediction. But I think the message you should take away is that the outsourcing service line is still fundamentally solid. There's still a very strong value proposition there. There are segments of that space that are still under penetrated, and that will continue to drive demand. And then we'll just see how -- where it nets out in terms of the trend line over the coming quarters.

Thanks for joining us today. This was a tremendous quarter. In fact, in dollar terms, we have the strongest sequential revenue growth in our history, exceeding both our expectations and our guidance. This come",1182,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. This was a tremendous quarter. In fact, in dollar terms, we have the strongest sequential revenue growth in our history, exceeding both our expectations and our guidance. This comes on the heels of strong performance in Q1. We've got a great portfolio of offerings, and as a result, we're seeing robust demand for services, a trend that has continued to accelerate from the first quarter.
Our Q2 revenue was $3.09 billion, up 6% or $174 million over Q1. Non-GAAP operating margin of 20.2% slightly exceeded our targeted range of 19% to 20%.
Similar to Q1, we saw very robust underlying demand across the geographies and industries that we serve. Our pace of hiring throughout 2014 and during the first quarter of 2015 ensured that we were prepared to capture this demand as it emerged. This is a clear reflection of the strength of our business model that enables us to make investments in anticipation of evolving demand.
I'm pleased to say that we're increasing our full year revenue guidance for the second time this year to at least $12.33 billion and our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance to at least $3. Our performance in the first half of this year gives us strong confidence in this guidance despite the restructuring of our contract with Health Net.
The underlying drivers of our revenue growth in Q2 remained consistent with the trends that we've seen in prior quarters. As we said before, market dynamics are creating a dual mandate, whereby clients continue to push hard for operational efficiency while driving digital transformation and innovation at scale. Our run better, run different value proposition continues to resonate well with clients, and as a result, demand for our services remained strong.
Dual mandate is also driving a fundamental change in the way IT and operations budgets are allocated. Clients are recalibrating their spending, moving dollars from lights on maintenance and operations projects to new digital initiatives. 
This shift is good for us because we're in a strong position to capture the enormous opportunity that are emerging from the transition to digital business. Through our investments in new solutions and services, we're enabling clients to enhance efficiencies and productivity while simultaneously reimagining their businesses and building new capabilities to succeed in the digital era.
To fully address the run better, run different needs of our clients, we're investing in 4 key areas. First, we are enabling our clients to be best-in-class when it comes to running their -- running and operating their core systems and business processes. As such, we're constantly optimizing our traditional services as well as investing in new services to enable clients to achieve higher levels of operational efficiency. We are doing this by finding new ways to simplify and automate clients' core processes, IT applications and IT infrastructure. 
Across our applications, infrastructure and business process services, we are creating new delivery models such as shared services and industry utilities. To help us enhance these delivery models, we're deploying automated software engineering, artificial intelligence and other tools for advanced automation. Our homegrown automation tools like ADPART and Automatika, combined with tools that we obtained from the acquisition of TriZetto, place us in a strong competitive position to deliver these new models.
The second area where we're investing is in capabilities that enable our clients to drive digital transformation at scale. As digital technologies become mainstream, organizations must continuously innovate to deploy these technologies to drive market differentiation and performance. For Cognizant, digital is more than just technology. Digital for us means the ability to connect technology, data science, devices, design and business strategy to change a business process or a customer experience. And given the pace of technology change, our clients not only want single-point digital solutions but have a need to innovate on a continuous basis and make innovation a part of the organization's DNA, what we refer to as innovation at scale. 
Cognizant is among the few companies that can provide comprehensive digital innovation at an enterprise scale. We do this with our Cognizant Digital Works accelerator methodology, which is comprised of 3 elements. The first is the Digital Works idea lab where we work with clients to create an approach to imagine the digital future of a business process or a customer experience and to identify a series of specific digital opportunities or ideas based on their vision of the future. 
Once the ideas have been prioritized, the second step is to design and prototype specific digital solutions in our Digital Works Collaboratory, which is a physical space where Cognizant works directly with clients to bring together designers, strategists and technologists to visualize, plan and prototype the new digital initiatives.
And finally, in the Digital Works foundry, we work with clients to scale up their digital initiatives by re-architecting legacy environments, connecting new solutions to existing systems and creating supporting capabilities in areas like rapid software engineering and security, which are necessary to bring digital ideas to enterprise scale. 
We find that our integrated Digital Works approach combining design, strategy, technology and industry expertise, coupled with the physical space for co-innovation, plays to our strengths and is distinctive in the market.
A third area of investment is in our consulting practice, which is an integral part of our value proposition. Cognizant Business Consulting continues to take a lead role in many of our transformation engagements by helping architect solutions and drive ongoing change management to ensure success in our clients' businesses. Our consultants bring tremendous expertise in industries and functional areas, and we continue to build on that strength. 
In addition, our consulting practice is deeply integrated with our technology capability and our business process services. Across clients' business, technology and operating model transformations, our consulting practice plays an important role through capabilities such as IT, business and digital strategy, operational improvement, program and change management and process redesign.
Our fourth key area of investment is platform-based solutions and industry utilities that enable clients to achieve new efficiency frontiers and, at the same time, deploy digital technologies more quickly. We've spoken to you in the past about the trend we've seen towards newer as-a-service utility models and platform-based solutions, which distribute fixed costs across multiple customers in an industry. These models not only drive efficiency but can also enable enterprises to run differently by deploying digital technologies, enabling more rapid time to value.
With that summary of our 4 key areas of investment, let me close by saying that our willingness to invest in and explore new commercial models, make bold decisions about investing early in new technologies and our recognized thought leadership has provided us with solid foundation and a strong platform for growth. Given Cognizant's strong entrepreneurial culture and our ability to adapt to change, I'm confident that we're well positioned for the next phase of our journey.
I'll hand the call over to Gordon to discuss our performance and then to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll return later for Q&A. Over to you, Gordon."

We're very pleased with our performance for the first half of 2015. As Francisco said, we've been well positioned to take advantage of a strong underlying demand environment. The mix of services and capabilities within our portfolio",1459,"Thank you, Francisco. We're very pleased with our performance for the first half of 2015. As Francisco said, we've been well positioned to take advantage of a strong underlying demand environment. The mix of services and capabilities within our portfolio enable us to benefit from the current shifts in client spending priorities. As noted previously, clients are focused on driving efficiency of operations and on driving down their cost of operations in order to remain competitive and to fund their digital transformations.
Let me now provide some more context on performance within our individual industry practices. Our Banking and Financial Services segment grew 7.7% sequentially and 18.1% year-over-year, driven by strength in both banking and insurance.
Within banking, growth was broad-based across our clients who remain focused on cost optimization, vendor consolidation, regulatory compliance and cyber security. In addition, there is an increased focus on automation and digital, particularly in areas that improve customer experience and customer self-service.
Within insurance, we continue to see strong demand for solutions which help transform both the claims and underwriting processes, delivering both greater efficiencies and improved customer service. For example, during Q2, Cognizant helped a leading U.K. bank to conceptualize, design and build an innovative new solution for its mortgage business. This engagement involved creating new digital channels for mortgage processing by intermediaries. The end result was a significant increase in the volume of business from brokers and as much as a 75% reduction in the time it takes for new broker onboarding.
Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients grew 2.1% sequentially and 39% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase includes the impact of TriZetto. 
As the health care landscape is changing rapidly, we continue to see our payer clients take a cautious approach to spending. An increased focus on medical costs, consumerization and a changing regulatory environment is driving consolidation as well as an ongoing search for solutions that fundamentally change the business model and economics of health care management. Given our prominence in the health care industry and long history of helping health care clients during times of consolidation, we believe that we are well positioned to partner with our clients as they navigate these transitions.
An example of industry consolidation is the proposed acquisition of Health Net by Centene announced in early July. As a result of the acquisition, we do not expect that the 7-year master service agreement with Health Net covering end-to-end administrative services will be implemented. However, with our existing relationship extended through 2020, we're pleased to say that Cognizant will remain a key strategic technology and operations partner to Health Net. 
In addition, we negotiated the right to license from Health Net certain intellectual property. We expect to leverage that IP, along with TriZetto's software and Cognizant's assets, to continue to drive our platform-based solutions.
Moving on to our Life Sciences business. We continue to see a trend towards multiservice deals, leveraging cloud technologies and platforms. Lumenis, a world leader in medical devices, deployed Cognizant's proprietary platform MedVantage, a cloud-based integrated complaint management solution that we built on the Force.com platform. By seamlessly integrating with Lumenis' existing Salesforce.com infrastructure, MedVantage enables Lumenis to provide its stakeholders improved service, efficiency and reporting. The MedVantage platform is a good example of how we closely collaborate and work with cloud-based providers to enhance functionality.
Our Retail and Manufacturing segment was up 5.4% sequentially and 12.4% year-over-year. We continue to see an improving demand environment, particularly around modernizing supply chains as well as driving digital and multichannel commerce solutions.
On the Manufacturing and Logistics side, we're working with a major auto manufacturer to integrate Apple Watch and other wearables into their vehicles, providing better analytics and insight and ultimately driving a better customer experience. In designing the solution, we brought together our multidisciplinary capabilities, including product engineering, embedded systems and Internet of Things as well as analytics for enhanced customer experience.
Another example is the work we're doing for one of India's leading engineering conglomerates to modernize its technology landscape and help digitally transform its businesses to deliver innovative products, provide superior customer service and drive growth. This is a good example of how we leverage our global expertise to penetrate new markets and drive new areas of growth.
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech communications, information, media and entertainment clients, was up 11.5% sequentially and 20.3% year-over-year, driven by strong demand across all areas.
Let me now turn to our Horizon 2 service lines. We continue to be pleased with the market traction we're seeing across all 3 service lines: Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Infrastructure Services and Cognizant Business Process Services. Each of these grew faster than the company average. 
As Frank mentioned earlier, Cognizant Business Consulting, or CBC, continues to be a critical competitive differentiator for us. Today, in approximately 70% of consulting deals, CBC competes primarily against Tier 1 global consulting firms. In addition to stand-alone consulting engagements, CBC today leads many of our transformation deals, helping architect the deals, reengineer processes and drive change management in our clients' businesses.
Reflecting our growing strength in consulting, Cognizant was recently named a leader in the Forrester Wave Business Transformation Consultancies report. Cognizant is 1 of just 5 global companies to be named a leader. We were recognized through the investments made in high-quality assets for large-scale business transformations, including building up software and other reusable assets that position us to exploit the long-term trend towards asset-based consulting.
Cognizant Business Process Services, or BPS, saw continued success during the quarter, led by work in insurance, health care and financial services. Outsourcing of business processes is a crucial component of bringing operational efficiencies to our clients. And increasing technology and automation -- and increasingly, technology and automation are an integral part of this solution. 
Cognizant Infrastructure Services continues to see robust growth, primarily in solutions that drive simplification, predictable operations and accelerated delivery. Increasingly, this is being delivered by combining applications and infrastructure and enabled by newer technologies such as the hybrid cloud.
From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 5.8% sequentially and 25.7% year-over-year. Our European operations recorded strong growth. Compared to the first quarter, revenue from Europe was up 5.5% sequentially while the U.K. grew 4.4%. Continental Europe grew 7.3% sequentially. Despite recent macro headlines, our pipeline in Europe continues to be strong.
Finally, we saw continued strong traction in the rest of the world, which was up 10.7% sequentially. Growth was driven primarily by strength in markets such as India and Australia.
For the second quarter, we were successful in growing our revenue by a record $174 million sequentially while keeping our global headcount essentially flat. During 2014 and the first quarter of 2015, we hired aggressively. We did this hiring as well as significant workforce retraining to ensure that we would be ahead of the curve and having the right skills and resources in place to meet the growing demand for -- client demand for digital transformation. These investments have clearly positioned us to capitalize on the surging demand environment, leading to record revenue growth for the second quarter.
After the staffing investments in 2014 and Q1 of this year, totaling approximately 46,000 net additions, we have the opportunity to drive utilization back up to a more appropriate level while meeting client demand, and we moved well down this path during the second quarter. This has freed up dollars to fund our annual compensation increments and key investments in our business, while meeting our margin commitments we have set for our shareholders.
While attrition is historically seasonally higher in the second quarter due to the timing of bonus payouts and associates leaving for higher education, second quarter annualized attrition this year at 19% was higher than normal. Although higher attrition was an industrywide phenomenon this quarter, we are working to improve our retention levels through a number of employee engagement initiatives. Due to our industry-leading growth, we know that we provide career opportunities that most others simply cannot. 
As we have transitioned more towards digital services these past few years, we've been working with our employees to provide clear career paths and role expectations as well as re-skilling our people for the next generation of demand. We're implementing programs to ensure that we will have a highly motivated and engaged workforce who share in our success and understand the tremendous career opportunities that we offer. Over time, we're confident that our attrition numbers will trend down towards more historic levels.
We're pleased with the strength of our performance across industries, service lines and geographies that we served during the second quarter. 
With that, let me have Karen now provide more color on the financial details of the strong performance."

Second quarter revenue of $3.09 billion represented growth of 6% sequentially and 22.6% year-over-year. While currencies are relatively stable on a sequential basis, on a year-over-year basis, we had a $75 million or 300 basis point negative impact to revenue growth due to currency.
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 20.2%, slightly above our target range of 19% to 20%. This positions us well to absorb wage inflation and promotions that take effect in Q3 while still being able to continue to invest in the business.
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.79 exceeded guidance by $0.07. The Q2 tax rate was lower than anticipated due to the favorable settlement of a discrete tax item during the quarter.
Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57% and 43% of revenue, respectively, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 8% sequentially and 35% year-over-year. Outsourcing services were up 3% sequentially and grew 9% from Q2 a year ago.
During Q2, we saw a continuation of the trends that we have seen in recent quarters whereby clients are shifting spend from legacy application maintenance towards discretionary spending, including digital and other transformational projects.
During the second quarter, 35% of our revenue came from fixed-priced contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 7 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 285.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.4 million shares for a total cost of approximately $153 million. To date, we have repurchased approximately 38 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.4 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion and have approximately $600 million remaining unutilized. Our fully diluted share count remained unchanged at 613.9 million shares in the quarter.
Total receivables were $2.5 billion at the end of the quarter, and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 71.9 days. This is down from 73 days in Q1. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $387 million, down slightly from $388 million at the end of Q1. We billed approximately 50% of the Q2 unbilled balance in July.
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.57 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $217 million from the quarter ending March 31 and down by approximately $563 million from the year-ago period. Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter, including $100 million outstanding on our revolver.
Operating activities generated approximately $456 million, financing activities were approximately $149 million use of cash during the quarter, and capital expenditures were approximately $76 million during the quarter.
Let me now provide some color on our business and operating metrics. During the quarter, we added approximately 300 net employees, and we ended the quarter with approximately 218,000 employees globally. Approximately 204,000 of our employees were service delivery staff.
As expected, utilization was up on a sequential basis. Offshore utilization increased by almost 300 basis points to approximately 73%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was approximately 78%. And on-site utilization was approximately 93% during the quarter.
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q3 and the full year. As Frank mentioned, we are increasing our full year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect the robust demand environment and the strong overperformance during quarter 2 in spite of the anticipated loss of $100 million in incremental revenue from Health Net. 
We are revising our full year revenue guidance to at least $12.33 billion, representing revenue growth of at least 20.1% over 2014. This does anticipate slower growth in the second half of this year to cover additional downside risks or disruption due to potential M&A activity amongst our clients. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not include additional potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year.
For the third quarter of 2015, we expect to deliver revenue of at least $3.14 billion. During the third quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. Due to the impact of wage increases and promotions, which are effective in Q3, we would not expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be above this range for the remainder of the year.
For Q3, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.75. Non-GAAP EPS excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613.9 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%. We are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.07 to at least $3. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613.9 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25.2%.

So if you think abou",349,"Yes. It's a good question. I would start by -- at the very 50,000-foot level and say, look, there's clearly a trend around the world across businesses and governments to become more technology-intensive, not less technology-intensive. So if you think about that as sort of the big proxy for demand, then I would say that to the extent that we are enablers of helping our clients be more technology-intensive, the demand environment is strong at the 50,000-foot level. When I look at the more micro level perhaps, what I would say, Ashwin, is that there are a couple of different things which I think are driving demand in digital, which I think are instructive to answer your question. The first is that, as I said before, it's less now about helping a client with a point digital solution and much more about helping clients innovate at scale and sort of adopt continuous innovation. So that sort of creates for us an opportunity, and we're doing with this with some clients around building an operating model around continuous innovation. So there's a revenue stream there, if you will, that we think we can leverage on a much more continuous basis. So that's point number one I'd make. The point number two, which is I think very important, is that whenever we've seen these big technology shifts, whether it's the digital shift we are seeing now, the Internet shift that we saw about a decade ago or the client service shift that we saw a decade before that, there's always a big imperative that clients have around integrating the new technology capability, digital in this case, with the legacy. And that means a lot of work around legacy modernization, a lot of work around new architectures, a lot of work around wrapping the legacy with the components that are necessary to support digital business. And so net-net, I do think that there's plenty of demand here, and the opportunity for us to offset the efficiencies that we're seeing in the traditional business with discretionary and new digital projects is definitely there."

And equally importantly, the change in -- the Health Net acquisition does not in any way impact our strategy, our belief that the industry or portions of it will move to end-to-end solutions. So the type of deal that we did with Health Net, we think those deals are still out there. We're actively talking to clients about that. So certainly, the Health Net restructuring was a little bit of a setback for us but in no way changes our strategy. And everything we're seeing in the market, everything that's happening with the TriZetto integration makes us feel that we are absolutely making the right decisions on our strategy. And the payer side is a little soft right now for external reasons, but that's a cycle. And that's the reason we have a portfolio of businesses, so as one is a little softer, another is a little stronger.

There's going to be a lot of pressure on the cost side, which we think will serve to our favor. But I think that pressure will manifest itself and look at how do you change processes, how do you change the way you do business. And because of our consulting capability, we'll be very well positioned for that. So what we don't know obviously is there's some short-term freezes in decision-making. At this point, we've not seen any of that. But as I mentioned earlier, clearly, we baked that into our guidance. So we have that cushion in case some of that happens.

And that's frankly because the businesses in Europe, as you know, continue to face slow economic growth -- macroeconomic growth environments. And so there's a continued pressure there. And of course, as we've said in the past, Ed, the businesses on the continent, if I could make a generalization, haven't outsourced the run of -- run-the-business kinds of things as much as their counterparts in, say, the U.K. or in the U.S. So there's upside there. Having said that, I would say that many of the countries in Europe are very digitally aware, digitally savvy. And if you include the U.K., the penetrations of digital technologies like mobile and so on and so forth in many of these countries, in some of these countries, are deeper than they are in the U.S. So there is a strong demand for digital in Europe as well. So we're really seeing in the continent this dual mandate of run better and run different playing out, and the demand there, I would say, is quite evenly based."

I'll just give you sort of comment at the high level, then I'll ask Karen to give specific comments on the guidance. In general, if you look at our demand patterns, Q2 tends to be the strongest quarter if you go back historically.

So the second quarter is the quarter where you get essentially the full quarter impact of the discretionary spending based on budgets that have been approved by the clients. So generally speaking, Q2 tends to be the strongest quarter. Q3 is a good -- historically has been -- is a good quarter but not quite as strong as the second quarter. And then Q4 tapers off as the year winds down. So that's been our historical demand pattern. Last year, it was a little different because of the impact of the acquisition of TriZetto in the third and fourth quarters. You saw some of that, and so you have to strip that out from the numbers. And I think if you strip out the TriZetto acquisition, you generally get the same kind of a demand pattern."

So this year, we would expect a much more traditional pattern, with Q2 being the strongest, Q3 a little bit slower, and then Q4 will be a little bit different than our historical pattern. Historically, our core business slows down quite significantly in Q4, but we will have TriZetto. Obviously, Q4 is their strongest quarter typically given the nature of their business.

I would probably single out or point to Asia as being one area where you'll see us potentially do some acquisitions to strengthen our position in key markets in Asia. We've already done, as you know, the acquisition of Odecee in Australia, which was both a digital acquisition and also helped to strengthen our presence in Australia.

As we need a more diverse set of skills, we do a wide range of businesses across multiple geographies. So first, from a sourcing standpoint, we now have college recruiting across the world. Here in the U.S., we recruit at close to 20 universities plus another 10 or 15 business schools. We've dramatically expanded our European college programs and moving it into Asia as well. From a lateral hiring standpoint, just as our scale and brand has changed dramatically over the last 5 years, people view us as an incredibly dynamic and attractive place to work. So when I look at all of our statistics in terms of quality hire and yield rates, that all hires, that all looks good. Now what we need to do, though, is in how we manage the people since it's no longer one size fits all. So we're very much and we're well into it, making sure that people understand what the different roles are, what it takes to move up in the organization, so people can manage their careers. And we have a very transparent policy and program so people from everything from performance management to promotions. So we call this Cognizant Career Architecture. So I think we're actually in quite good shape on this. We -- this is not a place where we put our head in the sand, but we're being proactive thinking about what's our workforce going to evolve to over time, how do we constantly re-skill people, how do we motivate millennials. Attrition was obviously up a little bit in this quarter, but when I look at things we're doing, we're convinced we're doing the right stuff, and it just takes a little time to kick in."

But I'll make a general broad statement. I think given our end-to-end value proposition, the run better, run different value proposition, we think that's really driving our growth. We tend to compete most frequently with the large global end-to-end providers that have both digital capabilities and the outsourcing capabilities. We tend to compete now much less with the traditional offshore or India-based pure play, what I think of as run better firms, although certainly they're still an important factor in the marketplace and so on. But we're increasingly competing more with the global multinationals who are -- who can -- who have both the run better and the run different value proposition."

The Health Net was a very, very large deal. But we have a good set of clients that we're talking to around the similar model as Health Net, and the pipeline, I think, of those deals is good. I would remind you that in our mind, really any client that is running the TriZetto platform is a potential candidate for this kind of model. So we think that when you look at the value proposition from a client standpoint and you say what's the value provision, we think that our ability to run the software, host the software, run the business process, given our deep domain expertise in health care plus the knowledge of the TriZetto platform, really is very, very compelling to clients.

So we've taken our bench down substantially, which I think is very good for employees. The other things such as travel, well, we need to walk the talk. We talk to our clients about being digital, being virtual. Our use of whether it's videoconferencing or other collaboration tools create great opportunities for people not to be on airplanes all the time. It is interesting. As we slowed down travel, our video usage went up 40%. That's great. We're interacting with clients on that.

If you look at the sort of dynamics of outsourcing, you have a few things going on. You have parts of the world, like I said earlier, like Continental Europe that are still first-time outsources. So that's one I would say on the positive side. The second positive driver is that you've got parts of outsourcing, like Business Process Services and Infrastructure Services, where penetration rates are still relatively low. So that's another positive driver of demand. So you -- those are the positives. Then you look at what's offsetting that, and you say, clearly, clients are shifting budgets from lights on maintenance over to digital. And so that pulls demand down on the outsourcing side. But as long as we are well positioned to pick it up on the digital side, which we feel like we're very strongly positioned, you pick up those dollars, and potentially you pick up more because it's not always a dollar-for-dollar swap that happens there. So net-net, how does that all net out in terms of the trend line over the next few quarters? It's very hard to make a prediction. But I think the message you should take away is that the outsourcing service line is still fundamentally solid. There's still a very strong value proposition there. There are segments of that space that are still underpenetrated, and that will continue to drive demand. And then we'll just see how it -- where it nets out in terms of the trend line over the coming quarters.

Thanks for joining us today. This was a tremendous quarter. In fact, in dollar terms, we had the strongest sequential revenue growth in our history, exceeding both our expectations and our guidance. This comes",1183,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. This was a tremendous quarter. In fact, in dollar terms, we had the strongest sequential revenue growth in our history, exceeding both our expectations and our guidance. This comes on the heels of strong performance in Q1. We've got a great portfolio of offerings, and as a result, we're seeing robust demand for services, a trend that has continued to accelerate from the first quarter.
Our Q2 revenue was $3.09 billion, up 6% or $174 million over Q1. Non-GAAP operating margin of 20.2% slightly exceeded our targeted range of 19% to 20%.
Similar to Q1, we saw very robust underlying demand across the geographies and industries that we serve. Our pace of hiring throughout 2014 and during the first quarter of 2015 ensured that we were prepared to capture this demand as it emerged. This is a clear reflection of the strength of our business model that enables us to make investments in anticipation of evolving demand.
I'm pleased to say that we're increasing our full year revenue guidance for the second time this year to at least $12.33 billion and our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance to at least $3. Our performance in the first half of this year gives us strong confidence in this guidance despite the restructuring of our contract with Health Net.
The underlying drivers of our revenue growth in Q2 remained consistent with the trends that we've seen in prior quarters. As we said before, market dynamics are creating a dual mandate, whereby clients continue to push hard for operational efficiency while driving digital transformation and innovation at scale. Our run better, run different value proposition continues to resonate well with clients, and as a result, demand for our services remained strong.
The dual mandate is also driving a fundamental change in the way IT and operations budgets are allocated. Clients are recalibrating their spending, moving dollars from lights on maintenance and operations projects to new digital initiatives. 
This shift is good for us because we're in a strong position to capture the enormous opportunities that are emerging from the transition to digital business. Through our investments in new solutions and services, we're enabling clients to enhance efficiencies and productivity while simultaneously reimagining their businesses and building new capabilities to succeed in the digital era.
To fully address the run better, run different needs of our clients, we're investing in 4 key areas. First, we are enabling our clients to be best-in-class when it comes to running their -- running and operating their core systems and business processes. As such, we're constantly optimizing our traditional services as well as investing in new services to enable clients to achieve higher levels of operational efficiency. We are doing this by finding new ways to simplify and automate clients' core processes, IT applications and IT infrastructure. 
Across our applications, infrastructure and business process services, we are creating new delivery models such as shared services and industry utilities. To help us enhance these delivery models, we're deploying automated software engineering, artificial intelligence and other tools for advanced automation. Our homegrown automation tools like ADPART and Automatika, combined with tools that we obtained from the acquisition of TriZetto, place us in a strong competitive position to deliver these new models.
The second area where we're investing is in capabilities that enable our clients to drive digital transformation at scale. As digital technologies become mainstream, organizations must continuously innovate to deploy these technologies to drive market differentiation and performance. For Cognizant, digital is more than just technology. Digital for us means the ability to connect technology, data science, devices, design and business strategy to change a business process or a customer experience. And given the pace of technology change, our clients not only want single-point digital solutions but have a need to innovate on a continuous basis and make innovation a part of the organization's DNA, what we refer to as innovation at scale. 
Cognizant is among the few companies that can provide comprehensive digital innovation at an enterprise scale. We do this with our Cognizant Digital Works accelerator methodology, which is comprised of 3 elements. The first is the Digital Works idea lab, where we work with clients to create an approach to imagine the digital future of a business process or a customer experience and to identify a series of specific digital opportunities or ideas based on their vision of the future. 
Once the ideas have been prioritized, the second step is to design and prototype specific digital solutions in our Digital Works Collaboratory, which is a physical space where Cognizant works directly with clients to bring together designers, strategists and technologists to visualize, plan and prototype the new digital initiatives.
And finally, in the Digital Works foundry, we work with clients to scale up their digital initiatives by re-architecting legacy environments, connecting new solutions to existing systems and creating supporting capabilities in areas like rapid software engineering and security, which are necessary to bring digital ideas to enterprise scale. 
We find that our integrated Digital Works approach combining design, strategy, technology and industry expertise, coupled with a physical space for co-innovation, plays to our strengths and is distinctive in the market.
Our third area of investment is in our consulting practice, which is an integral part of our value proposition. Cognizant Business Consulting continues to take a lead role in many of our transformation engagements by helping architect solutions and drive ongoing change management to ensure success in our clients' businesses. Our consultants bring tremendous expertise in industries and functional areas, and we continue to build on that strength. 
In addition, our consulting practice is deeply integrated with our technology capability and our business process services. Across clients' business, technology and operating model transformations, our consulting practice plays an important role through capabilities such as IT, business and digital strategy, operational improvement, program and change management and process redesign.
Our fourth key area of investment is platform-based solutions and industry utilities that enable clients to achieve new efficiency frontiers and, at the same time, deploy digital technologies more quickly. We've spoken to you in the past about the trend we've seen towards newer as-a-service utility models and platform-based solutions, which distribute fixed costs across multiple customers in an industry. These models not only drive efficiency but can also enable enterprises to run differently by deploying digital technologies, enabling more rapid time to value.
With that summary of our 4 key areas of investment, let me close by saying that our willingness to invest in and explore new commercial models, make bold decisions about investing early in new technologies and our recognized thought leadership has provided us a solid foundation and a strong platform for growth. Given Cognizant's strong entrepreneurial culture and our ability to adapt to change, I'm confident that we're well positioned for the next phase of our journey.
I'll hand the call over to Gordon to discuss our performance and then to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll return later for Q&A. Over to you, Gordon."

We're very pleased with our performance for the first half of 2015. As Francisco said, we've been well positioned to take advantage of a strong underlying demand environment. The mix of services and capabilities within our portfolio",1460,"Thank you, Francisco. We're very pleased with our performance for the first half of 2015. As Francisco said, we've been well positioned to take advantage of a strong underlying demand environment. The mix of services and capabilities within our portfolio enable us to benefit from the current shifts in client spending priorities. As noted previously, clients are focused on driving efficiency of operations and on driving down their cost of operations in order to remain competitive and to fund their digital transformations.
Let me now provide some more context on performance within our individual industry practices. Our Banking and Financial Services segment grew 7.7% sequentially and 18.1% year-over-year, driven by strength in both banking and insurance.
Within banking, growth was broad-based across our clients who remain focused on cost optimization, vendor consolidation, regulatory compliance and cyber security. In addition, there is an increased focus on automation and digital, particularly in areas that improve customer experience and customer self-service.
Within insurance, we continue to see strong demand for solutions which help transform both the claims and underwriting processes, delivering both greater efficiencies and improved customer service. For example, during Q2, Cognizant helped a leading U.K. bank to conceptualize, design and build an innovative new solution for its mortgage business. This engagement involved creating new digital channels for mortgage processing by intermediaries. The end result was a significant increase in the volume of business from brokers and as much as a 75% reduction in the time it takes for new broker onboarding.
Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients grew 2.1% sequentially and 39% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase includes the impact of TriZetto. 
As the health care landscape is changing rapidly, we continue to see our payer clients take a cautious approach to spending. An increased focus on medical costs, consumerization and a changing regulatory environment is driving consolidation as well as an ongoing search for solutions that fundamentally change the business model and economics of health care management. Given our prominence in the health care industry and long history of helping health care clients during times of consolidation, we believe that we're well positioned to partner with our clients as they navigate these transitions.
An example of industry consolidation is the proposed acquisition of Health Net by Centene, announced in early July. As a result of the acquisition, we do not expect that the 7-year master service agreement with Health Net covering end-to-end administrative services will be implemented. However, with our existing relationship extended through 2020, we're pleased to say that Cognizant will remain a key strategic technology and operations partner to Health Net. 
In addition, we negotiated the right to license from Health Net certain intellectual property. We expect to leverage that IP, along with TriZetto's software and Cognizant's assets, to continue to drive our platform-based solutions.
Moving on to our Life Sciences business. We continue to see a trend towards multiservice deals, leveraging cloud technologies and platforms. Lumenis, a world leader in medical devices, deployed Cognizant's proprietary platform MedVantage, a cloud-based integrated complaint management solution that we built on the Force.com platform. By seamlessly integrating with Lumenis' existing Salesforce.com infrastructure, MedVantage enables Lumenis to provide its stakeholders improved service, efficiency and reporting. The MedVantage platform is a good example of how we closely collaborate and work with cloud-based providers to enhance functionality.
Our Retail and Manufacturing segment was up 5.4% sequentially and 12.4% year-over-year. We continue to see an improving demand environment, particularly around modernizing supply chains as well as driving digital and multichannel commerce solutions.
On the Manufacturing and Logistics side, we're working with a major auto manufacturer to integrate Apple Watch and other wearables into their vehicles, providing better analytics and insight and ultimately driving a better customer experience. In designing this solution, we brought together our multidisciplinary capabilities, including product engineering, embedded systems in the Internet of Things as well as analytics for enhanced customer experience.
Another example is the work we're doing for one of India's leading engineering conglomerates to modernize its technology landscape and help digitally transform its businesses to deliver innovative products, provide superior customer service and drive growth. This is a good example of how we leverage our global expertise to penetrate new markets and drive new areas of growth.
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech, communications, information, media and entertainment clients, was up 11.5% sequentially and 20.3% year-over-year, driven by strong demand across all areas.
Let me now turn to our Horizon 2 service lines. We continue to be pleased with the market traction we're seeing across all 3 service lines: Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Infrastructure Services and Cognizant Business Process Services. Each of these grew faster than the company average. 
As Frank mentioned earlier, Cognizant Business Consulting, or CBC, continues to be a critical competitive differentiator for us. Today, in approximately 70% of consulting deals, CBC competes primarily against Tier 1 global consulting firms. In addition to stand-alone consulting engagements, CBC today leads many of our transformation deals, helping architect the deals, reengineer processes and drive change management in our clients' businesses.
Reflecting our growing strength in consulting, Cognizant was recently named a leader in the Forrester Wave Business Transformation Consultancies report. Cognizant is 1 of just 5 global companies to be named a leader. We were recognized for the investments made in high-quality assets for large-scale business transformations, including building up software and other reusable assets that position us to exploit the long-term trend towards asset-based consulting.
Cognizant Business Process Services, or BPS, saw continued success during the quarter, led by work in insurance, health care and financial services. Outsourcing of business processes is a crucial component of bringing operational efficiencies to our clients. And increasing technology and automation -- and increasingly, technology and automation are an integral part of this solution. 
Cognizant Infrastructure Services continues to see robust growth, primarily in solutions that drive simplification, predictable operations and accelerated delivery. Increasingly, this is being delivered by combining applications and infrastructure and enabled by newer technologies such as the hybrid cloud.
From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 5.8% sequentially and 25.7% year-over-year. Our European operations recorded strong growth. Compared to the first quarter, revenue from Europe was up 5.5% sequentially, while the U.K. grew 4.4%. Continental Europe grew 7.3% sequentially. Despite recent macro headlines, our pipeline in Europe continues to be strong.
Finally, we saw continued strong traction in the rest of the world, which was up 10.7% sequentially. Growth was driven primarily by strength in markets such as India and Australia.
For the second quarter, we were successful in growing our revenue by a record $174 million sequentially while keeping our global headcount essentially flat. During 2014 and the first quarter of 2015, we hired aggressively. We did this hiring, as well as significant workforce retraining, to ensure that we would be ahead of the curve in having the right skills and resources in place to meet the growing demand for -- client demand for digital transformation. These investments have clearly positioned us to capitalize on the surging demand environment, leading to record revenue growth for the second quarter.
After the staffing investments in 2014 and Q1 of this year, totaling approximately 46,000 net additions, we have the opportunity to drive utilization back up to a more appropriate level while meeting client demand, and we moved well down this path during the second quarter. This has freed up dollars to fund our annual compensation increments and key investments in our business, while meeting our margin commitments we have set for our shareholders.
While attrition is historically seasonally higher in the second quarter due to the timing of bonus payouts and associates leaving for higher education, second quarter annualized attrition this year, at 19%, was higher than normal. Although higher attrition was an industrywide phenomenon this quarter, we are working to improve our retention levels through a number of employee engagement initiatives. Due to our industry-leading growth, we know that we provide career opportunities that most others simply cannot. 
As we have transitioned more towards digital services these past few years, we've been working with our employees to provide clear career paths and role expectations as well as re-skilling our people for the next generation of demand. We're implementing programs to ensure that we will have a highly motivated and engaged workforce who share in our success and understand the tremendous career opportunities that we offer. Over time, we're confident that our attrition numbers will trend down towards more historic levels.
We're pleased with the strength of our performance across the industries, service lines and geographies that we serve during the second quarter. 
With that, let me have Karen now provide more color on the financial details of this strong performance."

Second quarter revenue of $3.09 billion represented growth of 6% sequentially and 22.6% year-over-year. While currencies were relatively stable on a sequential basis, on a year-over-year basis, we had a $75 m",865,"Thank you, Gordon, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter revenue of $3.09 billion represented growth of 6% sequentially and 22.6% year-over-year. While currencies were relatively stable on a sequential basis, on a year-over-year basis, we had a $75 million or 300 basis point negative impact to revenue growth due to currency.
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 20.2%, slightly above our target range of 19% to 20%. This positions us well to absorb wage inflation and promotions that take effect in Q3 while still being able to continue to invest in the business.
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.79 exceeded guidance by $0.07. The Q2 tax rate was lower than anticipated due to the favorable settlement of a discrete tax item during the quarter.
Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 57% and 43% of revenue, respectively, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 8% sequentially and 35% year-over-year. Outsourcing services were up 3% sequentially and grew 9% from Q2 a year ago.
During Q2, we saw a continuation of the trend that we have seen in recent quarters whereby clients are shifting spend from legacy application maintenance towards discretionary spending, including digital and other transformational projects.
During the second quarter, 35% of our revenue came from fixed-priced contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 7 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 285.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.4 million shares for a total cost of approximately $153 million. To date, we have repurchased approximately 38 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.4 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion and have approximately $600 million remaining unutilized. Our fully diluted share count remained unchanged at 613.9 million shares in the quarter.
Total receivables were $2.5 billion at the end of the quarter, and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 71.9 days. This is down from 73 days in Q1. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $387 million, down slightly from $388 million at the end of Q1. We billed approximately 50% of the Q2 unbilled balance in July.
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.57 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $217 million from the quarter ending March 31 and down by approximately $563 million from the year-ago period. Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter, including $100 million outstanding on our revolver.
Operating activities generated approximately $456 million, financing activities were approximately $149 million use of cash during the quarter, and capital expenditures were approximately $76 million during the quarter.
Let me now provide some color on our business and operating metrics. During the quarter, we added approximately 300 net employees, and we ended the quarter with approximately 218,000 employees globally. Approximately 204,000 of our employees were service delivery staff.
As expected, utilization was up on a sequential basis. Offshore utilization increased by almost 300 basis points to approximately 73%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was approximately 78%. And onsite utilization was approximately 93% during the quarter.
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q3 and the full year. As Frank mentioned, we are increasing our full year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect the robust demand environment and the strong overperformance during quarter 2 in spite of the anticipated loss of $100 million in incremental revenue from Health Net. 
We are revising our full year revenue guidance to at least $12.33 billion, representing revenue growth of at least 20.1% over 2014. This does anticipate slower growth in the second half of this year to cover additional downside risk or disruption due to potential M&A activity amongst our clients. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not include additional potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year.
For the third quarter of 2015, we expect to deliver revenue of at least $3.14 billion. During the third quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. Due to the impact of wage increases and promotions, which are effective in Q3, we would not expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be above this range for the remainder of the year.
For Q3, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.75. Non-GAAP EPS excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613.9 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%. We are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.07 to at least $3. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613.9 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25.2%.

Even without that, we raised guidance $20 million beyond the Q2 beat. The -- nothing specific that concerns us in -- for the second half of the year. However, obviously, there's a lot of M&A activity going on right now. So we certainly want to have an abundance of caution in case we get surprised by something as the year goes on.

It's a good question.

So if you think abou",349,"Yes. It's a good question. I would start by -- at the very 50,000-foot level and say, look, there's clearly a trend around the world across businesses and governments to become more technology-intensive, not less technology-intensive. So if you think about that as sort of the big proxy for demand, then I would say that to the extent that we are enablers of helping our clients be more technology-intensive, the demand environment is strong at the 50,000-foot level. When I look at the more micro level perhaps, what I would say, Ashwin, is that there are a couple of different things which I think are driving demand in digital, which I think are instructive to answer your question. The first is that, as I said before, it's less now about helping a client with a point digital solution and much more about helping clients innovate at scale and sort of adopt continuous innovation. So that sort of creates for us an opportunity, and we're doing with this with some clients, around building an operating model around continuous innovation. So there's a revenue stream there, if you will, that we think we can leverage on a much more continuous basis. So that's point number one I'd make. The point number two, which is I think very important, is that whenever we've seen these big technology shifts, whether it's the digital shift we are seeing now, the Internet shift that we saw about a decade ago, or the client service shift that we saw a decade before that, there's always a big imperative that clients have around integrating the new technology capability, digital in this case, with the legacy. And that means a lot of work around legacy modernization, a lot of work around new architectures, a lot of work around wrapping the legacy with the components that are necessary to support digital business. And so net-net, I do think that there's plenty of demand here, and the opportunity for us to offset the efficiencies that we're seeing in the traditional business with discretionary and new digital projects is definitely there."

We look at who our clients are, how our clients look to us for not just execution but advice on how to both run their business better and for innovation. We feel very good about that. And equally importantly, the change in -- the Health Net acquisition does not in any way impact our strategy, our belief that the industry or portions of it will move to end-to-end solutions. So the type of deal that we did with Health Net, we think those deals are still out there. We're actively talking to clients about that. So certainly, the Health Net restructuring was a little bit of a setback for us but in no way changes our strategy. And everything we're seeing in the market, everything that's happening with the TriZetto integration makes us feel that we are absolutely making the right decisions on our strategy. And the payer side is a little soft right now for external reasons, but that's a cycle. And that's the reason we have a portfolio of businesses, so as one is a little softer, another is a little stronger.

And we expect those customers to look to us both to help with the integration work and also to help them think about how do they fundamentally transform their businesses. There's going to be a lot of pressure on the cost side, which we think will serve to our favor. But I think that pressure will manifest itself in looking at how do you change processes, how do you change the way you do business. And because of our consulting capability, we'll be very well positioned for that. So what we don't know obviously is there's some short-term freezes in decision-making. At this point, we've not seen any of that. But as I mentioned earlier, clearly, we baked that into our guidance. So we have that cushion in case some of that happens.

And of course, as we've said in the past, Ed, the businesses on the continent, if I could make a generalization, haven't outsourced the run of -- run-the-business kinds of things as much as their counterparts in, say, the U.K. or in the U.S. So there's upside there. Having said that, I would say that many of the countries in Europe are very digitally aware, digitally savvy. And if you include the U.K., the penetrations of digital technologies like mobile and so on and so forth in many of these countries, in some of these countries, are deeper than they are in the U.S. So there is a strong demand for digital in Europe as well.

In general, if you look at our demand patterns, Q2 tends to be the strongest quarter, if you go back historically. And the reason for that is that our clients are by and large on a calendar budget cycle, and clients tend to have their budgets finalized sometime during the first quarter. So the second quarter is the quarter where you get essentially the full quarter impact of the discretionary spending based on budgets that have been approved by the client. So generally speaking, Q2 tends to be the strongest quarter. Q3 is a good -- historically has been -- is a good quarter but not quite as strong as the second quarter. And then Q4 tapers off as the year winds down. So that's been our historical demand pattern. Last year, it was a little different because of the impact of the acquisition of TriZetto in the third and fourth quarters. You saw some of that, and so you have to strip that out from the numbers. And I think if you strip out the TriZetto acquisition, you generally get the same kind of a demand pattern."

So this year, we would expect a much more traditional pattern, with Q2 being the strongest, Q3 a little bit slower, and then Q4 will be a little bit different than our historical pattern. Historically, our core business slowed down quite significantly in Q4, but we will have TriZetto. Obviously, Q4 is their strongest quarter typically given the nature of their business. So it will be a little bit more balanced this year than it would have been historically for us."

And now as we had to shift our workforce and re-skill our workforce, we've now taken it back up, but we still have some more room to take it up. So even when you think about the rest of this year, you'll still see some increase in utilization. We're doing our college hiring just as we normally would. So the college kids that come on board now through the end of the year, those people will be available for billing next year. And then obviously, for lateral hiring, that's really just-in-time hiring, so we turn that on and off as we need. The key is having that pipeline of college kids because of the long training period.

I would say that when we look at technologies, new technologies, new solutions, the pipeline might be a little bit more weighted towards digital and looking at digital capabilities in different parts of the world, in particular, to give us footprint in those areas. We're also looking for acquisitions just in general to get us into certain parts of the world where we don't have as strong a footprint as we would like. I would probably single out, or point to Asia as being one area where you'll see us potentially do some acquisitions to strengthen our position in key markets in Asia. We've already done, as you know, the acquisition of Odecee in Australia, which was both a digital acquisition and also helped to strengthen our presence in Australia. So that's the -- I would say that's sort of the color that I can provide on the pipeline. And of course, we continue to be active and -- keeping our eyes open as assets become available. And as with TriZetto, we don't expect to do another large-scale acquisition until we feel that the TriZetto integration is well on track, which, as Gordon said, we feel good about at the moment.

From a lateral hiring standpoint, just as our scale and brand has changed dramatically over the last 5 years, people view us as an incredibly dynamic and attractive place to work. So when I look at all of our statistics in terms of quality of hire and yield rates on lateral hires, that all looks good. Now what we need to do, though, is in how we manage the people since it's no longer one size fits all. So we're very much, and we're well into it, making sure that people understand what the different roles are, what it takes to move up in the organization, so people can manage their careers. And we have a very transparent policy and program so people from -- everything from performance management to promotions. So we call this Cognizant Career Architecture. So I think we're actually in quite good shape on this. We -- this is not a place where we put our head in the sand, but we're being proactive thinking about what's our workforce going to evolve to over time, how do we constantly re-skill people, how do we motivate millennials.

We tend to compete most frequently with the large global end-to-end providers that have both digital capabilities and the outsourcing capabilities. We tend to compete now much less with the traditional offshore or India-based pure play, what I think of as run better firms, although certainly they're still an important factor in the marketplace and so on.

So we've taken our bench down substantially, which I think is very good for employees. The other things such as travel, well, we need to walk the talk. We talk to our clients about being digital, being virtual. Our use of whether it's videoconferencing or other collaboration tools create great opportunities for people not to be on airplanes all the time. And it was interesting, as we slowed down travel, our video usage went up 40%. That's great. We're interacting with clients on that.

If you look at the sort of dynamics of outsourcing, you have a few things going on. You have parts of the world, like I said earlier, like Continental Europe that are still first-time outsourcers. So that's one I would say on the positive side. The second positive driver is that you've got parts of outsourcing, like Business Process Services and Infrastructure Services, where penetration rates are still relatively low. So that's another positive driver of demand. So you -- those are the positives. Then you look at what's offsetting that, and you say, clearly, clients are shifting budgets from lights on maintenance over to digital. And so that pulls demand down on the outsourcing side. But as long as you're well positioned to pick it up on the digital side, which we feel like we're very strongly positioned, you pick up those dollars, and potentially you pick up more because it's not always a dollar-for-dollar swap that happens there. So net-net, how does that all net out in terms of the trend line over the next few quarters? It's very hard to make a prediction. But I think the message you should take away is that the outsourcing service line is still fundamentally solid. There's still a very strong value proposition there. There are segments of that space that are still underpenetrated, and that will continue to drive demand. And then we'll just see how it -- where it nets out in terms of the trend line over the coming quarters.

We delivered another strong quarter, continuing the momentum we saw in the first half of the year. Q3 revenue of $3.19 billion was up 3.3% over Q2, which exceeded our guidance for the quarter by over $45 million. Non-GAAP operating margin of 19.4% was within our target range of 19% to 20%.
Much like the first half of this year, we saw strong demand across our business this quarter. And as a result, we are pleased to raise our full-year guidance for the third time this year for revenue to at least $12.41 billion and for non-GAAP EPS to at least $3.03. 
Our continued momentum reflects a healthy demand environment for Cognizant services that drive innovation, growth and efficiencies in the digital era. The strong relevance of our services portfolio to clients is reflected in our results this quarter, our guidance for the full year and the above-company average growth in our consulting and technology services.
For a while now, we've used these calls to talk about how we are at the cusp of a once-in-a-decade shift in technology that will drive a sustained period of technological transformation for our clients. Our clients recognize that becoming a digital enterprise is now a necessity, a matter of survival, as businesses, products, people and devices become more connected. Therefore, they are looking for innovative ways to combine their traditional business models and product sets with new and continuously evolving digital technologies. This is leading to a significant change in the way IT and operations budgets are allocated. Clients are recalibrating their spending, moving dollars from keep the lights on maintenance and operations projects to new digital initiatives that create competitive advantage by enabling new levels of business performance.
We've talked about IT being strategic for years, and that is perhaps more true today than it's ever been as management teams are looking to technology solutions to propel their businesses forward. Clients traditionally thought of IT as a means to drive productivity and efficiency, or what we refer to as run better. Today, the role of IT has evolved beyond that, to reimagine organizations and business models for future growth, or what we call run different. This dynamic where our clients have to simultaneously run better and run different is what we refer to as the dual mandate.
Against this backdrop of changing client needs, the approach that services companies like ours need to take is also evolving. Effectively addressing the dual mandate for clients requires partners that can combine strategy, technology and business consulting in one integrated model. However, equally importantly, serving the dual mandate requires a partner that has a deep understanding of clients' legacy environment and business processes so that these can be leveraged and integrated into new digital backbones. Our strength in the market comes from the fact that we've built this breadth of capabilities at Cognizant, and we've integrated these together in our digital works methodology for maximum client impact.
Let me give you an example of a large Financial Services client of ours. I'd revert back to this client example periodically during my remarks to illustrate the key investments we're making and the results we are seeing in the market. We've been working with this client for over a decade now, supporting many of their mission-critical platforms, infrastructures and business operations. Recently, we restructured our engagement with them where we will be taking them to a best-in-class operating model for their existing business with us. As a result of this transition to best-in-class efficiency, we were able to commit to considerable savings to them on our traditional application management business. This is the run better part of the dual mandate. They, in turn, committed not only those savings back to us in the form of a long-term contract but also increased their discretionary spending with us considerably. This is the run different part of the dual mandate. The result is that we have a 10-year contract with them for an annual contract value that's almost 50% higher than their current annual spend with us. This extended partnership also presents opportunities for Cognizant and the client to develop and sell joint go-to market solutions, leveraging our deep expertise and market presence.
Last quarter, we outlined our investments in 4 areas to fully address the needs of our clients to help drive both efficiency and transformation. Let me update you on the progress we've made since then.
First, we are building capabilities to enable our clients to drive digital transformation at scale. As I mentioned last quarter, Cognizant is among the few companies that can provide comprehensive digital innovation at an enterprise scale. We do this with our Cognizant Digital Works accelerated methodology, which comprises 3 elements: The idea lab, where we work with clients to identify big themes and prioritize opportunity areas; the collaboratory, a physical space where we design prototype and iterate specific solutions so clients can visualize the impact on their end users and businesses; and the foundry, where we take these pilot programs and switch them to enterprise scale by utilizing new technology options and integrating them with existing legacy systems.
Our clients appreciate this interdisciplinary approach and, across the industries we serve, we are finding great traction for our Digital Works framework. We recently engaged the our Financial Services client I mentioned a few minutes ago in a custom workshop at the collaboratory for their business and technology leaders. We jointly identified a set of potential opportunities and long-term strategic initiatives that digital is presenting to this customer's business.
Second, consulting is a critical component of our services portfolio. Increasingly, consulting has become an integral part of our comprehensive approach to helping clients drive digital transformation as over 60% of our consulting pipeline is focused in this area. Our matrix structure deeply integrates our consulting team with our technology and Business Process Services delivery organization. This synergy between our consulting and delivery organization helps the teams work closely together, driving business model change, the reengineering of business processes and organizational change management for our clients' businesses. We continue to invest in both people and capabilities to deepen our industry strength and have over 5,500 consultants globally as of today.
For the Financial Services client that I talked about, our consulting practice played a critical role in driving thought leadership into the 10-year deal. Our consultants work with the client to identify existing assets that could be extended to address significant business opportunities in an adjacent industry where they currently don't have a presence. This will potentially drive substantial revenue upside for the client.
Third, we are optimizing traditional services to enable our clients to achieve higher levels of operational efficiency. Today, digital technologies are driving changes in the traditional outsourcing business. The focus in core traditional IT services business, what we call our Horizon 1 services, has shifted from people and processes to people, process and automation. These services are important because clients rely upon them each day to run their businesses. These services are also integral to our ability to drive digital transformation and legacy integration for clients. This means we have to solve today's problems differently by applying innovation and creativity to reorganize and run core processes at an enterprisewide scale. Sometimes it also means moving clients radically different operating models to improve their costs and, at the same time, ensure a high-quality accelerated delivery.
For the Financial Services client that I've been talking about, we will convert our existing arrangement to an end-to-end managed services engagement to streamline their various customer-facing platforms and processes. At the same time, we will transform and digitally enable their core platforms, processes and infrastructure to support digital businesses while managing their existing IT platforms for optimal efficiency.
And fourth, we are building platform-based solutions and industry utilities that enable clients to achieve new levels of efficiency and at the same time deploy digital technologies more quickly. Last year, we took a very definitive step towards strengthening our platform-based solutions portfolio by acquiring TriZetto. We are pleased with the pace of integration of TriZetto and Cognizant capabilities. The combined stack of software products and services from TriZetto and Cognizant have helped open new market segments, allowing Cognizant to bring an integrated solution to the healthcare market.
We've also seen good traction with our internally developed platform solutions. Once such example is the cloud-based Big Data analytics platform, called big decision, that brings together our clients traditional enterprise data and digital data such as voice, device, sensor, social and mobile under a single umbrella. Big decisions includes business applications across multiple industries, which help our clients use analytics when making key business decisions.
In the case of the Financial Services client referenced so far, we anticipate leveraging big decisions to enable this client to monetize their data assets by delivering actionable insights to their clients.
In closing, I'd like to say that Cognizant's culture of innovation and adaptability, coupled with our commitment to continuous investment in the business, has positioned us to be the partner of choice for our clients as they navigate this tremendous period of change. With that, let me hand the call over to Gordon to discuss our performance and then to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll be back later as always to take your questions. Gordon?"

We had another solid quarter and saw strong demand across the business, with particular strength in consulting technology services as clients continue to focus on implementing digital technologies to drive business transformation. Le",1422,"Thank you, Francisco. We had another solid quarter and saw strong demand across the business, with particular strength in consulting technology services as clients continue to focus on implementing digital technologies to drive business transformation. Let me now provide additional color on our performance across industries, Horizon 2 businesses and geographies.
Our Banking and Financial Services segment grew 2.7% sequentially and 18.6% year-over-year, driven primarily by strength in banking. Growth continues to be broad-based across our banking clients, who remain focused on cost optimization, vendor consolidation, regulatory compliance and cyber security. We are seeing increased interest in managed services deals with both banking and insurance clients as they continue to look for ways to increase efficiencies in their operations. In addition, there's an increased focus on automation and digital, particularly in areas that improve customer experience and customer self-service, often through harnessing data and analytics to drive real-time decisions.
For example, during Q3, Cognizant was chosen to help one of Asia's largest private banks manage the future roadmap for a consolidated digital platform to sell personal loans, credit cards, auto loans and mortgages, all of which are currently being managed on separate platforms. The consolidated platform is expected to significantly increase conversion, reduce platform cost and empower the bank with better customer insights.
Another good example is the work we're doing for the National Stock Exchange in India, one of the world's largest exchanges by transaction volumes to transform its futures and options derivatives trading platform. Given the complex nature of exchange environments, new regulations and business requirements must be quickly absorbed and integrated to eliminate failures in transaction processing. The platform that Cognizant developed and deployed for tasks such as order matching and message transfers allowed the exchange to successfully process an unprecedented 1 billion orders in a single day.
Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients grew 4.7% sequentially and, including the impact of TriZetto, grew 43.3% year-over-year. As the healthcare industry shifts from fee-for-service to value-based care models, healthcare organizations are looking for new ways to deliver customer-centric care while simultaneously looking for ways to drive operational efficiency. We recently announced that the New England Healthcare Exchange Network, NEHEN, a consortium of retail players that provides and providers in the northeast selected Cognizant and TriZetto TO digitally transform and manage its technology infrastructure. NEHEN consists of over 55 hospitals, 8 health-insurance plans and tens of thousands of practitioners. Cognizant and TriZetto are enabling NEHEN to deploy an infrastructure that allows members to share costs and improve administrative and clinical processes. This win highlights the synergy opportunities brought by the combination of Cognizant and TriZetto. Together, we won a number of similar deals across payers and providers, combining TriZetto's products and platforms with Cognizant's capabilities in IT, BPO and hosting. As we approach the one-year anniversary of the TriZetto acquisition, we could not be more pleased with how the integration is progressing. TriZetto employee retention remains high, and we have a strong pipeline of opportunities leveraging the synergies between Cognizant and TriZetto.
Moving on to our Life Sciences business. We had a strong quarter as drug pipelines and product launches have improved for pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Additionally, we saw continued strong demand among our medical device clients. We see an increasing interest in deals which combine cloud technologies and platforms, including our proprietary MedVantage, a cloud-based integrated complaint management solution we built on the Force.com platform. We've had a number of our medical device clients implement MedVantage this year to improve efficiency, reporting and overall service level for their customers.
At the recent Dream Force event, Salesforce named Cognizant the recipient of the 2015 Salesforce Partner Innovation Award for Healthcare and Life Sciences for our work with Johnson & Johnson. Cognizant helped J&J medical launch their customer digital engagement model. This digital platform focuses on driving value to J&J's sales team through omnichannel and business integration, powering them with the information they need to better understand their customers and patients needs.
Our retail manufacturing segment was up 4.8% sequentially and 13.7% year-over-year. Clients are focused on modernizing their technology environment, particularly around supply chain and omnichannel commerce solutions. On the manufacturing side, in particular we are seeing strong demand around product transformation. For example, we helping a global packaging equipment manufacturer to transform the packaging equipment they manufacture to smart and connected products, leveraging sensors and the Internet of Things and connecting them with a Big Data analytics platform. This engagement involved organizational change management, business model innovation and machine-to-machine connectivity and will help our client reduce operating cost and deliver new value to their customers.
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech, communications and information media and entertainment clients, was down 0.5% sequentially and up 15.2% year-over-year. We saw a pause in spend with clients in the communication sector on the back of the wave of M&A deals in that space.
Let me now turn to our Horizon 2 service lines. We continue to be pleased with the above-company average growth we're seeing across these 3 businesses, Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Infrastructure Services and Cognizant Business Process Services.
As Frank mentioned earlier, Cognizant Business Consulting continues to be a critical competitive differentiator for us. As clients undergo enterprisewide transformation, our consulting practice plays an important role through capabilities such as technology, business and digital strategy, operational improvement, program and change management and process redesign. 
Cognizant Infrastructure Services continues to see strong growth, primarily in solutions that drive simplification, predictable operations and accelerated delivery. Increasingly, there's a strong focus on automation and IT operations, driving business agility through deploying cloud solutions.
Cognizant Business Process Services saw continued success during the quarter, led by work with our high-tech, insurance and banking clients. Infusing technology and automation in core business processes is critical to helping clients achieve greater levels of operational efficiencies while also enhancing business outcomes through data analytics. 
Let me now shift to geographies. From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 3.6% sequentially and 26.7% year-over-year. Europe was up 1.4% sequentially and 7.8% from last year after a 10.4% negative currency impact. The U.K. grew approximately 1% sequentially and 8.3% year-over-year. And Continental Europe grew 2.2% sequentially and 7.2% over prior year. Finally, we saw a continued strong traction in the rest of the world, which was up 5.3% sequentially and 31% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in our key markets in Asia, such as Singapore and Australia.
I'll now provide some color on our business operations. Similar to last quarter, quarterly annualized attrition remained at 20%, which is above our desired range. We're committed to improving our retention levels through various employee engagement initiatives, faster company growth, well-defined career paths, learning and opportunities and our practice of sharing the rewards of our strong company performance with our employees continues to make Cognizant a very highly attractive employer. Delivering strong revenue performance this year, combined with our continued success in driving higher operational efficiency, was only possible through the efforts of our incredible staff around the globe. And we believe that they should share in these accomplishments. Our performance during the quarter enabled us to increase our year-to-date bonus accruals to levels well above last year. In fact, our brand, which is a reflection of our attractiveness as an employer, has never been stronger. This was validated by the success we've seen in our global campus recruiting program this year. We've expanded our campus footprint, recruiting now from over 30 leading universities and business schools in the United States as well as another 30 top schools across Europe. This campus hiring program has helped us expand our in-country and near source centers. In India, this year, we saw tremendous success in our campus hiring across premium engineering campuses. On campuses where students receive multiple offers from Cognizant and other Tier 1 companies, on average, 75% of those students chose Cognizant over others.
Throughout this call, we've highlighted how we are winning in digital, driving leadership and industries in markets we serve and how we're seeing good traction for our platforms and as-a-service models. We're proud of the performance and are pleased that this is being recognized by leading industry analysts, sourcing advisers and other influencers. In the past few weeks, Cognizant has been recognized by this industry analysts as a leader in Internet of Things, business intelligence consulting, robotic process automation and insurance as a service.
With that, let me turn the call over to Karen to review our financial results"
386024,312428817,891431,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gordon, and good morning, everyone. As Frank mentioned, we are pleased to have delivered another strong quarter. Third quarter revenue of $3.19 billion exceeded our prior guidance by over $45 million and represented growth of 3.3% sequentially and",832,"Thanks, Gordon, and good morning, everyone. As Frank mentioned, we are pleased to have delivered another strong quarter. Third quarter revenue of $3.19 billion exceeded our prior guidance by over $45 million and represented growth of 3.3% sequentially and 23.5% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, we had an approximately $72.4 million negative currency headwind, which impacted revenue growth by 280 basis points. 
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.4%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. As expected, the non-GAAP operating margins declined from Q2 as we absorbed the impact of compensation increases beginning July 1. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.76 exceeded guidance by $0.01.
Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 58% and 42% of revenue, respectively, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 4.6% sequentially and 34.2% year-over-year. Outsourcing services were up 1.5% sequentially and grew 11.1% from Q3 a year ago.  During Q3, we saw a continuation of the trend we have seen in recent quarters whereby clients are shifting spend from legacy application maintenance towards projects-based works, including digital and other transformational programs.
During the third quarter, 37% of our revenue came from fixed priced contracts and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 7 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 292.
During the quarter, we had approximately 1,300 net employee additions, and we ended the quarter with approximately 219,300 employees globally. Approximately 205,000 of our employees were service delivery staff.
As expected, utilization is up on a sequential basis. Offshore utilization increased by almost 300 basis points sequentially to approximately 76%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was approximately 81%, and on-site utilization was approximately 94% during the quarter, up 100 basis points from Q2.
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with just over $4 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $484 million from the quarter ending June 30 and down by approximately $568 million from the year-ago period.
Total receivables were $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter, and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 70.6 days. This is down from 71.9 days in Q2. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $421 million, up from $387 million at the end of Q2. We billed approximately 55% of the Q3 unbilled balance in October. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables and ramp-up of certain fixed [ph] big contracts.
Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $950 million at the end of the quarter. And during the quarter, we repaid $100 million outstanding balance on our revolver.
Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated approximately $818 million. Financing activities during the quarter were approximately a $249 million use of cash. And capital expenditures were approximately $65 million during the quarter.
During the third quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for a total cost of $156 million. And our fully diluted share count decreased approximately 1 million shares to 612.7 million shares for the quarter. To date, we have repurchased approximately 40.5 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.5 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion and have $480 million remaining unutilized.
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q4 and the full year. As Frank mentioned, we are increasing our full year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect the healthy demand environment and the overperformance during quarter 3. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance to at least $12.41 billion, representing revenue growth of at least 21% over 2014. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not include additional potential currency fluctuations over the remainder of the year.
For the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect to deliver revenue of at least $3.23 billion, representing sequential revenue growth of at least 1.3%. As is the typical pattern in the fourth quarter, client furloughs, seasonality of our retail practice and fewer billing days will have an impact on sequential revenue growth.
During the fourth quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For Q4, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.77. Non-GAAP EPS excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates the share count of approximately 613 million shares. We are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.03  to at least $3.03. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25.5%.

From a capital allocation standpoint, as you see both this third quarter and second quarter, each quarter we purchased about $150 million worth of stock to target share neutrality. We'll continue to target share neutrality. One of our challenges is the majority of our cash is overseas. So we have some limitations here, but the capital allocation strategy we're doing is resulting in industry-leading results. We're going to stick with it."

So it's very well-balanced right now.

So the slow growth net headcount is not driven by attrition. That's driven by a very conscious decision we had this year to significantly improve our operational excellence and take our utilization up, which we successfully did while maintaining customer satisfaction. So -- and we're largely done with that process. I think we're pretty much, give or take, pretty much at the utilization levels that we want as we go into 2016. So we don't guide to quarter-to-quarter headcount growth. Still, I think we still have a little bit of room offshore on utilization which you might see in Q4, but then it starts to level out over that. On attrition, attrition being up is not just us, as you know, it's the industry. It's one where when I look at the opportunity for us, clearly, we should have lower attrition given we have unparalleled career opportunities for our employees given the success we have on the digital side, the overall growth rates. So we're redoubling our efforts there to make sure that employees have the career growth, that we share the rewards as I have said and no doubt to our entire company right after this call saying because of what they've delivered on revenue growth, what they've delivered on operational performance, we're going to share those rewards and pay a bonus as well above last year. So we'll keep working on it. I'd be concerned if we were an outlier, but we are not an outlier on the attrition."

We've spent a lot of time looking at what's going on. We're clearly seeing a bifurcation in the market. And that's a leading competitors who can compete on both sides of the dual mandate, and those who can't compete on both sides of dual mandate and therefore focus more on price. What we've seen, and I'm sure some of you have heard about, there've been some isolated instances of irrational pricing in the market. But let me be clear, overall pricing remains stable. These spots of irrational pricing is consistent with what we've seen historically in the market as there have been big technology shifts. And some players are having trouble with that shift and therefore act irrationally in their core market. We also will be very clear, we believe this is a short-term phenomenon. The fundamentals of the industry, input costs, facilities, travel have not shifted enough to warrant this change. And we are also seeing some of the competitors make considerable assumptions about productivity gains by new automation technologies, which we don't think are yet enterprise reality. Frank has touched base on that earlier. We think some people out there are making assumptions that we scratch our head a little bit about will they be able to achieve that or is it wishful thinking. Often when you see these sorts of unreal assumption about productivity built into bids, what you see is players shore up their profitability by cutting corners. And historically, this has resulted in unhappy clients. And we're already beginning to see that in the market. Some of instances where there's been irrational pricing, that client is actually pretty unhappy now as they're getting service from one of our competitors and that competitor is cutting corners. And also impacts employee morale because how you have to squeeze employee. So when we step back and look at it, when we look at our overall book of business, things are very stable and we feel fine about pricing. We're watching these pockets of irrationality, but we're not particularly worried about it because what we're seeing is very quickly the customer understands you get what you pay for and we are seeing dissatisfaction where customers have gone with someone who's been irrational. So we got to watch it. But at this point, we don't think it's long-term trend. We don't think it's impacting our book of business. And ultimately, I think it may be good for our reputation as clients have dissatisfaction with some of the other competitors."

Just building on what Gordon said a minute ago, it is absolutely true that on the run better side of our business, clients are still looking for greater levels of efficiency and effectiveness. And so we are focusing clients on looking at total cost of ownership and looking at the output and the outcomes that we deliver and driving output and outcomes to best-in-class, world-class levels. And so as a result of that, you will see a continued shift in our business towards more output and outcome-based models. And the fixed-price metric that we report to you, I suspect will creep up over time as a result of that trend. We think that, that's a far better, more thoughtful approach to working with clients is to focus them on the total cost of the outcome that we are providing as opposed to the comment Gordon has made earlier about somewhat irrational pricing on the input side, which is really a zero-sum game."

When I think about the healthcare business, as you saw, we had a reasonable quarter in that, actually a strong quarter in that business. And I think the fundamentals continue to be strong. The one cautionary note I would have there is there've been a number of megamergers that have been announced but yet to be approved by the government in that sector. And so as we go into next year, as we've seen in other M&A environments, you could see a pause in spending, depending on the -- I can't exactly predict when that will be because it will depend on when the government approves so on and so forth. But that's the one thing I'm keeping an eye on. But fundamentals are strong. The need for change in that industry continue to be very, very strong.

So if you look at organic, yes Karen gave some of the number said earlier, it will be less. So, from a supply side, I think we're in good shape. We've taken utilization up. But as I mentioned in my prepared comments, our brand for recruiting across the globe both in college and is the strongest it's ever been there always can be pockets where supplies is constrained like on digital right now. But even there, we're getting more than our fair share of people wanting to work for us. So I feel good from the supply side. From the demand side, obviously clients have to finish their planning cycles and all that, but I think we're well-positioned in terms of assuming that clients continue to shift more towards innovation. That's one of the good news. The bad news is the law of large numbers. As you get bigger each year on a percentage basis, the growth number becomes more challenging even if you're growing similar dollar amount and so forth. So the math long-term works against us.

I would say that it's actually in some senses the more things change, the more they stay the same. If you think back to other big technology shifts, when there are big changes in technology, you tend to see 2 things happen. First, a wave of, as you correctly pointed out, smaller projects that are more pilot and prototype in nature, which typically in the digital world also have the characteristics of requiring more than just technology skills. They require design, they require strategy, they require data science skills and of course deep consulting and domain expertise. And those also by their nature tend to be more,  if you will, on-site in nature. But after this initial phase of prototyping and piloting, those then have to be switched to enterprise scale. And when you get to enterprise scale, that's when you actually have to do the heavy lifting of integration with the legacy scale to hundreds of thousands or millions of users, very high transaction throughputs, some significant amount of performance testing and so on through the life cycle. And that's part of the engagement very much lends itself to the tradition of on-site, offshore delivery model. So we feel very good about the fact that we have such a strong on-site presence and capability in those new areas like strategy, like consulting, like design, like data science.

Thanks for joining us today.We delivered another strong quarter, continuing the momentum we saw in the first half of the year. Q3 revenue of $3.19 billion was up 3.3% over Q2, which exceeded our guidance for",1562,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.
We delivered another strong quarter, continuing the momentum we saw in the first half of the year. Q3 revenue of $3.19 billion was up 3.3% over Q2, which exceeded our guidance for the quarter by over $45 million. Non-GAAP operating margin of 19.4% was within our target range of 19% to 20%. 
Much like the first half of this year, we saw strong demand across our business this quarter, and as a result, we're pleased to raise our full year guidance for the third time this year for revenue to at least $12.41 billion and for non-GAAP EPS to at least $3.03. Our continued momentum reflects a healthy demand environment for Cognizant services that drive innovation, growth and efficiencies in the digital era. The strong relevance of our services portfolio to clients is reflected in our results this quarter, our guidance for the full year and the above-company-average growth in our consulting and technology services.
For a while now, we've used these calls to talk about how we are at the cusp of a once-in-a-decade shift in technology that will drive a sustained period of technological transformation for our clients. Our clients recognize that becoming a digital enterprise is now a necessity, a matter of survival, as businesses, products, people and devices become more connected. Therefore, they are looking for innovative ways to combine their traditional business models and product sets with new and continuously evolving digital technologies. This is leading to a significant change in the way IT and operations budgets are allocated. Clients are recalibrating their spending, moving dollars from ""keep the lights on"" maintenance and operations projects to new digital initiatives that create competitive advantage by enabling new levels of business performance.
We've talked about IT being strategic for years, and that is perhaps more true today than it's ever been, as management teams are looking to technology solutions to propel their businesses forward. Clients traditionally thought of IT as a means to drive productivity and efficiency or what we refer to as run better. Today, the role of IT has evolved beyond that, to reimagine organizations and business models for future growth or what we call run different. This dynamic where our clients have to simultaneously run better and run different is what we refer to as the dual mandate.
Against this backdrop of changing client needs, the approach that services companies like ours need to take is also evolving. Effectively addressing the dual mandate for clients requires partners that can combine strategy, technology and business consulting in one integrated model. However,  equally importantly, serving the dual mandate requires a partner that has a deep understanding of clients' legacy environment and business processes so that these can be leveraged and integrated into new digital backbones. Our strength in the market comes from the fact that we've built this breadth of capabilities at Cognizant, and we've integrated these together in our Digital Works methodology for maximum client impact.
Let me give you an example of a large Financial Services client of ours. I'll refer back to this client example periodically during my remarks to illustrate the key investments we're making and the results we're seeing in the market. We've been working with this client for over a decade now, supporting many of their mission-critical platforms, infrastructure and business operations. Recently, we restructured our engagement with them, where we will be taking them to a best-in-class operating model for their existing business with us. As a result of this transition to best-in-class efficiency, we were able to commit to considerable savings to them on our traditional application management business. This is the ""run better"" part of the dual mandate. 
They, in turn, committed not only those savings back to us in the form of a long-term contract, but also increased their discretionary spending with us considerably. This is the ""run different"" part of the dual mandate. The result is that we have a 10-year contract with them for an annual contract value that's almost 50% higher than their current annual spend with us. This extended partnership also presents opportunities for Cognizant and the client to develop and sell joint go-to market solutions, leveraging our deep expertise and market presence.
Last quarter, we outlined our investments in 4 areas to fully address the needs of our clients to help drive both efficiency and transformation. Let me update you on the progress we've made since then. First, we are building capabilities to enable our clients to drive digital transformation at scale. As I mentioned last quarter, Cognizant is among the few companies that can provide comprehensive digital innovation at an enterprise scale. We do this with our Cognizant Digital Works accelerated methodology, which comprises 3 elements: the idea lab, where we work with clients to identify big themes and prioritize opportunity areas; the Collaboratory, a physical space where we design prototype and iterate specific solutions so clients can visualize the impact on their end users and businesses; and the foundry, where we take these pilot programs and switch them to enterprise scale by utilizing new technology options and integrating them with existing legacy systems.
Our clients appreciate this interdisciplinary approach, and across the industries we serve, we are finding great traction for our Digital Works framework. We recently engaged the Financial Services client I mentioned a few minutes ago in a custom workshop at the Collaboratory for their business and technology leaders. We jointly identified a set of potential opportunities and long-term strategic initiatives that digital is presenting to this customer's business.
Second, consulting is a critical component of our services portfolio. Increasingly, consulting has become an integral part of our comprehensive approach to helping clients drive digital transformation as over 60% of our consulting pipeline is focused in this area. Our matrix structure deeply integrates our consulting team with our technology and business process services delivery organization. This synergy between our consulting and delivery organizations helps the teams work closely together, driving business model change, the reengineering of business processes and organizational change management for our clients' businesses. We continue to invest in both people and capabilities to deepen our industry strength and have over 5,500 consultants globally as of today.
For the Financial Services client that I talked about, our consulting practice played a critical role in driving thought leadership into the 10-year deal. Our consultants worked with the client to identify existing assets that could be extended to address significant business opportunities in  an adjacent industry where they currently don't have a presence. This will potentially drive substantial revenue upside for the client.
Third, we are optimizing traditional services to enable our clients to achieve higher levels of operational efficiency. Today, digital technologies are driving changes in the traditional outsourcing business. The focus in core traditional IT services business, what we call our Horizon 1 services, has shifted from people and processes to people, process and automation. These services are important because clients rely upon them each day to run their businesses. These services are also integral to our ability to drive digital transformation and legacy integration for clients. This means we have to solve today's problems differently by applying innovation and creativity to reorganize and run core processes at an enterprise-wide scale. Sometimes, it also means moving clients to radically different operating models to improve their costs and, at the same time, ensure a high-quality accelerated delivery.
For the Financial Services client that I've been talking about, we will convert our existing arrangement to an end-to-end managed services engagement to streamline their various customer-facing platforms and processes. At the same time, we will transform and digitally enable their core platforms, processes and infrastructure to support digital business while managing their existing IT platforms for optimal efficiency.
And fourth, we are building platform-based solutions and industry utilities that enable clients to achieve new levels of efficiency and, at the same time, deploy digital technologies more quickly. Last year, we took a very definitive step towards strengthening our platform-based solutions portfolio by acquiring TriZetto. We're pleased with the pace of integration of TriZetto and Cognizant capabilities. The combined stack of software products and services from TriZetto and Cognizant have helped open new market segments, allowing Cognizant to bring an integrated solution to the health care market.
We've also seen good traction with our internally developed platform solutions. One such example is the cloud-based big data analytics platform, called BigDecisions, that brings together our clients' traditional enterprise data and digital data, such as voice, device, sensor, social and mobile, under a single umbrella. BigDecisions includes business applications across multiple industries, which help our clients use analytics when making key business decisions. In the case of the Financial Services client referenced so far, we anticipate leveraging BigDecisions to enable this client to monetize their data assets by delivering actionable insights to their clients. In closing, I'd like to say that Cognizant's culture of innovation and adaptability, coupled with our commitment to continuous investment in the business, has positioned us to be the partner of choice for our clients as they navigate this tremendous period of change. 
With that, let me hand the call over to Gordon to discuss our performance and then to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll be back later, as always, to take your questions. Gordon?"

We had another solid quarter that saw strong demand across the business, with particular strength in consulting and technology services as clients continue to focus on implementing digital technologies to drive business transformation. 
Let me now provide additional color on our performance across industries, Horizon 2 businesses and geographies. Our banking and Financial Services segment grew 2.7% sequentially and 18.6% year-over-year, driven primarily by strength in banking. Growth continues to be broad-based across our banking clients who remain focused on cost optimization, vendor  consolidation, regulatory compliance and cybersecurity. We're seeing increased interest in managed services deals with both banking and insurance clients as they continue to look for ways to increase efficiencies in their operations. 
In addition, there is an increased focus on automation and digital, particularly in areas that improve customer experience and customer self-service, office through -- often through harnessing data and analytics to drive real-time decisions. For example, during Q3, Cognizant was chosen to help one of Asia's largest private banks manage the future road map for a consolidated digital platform to sell personal loans, credit cards, auto loans and mortgages, all of which are currently being managed on separate platforms. The consolidated platform is expected to significantly increase conversion,  reduce platform costs and empower the bank with better customer insights.
Another good example is the work we're doing for the National Stock Exchange in India, one of the world's largest exchanges by transaction volumes, to transform its futures and options derivatives trading platform. Given the complex nature of exchange environments, new regulations and  business requirements must be quickly absorbed and integrated to eliminate failures in transaction processing. The platform that Cognizant developed and deployed for tasks such as order matching and message transfers allows  the exchange -- allowed the exchange to successfully process an unprecedented 1 billion orders in a single day.
Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, grew 4.7% sequentially and, including the impact of TriZetto, grew 43.3% year-over-year. As the health care industry shifts from fee-for-service to value-based care models, health care organizations are looking for new ways to deliver customer-centric care while simultaneously looking for ways to drive operational efficiency. We recently announced that the New England Healthcare Exchange Network, NEHEN, a consortium of regional players that provides -- and providers in the Northeast, selected Cognizant and TriZetto to digitally transform and manage its technology infrastructure. NEHEN consists of over 55 hospitals, 8 health insurance plans and tens of thousands of practitioners. Cognizant and TriZetto are enabling NEHEN to deploy an infrastructure that allows members to share costs and improve administrative and clinical processes. 
This win highlights the synergy opportunities brought by the combination of Cognizant and TriZetto. Together, we've won a number of similar deals across payers and providers, combining TriZetto's products and platforms with Cognizant's capabilities in IT, BPO and hosting. As we approach the 1 year anniversary of the TriZetto acquisition, we could not be more pleased with how the integration is progressing. TriZetto employee retention remains high, and we have a strong pipeline of opportunities leveraging the synergies between Cognizant and TriZetto.
Moving on to our Life Sciences business. We had a strong quarter as drug pipelines and product launches have improved for pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Additionally, we saw continued strong demand among our medical device clients. We see an increasing interest in deals which combine cloud technologies and platforms, including our proprietary MedVantage, a cloud-based integrated complaint management solution we built on the Force.com platform. We've had a number of our medical device clients implement MedVantage this year to improve efficiency, reporting and overall service level for their customers.
At the recent Dreamforce event, Salesforce named Cognizant the recipient of the 2015 Salesforce Partner Innovation Award for Healthcare & Life Sciences for our work with Johnson & Johnson. Cognizant helped J&J Medical launch their customer digital engagement model. This digital platform focuses on driving value to J&J's sales team through omnichannel and business function integration, empowering them with the information they need to better understand their customers and patients' needs.
Our retail and manufacturing segment was up 4.8% sequentially and 13.7% year-over-year. Clients are focused on modernizing their technology environment, particularly around supply chain and omnichannel commerce solutions. On the manufacturing side, in particular, we're seeing strong demand around product transformation. For example, we're helping a global packaging equipment manufacturer to transform the packaging equipment they manufacture into smart and connected products, leveraging sensors and the Internet of Things and connecting them with a big data analytics platform. This engagement involved organizational change management, business model innovation and machine-to-machine connectivity and will help our client reduce operating cost and deliver new value to their customers.
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech, communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was down 0.5% sequentially and up 15.2% year-over-year. We saw a pause in spend with clients in the communication sector on the back of a wave of M&A deals in that space.
Let me now turn to our Horizon 2 service lines. We continue to be pleased with the above-company-average growth we're seeing across these 3 businesses: Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Infrastructure Services and Cognizant Business Process Services. 
As Frank mentioned earlier, Cognizant Business Consulting continues to be a critical competitive differentiator for us. As clients undergo enterprise-wide transformation, our consulting practice plays an important role through capabilities such as technology, business and digital strategy, operational improvement, program and change management and process redesign. 
Cognizant Infrastructure Services continues to see strong growth, primarily in solutions that drive simplification, predictable operations and accelerated delivery. Increasingly, there's a strong focus on automation and IT operations, driving business agility through deploying cloud solutions.
Cognizant Business Process Services saw continued success during the quarter, led by work with our high-tech, insurance and banking clients. Infusing technology and automation in core business processes is critical to helping clients achieve greater levels of operational efficiencies while also enhancing business outcomes through data analytics. 
Let me now shift to geographies. From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 3.6% sequentially and 26.7% year-over-year. Europe was up 1.4% sequentially and 7.8% from last year after a 10.4% negative currency impact. The U.K. grew approximately 1% sequentially and 8.3% year-over-year, and Continental Europe grew 2.2% sequentially and 7.2% over prior year. Finally, we saw a continued strong traction in the rest of the world, which was up 5.3% sequentially and 31% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in our key markets in Asia, such as Singapore and Australia.
I'll now provide some color on our business operations. Similar to last quarter, quarterly annualized attrition remained at 20%, which is above our desired range. We're committed to improving our retention levels through various employee engagement initiatives. Faster company growth, well-defined career paths, unique learning and re-skilling opportunities and our practice of sharing the rewards of our strong company performance with our employees continues to make Cognizant a very highly attractive employer. Delivering strong revenue performance this year, combined with our continued success in driving higher operational efficiency, was only possible through the efforts of our incredible staff around the globe, and we believe that they should share in these accomplishments. 
Our performance during the quarter enabled us to increase our year-to-date bonus accruals to levels well above last year. In fact, our brand, which is a reflection of our attractiveness as an employer, has never been stronger. This was validated by the success we've seen in our global campus recruiting program this year. We've expanded our campus footprint, recruiting now from over 30 leading universities and business schools in the United States as well as another 30 top schools across Europe. This campus hiring program has helped us expand our in-country and resource centers. In India, this year, we saw tremendous success in our campus hiring across premium engineering campuses. On campuses where students receive multiple offers from Cognizant and other Tier 1 companies, on average, 75% of those students chose Cognizant over others.
Throughout this call, we've highlighted how we're winning in digital, driving leadership in industries and markets we serve and how we are seeing good traction for our platforms and as-a-service models. We're proud of our performance and are pleased that this is being recognized by leading industry analysts, sourcing advisers and other influencers. In the past few weeks, Cognizant has been recognized by these industry analysts as a leader in Internet of Things, business intelligence consulting, robotic process automation and insurance as a service.
With that, let me turn the call over to Karen to review our financial results"
386024,312428817,891682,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Gordon, and good morning, everyone. As Frank mentioned, we are pleased to have delivered another strong quarter. Third quarter revenue of $3.19 billion exceeded our prior guidance by over $45 million and represented growth of 3.3% sequentially",832,"Thank you, Gordon, and good morning, everyone. As Frank mentioned, we are pleased to have delivered another strong quarter. Third quarter revenue of $3.19 billion exceeded our prior guidance by over $45 million and represented growth of 3.3% sequentially and 23.5% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, we had an approximately $72.4 million negative currency headwind, which impacted revenue growth by 280 basis points. 
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.4%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. As expected, the non-GAAP operating margins declined from Q2 as we absorbed the impact of compensation increases beginning July 1. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.76 exceeded guidance by $0.01.
Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 58% and 42% of revenue, respectively, for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 4 .6% sequentially and 34.2% year-over-year. Outsourcing services were up 1.5% sequentially and grew 11.1% from Q3 a year ago. During Q3, we saw a continuation of the trend we have seen in recent quarters, whereby clients are shifting spend from legacy application maintenance towards projects-based works, including digital and other transformational programs.
During the third quarter, 37% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts, and as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 7 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 292. 
During the quarter, we had approximately 1,300 net employee additions, and we ended the quarter with approximately 219,300 employees globally. Approximately 205,000 of our employees were service delivery staff. As expected, utilization was up on a sequential basis. Offshore utilization increased by almost 300 basis points sequentially to approximately 76%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was approximately 81%, and on-site utilization was approximately 94% during the quarter, up 100 basis points from Q2.
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with just over $4 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $484 million from the quarter ending June 30 and down by approximately $568 million from the year-ago period. 
Total receivables were $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter, and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 70.6 days. This is down from 71.9 days in Q2. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $421 million, up from $387 million at the end of Q2. We billed approximately 55% of the Q3 unbilled balance in October. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables and ramp-up of certain fixed-bid contracts.
Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $950 million at the end of the quarter. And during the quarter, we repaid $100 million outstanding balance on our revolver.
Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated approximately $818 million. Financing activities during the quarter were approximately a $249 million use of cash, and capital expenditures were approximately $65 million during the quarter.
During the third quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for a total cost of $156 million, and our fully diluted share count decreased approximately 1 million shares to 612.7 million shares for the quarter. To date, we have repurchased approximately 40.5 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.5 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion and have $480 million remaining unutilized.
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q4 and the full year. As Frank mentioned, we are increasing our full year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect the healthy demand environment and the overperformance during quarter 3. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance to at least $12.41 billion, representing revenue growth of at least 21% over 2014. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not include additional potential currency fluctuations over the remainder of the year.
For the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect to deliver revenue of at least $3.23 billion, representing sequential revenue growth of at least 1.3%. As is the typical pattern in the fourth quarter, client furloughs, seasonality of our retail practice and fewer billing days will have an impact on sequential revenue growth.
During the fourth quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For Q4, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.77. Non-GAAP EPS excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613 million shares. We are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.03 to at least $3.03. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25.5%.

We will always supplement our organic growth with acquisitions, either to strengthen a  geographic presence, industry strength or technology and service line. These largely are tuck-under acquisitions. Obviously, the TriZetto acquisition was outlier, but we continue to look at tuck-under acquisitions to supplement that. From a capital allocation standpoint, as you've seen both this third quarter and second quarter, each quarter we repurchased about $150 million worth of stock to target share neutrality.

So the slow growth in net headcount is not driven by attrition. That's driven by a very conscious decision we had this year to significantly  improve our operational excellence and take our utilization up, which we successfully did while maintaining customer satisfaction. So -- and we're largely done with that process. I think we're pretty -- give or take, pretty much at the utilization levels that we want as we go into 2016. So we don't guide to quarter-to-quarter headcount growth. Still, I think we still have a little bit of room offshore on utilization, which you might see in Q4, but then it starts to level out over that. On attrition, attrition being up is not just us. As you know, it's the industry. But it's one where when I look at the opportunity for us, clearly, we should have lower attrition given we have unparalleled career opportunities for our employees given the success we have on the digital side, the overall growth rates. So we're redoubling our efforts there to make sure that employees have the career growth, that we share the rewards, as I have said, and no doubt, to our entire company right after this call, saying because of what they've delivered on revenue growth, what they've delivered on operational performance, we're going to share those rewards and pay out bonuses well above last year. So we'll keep working on it. I'd be concerned if we were an outlier, but we're not an outlier on the attrition."

It's -- we've spent a lot of time looking at what's going on. We're clearly seeing a bifurcation in the market, and that's leading competitors who can compete on both sides of the dual mandate and those who can't compete on both sides of dual mandate and, therefore, focus more on price. What we've seen, and I'm sure some of you have heard about it, there've been some isolated instances of irrational pricing in the market. But let me be clear, overall, pricing remains stable. These spots of irrational pricing is consistent with what we've seen historically in the market as there have been big technology shifts. And some players are having trouble with that shift and,  therefore, act irrationally in their core market. We also -- I want to be very clear. We believe this is a short-term phenomenon. The fundamentals of the industry, input costs, facilities, travel, haven't shifted enough to warrant this change, and we're also seeing some of the competitors make considerable assumptions about productivity gains driven by new automation technologies, which we don't think are yet enterprise reality. Frank has touched base on that earlier. We think some people out there are making assumptions that we scratch our head a little bit about. Will they be able to achieve that? Or is it wishful thinking? Often, when you see these sorts of unrealistic assumptions about productivity built into bids, what you see is players shore up their profitability by cutting corners, and historically, this has resulted in unhappy clients. And we're already beginning to see that o the market. Some of -- in some instances where there's been irrational pricing, that client is actually pretty unhappy now as they're getting service from one of our -- one or more of our competitors, and that competitor is cutting corners. And also, it impacts employee morale because of how you have to squeeze the employee. So when we step back and look at it, when we look at our overall book of business, things are very stable, and we feel fine about pricing. We're watching these pockets of irrationality, but we're not particularly worried about it because what we're seeing is, very quickly, the customer understands you get what you pay for, and we're seeing dissatisfaction where customers have gone with someone who's bid irrationally. So we got to watch it, but at this point, we don't think it's long-term trend. We don't think it's impacting our book of business. And ultimately, I think it may be good for our reputation as clients have dissatisfaction with some of the other competitors."

Just building on what Gordon said a minute ago. It is absolutely true that on the ""run better"" side of our business, clients are still looking for greater levels of efficiency and effectiveness. And so we are focusing clients on looking at total cost of ownership and looking at the output and the outcomes that we deliver and driving output and outcomes to best-in-class, world-class levels. And so as a result of that, you will see a continued shift in our business towards more output and outcome-based models. And the fixed-price metric that we report to you, I suspect will creep up over time as a result of that trend. We think that, that's the far better, more thoughtful approach to working with clients, is to focus them on the total cost of the outcome that we're providing as opposed to the comment Gordon's made earlier about somewhat irrational pricing on the input side, which is really a zero-sum game."

When I think about the Healthcare business, as you saw, we had a reasonable quarter in that -- actually a strong quarter in that business, and I think the fundamentals continue to be strong. The one cautionary note I would have there is there have been a number of mega mergers that have been announced but yet to be approved by the government in that sector. And so as we go into next year, as we've seen in other M&A environments, you could see a pause in spending, depending on the -- I can't exactly predict when that will be because it will depend on when the government approves it and so on and so forth.

From the demand side, obviously, clients have to finish their planning cycles and all that, but I think we're well positioned in terms of assuming that clients continue to shift more towards innovation.

I would say that it's actually -- in some senses, the more things change, the more they stay the same. If you think back to other big technology shifts, when there are big changes in technology, you tend to see 2 things happen. First, a wave of, as you correctly pointed out, smaller projects that are more pilot and prototype in nature, which typic -- in the digital world, also have the characteristic of requiring more than just technology skills. They require design. They require strategy. They require data science skills and, of course, deep consulting and domain expertise. And those also, by their nature, tend to be more, if you will, on-site in nature. But after this initial phase of prototyping and piloting, those then have to be switched to enterprise scale. And when you get to enterprise scale, that's when you actually have to do the heavy lifting of integration with legacy scale to hundreds of thousands or millions of users, very high transaction throughputs, some significant amount of performance testing and so on through the life cycle. And that part of the engagement is very much -- very much lends itself to the traditional on-site, offshore delivery model. So we feel very good about the fact that we have such a strong on-site presence and capability in those new areas, like strategy, like consulting, like design, like data science. And we're able to actively and very seamlessly combine that with our offshore delivery model so that we can take a client through all 3 phases of the Digital Works methodology, from what we call idea lab, through Collaboratory and then through foundry, to create a seamless end-to-end scaled experience for clients."

And just as a follow-up question on the integration of deals next year. Just what would you expect we should look for in terms of impact when you have a number of clients going through integration like that?

But if you think about historical M&A patterns, Darrin, traditionally, M&A creates a substantial amount of technology and business process integration opportunity for us.

And so I think you might see -- my best assumption is that you might see a temporary pause during the phase of integration planning, but then I think it will result in significant M&A integration work for us once integration kicks off and is in full swing. That's my best hypothesis at this point. Again, no crystal balls here. I would say that the pipeline of synergy opportunities between Cognizant and TriZetto is very strong. There are -- I would say the synergies largely fall into a couple of different categories. We have great opportunities to take the TriZetto clients to and offer them a broader range of Cognizant services around, for example, things like the BP -- Business Process Services on top of the TriZetto platform, Cognizant Infrastructure Services to host and run the TriZetto platform. And then in the medium and longer term, we also have opportunities around Health Net-style deals, utility-type deals, where we can work with TriZetto clients to take full end-to-end responsibility, like we had proposed to do with Health Net some months ago. So we feel very good about the pipeline of opportunities that we have in -- around the TriZetto synergies.

We delivered another strong quarter, continuing the momentum we saw in the first half of the year. Q3 revenue of $3.19 billion was up 3.3% over Q2, which exceeded our guidance for the quarter by over $45 million. Non-GAAP operating margin of 19.4% was within our target range of 19% to 20%. 
Much like the first half of this year, we saw strong demand across our business this quarter and, as a result, we're pleased to raise our full year guidance for the third time this year for revenue to at least $12.41 billion and for non-GAAP EPS to at least $3.03. 
Our continued momentum reflects a healthy demand environment for Cognizant services that drive innovation, growth and efficiencies in the digital era. The strong relevance of our services portfolio to clients is reflected in our results this quarter, our guidance for the full year and the above-company average growth in our consulting and technology services.
For a while now, we've used these calls to talk about how we are at the cusp of a once-in-a-decade shift in technology that will drive a sustained period of technological transformation for our clients. Our clients recognize that becoming a digital enterprise is now a necessity, a matter of survival, as businesses, products, people and devices become more connected. Therefore, they are looking for innovative ways to combine their traditional business models and product sets with new and continuously evolving digital technologies. This is leading to a significant change in the way IT and operations budgets are allocated. Clients are recalibrating their spending, moving dollars from ""keep the lights on"" maintenance and operations projects to new digital initiatives that create competitive advantage by enabling new levels of business performance.
We've talked about IT being strategic for years, and that is perhaps more true today than it's ever been, as management teams are looking to technology solutions to propel their businesses forward. Clients traditionally thought of IT as a means to drive productivity and efficiency or what we refer to as run better. Today, the role of IT has evolved beyond that, to reimagine organizations and business models for future growth or what we call run different. This dynamic, where our clients have to simultaneously run better and run different, is what we refer to as the dual mandate.
Against this backdrop of changing client needs, the approach that services companies like ours need to take is also evolving. Effectively addressing the dual mandate for clients requires partners that can combine strategy, technology and business consulting in one integrated model. However, equally importantly, serving the dual mandate requires a partner that has a deep understanding of clients' legacy environments and business processes so that these can be leveraged and integrated into new digital backbones. Our strength in the market comes from the fact that we've built this breadth of capabilities at Cognizant, and we've integrated these together in our Digital Works methodology for maximum client impact.
Let me give you an example of a large Financial Services client of ours. I'll refer back to this client example periodically during my remarks to illustrate the key investments we're making and the results we're seeing in the market. We've been working with this client for over a decade now, supporting many of their mission-critical platforms, infrastructure and business operations. Recently, we restructured our engagement with them, where we will be taking them to a best-in-class operating model for their existing business with us. As a result of this transition to best-in-class efficiency, we were able to commit to considerable savings to them on our traditional application management business. This is the ""run better"" part of the dual mandate. 
They, in turn, committed not only those savings back to us in the form of a long-term contract, but also increased their discretionary spending with us considerably. This is the ""run different"" part of the dual mandate. The result is that we have a 10-year contract with them for an annual contract value that's almost 50% higher than their current annual spend with us. This extended partnership also presents opportunities for Cognizant and the client to develop and sell joint go-to market solutions, leveraging our deep expertise and market presence.
Last quarter, we outlined our investments in 4 areas to fully address the needs of our clients to help drive both efficiency and transformation. Let me update you on the progress we've made since then. First, we are building capabilities to enable our clients to drive digital transformation at scale. As I mentioned last quarter, Cognizant is among the few companies that can provide comprehensive digital innovation at an enterprise scale. We do this with our Cognizant Digital Works Accelerator methodology, which comprises 3 elements: the idea lab, where we work with clients to identify big themes and prioritize opportunity areas; the Collaboratory, a physical space where we design prototype and iterate specific solutions so clients can visualize the impact on their end users and businesses; and the foundry, where we take these pilot programs and switch them to enterprise scale by utilizing new technology options and integrating them with existing legacy systems.
Our clients appreciate this interdisciplinary approach and, across the industries we serve, we are finding great traction for our Digital Works framework. We recently engaged the Financial Services client I mentioned a few minutes ago in a custom workshop at the Collaboratory for their business and technology leaders. We jointly identified a set of potential opportunities and long-term strategic initiatives that digital is presenting to this customer's business.
Second, consulting is a critical component of our services portfolio. Increasingly, consulting has become an integral part of our comprehensive approach to helping clients drive digital transformation, as over 60% of our consulting pipeline is focused in this area. Our matrix structure deeply integrates our consulting team with our technology and business process services delivery organization. This synergy between our consulting and delivery organizations helps the teams work closely together, driving business model change, the reengineering of business processes and organizational change management for our clients' businesses. We continue to invest in both people and capabilities to deepen our industry strength and have over 5,500 consultants globally as of today.
For the Financial Services client that I talked about, our consulting practice played a critical role in driving thought leadership into the 10-year deal. Our consultants worked with the client to identify existing assets that could be extended to address significant business opportunities in an adjacent industry where they currently don't have a presence. This will potentially drive substantial revenue upside for the client.
Third, we are optimizing traditional services to enable our clients to achieve higher levels of operational efficiency. Today, digital technologies are driving changes in the traditional outsourcing business. The focus in core traditional IT services business, what we call our Horizon 1 services, has shifted from people and processes to people, process and automation. These services are important because clients rely upon them each day to run their businesses. These services are also integral to our ability to drive digital transformation and legacy integration for clients. This means we have to solve today's problems differently by applying innovation and creativity to reorganize and run core processes at an enterprise-wide scale. Sometimes, it also means moving clients to radically different operating models to improve their costs and, at the same time, ensure a high-quality accelerated delivery.
For the Financial Services client that I've been talking about, we will convert our existing arrangement to an end-to-end managed services engagement to streamline their various customer-facing platforms and processes. At the same time, we will transform and digitally enable their core platforms, processes and infrastructure to support digital business while managing their existing IT platform for optimal efficiency.
And fourth, we are building platform-based solutions and industry utilities that enable clients to achieve new levels of efficiency and, at the same time, deploy digital technologies more quickly. Last year, we took a very definitive step towards strengthening our platform-based solutions portfolio by acquiring TriZetto. We're pleased with the pace of integration of TriZetto and Cognizant capabilities. The combined stack of software products and services from TriZetto and Cognizant have helped open new market segments, allowing Cognizant to bring an integrated solution to the health care market.
We've also seen good traction with our internally developed platform solutions. One such example is the cloud-based big data analytics platform, called BigDecisions, that brings together our clients' traditional enterprise data and digital data, such as voice, device, sensor, social and mobile, under a single umbrella. BigDecisions includes business applications across multiple industries, which help our clients use analytics when making key business decisions. In the case of the Financial Services client referenced so far, we anticipate leveraging BigDecisions to enable this client to monetize their data assets by delivering actionable insights to their clients. 
In closing, I'd like to say that Cognizant's culture of innovation and adaptability, coupled with our commitment to continuous investment in the business, has positioned us to be the partner of choice for our clients as they navigate this tremendous period of change. 
With that, let me hand the call over to Gordon to discuss our performance and then to Karen to provide more financial details. I'll be back later, as always, to take your questions. Gordon?"

We had another solid quarter that saw strong demand across the business, with particular strength in consulting and technology services as clients continue to focus on implementing digital technologies to drive business transformation. 
Let me now provide additional color on our performance across industries, Horizon 2 businesses and geographies. Our banking and Financial Services segment grew 2.7% sequentially and 18.6% year-over-year, driven primarily by strength in banking. Growth continues to be broad-based across our banking clients who remain focused on cost optimization, vendor consolidation, regulatory compliance and cybersecurity. We're seeing increased interest in managed services deals with both banking and insurance clients as they continue to look for ways to increase efficiencies in their operations. 
In addition, there is an increased focus on automation and digital, particularly in areas that improve customer experience and customer self-service, office through -- often through harnessing data and analytics to drive real-time decisions. For example, during Q3, Cognizant was chosen to help one of Asia's largest private banks manage the future road map for a consolidated digital platform to sell personal loans, credit cards, auto loans and mortgages, all of which are currently being managed on separate platforms. The consolidated platform is expected to significantly increase conversion, reduce platform costs and empower the bank with better customer insights.
Another good example is the work we're doing for the National Stock Exchange in India, one of the world's largest exchanges by transaction volumes, to transform its futures and options derivatives trading platform, given the complex nature of exchange environments, new regulations and business requirements must be quickly absorbed and integrated to eliminate failures in transaction processing. The platform that Cognizant developed and deployed for tasks such as order matching and message transfers allows the exchange -- allowed the exchange to successfully process an unprecedented 1 billion orders in a single day.
Our Healthcare segment, which consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device clients, grew 4.7% sequentially and, including the impact of TriZetto, grew 43.3% year-over-year. As the health care industry shifts from fee-for-service to value-based care models, health care organizations are looking for new ways to deliver customer-centric care while simultaneously looking for ways to drive operational efficiency. 
We recently announced that the New England Healthcare Exchange Network, NEHEN, a consortium of regional players that provides -- and providers in the Northeast, selected Cognizant and TriZetto to digitally transform and manage its technology infrastructure. NEHEN consists of over 55 hospitals, 8 health insurance plans and tens of thousands of practitioners. Cognizant and TriZetto are enabling NEHEN to deploy an infrastructure that allows members to share costs and improve administrative and clinical processes. 
This win highlights the synergy opportunities brought by the combination of Cognizant and TriZetto. Together, we've won a number of similar deals across payers and providers, combining TriZetto's products and platforms with Cognizant's capabilities in IT, BPO and hosting. As we approach the 1 year anniversary of the TriZetto acquisition, we could not be more pleased with how the integration is progressing. TriZetto employee retention remains high, and we have a strong pipeline of opportunities leveraging the synergies between Cognizant and TriZetto.
Moving on to our Life Sciences business. We had a strong quarter as drug pipelines and product launches have improved for pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Additionally, we saw continued strong demand among our medical device clients. We see an increasing interest in deals which combine cloud technologies and platforms, including our proprietary MedVantage, a cloud-based integrated complaint management solution we built on the Force.com platform. We've had a number of our medical device clients implement MedVantage this year to improve efficiency, reporting and overall service level for their customers.
At the recent Dreamforce event, Salesforce named Cognizant the recipient of the 2015 Salesforce Partner Innovation Award for Healthcare & Life Sciences for our work with Johnson & Johnson. Cognizant helped J&J Medical launch their customer digital engagement model. This digital platform focuses on driving value to J&J's sales team through omnichannel and business function integration, empowering them with the information they need to better understand their customers' and patients' needs.
Our retail and manufacturing segment was up 4.8% sequentially and 13.7% year-over-year. Clients are focused on modernizing their technology environment, particularly around supply chain and omnichannel commerce solutions. On the manufacturing side, in particular, we're seeing strong demand around product transformation. For example, we're helping a global packaging equipment manufacturer to transform the packaging equipment they manufacture into smart and connected products, leveraging sensors and the Internet of Things and connecting them with a big data analytics platform. This engagement involved organizational change management, business model innovation and machine-to-machine connectivity and will help our client reduce operating costs and deliver new value to their customers.
Our Other segment, which includes high-tech, communications and information, media and entertainment clients, was down 0.5% sequentially and up 15.2% year-over-year. We saw a pause in spend with clients in the communication sector on the back of a wave of M&A deals in that space.
Let me now turn to our Horizon 2 service lines. We continue to be pleased with the above-company average growth we're seeing across these 3 businesses: Cognizant Business Consulting, Cognizant Infrastructure Services and Cognizant Business Process Services. 
As Frank mentioned earlier, Cognizant Business Consulting continues to be a critical competitive differentiator for us. As clients undergo enterprise-wide transformation, our consulting practice plays an important role through capabilities such as technology, business and digital strategy, operational improvement, program and change management and process redesign. 
Cognizant Infrastructure Services continues to see strong growth, primarily in solutions that drive simplification, predictable operations and accelerated delivery. Increasingly, there's a strong focus on automation and IT operations, driving business agility through deploying cloud solutions.
Cognizant Business Process Services saw continued success during the quarter, led by work with our high-tech, insurance and banking clients. Infusing technology and automation in core business processes is critical to helping clients achieve greater levels of operational efficiencies while also enhancing business outcomes through data analytics. 
Let me now shift to geographies. From a geographic standpoint, North America grew 3.6% sequentially and 26.7% year-over-year. Europe was up 1.4% sequentially and 7.8% from last year after a 10.4% negative currency impact. The U.K. grew approximately 1% sequentially and 8.3% year-over-year, and Continental Europe grew 2.2% sequentially and 7.2% over prior year. Finally, we saw a continued strong traction in the rest of the world, which was up 5.3% sequentially and 31% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by strength in our key markets in Asia, such as Singapore and Australia.
I'll now provide some color on our business operations. Similar to last quarter, quarterly annualized attrition remained at 20%, which is above our desired range. We're committed to improving our retention levels through various employee engagement initiatives. Faster company growth, well-defined career paths, unique learning and re-skilling opportunities and our practice of sharing the rewards of our strong company performance with our employees continues to make Cognizant a very highly attractive employer. 
Delivering strong revenue performance this year, combined with our continued success in driving higher operational efficiency, was only possible through the efforts of our incredible staff around the globe, and we believe that they should share in these accomplishments. Our performance during the quarter enabled us to increase our year-to-date bonus accrual to levels well above last year. 
In fact, our brand, which is a reflection of our attractiveness as an employer, has never been stronger. This was validated by the success we've seen in our global campus recruiting program this year. We've expanded our campus footprint, recruiting now from over 30 leading universities and business schools in the United States, as well as another 30 top schools across Europe. This campus hiring program has helped us expand our in-country and near-shore centers. In India, this year, we saw tremendous success in our campus hiring across premium engineering campuses. On campuses where students receive multiple offers from Cognizant and other Tier 1 companies, on average, 75% of those students chose Cognizant over others.
Throughout this call, we've highlighted how we're winning in digital, driving leadership in industries and markets we serve and how we are seeing good traction for our platforms and as-a-service models. We're proud of our performance and are pleased that this is being recognized by leading industry analysts, sourcing advisers and other influencers. In the past few weeks, Cognizant has been recognized by these industry analysts as a leader in Internet of Things, business intelligence consulting, robotic process automation and insurance as a service.
With that, let me turn the call over to Karen to review our financial results"

As Frank mentioned, we are pleased to have delivered another strong quarter. Third quarter revenue of $3.19 billion exceeded our prior guidance by over $45 million and represented growth of 3.3% sequentially and 23.5% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, we had an approximately $72.4 million negative currency headwind, which impacted revenue growth by 280 basis points. 
Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, was 19.4%, within our target range of 19% to 20%. As expected, the non-GAAP operating margins declined from Q2 as we absorbed the impact of compensation increases beginning July 1. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.76 exceeded guidance by $0.01.
Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 58% and 42% of revenue, respectfully (sic) [respectively], for the quarter. Consulting and technology services increased 4.6% sequentially and 34.2% year-over-year. Outsourcing services were up 1.5% sequentially and grew 11.1% from Q3 a year ago. During Q3, we saw a continuation of the trend we have seen in recent quarters, whereby clients are shifting spend from legacy application maintenance towards project-based work, including digital and other transformational programs.
During the third quarter, 37% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts and, as expected, overall pricing was stable. We added 7 strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 292. 
During the quarter, we had approximately 1,300 net employee additions, and we ended the quarter with approximately 219,300 employees globally. Approximately 205,000 of our employees were service delivery staff. 
As expected, utilization was up on a sequential basis. Offshore utilization increased by almost 300 basis points sequentially to approximately 76%. Offshore utilization, excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program, was approximately 81%, and on-site utilization was approximately 94% during the quarter, up 100 basis points from Q2.
Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with just over $4 billion of cash and short-term investments, up by approximately $484 million from the quarter ending June 30 and down by approximately $568 million from the year-ago period. 
Total receivables were $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter, and we finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 70.6 days. This is down from 71.9 days in Q2. The unbilled portion of our receivables balance was approximately $421 million, up from $387 million at the end of Q2. We billed approximately 55% of the Q3 unbilled balance in October. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables and ramp-up of certain fixed-bid contracts.
Our outstanding debt balance was approximately $950 million at the end of the quarter. And during the quarter, we repaid $100 million outstanding balance on our revolver.
Turning to cash flow. Operating activities generated approximately $818 million. Financing activities during the quarter were approximately a $249 million use of cash, and capital expenditures were approximately $65 million during the quarter.
During the third quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for a total cost of $156 million, and our fully diluted share count decreased approximately 1 million shares to 612.7 million shares for the quarter. To date, we have repurchased approximately 40.5 million shares for a total cost of approximately $1.5 billion under our stock repurchase authorization of $2 billion and have $480 million remaining unutilized.
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q4 and the full year. As Frank mentioned, we are increasing our full year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect the healthy demand environment and the overperformance during quarter 3. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance to at least $12.41 billion, representing revenue growth of at least 21% over 2014. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not include additional potential currency fluctuations over the remainder of the year.
For the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect to deliver revenue of at least $3.23 billion, representing sequential revenue growth of at least 1.3%. As is the typical pattern in the fourth quarter, client furloughs, seasonality of our retail practice and fewer billing days will have an impact on sequential revenue growth.
During the fourth quarter and for the full year, we expect to operate within our target non-GAAP operating margin range of 19% to 20%. For Q4, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.77. Non-GAAP EPS excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses and amortization. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613 million shares. We are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.03 to at least $3.03. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 613 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 25.5%.

These largely are tuck-under acquisitions. Obviously, the TriZetto acquisition was a outlier, but we continue to look at tuck-under acquisitions to supplement that.

Still, I think we still have a little bit of room offshore on utilization, which you might see in Q4, but then it starts to level out over that. On attrition, attrition being up is not just us. As you know, it's the industry. But it's one where when I look at the opportunity for us, clearly, we should have lower attrition given we have unparalleled career opportunities for our employees given the success we have on the digital side, the overall growth rates. So we're redoubling our efforts there to make sure that employees have the career growth, that we share the rewards, as I have said, and we're sending a note out to our entire company right after this call, saying because of what they've delivered on revenue growth, what they've delivered on operational performance, we're going to share those rewards and pay out bonuses well above last year.

It's -- we've spent a lot of time looking at what's going on. We're clearly seeing a bifurcation in the market, and that's leading competitors who can compete on both sides of the dual mandate and those who can't compete on both sides of the dual mandate and, therefore, focus more on price. What we've seen, and I'm sure some of you have heard about it, there have been some isolated instances of irrational pricing in the market. But let me be clear, overall, pricing remains stable. This -- spots of irrational pricing is consistent with what we've seen historically in the market as there have been big technology shifts. And some players are having trouble with that shift and, therefore, act irrationally in their core market. We also -- I want to be very clear. We believe this is a short-term phenomenon. The fundamentals of the industry, input costs, facilities, travel haven't shifted enough to warrant this change, and we're also seeing some of the competitors make considerable assumptions about productivity gains driven by new automation technologies, which we don't think are yet enterprise reality. Frank has touched base on that earlier. We think some people out there are making assumptions that we scratch our head a little bit about will they be able to achieve that or is it wishful thinking? Often, when you see these sorts of unrealistic assumptions about productivity built into bids, what you see is players shore up their profitability by cutting corners, and historically, this has resulted in unhappy clients. And we're already beginning to see that in the market. Some of -- in some instances where there's been irrational pricing, that client is actually pretty unhappy now as they're getting service from one of our -- one or more of our competitors, and that competitor is cutting corners. And it also impacts employee morale because of how you have to squeeze the employee. So when we step back and look at it, when we look at our overall book of business, things are very stable and we feel fine about pricing. We're watching these pockets of irrationality, but we're not particularly worried about it because what we're seeing is, very quickly, the customer understands you get what you pay for, and we're seeing dissatisfaction where customers have gone with someone who's bid irrationally. So we got to watch it, but at this point, we don't think it's a long-term trend. We don't think it's impacting our book of business. And ultimately, I think it may be good for our reputation as clients have dissatisfaction with some of the other competitors."

Just building on what Gordon said a minute ago. It is absolutely true that on the ""run better"" side of our business, clients are still looking for greater levels of efficiency and effectiveness. And so we are focusing clients on looking at total cost of ownership and looking at the output and the outcomes that we deliver and driving output and outcomes to best-in-class, world-class levels. And so as a result of that, you will see a continued shift in our business towards more output and outcome-based models. And the fixed-price metric that we report to you, I suspect will creep up over time as a result of that trend. We think that that's the far better, more thoughtful approach to working with clients, is to focus them on the total cost of the outcome that we're providing as opposed to the comment Gordon's made earlier about somewhat irrational pricing on the input side, which is really a zero-sum game."

I think at the macro level, I think if you break it into the 2 large component pieces, we feel pretty good about Life Sciences going into next year. Drug pipelines are healthy again across the industry. We're seeing good traction. So we feel pretty good about the Life Sciences side of the business. When I think about the Healthcare business, as you saw, we had a reasonable quarter in that -- actually a strong quarter in that business, and I think the fundamentals continue to be strong. The one cautionary note I would have there is, as you know, there have been a number of mega mergers that have been announced but yet to be approved by the government in that sector. And so as we go into next year, as we've seen in other M&A environments, you could see a pause in spending, depending on the -- I can't exactly predict when that will be because it will depend on when the government approves it and so on and so forth. But that's the one thing that I'm keeping an eye on. But fundamentals are strong. The need for change in that industry continues to be very, very strong; lots of opportunities for technology to bring competitive advantage to the industry to drive greater degrees of efficiency. So over the long run, I continue to be very optimistic about health care, both sides of health care and particularly so because we've got a very strong set of assets with the TriZetto acquisition combined with the traditional Cognizant strength. So we're well positioned in the industry."

So it's -- if you look at organic, yes, Karen gave some of the numbers earlier, it'd be less. So from a supply side, I think we're in good shape. The -- we've taken utilization up. But as I mentioned in my prepared comments, our brand for recruiting across the globe, both in college and lateral, is the strongest it's ever been. There always can be pockets where supply is constrained, like on digital right now. But even there, we're getting more than our fair share of people wanting to work for us. So I feel good from the supply side. From the demand side, obviously, clients have to finish their planning cycles and all that, but I think we're well positioned in terms of assuming that clients continue to shift more towards innovation. That's all the good news. The bad news is the law of large numbers. As you get bigger each year on a percentage basis, the growth number becomes more challenging even if you're growing similar dollar amounts and so forth. So the math, long term, works against us. But as I've said many times, that's not a straight line. You have some years where you go up in growth rates, some years where you go down and so forth. But we feel good about supply. We feel good about our pipeline going into the year. But we do have the headwind of the law of large numbers. And as Frank mentioned, there's been some M&A that may close next year, and we just got to keep an eye on that. And we'll certainly plan for the worse, hope for the best. And historically, the best has happened for us, but you always want to be cautious on that until you know the best is going to happen."

I would say that it's actually -- in some senses, the more things change, the more they stay the same. If you think back to other big technology shifts, when there are big changes in technology, you tend to see 2 things happen. First, a wave of, as you correctly pointed out, smaller projects that are more pilot and prototype in nature, which in the digital world, also have the characteristic of requiring more than just technology skills. They require design. They require strategy. They require data science skills and, of course, deep consulting and domain expertise. And those also, by their nature, tend to be more, if you will, on-site in nature. But after this initial phase of prototyping and piloting, those then have to be switched to enterprise scale. And when you get to enterprise scale, that's when you actually have to do the heavy lifting of integration with legacy, scale to hundreds of thousands or millions of users, very high transaction throughputs, some significant amount of performance testing and so on through the life cycle. And that part of the engagement is very much -- very much lends itself to the traditional on-site, offshore delivery model. So we feel very good about the fact that we have such a strong on-site presence and capability in those new areas, like strategy, like consulting, like design, like data science. And we're able to actively and very seamlessly combine that with our offshore delivery model so that we can take a client through all 3 phases of the Digital Works methodology, from what we call idea lab, through Collaboratory and then through foundry, to create a seamless end-to-end scaled experience for clients."

But if you think about historical M&A patterns, Darrin, traditionally, M&A creates a substantial amount of technology and business process integration opportunity for us.

And so I think you might see -- my best assumption is that you might see a temporary pause during the phase of integration planning, but then I think it will result in significant M&A integration work for us once integration kicks off and is in full swing. That's my best hypothesis at this point. Again, no crystal balls here. I would say that the pipeline of synergy opportunities between Cognizant and TriZetto is very strong. There are -- I would say the synergies largely fall into a couple of different categories. We have great opportunities to take the TriZetto clients to -- and offer them a broader range of Cognizant services around, for example, things like the BP -- Business Process Services on top of the TriZetto platform, Cognizant Infrastructure Services to host and run the TriZetto platform. And then, in the medium and longer term, we also have opportunities around Health Net-style deals, utility-type deals, where we can work with TriZetto clients to take full end-to-end responsibility, like we had proposed to do with Health Net some months ago. So we feel very good about the pipeline of opportunities that we have in -- around the TriZetto synergies.
And with that, I think we have to bring the call to a close. So I just want to thank everybody for joining us today, and thank you for your questions. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter."
