We're all fighting cold around here. Lorie may end up having to handle this call for us. Before John takes you through the results, I want to take just a couple of minutes and frame where we are.
2012 to 2014 was really a period of unprecedented investment for AT&T and for the industry for that matter. And during this period, we built our LTE network to cover more than 300 million people. We expanded our U-verse broadband footprint of 57 million customer locations, and we deployed 5 [ph] of 725,000 business locations. And at the same time, we reengineered our mobile network, and we now deliver the strongest LTE signal in the U.S. 
Now at the same time, we've been aggressively repositioning our wireless customer base. We're giving our customers now a choice of moving away from heavy handset subsidies in exchange for lower monthly prices. And as a result, our customer satisfaction continues to climb and defections continue to fall. And you can see that by our record low annual postpaid churn rate. 
And we also delivered our best ever full year adjusted EBITDA service margins. We've also made a significant investment to migrate our wireline customer basis to the new platforms. At the end of 2014, 76% of our broadband customers were on our fastest IP-based platforms. And our strategic IP-based business services now represent a $10 billion annualized revenue stream and is growing 14% when you adjust it for the Connecticut sale.
And that brings us to 2015. Because with these foundational investments largely behind us and several strategic investments announced to date, the groundwork is now being laid for 2015 and beyond. And today, our customers are expecting us to deliver video across all of our platforms, whether it's traditionally linear video or over the top on U-verse broadband or video to mobile device. So we've been assembling the pieces that we need to do exactly that. 
DIRECTV quickly and significantly shores up the economics of our U-verse video product, and it brings us to the best content relationships in the industry. Our fixed broadband footprint will likely begin expanding to 70 million customer locations in the U.S. when we complete the DIRECTV transaction. And in the Cricket acquisition, it's proven to be a cost-effective way to strengthen our Spectrum portfolio, which is a prerequisite for being in the mobile video delivery business. 
We also laid the groundwork for expanding these capabilities outside the U.S. We've always believed that demand for the mobile Internet and economic benefits experience in the U.S. would be repeated throughout the world. So with that, we've been looking for opportunities to gain a wireless foothold in key markets for the regulatory, and the investment climate is right.
In Iusacell and Nextel International Mexico assets give us of this opportunity. The changes in the Mexican legal and regulatory framework make it attractive for a new to invest. And we closed on Iusacell. And then once we complete Nextel, we'll have a very deep Spectrum portfolio. And this is the first element needed for a robust mobile Internet offering.
We will now have the ability to extend our U.S. network directly into Mexico, building one seamless network expanding 400 million people. And whether it's cross-border businesses, Latino customers of either Cricket or AT&T or Mexican consumers, we will be the only company with mobile Internet capability spanning both countries. And don't forget, DIRECTV brings the premier TV video business in Latin America. So the byproduct of this is represented on Slide 5.
And you go 12 months from now, AT&T's revenue mix is going to look very different. It will be much more diversified. The way we integrate our products and services will be different. And when we end 2015, post DIRECTV, our revenues will come from 4 areas. Our largest will be Business Solutions, that includes both fixed and wireless services and is growing nicely. 
In fact, in the fourth quarter, that's -- that area is growing nearly 6%. The next area will be our consumer TV and broadband business. Then third will be our Consumer Mobility business. Then, obviously, our Latin American businesses with satellite TV and in the Mexican mobility businesses will be our fastest-growing area. And we like this mix a lot. And by the end of the year, we're going to be uniquely positioned in a world of high-speed conductivity dominated by video and it's going to be a very different business.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to you, John, to go through 2014."

Let me start with our consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 6.We finished the year strong with solid revenue and EPS growth in the fourth quarter. Consolidated revenues grew to more than $34 billion, up 4",2417,"Thank you, Randall. Hello, everyone. Let me start with our consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 6.
We finished the year strong with solid revenue and EPS growth in the fourth quarter. Consolidated revenues grew to more than $34 billion, up 4.5% when you adjust for the sale of our Connecticut properties. This was driven by strong wireless growth, as we continue to reposition our business model and adjusted revenue growth in wireline, thanks to gains in strategic business services and U-verse.
For the full year, we saw adjusted consolidated revenue growth by more than 3%. This helped drive strong EPS growth. Reported EPS for the quarter was a loss of $0.77. However, when you exclude the significant items we disclosed in the last weeks, earnings per share was $0.55. That's up nearly 4% from a year ago. And if you consider that last year included about $0.02 of equity income from our divested América Móvil interest, that percentage would have been closer to 8%. Adjusted EPS was up slightly for the year even after a success impact from the sale of our América Móvil investment.
These adjustments include although $0.94 of noncash pressure from the year-end mark-to-market charge for our benefit plans. This was almost the reverse of last year when we had a strong mark-to-market gain. The actuarial loss was largely driven by a decrease of a discount rate, but was partially offset by strong performance of our benefit plan investments.
We also had a $0.25 noncash pressure from the write-off of certain network assets, which we told you about earlier this month. And we had $0.13 of cost associated with wireless integration, DIRECTV transaction costs and a loss of the sale of the Connecticut properties.
Now let's turn to our operational highlights starting with Wireless on Slide 7. Before I get to the quarter, it's important to take a look back at the full year and see how far we've come with repositioning our wireless business.
It's been almost a year since we first introduced our Mobile Share value plans and began to accelerate the move of our smartphone base off the subsidy model to AT&T Next. Since that time, the results have been dramatic.
First, we had nearly 3.3 million postpaid net adds, thanks to strong growth of phones and tablets. That's our best full year gain in 5 years. And this includes more than 700,000 postpaid phone net adds during the year. 
These postpaid gains, along with an end of your surge of connected device subscribers, thanks mainly to the Connected Car, helped drive 5.6 million total net adds, our strongest growth in 3 years. Just as impressive, we added nearly 5 million new smartphone subscribers during the year. These high-volume, high-quality customers have an ARPU of about twice that of non-smartphone subscribers.
At the same time, we had our best ever full year postpaid churn. That's a remarkable achievement any time, but even more so when you consider the intense competitive environment we face during the year.
We also had our best ever full year adjusted EBITDA service margins. We achieved that even with record full year smartphone sales. This is the impact of AT&T Next. Already, more than a quarter of our postpaid smartphone base are on equipment installment plans and more than half of our smartphone base has moved off the subsidy model pricing. These are the long-term results we have talked with you about throughout 2014. A repositioning of the smartphone base is working with nearly 70% of our postpaid base now on Mobile Share plans. Now let's look at fourth quarter results, starting on Slide 8.
Let's begin with net adds, where we had another strong quarter. We added nearly 2 million total subscribers, led by postpaid and connected devices. We added more than 850,000 postpaid subscribers, thanks to strong growth of tablets. These tablet gains more than offset a slight decline of feature phones subscribers. But we also grew high quality postpaid smartphone base by another million in the quarter. This includes upgrades and migrations, which we don't include in our net add number.
Connected devices also continued their strong growth as the Internet of Things begins to evolve. Nearly 1.3 million connected devices were added in the quarter, including 800,000 Connected Cars.
Prepaid total loss in the fourth quarter. However, the Cricket brand is showing momentum with positive net adds after losing customers in the preacquisition year ago fourth quarter. The Cricket integration is going strong, distribution has been expanded, churn is improving, and now nearly 3/4 of the customer base has transitioned to the AT&T network.
The fourth quarter is traditionally a strong sales quarter, and you see that in our results. We had record smartphone postpaid gross adds and upgrades with more than 10 million smartphones sold in the quarter. That includes record total upgrades, those customers choosing to stay with AT&T and commits to new device plans. Our upgrade rate exceeded 11% in the quarter.
Smartphones were 94% of all postpaid phone sales, another record for us in the quarter. As expected, postpaid churn was up in the quarter. The fourth quarter traditionally sees increased levels of churn for all carriers. And when you add in the intense competitive activity in the quarter, it's no surprise to see churn at these levels. 
But even with all these noise in the market, postpaid churn levels were comparable to 2 years ago, the last time when fully refreshed iPhone hit the market. And this was of the first time that all major carriers were able to sell that phone during the busy fourth quarter.
Now let's look at revenue gains on Slide 9. Total Wireless revenues grew nearly 8%, as the revenue mix shift we have seen throughout the year continue to play out in the fourth quarter. Equipment revenue growth cap [ph] 70% was strong AT&T Next sales. Service revenues were pressured, as customers continue to shine up for Mobile Share value plans and move away from the traditional subsidy model. We now have more than 18 million smart Mobile Share accounts covering nearly 70% of our postpaid subscribers. And about 58% of our postpaid smartphone base is on no subsidy pricing. 
Mobile Share customers continue to buy up to larger buckets of data. Half of our accounts are on the plans of 10 gigabits or larger. That compares to 27% a year ago. And we're seeing a move to even bigger, larger data plans. Nearly 27% are on plans of 15 gigs or more. That's 3x more than a year ago. This helped drive an 18% increase in data billings.
The take rate for AT&T Next increased to 58% in the fourth quarter or about 5.9 million new Next customers. This impacted cash flows, but we consider this an investment in a great customer base that we are more than willing to make.
We also had about 400,000 customers bring their own devices onto our network. The Next take rate was a step up from prior quarters. While we continue to see strong customer response in our company owned stores and agents with the Next take rate of about 90% of upgrades, the take rate for Next to our other retailers was much less. The strong holiday sales played a role here. 
We typically have a higher percentage of our sales with other retailers in the fourth quarter. These stores are still becoming familiar with Next plans and our sales show that. Plus, with a rush of the holiday season, sales personalities to retailers don't always have the time to take the steps necessary to close the Next transaction. We'll continue to work with these stores and expect the take rate of those locations to pick up in the future.
As expected, the strong Next take rate helped drive the second consecutive quarter of sequential ARPU growth when you factor in Next Billings. When you added Next billings, you get a more accurate idea of what an average customer pays us every month. That average monthly Next billings were up about $28 per month even with the introduction of the Next 24 months long.
As of the Next base growth, so that's the impact of billings, nearly 27% of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next. Now let's move to our wireline operations on Slide 10.
The transformation of our wireline networks to IP technology has helped drive year-over-year wireline revenue growth. We say it again, this helped drive year-over-year wireline revenue growth when you adjust for the sale of our Connecticut operation. We're really seeing the overall revenue impact of the strategic business services and U-verse. 
Total adjusted U-verse revenues increased by more than 20% and are now about 2/3 of consumer revenues. And strategic business service revenues grew by more than 14% and are now 30% of total Wireline business revenues. Growth was even stronger when you're just out the impact of foreign exchange.
Overall, adjusted wireline consumer revenue increased 2.4%. Adjusted Wireline business revenues were down 1.8%. However, if you adjust for the effective discontinued global hubbing businesses and foreign exchange, that decline would have been just about 0.5%. 
We're still dealing with the impacts of an uneven economy, but enterprise revenues were up slightly. However, the lack of new business formations continue to pressure small businesses. Wholesale also saw pressure in the quarter in part due to our focus on profitable sales. These results help drive a sequential improvement in Wireline margins, which were up 120 basis points over the third quarter of 2014. That's a reversal of trends in recent years when we are seeing sequential declines between the third and fourth quarter. 
U-verse subscribers also grew in the quarter. We added more than 400,000 high-speed broadband subscribers and now added 2.1 million for the full year. We finished the year with 12.2 million high-speed broadband subscribers or more than 3/4 of a broadband base. The transformation to IP broadband is a remarkable accomplishment for our entire Wireline team.
U-verse TV subscribers net adds came in at 73,000. Net adds were impacted by a strategic move to improve the profitability of our Wireline Consumer business. With our high content cost, we targeted profitable, long-term value subscribers with lower churn rates while still taking market share. Now let's take a look at margins on Slide 11. Let's start with our Wireless margins.
Wireless margins were pressured by strong smartphone gross adds and upgrades, investment-related expenses and wireless integration cost. We mentioned earlier that we had our best ever full year adjusted service margins even with record sales, thanks to AT&T Next. We will also see the impact of Next on our quarterly results. 
While our wireless EBITDA service margin was down slightly when compared to a year ago, the fourth quarter of 2014 saw 2.6 million more smartphone sales than in the previous year. And if you compare the results to 2 years ago, when smartphone sales were comparable, the service margins improved over 700 basis points.
Wireline margins improved from a year ago. Wireline margins usually were flat or down between the third and fourth quarter, but that trend changed last quarter. There was pressure from investment expenses and content cost, but this was offset by growth in wireline revenues and solid execution on cost initiatives.
For the quarter, our adjusted consolidated margins were 14.2%, compared to 15.5% in the year ago quarter and just under 13% 2 years ago. Strong smartphone sales also pressured consolidated margins, but our continued efforts for cost efficiency helped to offset some of that pressure.
Now let's move to cash flow. That summary is on Slide 12. For 2014, cash from operations totaled $31.3 billion and $5.7 billion for the quarter. Capital expenditures were $21.4 billion and $4.4 billion for the quarter, and free cash flow before dividends was $9.9 billion and $1.3 billion for the quarter. Free cash flow was impacted by the nearly 6 million AT&T Next sales in the fourth quarter. We pay upfront for those devices while our customers pay us back over time. The record upgrades and strong iPhone sales and the higher sales price mix made an impact as well. This speaks to our willingness to invest in our premium smartphone customer base. We aren't going to turn away good business to manage to a cash flow number. We have the financial strength to finance devices for our best customers, we have the lowest churn and higher ARPU, and that is our focus.
At the same time, our Next receivables significantly increased while our bad debt ratios stayed at traditionally low levels. These are high-quality receivables. We did monetize $1.2 billion of the Next receivables in the quarter as there continues to be great interest from financial institutions. And we do expect future sales of those receivables.
Also, in the fourth quarter, we sold our Connecticut wireline operations to Frontier for $2 billion. Our asset sales strengthen our balance sheet and cash position. In fact, we had more than $10 billion in cash and short-term investments on hand at the end of 2014. We have more than $3 billion in combined free cash flow and asset sales during the fourth quarter with $18 billion for the full year.
In terms of uses of cash, dividends totaled $9.6 billion for the year. And we continue to have one of the strongest yields around. We also announced the dividend increase last month. This is the 31st consecutive year that we have increased the dividend. That puts us on a small select group of companies. That should give you a good idea of how we look at our dividend, say the dividend is important is an under statement. Consider very important aspect of our shareholder return and are committed to it.
At the same time, we maintain the best credit ratings in the industry. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was at 1.75. And as we told you at the end of last year, the company will continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet, but expects that with pending investments, in the near term, we may go over our 1.8x net debt-to-EBITDA target. Also, as we've told you earlier, after we closed the DIRECTV transaction, our focus with free cash flow after dividends will be on paying down debt.
Let's now look at the fourth quarter and at 2014. I would now like to turn it back to Randall to talk about our 2015 outlook."

We're going to provide more definitive 2015 guidance after we close the DIRECTV transaction, and we do expect that to happen in the first half of this year. But let me frame for you what you can expect from us this year. And I'm going to start by talking about AT&T on a standalone basis, that is before our Mexico and DIRECTV acquisitions.
What we expect to deliver is continued consolidated revenue growth. Our adjusted EPS growth will be in the low single-digit range. We will have expanding margins, consolidated wireless and wireline margins. We will also have improving free cash flow and improving dividend coverage. And then capital expenditures will be in the $18 billion range, the same as we guided earlier, and that's thanks to the completion of a lot of the Project VIP initiatives.
Now if we include Mexico and DIRECTV, the first thing I want to note is that we now expect to achieve even higher multiyear synergies than we had communicated and anticipated when we announced the DIRECTV deal. And so when you add Mexico and DIRECTV, we anticipate no dilution to our adjusted EPS, meaning, our adjusted EPS growth, including Mexico and DIRECTV, will be in the low single-digit range.
We will exit 2015 a different company. We'll be a company with the ability to deliver video to any device. We'll have unique capability to integrate solutions across a diversified base of customers, geographies and technology platforms that are mobile, fast and highly secure. And we will have a path to profitable TV growth. 
We will have a nice set of growing Latin America business is positioned in video in the mobile tenant. So that's what we're focused for 2015 and beyond. We're very excited about the opportunities that are ahead here for us. 
And so with that, Lori, I think we're ready to take questions."

And look, the American Movil asset sale is, in one of those things, floating out there. Nobody really yet knows what that is going to look like. And for us, if we wanted to move into Mexico, there were a couple of really unique opportunities in front of us. And just to try to flush out what we're going to be required to América Móvil to sell their assets seem to be an uncertain process. So we pursued Iusacell. And then with the Nextel Mexico asset, what we have here is a set of assets, a Spectrum portfolio that is really a robust spectrum portfolio, a nice sales site grid that will be a very nice place to start and a nice customer base. And so we have the makings for what we need for a very viable and strong Mexico strategy, whether América Móvil sells assets or not. So that's what we try to do, is to try to do that would get us into Mexico and at us and buy from that would sustain itself, and we like these assets. We think these assets are more than sufficient to compete in Mexico and to go in and compete aggressively and take share. So I feel good about the assets we've got. On South America and Brazil, it's too early to say, John. What we have done there is the best Pay TV business in Latin America. And it's a business that continues to grow. It's got a great brand name down there. DIRECTV has done a very nice job of assembling some nice Spectrum in various Latin American markets, where they are doing a fixed wireless absolution for broadband. So there are a number of markets where they have line of sight and the ability to bundle broadband with the TV product. And their brand is strong enough that where they do that, they have really, really good success. And so we're actually actions to get the transaction closed and leverage those assets in Latin America, and it is, it's a really good product, a really good footprint, a really good brand. So we're excited about getting it. On Canada, I think, right now, we have about as much as we as a company can handle. We're not prepared to start talking about going North of the border right now. We've got a lot to execute on. The DIRECTV, get the deal approved. And then, we've got some serious integration efforts that we need to get busy on. And then, obviously, building out Mexico is going to be a full-court press for the next couple of years. So we've got more than we can chew right -- we've been off more than we can chew right now and you'll us focus on what we've consummated to date."

In terms of the Wireless business, when you look at 2014, there are some aggressive pricing in the marketplace. But John, I thought, did a nice job of giving a good basis of compare to 2012.

But John, I thought, did a nice job of giving a good basis of compare to 2012. And so fourth quarter of 2012, there were 3 competitors with an iPhone in the marketplace. That was a last time there was a major iPhone launch. And our churn rate this quarter was very comparable to what it was in 2012. And this quarter, there were everybody and the market had an iPhone. So the churn rates in the fourth quarter, relative to what we've seen in the past, were fairly consistent. When you look at the churn rates for the year in light of what I think was a very robust pricing environment, we had our lowest churn rates ever. Now as we move forward, what we're really going to be focused on is the smartphone base. You're going to see us continue to penetrate our customer base with smartphones. We added a million in the fourth quarter by itself. And you're going to really see us focus more and more intently on the business side of the equation. And you're seeing how we're laying out what our segmentation -- or what our business segments will look like as we move into 2015. And we've had a lot of success really focusing on the business segment with our wireless products and bundling that with the VPN solutions and security solutions. And as I mentioned in the opening, that when you put those 2 areas together, that -- well, not put the 2 together, but when you look at the enterprise business segments, both fixed line and wireless combined, it's growing 5.8% in the fourth quarter. That business segment, that segment of customers churns lower than any other segment of the marketplace. It is price competitive. But it's interesting, when you bundle it with VPN and other products that's, that you have a very, very nice business that grows very nicely. And as John showed, we're expanding margins as well. So we're really focused on the high-end customer base. The area where we're seeing a lot more pressure in the market is in the feature phones. We churn feature phones much higher than our traditional smartphone base. And so that's what Cricket serves the purpose to do is to help us adjust that into the market with a very robust and aggressive prepaid product. And as John pointed out in his comments, Cricket, we're getting through the transition. It is now growing. Our prepaid base is growing. That customer base is obviously a very nice complement to what we're doing in Mexico. We're looking forward to take advantage of the Mexico footprint with Cricket. And as you noticed in the last week, we've announced that free unlimited calling from the U.S. to Mexico. And you'll see more and more of those offers materials going the other rate as we build out the Mexican footprint and the Mexican network."

As you know, we've announced -- we're committed to do about an $18 billion range for CapEx next year. So that's about a $3.5 billion reduction in CapEx or improvement in free cash flow. That's step 1. Step 2 is with all of our free cash flow or with all of our CapEx spending in investment, there comes some trailing expense with a reduction in our CapEx, we'll see a reduction of trailing expense. I don't know if it will help us with margins, but it will also help us with free cash flow. So those are 2 major steps. What [indiscernible] is we have invested significantly in our customer base with regard to Next. High-quality receivables, the banks continue to be interested, but we have a portfolio those that we'll be able to securitized this year, and we'll see some turnaround in payback of cash for those that we haven't securitized. So we're optimistic about that. That will be pressured -- those things will be pressured by the continued success of Next. So we may we reinvest some of those Next dollars that we've got this year. We may reinvest from our customer base. We'll make those judgments as we go. And then we'll see some increase in taxes, but not significant. We will likely see some increases in taxes. With all of that being said, I feel very comfortable about the increasing free cash flow and improving dividend coverage guidance that Randall mentioned. We constantly talk to the credit rating agencies, work with them on our plans and try to be transparent with what we have going on. I would expect will see some -- made some announcements on their own, and I'm sure they will make their decisions as we kind of go through the rest of this year. And the final DTV integration plans that we have, they will come out and make their viewpoints known. But those, I would tell you, those conversations have been productive and constructive, but there will understanding our strategies and our approach."

They sell a lot of our phones. A higher proportion of fourth quarter because the holiday season than any other quarter. So we are optimistic about Next take rates increasing overall through the year. And we are also optimistic about working with financial retailers and the other retailers to provide some additional support on how to sell Next and how it works. So we're still real positive about Next and believe that we'll get the number of customers on the non-subsidy plans in line with the number of customers on Next, plus Bring Your Own Device. So we're really moving dramatically out of the subsidy business. That's a good thing long-term and short-term. With regard to the -- if free cash flow impacts, we'll have the flexibility to monetize.

I would suggest to you that the activities we have going on now are not to -- are not intended to be looked at to generate cash flow in and of themselves to pump cash flow in any way, shape, or form. It's really more of a prudent management process throughout the year.

But obviously, there is a legal challenge going on between content providers and the FCC. And that's kind of the big unknown in our process right now. We're hopeful that the 2 parties, FCC and the content folks, can get that deal settled in short order. I believe there's a court proceeding that's due here soon that will help determine the pace at which that progresses. But even with that, Simon, we're still fairly confident that this thing gets done first half of the year. And so I can't get a more refined that because of this issue. So this issue will be the only issue because of the delay of the 180-day clock to our knowledge right now. As it relates to the synergies, there's a fairly predictable formula with us when we do these large scale deals. And when we're doing the deals, we tend to be fairly conservative. And we've obviously have begun with the DIRECTV management teams, some parlor discussions and getting to a level of detail that's appropriate within the confines of a DOJ review and so forth. And so we're starting to see details on channels and channel cost and so forth. And as a result, as you start drilling down to it, it's fairly much across the board. We're seeing better opportunities in what we've baked into the original deal economics. And so that's why we're fairly pretty confident that we will exceed the merger synergies that we announced at the time that we did the deal. And across the board, they are looking good. And even revenue synergies. When you have 20 million DIRECTV customers that are very, very high end customers, and seeing what the wireless penetration rate that we have in that customer base, it looks really good, the opportunity to be able to sell mobility to those channels and so forth. So across the board, cost synergies, fee revenue synergies, it's all looking better to what we had anticipated when we announced the deal. And then in terms of video to any device, this is one of the key opportunities that we were pursuing when we did this deal. Our customers are demanding video to be delivered across any device. And so one of the primary objectives we will have coming out of the close of the deal is taking advantage of the content relationships that DIRECTV has in our wireless customer base. We envision customers being able to walk out of our stores with content available to them on devices that they have purchased in our stores. You're familiar with the auditor deal that we have done with the churning group, where we are developing over-the-top content with them taking advantage of ways of delivering that to our customers as well. So it's going to be a multifaceted approach in terms of how we bring video to our customers. But we're looking at multiple channels and channel lineups that we would be able to accommodate into our wireless customers, both tablet, as well as handsets, as well as our broadband customer base, 60 million broadband customers. And so stay tuned, there will be more to come. But this is a high priority for us, is getting the content delivered to the mobile handsets and tablets."

Or should we expect some equity component for a sizable transaction.

In terms of churn, I would tell you, I'm comfortable with the performance we had in the fourth quarter as it relates to churn. And I'll say it again. When you compare it to 2 years ago, which was the last major iPhone launch and only 3 national carriers carrying the iPhone, to have a comparable level of churn with the kind of pricing moves we're seeing in the marketplace versus 2 years ago, I think that's pretty good performance and its performance at for the quarter that we're comfortable with. We are, as I mentioned before, I really focus on that area of customer base of that tends to have lower churn and that is our business customer base and high end consumer customer base, where we are experiencing the churn. As John said in the future phone side of the house, and we will address that with our Cricket platform. And so right now, who can call where pricing goes in this industry. I haven't the slightest idea. It moves. It's very volatile. But right now, we have the value equation we have in the marketplace. We have a customer base that demands reliability, that demands speed and that demands quality. They demand a very sophisticated consumer channel and business channel. We have probably the most sophisticated business channel in the industry for B2B, and we think it's very important. And we think also that, that B2B customer segment is more and more demanding security solutions integrated all the way through the cloud with our NetBond strategy. And that's proving to be a very powerful combination in the marketplace. So that's where you'll see us focused. And like I said, I can't predict where pricing will go."

First, Net neutrality I mean, what this debate started out to be pursuing was how do we protect net neutrality, a neutral Internet? And I would tell you I'm not similar -- I don't know if anybody in the industry who really argues that we shouldn't have net neutrality. And indeed, the President laid out 4 principles for what that meant. And we look at those 4 principles and said, we're okay with those. Those 4 principles, if what resulted from all of this was the FCC. We're given authority to enforce those 4 principles. It has no bearing or impact on our investment decisions, none whatsoever. What causes us pause is if the way you affect those 4 principles is by categorizing the Internet and wireless services as Title II communication services, that's a different deal, all right? And that's something we have to say, what does that mean? And what are the implications of categorizing these services as Title II services to our industry? And I -- the example I give is we are right now trying to obsolete our old legacy telephone services, moving to IP or to all wireless. And there is a very specific process one has to go through to obsolete those services and replace them with the new advanced services. And we're working through that with the FCC. It's a very collaborative process, it works, but it takes a lot of time to make that happen. And we think that we might be able to get to a point where we can obsolete these services and begin replacing them with the new services by 2020. That's an aggressive timeline. The idea of beginning to put our wireless services and our broadband products under those categories and subjecting ourselves to that kind of regulatory oversight is what causes us pause. And when we say we are pausing investment 'til we understand where this is going, that's what we're referring. Now Chairman Wheeler call find some great is should of categorizing these as Title II, but doesn't cause the industry to slow down, doesn't cause investment cycles to slow down, does not cause innovation cycles to slow down, then it will give us some confidence and relief to continue investing at the same pace we have. But until we kind of have clarity, we're saying we're just on any new investment where we're in a bit of a pause mode. But it's really up in the air right now. There are a lot of ways of getting of what the President has articulated, he wanted to accomplish. One of them is Congress is working on it. And that is that Congress would pass legislation that we give the FCC the authority to enforce the 4 principles that the President articulated were important. That works to us. That puts us very similar to where we are today and probably doesn't change our investment thesis for anything we're trying to do. But these really started, heavy-handed regulations on wireless and broadband, if we go down that path, that's what causes everybody some apprehension and uncertainty and begins to change investment thesis and so forth. So it's up in the air. Right now, which is ashes to see what the FCC comes out and we all begin to see what the formulate our plans."

And if you look at our current cost of borrowings, some of our recent transactions, but quite frankly, our entire portfolio today, we have after-tax cost of debt in well below 3%. So it's producing interest expense at a very acceptable level at 1.8. We're just a few years ago where interest rates were higher. You might have gotten a comparable answer with the 1 5 or 1 6 net debt-to-EBITDA. So that's where we're at. We'll let the debt rating agencies deal with it as they see fit. But we're comfortable if where we're going and we understand the implications. The last thing I would tell you, Amir, as we announced lastly, we set up a facility with the collection of banks in 18-month, 3-year 5 year terms for over $11 million. The net after-tax cost of that debt averages less than 1%. And we have been very transparent with our plans and activities such that reasonable people as the banks are in this process are still very interested in providing a significant funding at very attractive rates with an ability for us to prepay it without penalty and ability to leave the, if you will, be facility open until such time as we needed. So we feel real good about where we stand in the crowd market. We'll continue to work on it, but will continue to feel good about where we're at."

We're all fighting colds around here. Lori may end up having to handle this call for us. Before John takes you through the results, I want to take just a couple of minutes and frame where we are.
2012 to 2014 was really a period of unprecedented investment for AT&T and for the industry for that matter. And during this period, we built our LTE network to cover more than 300 million people. We expanded our U-verse broadband footprint of 57 million customer locations, and we deployed fiber to 725,000 business locations. And at the same time, we reengineered our mobile network, and we now deliver the strongest LTE signal in the U.S. 
Now at the same time, we've been aggressively repositioning our wireless customer base. We're giving our customers now a choice of moving away from heavy handset subsidies in exchange for lower monthly prices. And as a result, our customer satisfaction continues to climb and defections continue to fall. And you can see that by our record-low annual postpaid churn rate. And we also delivered our best-ever, full year adjusted EBITDA service margins. We've also made a significant investment to migrate our wireline customer bases to the new platforms. At the end of 2014, 76% of our broadband customers were on our fastest IP-based platforms, and our strategic IP-based business services now represent a $10 billion annualized revenue stream and is growing 14% when you adjust it for the Connecticut sale.
And that brings us to 2015. Because with these foundational investments largely behind us and several strategic investments announced to date, the groundwork is now being laid for 2015 and beyond. And today, our customers are expecting us to deliver video across all of our platforms, whether it's traditional linear video or over the top on U-verse broadband or video to the mobile device. So we've been assembling the pieces that we need to do exactly that. 
DIRECTV quickly and significantly shores up the economics of our U-verse video product, and it brings us the best content relationships in the industry. Our fixed broadband footprint will quickly begin expanding to 70 million customer locations in the U.S. when we complete the DIRECTV transaction. And in the Cricket acquisition, it's proven to be a cost-effective way to strengthen our spectrum portfolio, which is a prerequisite for being in the mobile video delivery business. 
We also laid the groundwork for expanding these capabilities outside the U.S. We've always believed that demand for the mobile Internet and economic benefits experienced in the U.S. would be repeated throughout the world. And so with that, we've been looking for opportunities to gain a wireless foothold in key markets when the regulatory and the investment climate is right, and Iusacell and Nextel International's Mexico assets give us of this opportunity. The changes in the Mexican legal and regulatory framework make it attractive for a new entrant to invest, and we closed on Iusacell. And then once we complete Nextel, we'll have a very deep spectrum portfolio, and this is the first element needed for a robust mobile Internet offering.
We will now have the ability to extend our U.S. network directly into Mexico, building one seamless network spanning 400 million people. And whether it's cross-border businesses, Latino customers of either Cricket or AT&T or Mexican consumers, we will be the only company with mobile Internet capability spanning both countries. And don't forget, DIRECTV brings the premier video business in Latin America. So the byproduct of this is represented on Slide 5.
When you go 12 months from now, AT&T's revenue mix is going to look very different. It will be much more diversified. The way we integrate our products and services will be different. And when we end 2015, post-DIRECTV, our revenues will come from 4 areas. Our largest will be business solutions, that includes both fixed and wireless services and is growing nicely. In fact, in the fourth quarter, that's -- that area is growing nearly 6%. 
The next area will be our consumer TV and broadband business. Then third will be our consumer mobility business. Then obviously, our Latin American businesses with satellite TV and then the Mexican mobility businesses will be our fastest-growing area, and we like this mix a lot. And by the end of the year, we're going to be uniquely positioned in a world of high-speed connectivity dominated by video, and it's going to be a very different business.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to you, John, to go through 2014."
100231,280659621,749637,"AT&T, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2015",2015-01-27,"Earnings Calls","AT&T Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Randall. Hello, everyone. Let me start with our consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 6.We finished the year strong with solid revenue and EPS growth in the fourth quarter. Consolidated revenues grew to more than $34 billion, up 4",2408,"Thank you, Randall. Hello, everyone. Let me start with our consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 6.
We finished the year strong with solid revenue and EPS growth in the fourth quarter. Consolidated revenues grew to more than $34 billion, up 4.5% when you adjust for the sale of our Connecticut properties. This was driven by strong wireless growth, as we continue to reposition our business model and adjusted revenue growth in wireline, thanks to gains in strategic business services and U-verse.
For the full year, we saw adjusted consolidated revenue growth by more than 3%. This helped drive strong EPS growth. Reported EPS for the quarter was a loss of $0.77. However, when you exclude the significant items we disclosed in the last weeks, earnings per share was $0.55. That's up nearly 4% from a year ago. And if you consider that last year included about $0.02 of equity income from our divested América Móvil interest, that percentage would have been closer to 8%. Adjusted EPS was up slightly for the year even after a $0.06 impact from the sale of our América Móvil investment.
These adjustments include $0.94 of noncash pressure from the year-end mark-to-market charge for our benefit plans. This was almost the reverse of last year when we had a strong mark-to-market gain. The actuarial loss was largely driven by a decrease in the discount rate but was partially offset by strong performance of our benefit plan investments.
We also had a $0.25 noncash pressure from the write-off of certain network assets, which we told you about earlier this month, and we had $0.13 of cost associated with wireless integration, DIRECTV transaction costs and a loss from the sale of the Connecticut properties.
Now let's turn to our operational highlights, starting with wireless on Slide 7. Before I get to the quarter, it's important to take a look back at the full year and see how far we've come with repositioning our wireless business. It's been almost a year since we first introduced our Mobile Share Value plans and began to accelerate the move of our smartphone base off the subsidy model to AT&T Next. Since that time, the results have been dramatic.
First, we have nearly 3.3 million postpaid net adds, thanks to strong growth of phones and tablets. That's our best full year gain in 5 years, and this includes more than 700,000 postpaid phone net adds during the year. These postpaid gains, along with an end-of-year surge of connected device subscribers, thanks mainly to the connected car, helped drive 5.6 million total net adds, our strongest growth in 3 years. Just as impressive, we added nearly 5 million new smartphone subscribers during the year. These high-value, high-quality customers have an ARPU of about twice that of non-smartphone subscribers. At the same time, we had our best-ever, full year postpaid churn. That's a remarkable achievement any time but even more so when you consider the intense competitive environment we faced during the year.
We also had our best-ever, full year adjusted EBITDA service margins. We achieved that even with record full year smartphone sales. This is the impact of AT&T Next. Already, more than a quarter of our postpaid smartphone base are on equipment installment plans, and more than half of our smartphone base has moved off the subsidy model pricing. These are the long-term results we have talked with you about throughout 2014. A repositioning of the smartphone base is working with nearly 70% of our postpaid base now on Mobile Share plans. 
Now let's look at fourth quarter results, starting on Slide 8. Let's begin with net adds, where we had another strong quarter. We added nearly 2 million total subscribers, led by postpaid and connected devices. We added more than 850,000 postpaid subscribers, thanks to strong growth of tablets. These tablet gains more than offset a slight decline of feature phones subscribers, but we also grew high-quality postpaid smartphone base by another million in the quarter. This includes upgrades and migrations, which we don't include in our net add number. Connected devices also continued their strong growth as the Internet of Things begins to evolve. Nearly 1.3 million connected devices were added in the quarter, including 800,000 connected cars.
Prepaid showed a loss in the fourth quarter. However, the Cricket brand is showing momentum with positive net adds after losing customers in the pre-acquisition year ago fourth quarter. The Cricket integration is going strong. Distribution has been expanded. Churn is improving, and now nearly 3/4 of the customer base has transitioned to the AT&T network.
The fourth quarter is traditionally a strong sales quarter, and you see that in our results. We had record smartphone postpaid gross adds and upgrades with more than 10 million smartphones sold in the quarter. That includes record total upgrades, those customers choosing to stay with AT&T and commits to new device plans. Our upgrade rate exceeded 11% in the quarter.
Smartphones were 94% of all postpaid phone sales, another record for us in the quarter. As expected, postpaid churn was up in the quarter. The fourth quarter traditionally sees increased levels of churn for all carriers. And when you add in the intense competitive activity in the quarter, it's no surprise to see churn at these levels. But even with all this noise in the market, postpaid churn levels were comparable to 2 years ago, the last time a fully refreshed iPhone hit the market. And this was of the first time that all major carriers were able to sell that phone during the busy fourth quarter.
Now let's look at revenue gains on Slide 9. Total wireless revenues grew nearly 8%, as the revenue mix shift we have seen throughout the year continue to play out in the fourth quarter. Equipment revenue growth tops 70% with strong AT&T Next sales. Service revenues were pressured, as customers continue to sign up for Mobile Share Value plans and move away from the traditional subsidy model. We now have more than 18 million smart Mobile Share accounts, covering nearly 70% of our postpaid subscribers. And about 58% of our postpaid smartphone base is on no-subsidy pricing. 
Mobile Share customers continue to buy up a larger buckets of data. Half of our accounts are on the plans of 10 GB or larger. That compares to 27% a year ago, and we're seeing a move to even bigger, larger data plans. Nearly 20%% are on plans of 15 GB or more. That's 3x more than a year ago. This helped drive an 18% increase in data billings.
The take rate for AT&T Next increased to 58% in the fourth quarter or about 5.9 million new Next customers. This impacted cash flows, but we consider this an investment in a great customer base that we are more than willing to make.
We also had about 400,000 customers bring their own devices on to our network. The Next take rate was a step-up from prior quarters. While we continue to see strong customer response in our company-owned stores and agents with the Next take rate of about 90% of upgrades, the take rate for Next to our other retailers was much less. The strong holiday sales played a role here. We typically have a higher percentage of our sales with other retailers in the fourth quarter. These stores are still becoming familiar with Next plans, and our sales show that. Plus, with the rush of the holiday season, sales personnel with these retailers don't always have the time to take the steps necessary to close the Next transaction. We'll continue to work with these stores and expect the take rate of those locations to pick up in the future.
As expected, the strong Next take rate helped drive the second consecutive quarter of sequential ARPU growth when you factor in Next billings. When you add in Next billings, you get a more accurate idea of what an average customer pays us every month. That average monthly Next billings were up about $28 per month even with the introduction of the Next 24-month plan. As the Next space grows, so does the impact on billings. Nearly 27% of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next. 
Now let's move to our wireline operations on Slide 10. The transformation of our wireline networks to IP technology has helped drive year-over-year wireline revenue growth. We say it again, this helped drive year-over-year wireline revenue growth when you adjust for the sale of our Connecticut operations. We're really seeing the overall revenue impact of the strategic business services and U-verse. 
Total adjusted U-verse revenues increased by more than 20% and are now about 2/3 of consumer revenues, and strategic business service revenues grew by more than 14% and are now 30% of total wireline business revenues. Growth was even stronger when you adjust out the impacts of foreign exchange.
Overall, adjusted wireline consumer revenue increased 2.4%. Adjusted wireline business revenues were down 1.8%. However, if you adjust for the impact of discontinued Global Hubbing businesses and foreign exchange, that decline would have been just about 0.5%. 
We're still dealing with the impacts of an uneven economy, but enterprise revenues were up slightly. However, the lack of new business formations continue to pressure small businesses. Wholesale also saw pressure in the quarter in part due to our focus on profitable sales. These results help drive a sequential improvement in wireline margins, which were up 120 basis points over the third quarter of 2014. That's a reversal of trends in recent years when we have seen sequential declines between the third and fourth quarter. 
U-verse subscribers also grew in the quarter. We added more than 400,000 high-speed broadband subscribers and now added 2.1 million for the full year. We finished the year with 12.2 million high-speed broadband subscribers or more than 3/4 of a broadband base. The transformation to IP broadband is a remarkable accomplishment for our entire wireline team.
U-verse TV subscribers net adds came in at 73,000. Net adds were impacted by a strategic move to improve the profitability of our wireline consumer business. With our high content costs, we targeted profitable, long-term value subscribers with lower churn rates while still taking market share. 
Now let's take a look at margins on Slide 11. Let's start with our wireless margins. Wireless margins were pressured by strong smartphone gross adds and upgrades, investment-related expenses and wireless integration costs. We mentioned earlier that we had our best-ever, full year adjusted service margins even with record sales, thanks to AT&T Next. We also see the impact of Next on our quarterly results. 
While our wireless EBITDA service margin was down slightly when compared to a year ago, the fourth quarter of 2014 saw 2.6 million more smartphone sales than in the previous year. And if you compare the results to 2 years ago when smartphone sales were comparable, service margins improved over 700 basis points.
Wireline margins improved from a year ago. Wireline margins usually are flat or down between the third and fourth quarter, but that trend changed last quarter. There was pressure from investment expenses and content cost, but this was offset by growth in wireline revenues and solid execution on cost initiatives.
For the quarter, our adjusted consolidated margins were 14.2% compared to 15.5% in the year-ago quarter and just under 13% 2 years ago. Strong smartphone sales also pressured consolidated margins, but our continued efforts for cost efficiency helped to offset some of that pressure.
Now let's move to cash flow. That summary is on Slide 12. For 2014, cash from operations totaled $31.3 billion and $5.7 billion for the quarter. Capital expenditures were $21.4 billion and $4.4 billion for the quarter, and free cash flow before dividends was $9.9 billion and $1.3 billion for the quarter. Free cash flow was impacted by the nearly 6 million AT&T Next sales in the fourth quarter. We pay upfront for those devices while our customers pay us back over time. The record upgrades and strong iPhone sales with a higher sales price mix made an impact as well. This speaks to our willingness to invest in our premium smartphone customer base. We aren't going to turn away good business to manage to a cash flow number. We have the financial strength to finance devices for our best customers. We have the lowest churn and higher ARPU, and that is our focus.
At the same time, our Next receivables significantly increased while our bad debt ratios stayed at traditionally low levels. These are high-quality receivables. We did monetize $1.2 billion of the Next receivables in the quarter, as there continues to be great interest from financial institutions. And we do expect future sales of those receivables.
Also, in the fourth quarter, we sold our Connecticut wireline operations to Frontier for $2 billion. Our asset sales strengthen our balance sheet and cash position. In fact, we had more than $10 billion in cash and short-term investments on hand at the end of 2014. We have more than $3 billion in combined free cash flow and asset sales during the fourth quarter with $18 billion for the full year.
In terms of uses of cash, dividends totaled $9.6 billion for the year, and we continue to have one of the strongest yields around. We also announced the dividend increase last month. This is the 31st consecutive year that we have increased the dividend. That puts us on a small select group of companies. That should give you a good idea of how we look at our dividend. Saying that dividend is important to us is an understatement. We consider it a very important aspect of our shareholder return and are committed to it.
At the same time, we maintain the best credit ratings in the industry. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was at 1.75. And as we told you at the end of last year, the company will continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet but expects that with pending investments, in the near term, we may go over our 1.8x net debt-to-EBITDA target. Also, as we've told you earlier, after we close the DIRECTV transaction, our focus with free cash flow after dividends will be on paying down debt. That's the look at the fourth quarter and at 2014.

We're going to provide more definitive 2015 guidance after we close the DIRECTV transaction, and we do expect that to happen in the first half of this year. But let me frame for you what you can expect from us this year, and I'm going to start by talking about AT&T on a standalone basis. That is before our Mexico and DIRECTV acquisitions.
What we expect to deliver is continued consolidated revenue growth. Our adjusted EPS growth will be in the low single-digit range. We will have expanding margins, consolidated wireless and wireline margins. We will also have improving free cash flow and improving dividend coverage. And then capital expenditures will be in the $18 billion range, the same as we guided earlier, and that's thanks to the completion of a lot of the Project VIP initiatives.
Now if we include Mexico and DIRECTV, the first thing I want to note is that we now expect to achieve even higher multiyear synergies than we had communicated and anticipated when we announced the DIRECTV deal. And so when you add Mexico and DIRECTV, we anticipate no dilution to our adjusted EPS, meaning our adjusted EPS growth, including Mexico and DIRECTV will be in the low single-digit range.
We will exit 2015 a very different company. We'll be a company with the ability to deliver video to any device. We'll have unique capability to integrate solutions across a diversified base of customers, geographies and technology platforms that are mobile, fast and highly secure. And we will have a path to profitable TV growth. And we'll have a nice set of growing Latin America business that's positioned well in video and the mobile Internet. So that's where we're focused for 2015 and beyond. We're very excited about the opportunities that are ahead here for us. 
And so with that, Lori, I think we're ready to take questions."

And then if we could expand that, you also have a large footprint now in South America, especially Brazil. What are your thoughts on that market? And then maybe the same for Canada. You talked in -- at least in the release about a North American calling market. If you could sort of comment on your view on the attractiveness of those markets, that'd be great."

And look, the América Móvil asset sale has been one of those things floating out there. Nobody really yet knows what that's going to look like. And for us, if we wanted to move into Mexico, there were a couple of really unique opportunities in front of us. And just to try to flush out what was going to be required by América Móvil to sell their assets seem like an uncertain process, so we pursued Iusacell. And then with the Nextel Mexico asset, what we have here is a set of assets, a spectrum portfolio that is really a robust spectrum portfolio, a nice cell site grid that'll be a very nice place to start and a nice customer base. And so we have the makings for what we need for a very viable and strong Mexico strategy, whether América Móvil sells assets or not. And so that's what we tried to do, is chart a path that would get us into Mexico and get us and platform that would sustain itself, and we like these assets. We think these assets are more than sufficient to compete in Mexico and to go in and compete aggressively and take share. So I feel good about the assets we've got. On South America and Brazil, it's too early to say, John. What we have down there is the best pay TV business in Latin America, and it's a business that continues to grow. It's got a great brand name down there. DIRECTV has done a very nice job of assembling some nice spectrum in various Latin American markets, where they're doing a fixed wireless-type solution for broadband. So there are a number of markets where they have line of sight and the ability to bundle broadband with the TV product. And their brand is strong enough that where they do that, they have really, really good success. And so we're actually anxious to get the transaction closed and leverage those assets in Latin America. And it is, it's a really good product, a really good footprint, a really good brand. So we're excited about getting it. On Canada, I think, right now, we have about as much as we as a company can handle. We're not prepared to start talking about going North of the border right now. We've got a lot to execute on, the DIRECTV, get the deal approved, and then we've got some serious integration efforts that we need to get busy on. And then, obviously, building out Mexico is going to be a full-court press for the next couple of years. So we've got more than we can chew right -- we've bitten off more than we can chew right now, and you'll see us focus on what we've consummated to date."

But John, I thought, did a nice job of giving a good basis of compare to 2012. And so fourth quarter of 2012, there were 3 competitors with an iPhone in the marketplace. That was the last time there was a major iPhone launch, and our churn rate this quarter was very comparable to what it was in 2012. In this quarter, there -- everybody in the market had an iPhone. And so the churn rates in the fourth quarter, relative to what we've seen in the past, were fairly consistent. When you look at the churn rates for the year in light of what I think was a very robust pricing environment, we had our lowest churn rates ever. Now as we move forward, what we are really going to be focused on is the smartphone base. You're going to see us continue to penetrate our customer base with smartphones. We added a million in the fourth quarter by itself, and you're going to really see us focus more and more intently on the business side of the equation. And you're seeing how we're laying out what our segmentation -- or what our business segments will look like as we move into 2015. And we've had a lot of success really focusing on the business segment with our wireless products and bundling that with VPN solutions and security solutions. And as I mentioned in the opening that when you put those 2 areas together -- or not put the 2 together, but when you look at our enterprise business segment, both fixed line and wireless combined, it's growing 5.8% in the fourth quarter. That business segment, that segment of customers churns lower than any other segment of the marketplace. It is price competitive. But it's interesting when you bundle it with VPN and other product sets that you have a very, very nice business that grows very nicely. And as John showed, we're expanding margins as well. So we're really focused on the high-end customer base. The area where we're seeing a lot more pressure in the market is in the feature phones. We churn feature phones much higher than our traditional smartphone base, and so that's what Cricket serves the purpose to do is to help us address that into the market with a very robust and aggressive prepaid product. And as John pointed out in his comments, Cricket, we're getting through the transition. It is now growing. Our prepaid base is growing. That customer base is obviously a very nice complement to what we're doing in Mexico. We're looking forward to taking advantage of the Mexico footprint to -- with Cricket. And as you noticed in the last week, we've announced that free unlimited calling from the U.S. to Mexico, and you'll see more and more of those offers materialize going the other way as we build out the Mexican footprint and the Mexican network."

As you know, we've announced -- we're committed to do about an $18 billion range for CapEx next year. So that's about a $3.5 billion reduction in the CapEx or improvement in free cash flow. That's step 1. Step 2 is with all of our free cash flow -- or excuse me, with all our CapEx spending in investment, there comes some trailing expense. With a reduction in our CapEx, we'll see a reduction of that trailing expense. Not only will it help us with margins, but it will also help us with free cash flow. So those are 2 major steps. What everyone is -- we have invested significantly in our customer base with regard to Next. High-quality receivables, the banks continue to be interested and -- but we have a portfolio of those that we'll be able to securitize this year, and we'll see some turnaround in payback of cash for those that we haven't securitized. So we're optimistic about that. That will be pressured. Those things will be pressured by the continued success of Next. So we may we reinvest some of those Next dollars that we've got this year. We may reinvest from our customer base. We'll make those judgments as we go, and then we'll see some increase in taxes but not significant. We will likely see some increases in taxes. With all of that being said, we're very comfortable about the increasing free cash flow and improving dividend coverage guidance that Randall mentioned. We constantly talk to the credit rating agencies, work with them on our plans and try to be transparent with what we have going on. I would expect we'll see some -- they've made some announcements on their own, and I'm sure they will make their decisions as we kind of go through the rest of this year. And the final DTV integration plans that we have, they will come out and make their viewpoints known. But those -- I would tell you those conversations have been productive and constructive, but they're well -- understanding our strategies and our approach."

But quite frankly, when you sell almost 6 million phones in the fourth quarter on Next and you start billing those for the entire first quarter and throughout next year on a $28 or $30 a month basis, you can understand our optimism about improving ARPUs as we define those. And remember, we define it that way because that's where the customer is paying us in cash every month. So we feel real good about where we're going and where the processes. We're not predicting or giving a guidance with regard to when ARPU plus Next billings will be greater than they were in the prior year quarter, but we look forward to getting through this year and continuing the progress, especially after having a fourth quarter where the sales team just did an outstanding job of adding almost 6 million customers to the Next program."

Quite frankly, on the large national retailers and the manufacturer-owned retail stores, the take rates were smaller. But in the fourth quarter, they have a lot of activity for us. They sell a lot of our phones, a higher proportion of fourth quarter because of the holiday season than any other quarter. So we are optimistic about Next take rates increasing overall through the year, and we're also optimistic about working with financial retailers and the other retailers to provide an additional support on how to sell Next and how it works. So we're still real positive about Next and believe that we'll get the number of customers on the non-subsidy plans in line with the number of customers on Next, plus bring your own device. So we're really moving dramatically out of the subsidy business. That's a good thing long term and short term. With regard to the -- if free cash flow impacts, we'll have the flexibility to monetize. We expect to have the flexibility to continue to monetize large blocks of these securitizations. It's worked very well. The banks continue to have very much interest. And as we stated before, we want to continue a regular pattern of doing this so that we build the history for this entity to keep us with flexibility and financing going forward. I would suggest to you that the activities we have going now are not to -- are not intended to be looked at to generate cash flow in and of themselves to pump up cash flow in any way, shape or form. It's really more of just a prudent management process throughout the year. We'll have flexibility to push forward or pull back, depending upon continued interest rates, continued attractiveness from the banks and so forth. But so far, the process has gone extremely well.

First of all, deal process. You nailed, when the 180-day clock is running again. But obviously, there is a legal challenge going on between the content providers and the FCC, and that's kind of the big unknown in our process right now. We're hopeful that the 2 parties, the FCC and the content folks, can get that deal settled in short order. I believe there's a court proceeding that's due here soon that will help determine the pace at which that progresses. But even with that, Simon, we're still fairly confident that this thing gets done first half of the year. And so I can't get any more refined than that because of this issue. And so this issue would be the only issue because of the delay of the 180-day clock to our knowledge right now. As it relates to the synergies, there's a fairly predictable formula with us when we do these large-scale deals. And when we're doing the deals, we tend to be fairly conservative. And we obviously have begun with the DIRECTV management teams, some parlor discussions and getting to a level of detail that -- that's appropriate within the confines of the DOJ review and so forth. And so we're starting to see details on channels and channel cost and so forth. And as a result, as you start drilling down to it, it's fairly much across the board. We're seeing better opportunities in what we've baked into the original deal economics, and so that's why we're feeling pretty confident that we will exceed the merger synergies that we announced at the time that we did the deal. And across the board, they are looking to. There are even revenue synergies. When you have 20 million DIRECTV customers that are very, very high-end customers and seeing what the wireless penetration rate that we have in that customer base, it looks really good, the opportunity to be able to sell mobility into those channels and so forth. So across the board, cost synergies, few revenue synergies, it's all looking better to what we had anticipated when we announced the deal. And then in terms of video to any device, this is one of the key opportunities that we were pursuing when we did this deal. Our customers are demanding video to be delivered across any device. And so one of the primary objectives we will have coming out of the close of the deal is taking advantage of the content relationships that DIRECTV has in our wireless customer base. We envision customers being able to walk out of our stores with content available to them on devices that they have purchased in our stores. You're familiar with the Otter deal that we have done with The Chernin Group where we are developing over-the-top content with them and taking advantage of ways of delivering that to our customers as well. So it's going to be a multifaceted approach in terms of how we bring video to our customers, but we're looking at multiple channels and channel lineups that we'd be able to accommodate into our wireless customers, both tablet as well as handsets, as well as our broadband customer base, 60 million broadband customers. And so stay tuned, there will be more to come, but this is a high priority for us, is getting the content delivered to the mobile handsets and tablets."

John, if there was an attractive opportunity in Latin America, maybe something sizable like América Movil is expected to be, given your funding requirements over the next few years, do you think a transaction like that -- you could do a transaction like that and stay within a comfortable leverage range? Or should we expect some equity component for a sizable transaction? And then, Randall, part of the strategy of allowing the base to move to new pricing with the help on the churn side and while we saw the benefits of that over the prior 2 quarters, we did see churn return to levels similar to 2 years ago, as you pointed out. Are you comfortable with the current pricing strategy in place right now? And do you think this fourth quarter was more of a onetime-ish in nature? Or should we expect churn to remain at elevated levels as we move throughout 2015?"

So anything else is just kind of a speculation and probably isn't worth conversation at this point. In terms of churn, I would tell you, I'm comfortable with the performance we had in the fourth quarter as it relates to churn, and I'll say it again. When you compare that to 2 years ago, which was the last major iPhone launch and only 3 national carriers carrying the iPhone, to have a comparable level of churn with the kind of pricing moves we're seeing in the marketplace versus 2 years ago, I think that's pretty good performance, and it's performance for the quarter we're comfortable with. We are, as I mentioned before, are really focused on that area of our customer base that tends to have lower churn. And that is our business customer base in the high-end consumer customer base where we are experiencing the churn as John said in the feature phone side of the house, and we will address that with our Cricket platform. And so right now, it's -- who can call where pricing goes in this industry? I haven't the slightest idea. It moves. It's very volatile. But right now, we'd like the value equation we have in the marketplace. We have a customer base that demands reliability, that demands speed and that demands quality. They demand a very sophisticated consumer channel and business channel. We have probably the most sophisticated business channel in the industry for B2B, and we think it's very important. And we think also that, that B2B customer segment is more and more demanding security solutions integrated all the way through the cloud with our NetBond strategy, and that's proving to be a very powerful combination in the marketplace. So that's where you'll see us focused. And like I said, I can't predict where pricing will go."

Let me give Randall a break, and I'll take the copper question first. We went through a study. And in our business, there's active payers that are -- copper payers that are connected to customers and serving customers. There are spare payers in our network. They're available. They're in great working condition and available to be used if needed, and then there are what we would consider dead payers or payers that need significant repair work that are not connected to any customers and need significant repair work and investment to make functional. We did a detailed study across our network by our network engineers in conjunction with them, identified, marked and made the decision to abandon those ineffective payers or what we would -- what the engineers would call dead payers. We have plenty of capacity to serve our customers with our active payers and spare payers. So we don't expect any limitations on that. We -- that's how we went through the process. It was a very extensive process. It was a very unusual process to go through. We don't expect any further write-offs like this. We're not aware of any. We just thought it was appropriate to recognize this fact. And I think anybody's following our business have seen the change in our access line customer base over the last 5 or 6 years can understand that we would have payers that would be inactive. And in this case, the ones that were not economical to activate, not to mention the fact, there's not demand for us to make that investment. So that's the background, gets across our traditional wireline footprint."

Look, I'll address it from a couple of perspectives. First, net neutrality, I mean, what this debate started out as to be pursuing was how do we protect net neutrality, a neutral Internet. And I would tell you I'm not familiar",573,"My favorite topic, Title II. Look, I'll address it from a couple of perspectives. First, net neutrality, I mean, what this debate started out as to be pursuing was how do we protect net neutrality, a neutral Internet. And I would tell you I'm not familiar -- I don't know if anybody in the industry who really argues that we shouldn't have net neutrality and, indeed, the President laid out 4 principles for what that meant. And we look at those 4 principles and said, ""You know, we're okay with those."" Those 4 principles -- if what resulted from all of this was the FCC were given authority to enforce those 4 principles, it has no bearing or impact on our investment decisions. None whatsoever. What causes us pause is if the way you affect those 4 principles is by categorizing the Internet and wireless services as Title II communication services. That's a different deal, all right? And that's something we have to say, ""What does that mean?"" And what are the implications of categorizing these services as Title II services to our industry? And I -- the example I give is we are right now trying to obsolete our old legacy telephone services, moving to IP or to all wireless. And there is a very specific process one has to go through to obsolete those services and replace them with the new advanced services, and we're working through that with the FCC. It's a very collaborative process. It works, but it takes a lot of time to make that happen. And we think that we might be able to get to a point where we can obsolete these services and begin replacing them with the new services by 2020. That's an aggressive timeline. The idea of beginning to put our wireless services and our broadband products under those categories and subjecting ourselves to that kind of regulatory oversight is what causes us pause. And when we say we are pausing investment until we understand where this is going, that's what we're referring to. Now Chairman Wheeler can find some creative solution of categorizing these as Title II but doesn't cause the industry to slow down, doesn't cause investment cycles to slow down, does not cause innovation cycles to slow down, then it will give us some confidence and relief to continue investing at the same pace we have. But until we kind of have clarity, and we're saying we're just on any new investments where we're in a bit of a pause mode, but it's really up in the air right now. There are a lot of ways of getting of what the President has articulated he wanted to accomplish. One of them is Congress is working on it, and that is that Congress would pass legislation that we give the FCC the authority to enforce the 4 principles that the President articulated were important. That works to us. That puts us very similar to where we are today and probably doesn't change our investment thesis for anything we're trying to do. But these really strident, heavy-handed regulations on wireless and broadband, if we go down that path, that's what causes everybody some apprehension and uncertainty and begins to change investment thesis and so forth. So it's up in the air. Right now, we're just anxious to see where the FCC comes out so we can all begin to formulate our plans."

If you look at the DIRECTV transaction based on some of the most recent public financials, you'll know that there's a cash piece of the transaction that would approximate about $15 billion. And I think if you go back to their last published financial statement, their gross debt rate -- gross debt level could be at $18 billion to $20 billion level. That would be the debt we'd be adding on as well as any impacts from closing Nextel and Iusacell as compared to our first quarter, and then we've got some other -- as we mentioned, we can't talk about the spectrum auctions, and so we won't do that. We'll have other impacts from matters ongoing that will impact our debt ratings. With regard to that, it is very conceivable that our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio would go above 2. I think that's assumed and possibly in -- somewhere in between the 2 to 2.5 range, and I know it's a great -- a wide range, but that's where we feel comfortable right now. Say it again, those are the kinds of levels of debt that we would expect that could occur once we close all the transactions. What we would then focus on doing is -- because we would have accretive free cash flow after the DTV transactions we said before, we would take the excess cash flows after dividends and use that, commit that to paying down debt as quickly as possible. We've suggested that over the kind of the course of the 3-year cycle. That ought to get us back to what is more traditional levels. For us, that's the 1.8x net debt-to-EBITDA. And if you look at our current cost of borrowings, some of our recent transactions, but quite frankly, our entire portfolio today, we have after-tax cost of debt well below 3%. So it's producing interest expense at a very acceptable level at 1.8. We're just a few years ago where interest rates were higher. You might have gotten a comparable answer with the 1.5 or 1.6 net debt-to-EBITDA. So that's where we're at. We'll let the debt rating agencies deal with it as they see fit, but we're comfortable with where we're going and we understand the implications. The last thing I would tell you, Amir, is as we announced last week, we'll set up a facility with a collection of banks an 18-month, 3-year, 5-year terms for over $11 million. The net after-tax cost of that debt average is less than 1%. And we have been very transparent with our plans and activities such that reasonable people as the banks are in this process are still very interested in providing a significant funding at very attractive rates with an ability for us to prepay it without penalty and ability just to leave the, if you will, facility open until such time as we need it. So we feel real good about where we stand in the credit markets. We'll continue to work on it, but we continue to feel good about where we're at."

You know your customers well, and so you're willing to invest in your customers that you know who may have credit scores that are weaker than what a new customer -- you'd be willing to do with a new customer coming in with a low credit score.

We're all fighting colds around here. Lori may end up having to handle this call for us. Before John takes you through the results, I want to take just a couple of minutes and frame where we are.
2012 to 2014 was really a period of unprecedented investment for AT&T and for the industry for that matter. And during this period, we built our LTE network to cover more than 300 million people. We expanded our U-verse broadband footprint of 57 million customer locations, and we deployed fiber to 725,000 business locations. And at the same time, we reengineered our mobile network, and we now deliver the strongest LTE signal in the U.S. 
Now at the same time, we've been aggressively repositioning our wireless customer base. We're giving our customers now a choice of moving away from heavy handset subsidies in exchange for lower monthly prices. And as a result, our customer satisfaction continues to climb and defections continue to fall. And you can see that by our record-low annual postpaid churn rate. And we also delivered our best-ever, full year adjusted EBITDA service margins. We've also made a significant investment to migrate our wireline customer bases to the new platforms. At the end of 2014, 76% of our broadband customers were on our fastest IP-based platforms, and our strategic IP-based business services now represent a $10 billion annualized revenue stream and is growing 14% when you adjust it for the Connecticut sale.
And that brings us to 2015. Because with these foundational investments largely behind us and several strategic investments announced to date, the groundwork is now being laid for 2015 and beyond. And today, our customers are expecting us to deliver video across all of our platforms, whether it's traditional linear video or over the top on U-verse broadband or video to the mobile device. So we've been assembling the pieces that we need to do exactly that. 
DIRECTV quickly and significantly shores up the economics of our U-verse video product, and it brings us the best content relationships in the industry. Our fixed broadband footprint will quickly begin expanding to 70 million customer locations in the U.S. when we complete the DIRECTV transaction. And in the Cricket acquisition, it's proven to be a cost-effective way to strengthen our spectrum portfolio, which is a prerequisite for being in the mobile video delivery business. 
We also laid the groundwork for expanding these capabilities outside the U.S. We've always believed that demand for the mobile Internet and economic benefits experienced in the U.S. would be repeated throughout the world. And so with that, we've been looking for opportunities to gain a wireless foothold in key markets when the regulatory and the investment climate is right, and Iusacell and Nextel International's Mexico assets give us of this opportunity. The changes in the Mexican legal and regulatory framework make it attractive for a new entrant to invest, and we closed on Iusacell. And then once we complete Nextel, we'll have a very deep spectrum portfolio, and this is the first element needed for a robust mobile Internet offering.
We will now have the ability to extend our U.S. network directly into Mexico, building one seamless network that's spanning 400 million people. And whether it's cross-border businesses, Latino customers of either Cricket or AT&T or Mexican consumers, we will be the only company with mobile Internet capability spanning both countries. And don't forget, DIRECTV brings the premier video business in Latin America. So the byproduct of this is represented on Slide 5.
When you go 12 months from now, AT&T's revenue mix is going to look very different. It will be much more diversified. The way we integrate our products and services will be different. And when we end 2015, post-DIRECTV, our revenues will come from 4 areas. Our largest will be business solutions, that includes both fixed and wireless services and is growing nicely. In fact, in the fourth quarter, that's -- that area is growing nearly 6%. 
The next area will be our consumer TV and broadband business. Then third will be our consumer mobility business. Then obviously, our Latin American businesses with satellite TV and then the Mexican mobility businesses will be our fastest-growing area, and we like this mix a lot. And by the end of the year, we're going to be uniquely positioned in a world of high-speed connectivity dominated by video, and it's going to be a very different business.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to you, John, to go through 2014."
100231,280659621,749669,"AT&T, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2015",2015-01-27,"Earnings Calls","AT&T Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Randall. Hello, everyone. Let me start with our consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 6.We finished the year strong with solid revenue and EPS growth in the fourth quarter. Consolidated revenues grew to more than $34 billion, up 4",2407,"Thank you, Randall. Hello, everyone. Let me start with our consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 6.
We finished the year strong with solid revenue and EPS growth in the fourth quarter. Consolidated revenues grew to more than $34 billion, up 4.5% when you adjust for the sale of our Connecticut properties. This was driven by strong wireless growth, as we continue to reposition our business model and adjusted revenue growth in wireline, thanks to gains in strategic business services and U-verse.
For the full year, we saw adjusted consolidated revenue grow by more than 3%. This helped drive strong EPS growth. Reported EPS for the quarter was a loss of $0.77. However, when you exclude the significant items we disclosed in the last weeks, earnings per share was $0.55. That's up nearly 4% from a year ago. And if you consider that last year included about $0.02 of equity income from our divested América Móvil interest, that percentage would have been closer to 8%. Adjusted EPS was up slightly for the year even after a $0.06 impact from the sale of our América Móvil investment.
These adjustments include $0.94 of noncash pressure from the year-end mark-to-market charge for our benefit plans. This was almost the reverse of last year when we had a strong mark-to-market gain. The actuarial loss was largely driven by a decrease in the discount rate but was partially offset by strong performance of our benefit plan investments.
We also had a $0.25 noncash pressure from the write-off of certain network assets, which we told you about earlier this month, and we had $0.13 of cost associated with wireless integration, DIRECTV transaction costs and a loss from the sale of the Connecticut properties.
Now let's turn to our operational highlights, starting with wireless on Slide 7. Before I get to the quarter, it's important to take a look back at the full year and see how far we've come with repositioning our wireless business. It's been almost a year since we first introduced our Mobile Share Value plans and began to accelerate the move of our smartphone base off the subsidy model to AT&T Next. Since that time, the results have been dramatic.
First, we have nearly 3.3 million postpaid net adds, thanks to strong growth of phones and tablets. That's our best full year gain in 5 years, and this includes more than 700,000 postpaid phone net adds during the year. These postpaid gains, along with an end-of-year surge of connected device subscribers, thanks mainly to the connected car, helped drive 5.6 million total net adds, our strongest growth in 3 years. Just as impressive, we added nearly 5 million new smartphone subscribers during the year. These high-value, high-quality customers have an ARPU of about twice that of non-smartphone subscribers. At the same time, we had our best-ever, full year postpaid churn. That's a remarkable achievement any time but even more so when you consider the intense competitive environment we faced during the year.
We also had our best-ever, full year adjusted EBITDA service margins. We achieved that even with record full year smartphone sales. This is the impact of AT&T Next. Already, more than a quarter of our postpaid smartphone base are on equipment installment plans, and more than half of our smartphone base has moved off the subsidy model pricing. These are the long-term results we have talked with you about throughout 2014. A repositioning of the smartphone base is working with nearly 70% of our postpaid base now on Mobile Share plans. 
Now let's look at fourth quarter results, starting on Slide 8. Let's begin with net adds, where we had another strong quarter. We added nearly 2 million total subscribers, led by postpaid and connected devices. We added more than 850,000 postpaid subscribers, thanks to strong growth of tablets. These tablet gains more than offset a slight decline of feature phones subscribers, but we also grew high-quality postpaid smartphone base by another million in the quarter. This includes upgrades and migrations, which we don't include in our net add number. Connected devices also continued their strong growth as the Internet of Things begins to evolve. Nearly 1.3 million connected devices were added in the quarter, including 800,000 connected cars.
Prepaid showed a loss in the fourth quarter. However, the Cricket brand is showing momentum with positive net adds after losing customers in the pre-acquisition year ago fourth quarter. The Cricket integration is going strong. Distribution has been expanded. Churn is improving, and now nearly 3/4 of the customer base has transitioned to the AT&T network.
The fourth quarter is traditionally a strong sales quarter, and you see that in our results. We had record smartphone postpaid gross adds and upgrades with more than 10 million smartphones sold in the quarter. That includes record total upgrades, those customers choosing to stay with AT&T and commit to new device plans. Our upgrade rate exceeded 11% in the quarter.
Smartphones were 94% of all postpaid phone sales, another record for us in the quarter. As expected, postpaid churn was up in the quarter. The fourth quarter traditionally sees increased levels of churn for all carriers. And when you add in the intense competitive activity in the quarter, it's no surprise to see churn at these levels. But even with all this noise in the market, postpaid churn levels were comparable to 2 years ago, the last time a fully refreshed iPhone hit the market. And this was of the first time that all major carriers were able to sell that phone during the busy fourth quarter.
Now let's look at revenue gains on Slide 9. Total wireless revenues grew nearly 8%, as the revenue mix shift we have seen throughout the year continued to play out in the fourth quarter. Equipment revenue growth tops 70% with strong AT&T Next sales. Service revenues were pressured, as customers continue to sign up for Mobile Share Value plans and move away from the traditional subsidy model. We now have more than 18 million smart Mobile Share accounts, covering nearly 70% of our postpaid subscribers. And about 58% of our postpaid smartphone base is on no-subsidy pricing. 
Mobile Share customers continue to buy up a larger buckets of data. Half of our accounts are on the plans of 10 GB or larger. That compares to 27% a year ago, and we're seeing a move to even bigger, larger data plans. Nearly 20% on plans of 15 GB or more. That's 3x more than a year ago. This helped drive an 18% increase in data billings.
The take rate for AT&T Next increased to 58% in the fourth quarter or about 5.9 million new Next customers. This impacted cash flows, but we consider this an investment in a great customer base that we are more than willing to make.
We also had about 400,000 customers bring their own devices on to our network. The Next take rate was a step-up from prior quarters. While we continue to see strong customer response in our company-owned stores and agents with the Next take rate of about 90% of upgrades, the take rate for Next through our other retailers was much less. The strong holiday sales played a role here. We typically have a higher percentage of our sales with other retailers in the fourth quarter. These stores are still becoming familiar with Next plans, and our sales show that. Plus, with the rush of the holiday season, sales personnel with these retailers don't always have the time to take the steps necessary to close the Next transaction. We'll continue to work with these stores and expect the take rate of those locations to pick up in the future.
As expected, the strong Next take rate helped drive the second consecutive quarter of sequential ARPU growth when you factor in Next billings. When you add in Next billings, you get a more accurate idea of what an average customer pays us every month. That average monthly Next billings were up about $28 per month even with the introduction of the Next 24-month plan. As the Next space grows, so does the impact on billings. Nearly 27% of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next. 
Now let's move to our wireline operations on Slide 10. The transformation of our wireline networks to IP technology has helped drive year-over-year wireline revenue growth. We say it again, this helped drive year-over-year wireline revenue growth when you adjust for the sale of our Connecticut operations. We're really seeing the overall revenue impact of the strategic business services and U-verse. 
Total adjusted U-verse revenues increased by more than 20% and are now about 2/3 of consumer revenues, and strategic business service revenues grew by more than 14% and are now 30% of total wireline business revenues. Growth was even stronger when you adjust out the impacts of foreign exchange.
Overall, adjusted wireline consumer revenue increased 2.4%. Adjusted wireline business revenues were down 1.8%. However, if you adjust for the impact of discontinued Global Hubbing businesses and foreign exchange, that decline would have been just about 0.5%. 
We're still dealing with the impacts of an uneven economy, but enterprise revenues were up slightly. However, the lack of new business formations continue to pressure small businesses. Wholesale also saw pressure in the quarter in part due to our focus on profitable sales. These results help drive a sequential improvement in wireline margins, which were up 120 basis points over the third quarter of 2014. That's a reversal of trends in recent years when we have seen sequential declines between the third and fourth quarter. 
U-verse subscribers also grew in the quarter. We added more than 400,000 high-speed broadband subscribers and now added 2.1 million for the full year. We finished the year with 12.2 million high-speed broadband subscribers or more than 3/4 of a broadband base. The transformation to IP broadband is a remarkable accomplishment for our entire wireline team.
U-verse TV subscribers net adds came in at 73,000. Net adds were impacted by a strategic move to improve the profitability of our wireline consumer business. With our high content costs, we targeted profitable, long-term value subscribers with lower churn rates while still taking market share. 
Now let's take a look at margins on Slide 11. Let's start with our wireless margins. Wireless margins were pressured by strong smartphone gross adds and upgrades, investment-related expenses and wireless integration costs. We mentioned earlier that we had our best-ever, full year adjusted service margins even with record sales, thanks to AT&T Next. We also see the impact of Next on our quarterly results. 
While our wireless EBITDA service margin was down slightly when compared to a year ago, the fourth quarter of 2014 saw 2.6 million more smartphone sales than in the previous year. And if you compare the results to 2 years ago when smartphone sales were comparable, service margins improved over 700 basis points.
Wireline margins improved from a year ago. Wireline margins usually are flat or down between the third and fourth quarter, but that trend changed last quarter. There was pressure from investment expenses and content cost, but this was offset by growth in wireline revenues and solid execution on cost initiatives.
For the quarter, our adjusted consolidated margins were 14.2% compared to 15.5% in the year-ago quarter and just under 13% 2 years ago. Strong smartphone sales also pressured consolidated margins, but our continued efforts for cost efficiency helped to offset some of that pressure.
Now let's move to cash flow. That summary is on Slide 12. For 2014, cash from operations totaled $31.3 billion and $5.7 billion for the quarter. Capital expenditures were $21.4 billion and $4.4 billion for the quarter, and free cash flow before dividends was $9.9 billion and $1.3 billion for the quarter. Free cash flow was impacted by the nearly 6 million AT&T Next sales in the fourth quarter. We pay upfront for those devices while our customers pay us back over time. The record upgrades and strong iPhone sales with a higher sales price mix made an impact as well. This speaks to our willingness to invest in our premium smartphone customer base. We aren't going to turn away good business to manage to a cash flow number. We have the financial strength to finance devices for our best customers who have the lowest churn and higher ARPU, and that is our focus.
At the same time, our Next receivables significantly increased while our bad debt ratios stayed at traditionally low levels. These are high-quality receivables. We did monetize $1.2 billion of the Next receivables in the quarter, as there continues to be great interest from financial institutions. And we do expect future sales of those receivables.
Also, in the fourth quarter, we sold our Connecticut wireline operations to Frontier for $2 billion. Our asset sales strengthen our balance sheet and cash position. In fact, we had more than $10 billion in cash and short-term investments on hand at the end of 2014. We have more than $3 billion in combined free cash flow and asset sales during the fourth quarter with $18 billion for the full year.
In terms of uses of cash, dividends totaled $9.6 billion for the year, and we continue to have one of the strongest yields around. We also announced the dividend increase last month. This is the 31st consecutive year that we have increased the dividend. That puts us on a small select group of companies. That should give you a good idea of how we look at our dividend. Saying that dividend is important to us is an understatement. We consider it a very important aspect of our shareholder return and are committed to it.
At the same time, we maintain the best credit ratings in the industry. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was at 1.75. And as we told you at the end of last year, the company will continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet but expects that with pending investments, in the near term, we may go over our 1.8x net debt-to-EBITDA target. Also, as we've told you earlier, after we close the DIRECTV transaction, our focus with free cash flow after dividends will be on paying down debt. That's the look at the fourth quarter and at 2014. 
I would now like to turn it back to Randall to talk about our 2015 outlook."

We're going to provide more definitive 2015 guidance after we close the DIRECTV transaction, and we do expect that to happen in the first half of this year. But let me frame for you what you can expect from us this year, and I'm going to start by talking about AT&T on a standalone basis. That is before our Mexico and DIRECTV acquisitions.
What we expect to deliver is continued consolidated revenue growth. Our adjusted EPS growth will be in the low single-digit range. We will have expanding margins, consolidated wireless and wireline margins. We will also have improving free cash flow and improving dividend coverage. And then capital expenditures will be in the $18 billion range, the same as we guided earlier, and that's thanks to the completion of a lot of the Project VIP initiatives.
Now if we include Mexico and DIRECTV, the first thing I want to note is that we now expect to achieve even higher multiyear synergies than we had communicated and anticipated when we announced the DIRECTV deal. And so when you add Mexico and DIRECTV, we anticipate no dilution to our adjusted EPS, meaning our adjusted EPS growth, including Mexico and DIRECTV will be in the low single-digit range.
We will exit 2015 a very different company. We'll be a company with the ability to deliver video to any device. We'll have unique capability to integrate solutions across a diversified base of customers, geographies and technology platforms that are mobile, fast and highly secure. And we will have a path to profitable TV growth. And we'll have a nice set of growing Latin America businesses positioned well in video and the mobile Internet. So that's where we're focused for 2015 and beyond. We're very excited about the opportunities that are ahead here for us. 
And so with that, Lori, I think we're ready to take questions."

And then if we could expand that, you also have a large footprint now in South America, especially Brazil. What are your thoughts on that market? And then maybe the same for Canada. You talked in -- at least in the release about a North American calling market. If you could sort of comment on your view on the attractiveness of those markets, that'd be great."

And look, the América Móvil asset sale has been one of those things floating out there. Nobody really yet knows what that's going to look like. And for us, if we wanted to move into Mexico, there were a couple of really unique opportunities in front of us. And just to try to flush out what was going to be required by América Móvil to sell their assets seem like an uncertain process, so we pursued Iusacell. And then with the Nextel Mexico asset, what we have here is a set of assets, a spectrum portfolio that is really a robust spectrum portfolio, a nice cell site grid that'll be a very nice place to start and a nice customer base. And so we have the makings for what we need for a very viable and strong Mexico strategy, whether América Móvil sells assets or not. And so that's what we tried to do, is chart a path that would get us into Mexico and get us a platform that would sustain itself, and we like these assets. We think these assets are more than sufficient to compete in Mexico and to go in and compete aggressively and take share. So I feel good about the assets we've got. On South America and Brazil, it's too early to say, John. What we have down there is the best pay TV business in Latin America, and it's a business that continues to grow. It's got a great brand name down there. DIRECTV has done a very nice job of assembling some nice spectrum in various Latin American markets, where they're doing a fixed wireless-type solution for broadband. So there are a number of markets where they have line of sight and the ability to bundle broadband with the TV product. And their brand is strong enough that where they do that, they have really, really good success. And so we're actually anxious to get the transaction closed and leverage those assets in Latin America. And it is, it's a really good product, a really good footprint, a really good brand. So we're excited about getting it. On Canada, I think, right now, we have about as much as we as a company can handle. We're not prepared to start talking about going North of the border right now. We've got a lot to execute on, the DIRECTV, get the deal approved, and then we've got some serious integration efforts that we need to get busy on. And then, obviously, building out Mexico is going to be a full-court press for the next couple of years. So we've got more than we can chew right -- we've bitten off more than we can chew right now, and you'll see us focus on what we've consummated to date."

In terms of the wireless business, when you look at 2014, there were some aggressive pricing in the marketplace. But John, I thought, did a nice job of giving a good basis of compare to 2012.

But John, I thought, did a nice job of giving a good basis of compare to 2012. And so fourth quarter of 2012, there were 3 competitors with an iPhone in the marketplace. That was the last time there was a major iPhone launch, and our churn rate this quarter was very comparable to what it was in 2012. In this quarter, there -- everybody in the market had an iPhone. And so the churn rates in the fourth quarter, relative to what we've seen in the past, were fairly consistent. When you look at the churn rates for the year in light of what I think was a very robust pricing environment, we had our lowest churn rates ever. Now as we move forward, what we are really going to be focused on is the smartphone base. You're going to see us continue to penetrate our customer base with smartphones. We added a million in the fourth quarter by itself, and you're going to really see us focus more and more intently on the business side of the equation. And you're seeing how we're laying out what our segmentation -- or what our business segments will look like as we move into 2015. And we've had a lot of success really focusing on the business segment with our wireless products and bundling that with VPN solutions and security solutions. And as I mentioned in the opening that when you put those 2 areas together -- or not put the 2 together, but when you look at our enterprise business segment, both fixed line and wireless combined, it's growing 5.8% in the fourth quarter. That business segment, that segment of customers churns lower than any other segment of the marketplace. It is price competitive. But it's interesting when you bundle it with VPN and other product sets that you have a very, very nice business that grows very nicely. And as John showed, we're expanding margins as well. So we're really focused on the high-end customer base. The area where we're seeing a lot more pressure in the market is in the feature phones. We churn feature phones much higher than our traditional smartphone base, and so that's what Cricket serves the purpose to do is to help us address that into the market with a very robust and aggressive prepaid product. And as John pointed out in his comments, Cricket, we're getting through the transition. It is now growing. Our prepaid base is growing. That customer base is obviously a very nice complement to what we're doing in Mexico. We're looking forward to taking advantage of the Mexico footprint to -- with Cricket. And as you noticed in the last week, we've announced that free unlimited calling from the U.S. to Mexico, and you'll see more and more of those offers materialize going the other way as we build out the Mexican footprint and the Mexican network."

As you know, we've announced -- we're committed to do about an $18 billion range for CapEx next year. So that's about a $3.5 billion reduction in the CapEx or improvement in free cash flow. That's step 1. Step 2 is with all of our free cash flow -- or excuse me, with all our CapEx spending and investment, there comes some trailing expense. With a reduction in our CapEx, we'll see a reduction of that trailing expense. Not only will it help us with margins, but it will also help us with free cash flow. So those are 2 major steps. The third one is we have invested significantly in our customer base with regard to Next. High-quality receivables, the banks continue to be interested and -- but we have a portfolio of those that we'll be able to securitize this year, and we'll see some turnaround in payback of cash for those that we haven't securitized. So we're optimistic about that. That will be pressured. Those things will be pressured by the continued success of Next. So we may we reinvest some of those Next dollars that we've got this year. We may reinvest in our customer base. We'll make those judgments as we go, and then we'll see some increase in taxes but not significant. We will likely see some increases in taxes. With all of that being said, we're very comfortable about the increasing free cash flow and improving dividend coverage guidance that Randall mentioned. We constantly talk to the credit rating agencies, work with them on our plans and try to be transparent with what we have going on. I would expect we'll see some -- they've made some announcements on their own, and I'm sure they will make their decisions as we kind of go through the rest of this year. And the final DTV integration plans that we have, they will come out and make their viewpoints known. But those -- I would tell you those conversations have been productive and constructive, but they're well -- understanding our strategies and our approach."

And remember, we define it that way because that's where the customer is paying us in cash every month. So we feel real good about where we're going and where the processes. We're not predicting or giving a guidance with regard to when ARPU plus Next billings will be greater than they were in the prior year quarter, but we look forward to getting through this year and continuing the progress, especially after having a fourth quarter where the sales team just did an outstanding job of adding almost 6 million customers to the Next program."

They sell a lot of our phones, a higher proportion of fourth quarter because of the holiday season than any other quarter. So we are optimistic about Next take rates increasing overall through the year, and we're also optimistic about working with financial retailers and the other retailers to provide an additional support on how to sell Next and how it works. So we're still real positive about Next and believe that we'll get the number of customers on the non-subsidy plans in line with the number of customers on Next, plus bring your own device.

We expect to have the flexibility to continue to monetize large blocks of these securitizations. It's worked very well. The banks continue to have very much interest. And as we stated before, we want to continue a regular pattern of doing this so that we build the history for this entity to keep us with flexibility in financing going forward. I would suggest to you that the activities we have going now are not to -- are not intended to be looked at to generate cash flow in and of themselves to pump up cash flow in any way, shape or form. It's really more of just a prudent management process throughout the year. We'll have flexibility to push forward or pull back, depending upon continued interest rates, continued attractiveness from the banks and so forth. But so far, the process has gone extremely well. We've been very pleased with not only the demand but also the financial terms."

And the agent channel is now beginning to perform at levels that look like our retail channel. And so then you'll move into the big-box retailers, it will follow a similar curve. And we've come through the holiday season. And John mentioned it. And they're pushing volumes, and this takes a little bit more time to sell a handset that's financed rather than just one in a box.

First of all, deal process. You nailed, when the 180-day clock is running again. But obviously, there is a legal challenge going on between the content providers and the FCC, and that's kind of the big unknown in our process right now. We're hopeful that the 2 parties, the FCC and the content folks, can get that deal settled in short order. I believe there's a court proceeding that's due here soon that will help determine the pace at which that progresses. But even with that, Simon, we're still fairly confident that this thing gets done first half of the year. And so I can't get any more refined than that because of this issue. And so this issue would be the only issue that would cause the delay of the 180-day clock to our knowledge right now. As it relates to the synergies, there's a fairly predictable formula with us when we do these large-scale deals. And when we're doing the deals, we tend to be fairly conservative. And we obviously have begun with the DIRECTV management teams, some parlor discussions and getting to a level of detail that -- that's appropriate within the confines of the DOJ review and so forth. And so we're starting to see details on channels and channel cost and so forth. And as a result, as you start drilling down to it, it's fairly much across the board. We're seeing better opportunities than what we've baked into the original deal economics, and so that's why we're feeling pretty confident that we will exceed the merger synergies that we announced at the time that we did the deal. And across the board, they are looking good. There are even revenue synergies. When you have 20 million DIRECTV customers that are very, very high-end customers and seeing what the wireless penetration rate that we have in that customer base, it looks really good, the opportunity to be able to sell mobility into those channels and so forth. So across the board, cost synergies, few revenue synergies, it's all looking better to what we had anticipated when we announced the deal. And then in terms of video to any device, this is one of the key opportunities that we were pursuing when we did this deal. Our customers are demanding video to be delivered across any device. And so one of the primary objectives we will have coming out of the close of the deal is taking advantage of the content relationships that DIRECTV has in our wireless customer base. We envision customers being able to walk out of our stores with content available to them on devices that they have purchased in our stores. You're familiar with the Otter deal that we have done with The Chernin Group where we are developing over-the-top content with them and taking advantage of ways of delivering that to our customers as well. So it's going to be a multifaceted approach in terms of how we bring video to our customers, but we're looking at multiple channels and channel lineups that we'd be able to accommodate into our wireless customers, both tablet as well as handsets, as well as our broadband customer base, 60 million broadband customers. And so stay tuned, there will be more to come, but this is a high priority for us, is getting the content delivered to the mobile handsets and tablets."

John, if there was an attractive opportunity in Latin America, maybe something sizable like América Movil is expected to be, given your funding requirements over the next few years, do you think a transaction like that -- you could do a transaction like that and stay within a comfortable leverage range? Or should we expect some equity component for a sizable transaction? And then, Randall, part of the strategy of allowing the base to move to new pricing with the help on the churn side and while we saw the benefits of that over the prior 2 quarters, we did see churn return to levels similar to 2 years ago, as you pointed out. Are you comfortable with the current pricing strategy in place right now? And do you think this fourth quarter was more of a onetime-ish in nature? Or should we expect churn to remain at elevated levels as we move throughout 2015?"

So anything else is just kind of a speculation and probably isn't worth conversation at this point. In terms of churn, I would tell you, I'm comfortable with the performance we had in the fourth quarter as it relates to churn, and I'll say it again. When you compare that to 2 years ago, which was the last major iPhone launch and only 3 national carriers carrying the iPhone, to have a comparable level of churn with the kind of pricing moves we're seeing in the marketplace versus 2 years ago, I think that's pretty good performance, and it's performance for the quarter we're comfortable with. We are, as I mentioned before, are really focused on that area of our customer base that tends to have lower churn. And that is our business customer base and the high-end consumer customer base where we are experiencing the churn as John said in the feature phone side of the house, and we will address that with our Cricket platform. And so right now, it's -- who can call where pricing goes in this industry? I haven't the slightest idea. It moves. It's very volatile. But right now, we'd like the value equation we have in the marketplace. We have a customer base that demands reliability, that demands speed and that demands quality. They demand a very sophisticated consumer channel and business channel. We have probably the most sophisticated business channel in the industry for B2B, and we think it's very important. And we think also that, that B2B customer segment is more and more demanding security solutions integrated all the way through the cloud with our NetBond strategy, and that's proving to be a very powerful combination in the marketplace. So that's where you'll see us focused. And like I said, I can't predict where pricing will go."

They're in great working condition and available to be used if needed, and then there are what we would consider dead payers or payers that need significant repair work that are not connected to any customers and need significant repair work and investment to make functional. We did a detailed study across our network by our network engineers in conjunction with them, identified, marked and made the decision to abandon those ineffective payers or what we would -- what the engineers would call dead payers. We have plenty of capacity to serve our customers with our active payers and spare payers. So we don't expect any limitations on that. We -- that's how we went through the process. It was a very extensive process. It was a very unusual process to go through. We don't expect any further write-offs like this. We're not aware of any.

And I think anybody's following our business have seen the change in our access line customer base over the last 5 or 6 years can understand that we would have payers that would be inactive.

And I would tell you I'm not familiar",573,"My favorite topic, Title II. Look, I'll address it from a couple of perspectives. First, net neutrality, I mean, what this debate started out as to be pursuing was how do we protect net neutrality, a neutral Internet. And I would tell you I'm not familiar -- I don't know if anybody in the industry who really argues that we shouldn't have net neutrality and, indeed, the President laid out 4 principles for what that meant. And we look at those 4 principles and said, ""You know, we're okay with those."" Those 4 principles -- if what resulted from all of this was the FCC were given authority to enforce those 4 principles, it has no bearing or impact on our investment decisions. None whatsoever. What causes us pause is if the way you affect those 4 principles is by categorizing the Internet and wireless services as Title II communication services. That's a different deal, all right? And that's something we have to say, ""What does that mean?"" And what are the implications of categorizing these services as Title II services to our industry? And I -- the example I give is we are right now trying to obsolete our old legacy telephone services, moving to IP or to all wireless. And there is a very specific process one has to go through to obsolete those services and replace them with the new advanced services, and we're working through that with the FCC. It's a very collaborative process. It works, but it takes a lot of time to make that happen. And we think that we might be able to get to a point where we can obsolete these services and begin replacing them with the new services by 2020. That's an aggressive timeline. The idea of beginning to put our wireless services and our broadband products under those categories and subjecting ourselves to that kind of regulatory oversight is what causes us pause. And when we say we are pausing investment until we understand where this is going, that's what we're referring to. Now Chairman Wheeler can find some creative solution of categorizing these as Title II but doesn't cause the industry to slow down, doesn't cause investment cycles to slow down, does not cause innovation cycles to slow down, then it will give us some confidence and relief to continue investing at the same pace we have. But until we kind of have clarity, and we're saying we're just on any new investments where we're in a bit of a pause mode, but it's really up in the air right now. There are a lot of ways of getting of what the President has articulated he wanted to accomplish. One of them is Congress is working on it, and that is that Congress would pass legislation that we give the FCC the authority to enforce the 4 principles that the President articulated were important. That works to us. That puts us very similar to where we are today and probably doesn't change our investment thesis for anything we're trying to do. But these really strident, heavy-handed regulations on wireless and broadband, if we go down that path, that's what causes everybody some apprehension and uncertainty and begins to change investment thesis and so forth. So it's up in the air. Right now, we're just anxious to see where the FCC comes out so we can all begin to formulate our plans."

If you look at the DIRECTV transaction based on some of the most recent public financials, you'll know that there's a cash piece of the transaction that would approximate about $15 billion. And I think if you go back to their last published financial statement, their gross debt rate -- gross debt level could be at $18 billion to $20 billion level. That would be the debt we'd be adding on as well as any impacts from closing Nextel and Iusacell as compared to our first quarter, and then we've got some other -- as we mentioned, we can't talk about the spectrum auctions, and so we won't do that. We'll have other impacts from matters ongoing that will impact our debt ratings. With regard to that, it is very conceivable that our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio would go above 2. I think that's assumed and possibly in -- somewhere in between the 2 to 2.5 range, and I know it's a great -- a wide range, but that's where we feel comfortable right now. Say it again, those are the kinds of levels of debt that we would expect that could occur once we close all the transactions. What we would then focus on doing is -- because we would have accretive free cash flow after the DTV transactions we said before, we would take the excess cash flows after dividends and use that, commit that to paying down debt as quickly as possible. We've suggested that over the kind of the course of the 3-year cycle. That ought to get us back to what is more traditional levels. For us, that's the 1.8x net debt-to-EBITDA. And if you look at our current cost of borrowings, some of our recent transactions, but quite frankly, our entire portfolio today, we have after-tax cost of debt well below 3%. So it's producing interest expense at a very acceptable level at 1.8. We're just a few years ago where interest expense rates were higher. You might have gotten a comparable answer with the 1.5 or 1.6 net debt-to-EBITDA. So that's where we're at. We'll let the debt rating agencies deal with it as they see fit, but we're comfortable with where we're going and we understand the implications. The last thing I would tell you, Amir, is as we announced last week, we'll set up a facility with a collection of banks an 18-month, 3-year, 5-year terms for over $11 million. The net after-tax cost of that debt average is less than 1%. And we have been very transparent with our plans and activities such that reasonable people as the banks are in this process are still very interested in providing a significant funding at very attractive rates with an ability for us to prepay it without penalty and ability just to leave the, if you will, facility open until such time as we need it. So we feel real good about where we stand in the credit markets. We'll continue to work on it, but we continue to feel good about where we're at."

We are very excited about the progress we've seen in our business the last 3 years. We set some ambitious goals to transform our business, every part of our business, to a new foundation for the future and for growth. The first quarter was another significant step in that transformation. To put it simply, we are executing very well.
We have completed or are near completion with all of our Project VIP network initiatives. We are also ahead of plans with many of the transformational customer and operational initiatives that we now have underway. The results are impressive. You know the story.
Our 4G LTE network now covers 308 million people with ultrafast speeds. We also deployed the Spectrum, intensified the network and added DOE's and WiFi capabilities to improve the quality and reach of our best-in-class network.
Our expanded wireline IP broadband footprint reaches 57 million customer locations. And we now are offering 75 megabit speeds in 90 cities. We've also deployed fiber to nearly 800,000 additional business locations with our 1 million goal in sight, enabling strategic services growth and network on-demand possibilities.
While transforming these networks, we've also invested heavily to transition our customer base. Many of those transitions are nearing completion as well. 
Several years ago, we started to move our postpaid base to smartphones and usage-based pricing. Today, 84% of our postpaid phone base use smartphones and almost 90% are on usage-based plans. And just one year ago, we accelerated the shift to the no-device-subsidy model for smartphones when we launched Mobile Share Value plans. Customer response to these plans have been tremendous. About 60% of our postpaid smartphone subscribers already are on no-device-subsidy plans.
The surge of customers coming to value plans provides for some expected tough comparisons when looking at year-over-year financial results. But our record-breaking churn demonstrates that we made the right move in introducing these plans.
We also moved to strengthen our position in new growth areas. In Prepaid, we acquired Cricket and paired it with our LTE network to provide a premium prepaid experience. We also saw the future of Internet of Things in developed platform, such as the Connected Car and home automation. We now have more than 20 million connected devices on our network, and the future is very bright for additional growth.
In Wireline, the transformation IP broadband is nearing completion. That means most of the cost associated with these transformation are also behind us. Today, nearly 80% of our broadband base is on IP and about 90% of the customers with access to IP broadband already have it. And more than 30% of our business wireline revenues come from our strategic IP services.
And finally, we've been laser-focused on improving our operations, driving efficiencies across the board. We're seeing good traction with several Project Agile cost savings initiatives, including digital first, which is our company-wide effort to make it easy for customers to do business online. The number of digital transactions with our customers has increased by the tens of millions the last 2 years, and we expect to see that increase by millions more in this coming year.
We also been reducing cycle times in provisioning new services. This improves our competitiveness, our revenue opportunities and the customer experience, while reducing expenses as well. And we took a giant step with our leading software-defined network initiative when we launched network on-demand capabilities for business customers in 100 cities. 
We continue to take steps to make our capital structure more efficient, including monetization of assets, reducing borrowing costs and implementing working capital improvements. This has contributed to our strong balance sheet and give us the financial strengths we need to continue to invest and diversify our business. The moves to diversify our business also continue on track in the first quarter. Those details are on Slide 4.
We've executed Project VIP in our transformation well, doing the hard work necessary to enable the company to move forward. This puts us in a great position to achieve the vision we laid out for you last quarter, a vision of a new AT&T, a diversified integrated wireless and wireline company for both business and consumers uniquely positioned in a world of high-speed mobile connectivity and video. We expect the DIRECTV transaction will close this quarter. We have done a lot of work identifying opportunities for additional cost synergies between these 2 great companies. This includes savings from supply chain, installation, customer care and even sending just one bill. This has increased our confidence that we can significantly exceed the original $1.6 billion expected in cost synergies. In fact, we now believe cost synergies alone will exceed a $2.5 billion run rate by year 3.
In Wireless, we closed on Iusacell, the first of our Mexico wireless acquisitions. And we expect to close the Nextel Mexico deal shortly. Together, these properties will give us a leading spectrum position in a dynamic wireless market that is just beginning its transformation to the mobile Internet.
We plan to deploy near nationwide 4G LTE network, something we know how to do very well. It'll be covering up about 100 million people in a country that borders the United States. The cross-border opportunities that this opens up are exciting from both a consumer and a business standpoint.
We've also significantly improved our spectrum position here in the United States. Our Leap acquisition brought with it an average of 10 megahertz of spectrum in the top 100 markets, covering 137 million people. Some of it was unused spectrum. We've already put much of that unused spectrum to work in more than 200 markets, and we've begun shutting down the legacy CDMA networks. We expect that process to be complete by the end of the year, and we will quickly redeploy that spectrum as well.
We also made a major investment earlier this year when we acquired licenses for near nationwide contiguous 2x10 megahertz block of high-quality AWS-3 spectrum. Needless to say, we feel good about our spectrum position. This takes a lot of uncertainty out of the process with our ability to add capacity and maintain quality in a cost-efficient manner. We know what we have, and we know what we need to do, and we have a clear path to delivering the network that customers want, that customers expect and that customers will use.
With that as background, let's take a look at our consolidated financial summary on Slide 5. Adjusted consolidated revenues grew to more than $32.6 billion. That's up about $375 million when you adjust for the sale of our Connecticut wireline properties. This growth was driven by continued success in wireless as we reposition our business model, strong demand for strategic business services and adjusted wireline consumer revenue growth. 
Adjusted wireline revenues were down about 1%. But revenues were essentially flat year-over-year if you adjust for the impact of foreign exchange and discontinued businesses. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.63. That includes adjustments for Leap integration expenses, as well as costs associated with the voluntary employee retirement plan. It also excludes a one-time $0.05 benefit from a tax planning-related manner. 
And while we don't show this on an adjusted basis, first quarter 2014 earnings also include the income we received from our previous equity ownership at América Móvil, as well as net income from our divested Connecticut wireline operations. Those 2 provide about $0.03 of EPS in the first quarter of the last year that we don't have this year.
Our business also continues to generate solid cash flows with free cash flow of $2.8 billion. Cash from operations totaled $6.7 billion, and that includes an additional $500 million investment in our next customer base. And capital expenditures were $4 billion. At the end of the quarter, our cash balance was $4.4 billion. And in terms of uses of cash, dividend payouts totaled $2.4 billion.
At the same time, we maintained a solid balance sheet while continuing to invest in the business. During the quarter, we funded investments in AWS spectrum and Iusacell, and we're also well-positioned for our planned investments in DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico.
Net debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of the quarter was 2.19. And as we said before, with our transformational investments in DIRECTV, Mexico and spectrum, we will go above our normal net debt-to-EBITDA target. But after we close the DIRECTV transaction, our focus with free cash flow after dividends will be on paying down debt and getting back to our target range. Now let's turn to our operational highlights, starting with wireless on Slide 6.
Our wireless results this quarter only include our domestic operations. Information on our Iusacell operations is included under the International segment in our financial statements, and it's separately broken out. 
The repositioning of our smartphone base by giving customers the choice of lower-priced service with no-device-subsidy plans continues to show positive results. Postpaid churn was 1.02%, the best first quarter that we have ever had and the best in the industry this quarter. This continues the positive trend we saw last year and comes at a very noisy and competitive marketplace. And prepaid churn also showed strong, continued signs of improvement, thanks to the strength of our Cricket operations.
Total net adds came in strong at 1.2 million and was led by gains in postpaid and connected devices. We added more than 440,000 postpaid subscribers in what is a traditionally slow net add quarter, thanks to strength in tablets. These tablet gains more than offset the decline of feature phones subscribers. We also grew our high-quality postpaid smartphone base by another 500,000 in the quarter. This includes postpaid upgrades and migrations, which we don't include in our net add number. 
And when you look at total branded smartphones, which includes both postpaid and prepaid, we added about 1.2 million smartphones to our base during the quarter. We also added about 1 million connected devices, thanks to a continued strong showing by Connected Cars. Connected device that net adds were impacted by a change in how we report our session-based tablets. 
Previously, we included them as part of our prepaid base. Now they're reported as connected device subscribers. This give us and you a better view of phone growth in prepaid, which has now essentially includes only phone activity.
You see that this quarter, thanks to strong results from our Cricket offering, we had positive growth in prepaid. Cricket is just the latest example of our ability to integrate new businesses. The team has done a very good job of transforming this business. 
Retention is at a schedule, churn is less than expected and certainly, much less so than historical levels prior to our ownership. And we're doing a great job of moving customers off the legacy CDMA network. More than 90% of Cricket customers already are on the GSM platform.
However, we do expect to see some pressure over the next quarters, as we complete the transition to GSM and shut down the legacy CDMA networks.
Overall, postpaid gross adds and upgrades continue at a solid base. We had about 6.2 million smartphone sales in the quarter, slightly higher than last year's total. Our postpaid upgrade rate was 6.6%. Smartphones were 94% of all phone sales and now make up about 84% of our postpaid phone base.
We still have about 16% of our phone-based to transition to smart phones, but the bulk of the smartphone transformation has been completed. Transforming our phone base to LTE smartphones and moving those customers to no subsidy and usage-based pricing has been a big investment for us. But once again, we made these investments, executed our plan and are now in a strong position to move forward.
Now let's look at the progress we're making with shifting our customers to AT&T Next and Mobile Share. That information and revenue were on Slide 7.
AT&T Next sales reached record levels, nearly 2/3 of smartphone sales. Another 5% brought their own devices to our network. That means 70% of phone sales in the quarter didn't carry a subsidy. Total wireless revenue was up about 2%, driven by 36% growth in equipment revenue. The customers who choose to bring their own devices don't increase equipment expense for us, so the no-device-subsidy model works for our customers and us, whether it's with Next or with Bring Your Own Device.
As expected, service revenues this quarter were impacted by Mobile Share Value plans. But because we have now past the anniversary of the introduction of these plans, we expect the year-over-year comparisons will improve in the coming quarters. 
At the end of the first quarter, more than 70% of our postpaid base is on Mobile Share plans, with more than 60% of the postpaid smartphone base on no-device-subsidy pricing. This means our first quarter Next flow share percentage has exceeded the percentage of smartphone subs on no-device-subsidy pricing. Mobile Share customers continue to buy up to larger buckets of data. About half of all accounts are on plans 10 gigabytes or larger. And about 20% are on plans of 15 gigs or more. That's more than twice as many as a year ago. This helped drive a 14% increase in data billings. 
As expected, the strong Next take rate helped drive the third consecutive quarter of sequential phone ARPU growth when you factor in Next Billings. The metric gives you a more accurate idea of what an average customer pays us each month. Phone-only ARPU with Next was more than $66 in the quarter with the average monthly Next billings about $6 and growing.
That strong sequential increase comes even you when you factor in the impact of our new data rollover plan, which generated about $0.25 of ARPU pressure in the quarter. As the Next base grows, so does the impact on billings. More than 30% of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next, but 65% of our sales were on Next. So our ARPU with Next is expected to continue to grow. Now let's move to our wireline operations on Slide 8.
Our focus on profitability and transforming to IP technologies can be seen in our wireline results. On the business side, strategic business services are now close to 1/3 of the business wireline revenues, and we continue to see strong demand for those services. 
Adjusted strategic business service revenues improved by more than 15% in the quarter. And when you adjust for FX, growth was more than 17%. Adjusted wireline business revenues were down 3.3%. However, about half of that decline comes from the impact of FX and our discontinued low-margin businesses, such as global Hubbing.
If you consider those items, the decline would have been 1.7%. And if you look at our combined business wireline and wireless operations, revenue actually increased year-over-year. While overall wireline business operations saw pressure, it was most pronounced in wholesale, in part, due to our focus on profitable sales and the continued impacts of network roaming. Enterprise revenue was down less than 1% when you adjust for Connecticut and FX.
Small business revenues were also down. However, there are some positive signs with new business starts and growing sales from our fiber build. We also took a significant step recently in our transition to software-defined networks. We introduced network on demand for business customers in more than 100 cities. This allows businesses to easily order and/or change network services on their own in realtime.
In consumer, viewer services now make up about 70% of consumer revenues and help drive adjusted consumer revenue growth of more than 2%. Viewer started the year with solid subscriber gains, increasing penetration and strong revenue growth, including adding more than 400,000 high-speed broadband subscribers. That helped drive a net gain of almost 70,000 new subscribers to our overall broadband base.
We are nearing the completion of our broadband conversion to IP. About 80% of our broadband base is now on IP. That's 90% of our IP eligible customers. So we expect the number of migrations to ease throughout the year, as well as the cost associated with those conversions.
At the same time, we continue to increase broadband speeds. We expanded our 75 megabit service to nearly 9 cities, and we offer GigaPower in 10 markets, including the just announced deployment in Chicago. We also hit a milestone with our voice-over-IP services in the quarter. We now have more than 5 million VoIP subscribers. All this helped drive an increase in adjusted U-verse consumer revenues of almost 20%. Now let's move to margins, starting with wireless margins on Slide 9.
Wireless service margins were essentially stable year-over-year. There was pressure from customers on no-device-subsidy pricing in advance of upgrades and from the full quarter inclusion of the Cricket operations. And our new data rollover plan also had about a 20 basis point impact on margins. This was offset by the impact of AT&T Next and cost-saving initiatives in the quarter.
Wireline margins continue to stabilize and operating margins were flat year-over-year. There was pressure from noncash benefit expenses and TV content costs, but this was offset by growth in consumer and strategic business service revenues and solid execution on our cost initiatives. For the quarter, our adjusted consolidated operating margin was 18.5%, compared to 19.6% in the year ago quarter and 18.9% 2 years ago.
But most of the year-over-year difference is due to our strategic investments in Mexico and Cricket. Cost efficiencies continue to be a priority with us. We just took us the success of a digital first as I mentioned earlier. We also made headway in cutting cycle times to provision new business services. We're seeing up to a 40% reduction in cycle times on some IP products with more than a 50% reduction in the fiber ready buildings. Our software-defined network initiatives will help even more. Before we open up the call for your questions, let me do a quick recap of the quarter on Slide 10.
The first quarter was another big step in the transformation and diversification of our company. Customers are moving to Mobile Share Value plans and AT&T Next in increasing numbers. This helped drive industry-leading postpaid churn and more than 1.2 million wireless net adds.
The success of the migration to IP technologies can clearly be seen in our wireline revenue numbers. IP services now make up 70% of our consumer revenues and our migration to IP broadband is near complete.
In business, strategic business services, which include our IP services, is close to 1/3 of the wireline business revenues. Strong demand has revenue growing at more than 15%. At the same time, the moves we are making to diversify our business through video and international operations are on track. We are confident that DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico deals will close this quarter, and we are taking steps to get all plans in place to close these transactions quickly.
Our solid balance sheet and cash flows provide the financial strength to invest and to make these transformative moves. We feel very confident with our stand-alone guidance for the year. We're on track and on plan. In fact, we're actually ahead of plan in many of the areas, including free cash flow.
That gives us even greater confidence that we can hit our growth targets for the year while also being prepared for the DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico acquisitions.
We're on the starting blocks for a very exciting year for AT&T. We have made the investments, have done the hard work necessary to position us to be a very different company. And we are ready for the opportunity ahead of us. 
With that, Tony, let's go ahead and take some questions."

The base of most of our savings that we previously announced was going to content contracts, as we understood them to be standard in the industry. And that was of the basis for a large part of our $1.6 billion original target. That, along with some of the normal synergies associated with bringing 2 public companies together. The initial ones are the opportunities we now see and going to, for example, one single truckroll to install products. So combining the installation of both our broadband capabilities and our video capabilities in the one truck roll. Or getting the customers on one single bill, one single customer care operation. The ability to go our -- to our supply chain to get better pricing with regard to our equipment because specifically one of us was buying set-top boxes and other equipment in lower numbers than the other one was. And so when you combine those, we were confident we can get some more supply chain savings. There's also there's standard cost of things like combine the advertising, combine customer care, combine activities. But that's what we've built up to this $2.5 billion. They are cost savings. But we believe that they're very much real, very achievable. And we believe that they'll grow certainly in the third years when they get to the 2.5 level. But they are significant during the 2017 third year timeframe. They will build starting in '15, but build really in '16, and really move towards significant amounts in '17. 
With regard to our confidence and the transaction closing, it really comes down to what that -- what the transaction is about. And that is bringing customers greater choice, bringing more competition to the marketplace, bringing expanded opportunities for customers to get bundled services, services that they want, and really, to improve the broadband capacity that's out there for customers through our additional investments in some of these savings. So as we continue to go through the process, we continue to feel good about where we're at, and we are optimistic and continue to believe we'll close it this quarter."

So I'll leave it at that. It just we continue to feel good about it. With regard to Mexico. The process for Nextel first had to go through the U.S. bankruptcy process and the opportunity for other bidders to come in. That process has all been completed. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court has approved the sale. So we're now just left the getting the regulatory authorities in Mexico with Patel to approve it. We're in, as you might, expect normal contact. And there will be normal in a deal, respectful contact and working through issues with them. Our experience with them on sell, our experience with them on the regulatory framework that they've set up and the economic environment they set up gives us confidence that, that deal could close shortly."

And when -- and I don't mean to be inappropriate, but the 1.02% postpaid churn is the best we've ever had. So -- and if you go beyond -- if you subdivide our postpaid base into postpaid smartphones, as you can imagine, the trend's even lower. So we feel very good about that. And with your comments with regard to service revenues, when you look at our service revenues this quarter, clearly, that was impacted by, so to speak, a full year of opportunity for customers to transition to Mobile Share and really not only about a month and no time prior to the first quarter of '14 and only about a month of 2014 first quarter for customers to transition. So this is going to be the starkest comparison or the most significant comparison time. We expect that those comparisons to get easier or to be less challenging as we go through the year because we've established much more of a stable Mobile Share Value base as of the end of the first quarter compared to where we were at the end of the first quarter last year."

First, I think we mentioned that we had about 65% take rate on Next on about a 0.2 million net adds upgrade sales. So around 4 million Next sales. You guys can do the math on an average price on the phone to get kind of the gross receivable. We mentioned that the increase our receivables net increase in our investment, our customers by about $500 million. We all set to the rest of the purchase price was about $1.5 billion of factoring and then some collections from customers for previously sold Next phones in early '14, or even a few that we sold in '13 that are now paying us monthly fees that we are collecting and keeping at the company. But we're are subject to prior monetizations or securitizations. On the net adds, at 70%, I think the key assumption there is we've seen this 60%, 65% Next take rate before. And we've seen it again this quarter. The one thing I will tell you is to get it to 70%, we had about 5%, about 300 -- a little over 300,000 BYOD devices. Those are great net adds for us. While they don't bring any equipment revenue, they do -- they don't bring any equipment expense. And so that's a good deal for us. They often join mobile share value plans. So they are sticky customers. That is the unknown, if you will, that 300,000 is a little bit below what it was running out the quarterly basis the last 3 quarters of last year. But this is typically a slower -- first quarter is typically a slower quarter. We're still encouraged by the level of that. That will be the determinant of where we come out, whether we come out in that 60% to 65% range or if we get higher than that, we'll just have to wait and see. But I do feel very good about the fact that in total, that no-device-subsidy is at 70%. And quite frankly, the overall base on Mobile Share Value for smartphones is at 62%. So we're wanting hotter than that. And then, third, the amount of those customers that are actually paying us monthly for Next today is down in the 32% range. So I'm very optimistic that the monthly Next ARPU piece, the monthly billings piece, is going to pick up from that $6 level. EBITDA margins, we're going to continue to focus on doing wireline and cost savings. I think you're aware that we didn't early -- a voluntary early retirement program. I think our take rates were on that. We're in the 3,300 range. So we'll see some savings from that going forward. Additionally, we did see some pressure in the first quarter as we converted some of our former backhaul or interconnection in Connecticut from company-owned to lease arrangements. So they moved out of depreciation in some of those characteristics into COE. And we'll manage through that and manage the efficiencies of our operations. We'll overcome that during the year. So those are the things we're working on to improve those margins. And as I said, we're still confident with our guidance, and that the guidance included improving margins in wireline/Wireless and overall."

You are right, Brett, that the second quarter of last year is going to be really tough comparison. But with that being said, we still are striving to do better each and every quarter than we did the last quarter, and we'll keep that effort up. When you think about our Mobile Share Value accounts, they're just under about $20 million of those accounts and they average just under 3 devices per account. I think when we get to the detail numbers, but it was probably about 19.5 million accounts, and there's 2.9 devices per account. And yes, that really does help with churn. Additionally, our smartphone churn is lower than our total postpaid. Effectively, our feature phone churn is higher and as we've reduced that base down to 16% now, of our base and of our postpaid base, and we're seeing flow share volume of only about 6%, we're optimistic that we can increase the smartphone base. And that will give us another lever to really attempt to manage churn to a lower level. With all that being said, it is a competitive environment, and we have to be ready to handle whatever situation, issues up a first comes out from other parties in this environment regardless of the logic that the or may not be behind them."

With regard to deleveraging, and I will go this way. We're expecting free cash flow to exceed dividends and provide cash, not only this year, but into the future, to pay down debt. That's one. Two, we're expecting EBITDA to expand, not only just from the acquisition of DTV, but from the content savings, excuse me, from the cost savings that we've talked about even today. That will expand EBITDA even more, which will, by simple math, help the metrics of net debt EBITDA. Third, we'll continue to look at all aspects of our asset portfolio. As I've mentioned before, we have about a $300 billion total asset portfolio today, and we'll only get larger with DTV and Nextel Mexico. And so we will continue to look for opportunities. I would suggest to you that if you look at our record over the last 3 [ph] years, we have a pretty reliable record of generating over $15 billion worth of cash from asset modernizations, and we've done it very tax efficiently. So we've netted a significant amount of net cash to be able to use. And we'll just continue to do the same process that we've done.

With regard to the Wireline business, the VIP project, and specifically, I think Mike, you're probably referring to the $57 million IP broadband locations. I suggest you this, what we really need to see is the DIRECTV deals are closed. Because the transaction, the key to being successful there in that area is that customers want a bundle. And so with the closing of the transaction, we'll be able to have a bundle, not only of the video Services that DTV provides, but of the product and services that we can provide. As I've mentioned before, about 30 million of those 57 million broadband locations a little bit under that number. Don't currently have a video product. Once we can do a real bundle with owner's economics and provide the efficiencies of one truck roll, the efficiencies of one service call, the efficiency of one troubleshooting call for the customers, one offer, one pricing structure, we believe that, that will not only be good for our company, but it will be very good for customers that they'll have a new competitive offer out of the marketplace. And so we think that the completion of our DIRECTV, AT&T merger is a key factor in that process and a key factor bringing great quality services to customers. And from our surveys and from the information I've seen, it's what customers want. So that will be the focus point. I would suggest to you that you'll probably have more to say on that and gives some insights to that when we have our Investor Day, which will likely be within about a month after the closing of DTV."

So that is what is getting capitalized. With regard to the fixed wireless, Colby, I wouldn't suggest to you that anything changed at this time. We still have the commitments out there in the DTV transaction. And we still stand ready to live up to those and to satisfy those in full. We think that's a clear benefit for the consumer and the marketplace as a part of that transaction. So -- but we're still confident that we can satisfy that. And we'll see how that comes out. That's probably the finalization of the DTV does is probably have to come before go through and be ready to discuss any modifications, if any, to the fixed wireless local plans.
With that, I want to thank all of you for being on the call today. Our work the last few years set us up for a transformative 2015. We are ready to move quickly once the DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico deals close. Our networks are in place. Our customers transformation is on track, and we are seeing tangible results in our digital first software-defined network initiatives. Our performance in the first quarter adds to that confidence. Wireless turned in another solid performance in a competitive environment. Wireline's is focus on profitability and strong demand for IP services brought margin stability and growing IP revenues.
We are ready for our next transformative steps, and we are excited about the opportunity we have before us. One last thing before we go, as a good friend of ours, Kathy, would tell you on your way home tonight, ""Don't text and drive. It can wait. "" Thanks again for being on the call.

We've set some ambitious goals to transform our business, ever",3300,"Thanks, Mike, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in AT&T.
We are very excited about the progress we've seen in our business the last 3 years. We've set some ambitious goals to transform our business, every part of our business, to lay a new foundation for the future and for growth. The first quarter was another significant step in that transformation. To put it simply, we are executing very well. We have completed or are near completion with all of our Project VIP network initiatives. We are also ahead of plans with many of the transformational customer and operational initiatives that we now have under way. The results are impressive. You know the story.
Our 4G LTE network now covers 308 million people with ultrafast speeds. We also deployed the spectrum, intensified the network and added DAS and WiFi capabilities to improve the quality and reach of our best-in-class network.
Our expanded wireline IP broadband footprint reaches 57 million customer locations, and we now are offering 75 megabit speeds in 90 cities. We've also deployed fiber to nearly 800,000 additional business locations with our 1 million goal in sight, enabling strategic services growth and Network on Demand possibilities. While transforming these networks, we've also invested heavily to transition our customer base. Many of those transitions are nearing completion as well. 
Several years ago, we started to move our postpaid base to smartphones and usage-based pricing. Today, 84% of our postpaid phone base use smartphones, and almost 90% are on usage-based plans. And just one year ago, we accelerated the shift to the no-device-subsidy model for smartphones when we launched Mobile Share Value plans. Customer response to these plans has been tremendous. About 60% of our postpaid smartphone subscribers already are on no-device-subsidy plans. The surge of customers coming to value plans provides for some expected tough comparisons when looking at year-over-year financial results, but our record-breaking churn demonstrates that we made the right move in introducing these plans.
We also moved to strengthen our position in new growth areas. In prepaid, we acquired Cricket and paired it with our LTE network to provide a premium prepaid experience. We also saw the future of the Internet of Things and developed platforms, such as the connected car and home automation. We now have more than 20 million connected devices on our network, and the future is very bright for additional growth.
In wireline, the transformation IP broadband is nearing completion. That means most of the cost associated with this transformation are also behind us. Today, nearly 80% of our broadband base is on IP, and about 90% of the customers with access to IP broadband already have it. And more than 30% of our business wireline revenues come from our strategic IP services.
And finally, we've been laser-focused on improving our operations, driving efficiencies across the board. We're seeing good traction with several Project Agile cost-savings initiatives, including digital first, which is our company-wide effort to make it easy for customers to do business online. The number of digital transactions with our customers has increased by the tens of millions the last 2 years, and we expect to see that increase by millions more in this coming year.
We also been reducing cycle times in provisioning new services. This improves our competitiveness, our revenue opportunities and the customer experience while reducing expenses as well, and we took a giant step with our leading software-defined network initiative when we launched Network on Demand capabilities for business customers in 100 cities. 
We continue to take steps to make our capital structure more efficient, including monetization of assets, reducing borrowing costs and implementing working capital improvements. This has contributed to our strong balance sheet and given us the financial strengths we need to continue to invest and diversify our business. The moves to diversify our business also continue on track in the first quarter. Those details are on Slide 4.
We've executed Project VIP and our transformation well, doing the hard work necessary to enable the company to move forward. This puts us in a great position to achieve the vision we laid out for you last quarter, vision of a new AT&T, a diversified integrated wireless and wireline company for both business and consumers, uniquely positioned in a world of high-speed mobile connectivity and video. We expect the DIRECTV transaction will close this quarter. We have done a lot of work, identifying opportunities for additional cost synergies between these 2 great companies. This includes savings from supply chain, installation, customer care and even sending just one bill. This has increased our confidence that we can significantly exceed the original $1.6 billion expected in cost synergies. In fact, we now believe cost synergies alone will exceed a $2.5 billion run rate by year 3.
In wireless, we closed on Iusacell, the first of our Mexico wireless acquisitions, and we expect to close the Nextel Mexico deal shortly. Together, these properties will give us a leading spectrum position in a dynamic wireless market that is just beginning its transformation to the mobile Internet. We plan to deploy near-nationwide 4G LTE network, something we know how to do very well. It'll be covering up about 100 million people in a country that borders the United States. The cross-border opportunities that this opens up are exciting from both a consumer and a business standpoint.
We have also significantly improved our spectrum position here in the United States. Our Leap acquisition brought with it an average of 10 megahertz of spectrum in the top 100 markets, covering 137 million people. Some of it was unused spectrum. We've already put much of that unused spectrum to work in more than 200 markets, and we've begun shutting down the legacy CDMA networks. We expect that process to be complete by the end of the year, and we will quickly redeploy that spectrum as well.
We also made a major investment earlier this year when we acquired licenses for near-nationwide contiguous 2x10 megahertz block of high-quality AWS-3 spectrum. Needless to say, we feel good about our spectrum position. This takes a lot of uncertainty out of the process with our ability to add capacity and maintain quality in a cost-efficient manner. We know what we have, and we know what we need to do, and we have a clear path to delivering a network that customers want, that customers expect and that customers will use.
With that as background, let's take a look at our consolidated financial summary on Slide 5. Adjusted consolidated revenues grew to more than $32.6 billion, and that's up about $375 million when you adjust for the sale of our Connecticut wireline properties. This growth was driven by continued success in wireless, as we reposition our business model, strong demand for strategic business services and adjusted wireline consumer revenue growth. 
Adjusted wireline revenues were down about 1%, but revenues were essentially flat year-over-year if you adjust for the impact of foreign exchange and discontinued businesses. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.63. That includes adjustments for Leap integration expenses, as well as costs associated with the voluntary employee retirement plan. It also excludes a onetime $0.05 benefit from a tax-planning-related manner. And while we don't show this on an adjusted basis, first quarter 2014 earnings also include the income we received from our previous equity ownership at América Móvil as well as net income from our divested Connecticut wireline operations. Those 2 provided about $0.03 of EPS in the first quarter of last year that we don't have this year.
Our business also continues to generate solid cash flows with free cash flow of $2.8 billion. Cash from operations totaled $6.7 billion, and that includes an additional $500 million investment in our Next customer base. And capital expenditures were $4 billion. At the end of the quarter, our cash balance was $4.4 billion. And in terms of uses of cash, dividend payouts totaled $2.4 billion. At the same time, we maintained a solid balance sheet while continuing to invest in the business. During the quarter, we funded investments in AWS spectrum and Iusacell, and we're also well positioned for our planned investments in DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico.
Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA at the end of the quarter was 2.19. And as we said before, with our transformational investments in DIRECTV, Mexico and spectrum, we will go above our normal net debt-to-EBITDA target. But after we close the DIRECTV transaction, our focus with free cash flow after dividends will be on paying down debt and getting back to our target range.
Now let's turn to our operational highlights, starting with wireless on Slide 6. Our wireless results this quarter only include our domestic operations. Information on our Iusacell operations is included under the international segment in our financial statements, and it's separately broken out. 
The repositioning of our smartphone base by giving customers the choice of lower-priced service with no-device-subsidy plans continues to show positive results. Postpaid churn was 1.02%, the best first quarter that we have ever had and the best in the industry this quarter. This continues the positive trend we saw last year and comes in a very noisy and competitive marketplace. And prepaid churn also showed strong, continued signs of improvement, thanks to the strength of our Cricket operations.
Total net adds came in strong at 1.2 million and was led by gains in postpaid and connected devices. We added more than 440,000 postpaid subscribers in what is traditionally a slow net add quarter, thanks to strength in tablets. These tablet gains more than offset the decline of feature phones subscribers. We also grew our high-quality postpaid smartphone base by another 500,000 in the quarter. This includes postpaid upgrades and migrations, which we don't include in our net add number. And when you look at total branded smartphones, which includes both postpaid and prepaid, we added about 1.2 million smartphones to our base during the quarter. We also added about 1 million connected devices, thanks to a continued strong showing by connected cars. Connected device net adds were impacted by a change in how we report our session-based tablets. Previously, we included them as part of our prepaid base. Now they're reported as connected device subscribers. This gives us and you a better view of phone growth in prepaid, which has now essentially includes only phone activity.
You see that this quarter. Thanks to strong results from our Cricket offering, we had positive growth in prepaid. Cricket is just the latest example of our ability to integrate new businesses. The team has done a very good job of transforming this business. 
Retention is at a schedule. Churn is less than expected and, certainly, much less than historical levels prior to our ownership. And we're doing a great job of moving customers off the legacy CDMA network. More than 90% of Cricket customers already are on the GSM platform. However, we do expect to see some pressure over the next quarters, as we complete the transition to GSM and shut down the legacy CDMA networks.
Overall, postpaid gross adds and upgrades continue at a solid pace. We had about 6.2 million smartphone sales in the quarter, slightly higher than last year's total. Our postpaid upgrade rate was 6.6%. Smartphones were 94% of all phone sales and now make up about 84% of our postpaid phone base. We still have about 16% of our phone base to transition to smartphones, but the bulk of the smartphone transformation has been completed. Transforming our phone base to LTE smartphones and moving those customers to no-subsidy and usage-based pricing has been a big investment for us. But once again, we made these investments, executed our plan and are now in a strong position to move forward.
Now let's look at the progress we're making with shifting our customers to AT&T Next and Mobile Share. That information and revenue were on Slide 7.
AT&T Next sales reached record levels, nearly 2/3 of smartphone sales. Another 5% brought their own devices to our network. That means 70% of phone sales in the quarter didn't carry a subsidy. Total wireless revenue was up about 2%, driven by 36% growth in equipment revenue. The customers who choose to bring their own devices don't increase equipment expense for us, so the no-device-subsidy model works for our customers and us, whether it's with Next or with Bring Your Own Device. As expected, service revenues this quarter were impacted by Mobile Share Value plans. But because we have now passed the anniversary of the introduction of these plans, we expect the year-over-year comparisons will improve in the coming quarters. 
At the end of the first quarter, more than 70% of our postpaid base is on Mobile Share plans, with more than 60% of the postpaid smartphone base on no-device-subsidy pricing. This means our first quarter Next flow share percentage has exceeded the percentage of smartphone subs on no-device-subsidy pricing. Mobile Share customers continue to buy up to larger buckets of data. About half of all accounts are on plans 10 gigabytes or larger, and about 20% are on plans of 15 GB or more. That's more than twice as many as a year ago. This helped drive a 14% increase in data billings. As expected, the strong Next take rate helped drive third -- the third consecutive quarter of sequential phone ARPU growth when you factor in Next billings. The metric gives you a more accurate idea of what an average customer pays us each month. Phone-only ARPU with Next was more than $66 in the quarter, with the average monthly Next billings about $6 and growing. That strong sequential increase comes even when you factor in the impact of our new data rollover plan, which generated about $0.25 of ARPU pressure in the quarter. As the Next base grows, so does the impact on billings. More than 30% of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next, but 65% of our sales were on Next. So our ARPU with Next is expected to continue to grow. 
Now let's move to our wireline operations on Slide 8.
Our focus on profitability and transforming to IP technologies can be seen in our wireline results. On the business side, strategic business services are now close to 1/3 of the business wireline revenues, and we continue to see strong demand for those services. Adjusted strategic business service revenues improved by more than 15% in the quarter, and when you adjust for FX, growth was more than 17%. Adjusted wireline business revenues were down 3.3%. However, about half of that decline comes from the impact of FX and our discontinued low-margin businesses, such as global hubbing.
If you consider those items, the decline would have been 1.7%. And if you look at our combined business wireline and wireless operations, revenue actually increased year-over-year. While overall wireline business operations saw pressure, it was most pronounced in wholesale, in part due to our focus on profitable sales and the continued impacts of network roaming. Enterprise revenue was down less than 1% when you adjust for Connecticut and FX.
Small business revenues were also down. However, there are some positive signs with new business starts and growing sales from our fiber build. We also took a significant step recently in our transition to software-defined networks. We introduced Network on Demand for business customers in more than 100 cities. This allows businesses to easily order and/or change network services on their own in real time.
In consumer, U-verse services now make up about 70% of consumer revenues that helped drive adjusted consumer revenue growth of more than 2%. U-verse started the year with solid subscriber gains, increasing penetration and strong revenue growth, including adding more than 400,000 IP broadband subscribers. That helped drive a net gain of almost 70,000 new subscribers to our overall broadband base. We are nearing the completion of our broadband conversion to IP. About 80% of our broadband base is now on IP. That's 90% of our IP-eligible customers. So we expect the number of migrations to ease throughout the year as well as the costs associated with those conversions. At the same time, we continue to increase broadband speeds. We expanded our 75-megabit service to nearly 90 cities, and we offer GigaPower in 10 markets, including a just-announced deployment in Chicago. We also hit a milestone with our voice-over-IP services in the quarter. We now have more than 5 million VoIP subscribers. All this helped drive an increase in adjusted U-verse consumer revenues of almost 20%. 
Now let's move to margins, starting with wireless margins on Slide 9.
Wireless service margins were essentially stable year-over-year. There was pressure from customers on no-device-subsidy pricing in advance of upgrades and from the full quarter of inclusion of Cricket operations. And our new data rollover plan also had about a 20-basis-point impact on margins. This was offset by the impact of AT&T Next and cost-saving initiatives in the quarter.
Wireline margins continue to stabilize, and operating margins were flat year-over-year. There was pressure from noncash benefit expenses and TV content costs, but this was offset by growth in consumer and strategic business service revenues and solid execution on our cost initiatives. For the quarter, our adjusted consolidated operating margin was 18.5% compared to 19.6% in the year-ago quarter and 18.9% 2 years ago. But most of the year-over-year difference is due to our strategic investments in Mexico and Cricket. Cost efficiencies continue to be a priority with us. We just took up the success of our digital-first initiative earlier. We also made headway in cutting cycle times to provision new business services. We're seeing up to a 40% reduction in cycle times on some IP products, with more than a 50% reduction in the fiber-ready buildings. Our software-defined network initiatives will help even more. 
Before we open up the call for your questions, let me do a quick recap of the quarter on Slide 10.
The first quarter was another big step in the transformation and diversification of our company. Customers are moving to Mobile Share Value plans and AT&T Next in increasing numbers. This helped drive industry-leading postpaid churn and more than 1.2 million wireless net adds. The success of the migration to IP technologies can clearly be seen in our wireline revenue numbers. IP services now make up 70% of our consumer revenues, and our migration to IP broadband is near complete.
In business -- strategic business services, which include our IP services, is close to 1/3 of the wireline business revenues. Strong demand has revenue growing at more than 15%. At the same time, the moves we are making to diversify our business through video and international operations are on track. We are confident the DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico deals will close this quarter, and we are taking steps to get all plans in place to close these transactions quickly.
Our solid balance sheet and cash flows provide the financial strength to invest and to make these transformative moves. We feel very confident with our stand-alone guidance for the year. We're on track and on plan. In fact, we're actually ahead of plan in many of the areas, including free cash flow.
That gives us even greater confidence that we can hit our growth targets for the year while also being prepared for the DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico acquisitions.
We are on the starting blocks for a very exciting year for AT&T. We have made the investments, have done the hard work necessary to position us to be a very different company, and we are ready for the opportunity ahead of us. 
With that, Tony, let's go ahead and take some questions."

Real quickly, Simon. The base of most of our savings that we previously announced was going to content contracts as we understood them to be standard in the industry, and that was the basis for a large part of our $1.6 billion original target; that, along with some of the normal synergies associated with bringing 2 public companies together. The initial ones are the opportunities we now see and going to, for example, one single truck roll to install products, so combining the installation of both our broadband capabilities and our video capabilities in the one truck roll or getting the customers on one single bill, one single customer care operation. The ability to go to our supply chain to get better pricing with regard to our equipment because, specifically, one of us was buying set-top boxes and other equipment in lower numbers than the other one was. And so when you combine those, we were confident we can get some more supply chain savings. There's also the standard cost of things like combined advertising, combined customer care, combined activities. But that's what we've built up to this $2.5 billion. They are cost savings, but we believe that they're very much real, very achievable. And we believe that they'll grow certainly in that third years when they get to the 2.5 level, but they are significant during the 2017 third-year time frame. They will build starting in '15 but build really in '16 and really move towards significant amounts in '17. With regard to our confidence in the transaction closing, it really comes down to what that -- what the transaction about. And that is bringing customers greater choice, bringing more competition to the marketplace, bringing expanded opportunities for customers to get bundled services, services that they want and, really, to improve the broadband capacity that's out there for customers through our additional investments of some of these savings. So as we continue to go through the process, we continue to feel good about where we're at, and we are optimistic and continue to believe we'll close it this quarter."

I'll leave it at that and just -- we continue to feel good about it. With regard to Mexico, the process for Nextel, first, had to go through the U.S. bankruptcy process and the opportunity for other bidders to come in. That process has all been completed. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court has approved the sale. So we're now just left with getting the regulatory authorities in Mexico, IFETEL, to approve it. We're in, as you might expect, normal contact. And that would be normal in a deal, respectful contact and working through issues with them. Our experience with them on Iusacell, our experience with them on the regulatory framework that they've set up and the economic environment they set up gives us confidence that, that deal could close shortly."

Your comment or question, Phil, with regard to, will we need to spend capital on that asset? Absolutely. We intend to get the network quality up to our standards and as quickly as prudently possible. We're working through those plans. And once we get the Nextel Mexico merger completed, we'll have all the information at our disposal to finalize those plans.

So this is going to be the starkest comparison or the most significant comparison time.

Y",575,"So John, let me try to make sure I hit all these and ask me -- challenge me -- if I skip one, let me know. First, I think we mentioned that we had about 65% take rate on Next on about a 0.2 million net adds upgrade sales. So around 4 million Next sales. You guys can do the math on an average price of the phone to get kind of the gross receivable. We mentioned that we increased our receivables, net increase in our investment, our customers by about $500 million. The offset to the rest of the purchase price was about $1.5 billion of factoring and then some collections from customers for previously sold Next phones in early '14 or even a few that we sold in '13 that are now paying us monthly fees that we are collecting and keeping at the company, that we're not subject to prior monetizations or securitizations. On the net adds, at 70%, I think the key assumption there is we've seen this 60%, 65% Next take rate before, and we've seen it again this quarter. The one thing I will tell you is that the -- to get it to 70%, we had about 5% or about 300 -- a little over 300,000 BYOD devices. Those are great net adds for us. While they don't bring any equipment revenue, they do -- they don't bring any equipment expense, and so that's a good deal for us. They often join Mobile Share Value plans, so they are sticky customers. That is the unknown. If you will, that 300,000 is a little bit below what it was running on a quarterly basis the last 3 quarters of last year, but this is typically a slower -- first quarter is typically a slower quarter. We're still encouraged by the level that -- that will be the determinant of where we come out, whether we come out in that 60% to 65% range or if we get higher than that. We'll just have to wait and see. But I do feel very good about the fact that, in total, that no-device subsidy is at 70%. And quite frankly, the overall base on Mobile Share Value for smartphones is at 62%. So we're running hotter than that. And then third, the amount of those customers that are actually paying us monthly for Next today is down in the 32% range. So I'm very optimistic that the monthly Next ARPU piece, the monthly billings piece, is going to pick up from that $6 level. EBITDA margins, we're going to continue to focus on -- for doing a wireline on a cost savings. I think you're aware that we did an early -- a voluntary early retirement program. I think our take rates were on that. We're in the 3,300 range. So we'll see some savings from that going forward. Additionally, we did see some pressure in the first quarter as we converted some of our former backhaul or interconnection in Connecticut from company-owned to leased arrangements. So they moved out of depreciation in some of those characteristics into COE, and we'll manage through that and manage the efficiencies of our operations. We'll overcome that during the year. So those are the things we're working on to improve those margins. And as I said, we're still confident with our guidance, and that the guidance included improving margins in wireline, wireless and overall."

But with that being said, we still are striving to do better each and every quarter than we did the last quarter, and we'll keep that effort up. When you think about our Mobile Share Value accounts, they're just under about $20 million of those accounts, and they average just under 3 devices per account. I think the -- we'd get you the detailed numbers, but it's probably about 19.5 million accounts, and there's about 2.9 devices per account. And yes, that really does help with churn. Additionally, our smartphone churn is lower than our total postpaid. Effectively, our feature phone churn is higher. And as we've reduced that base down to 16% now of our base and -- of our postpaid base and we're seeing flow share of only about 6%, we're optimistic that we can increase the smartphone base and that will give us another lever to really attempt to manage churn to a lower level.

So that's the encouragement. In many of those buildings, you've seen how it works. You can go into a building. It might have 20 potential customers in there, and you have to sell to the first one.

Could you kind of divide, kind of waterfall how you get there from a combination of operations and asset sales? And then rumor has it, you're running the real estate group at AT&T now. Could you kind of map out where the buckets for asset sales inside AT&T and are -- kind of scope it for us would be helpful."

One, I don't get any detailed plans about post-DTV/AT&T. I don't think it'll be prudent at this time. But what I will tell you is that over-the-top distribution of video on wireless, on broadband connections with or without linear subscription is something that I'm sure we'll see and something that we will see be a part of packages in the future. My own experience is that I see it as an add-on to a subscription package, and I think we believe that, that will be the way a lot of the opportunities will go. But we're certainly open to it, and we're going to certainly be in a position to help develop that part of the process. I won't go into the Verizon situation or any specific office on our part. With regard to deleveraging, and I will go this way, we're expecting free cash flow to exceed dividends and provide cash not only in this year but into the future to pay down debt. That's one. Two, we're expecting EBITDA to expand not only just from the acquisition of DTV but from the content savings -- or excuse me, from the cost savings that we've talked about even today. And that will expand EBITDA even more, which will, by simple math, help the metrics of net debt-to-EBITDA. Third, we'll continue to look at all aspects of our asset portfolio. As I've mentioned before, we have about a $300 billion total asset portfolio today, and we'll only get larger with DTV and Nextel Mexico. And so we will continue to look for opportunities. I would suggest to you that if you look at our record over the last 30 [ph] years, we have a pretty reliable record of generating over $15 billion worth of cash from asset monetizations, and we've done it very tax efficiently. So we've netted a significant amount of that cash to be able to use, and we'll just continue to do the same process that we've done. I don't want anyone -- I wouldn't expect anyone to think that we are complete in that process, but I'm not going to get into listing any specific items."

We'll make sure it's out there on the AT&T website. I don't have those numbers right in front of me. With regard to the wireline business and the VIP project, and specifically, I think, Mike, you're probably referring to the 57 million IP broadband locations. I'd suggest to you this, what we really need to see is the DIRECTV deals are closed. Because the transaction -- the key to being successful in that area is that customers want to bundle. And so with the closing of the transaction, we'll be able to have a bundle not only of the video services that DTV provides but of the broadband services that we can provide. As I mentioned before, about 30 million of those 57 million broadband locations, a little bit under that number, don't currently have a video product. Once we can do a real bundle with owner's economics and provide the efficiencies of one truck roll, the efficiencies of one service call, the efficiency of one troubleshooting call for the customers, one offer, one pricing structure, we believe that, that will not only be good for our company, but it will be very good for customers that they'll have a new competitive offer out in the marketplace. And so we think that the completion of our DIRECTV-AT&T merger is a key factor in that process and a key factor bringing great quality services to customers. And from our surveys and from the information I've seen, it's what customers want. So that will be the focus point. I would suggest to you that we'll probably have more to say on that and give some insights to that when we have our Investor Day, which will likely be within about a month after the closing of DTV."

And our overall interest cost has come down significantly over the last 3 years as we've refinanced debt, but it is an allocated share based on the $18 billion -- approximately $18 billion purchase price. So that is what is getting capitalized. With regard to the fixed wireless, look, Colby, I wouldn't suggest to you that anything's changed at this time. We still have the commitments out there in the DTV transaction, and we still stand ready to live up to those and to satisfy those in full. We think that's a clear benefit for the consumer and the marketplace as a part of that transaction, so we're -- but we're still confident that we can satisfy that. And we'll see how that comes out. That's probably the -- the finalization of the DTV deal is probably going to have to come before. We're going to through and be ready to discuss any modifications, if any, to the fixed wireless local loop plans. 
With that, I want to thank all of you for being on the call today. Our work the last few years sets us up for a transformative 2015. We are ready to move quickly once the DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico deals close. Our networks are in place. Our customer transformation is on track, and we are seeing tangible results in our digital first and software-defined network initiatives. Our performance in the first quarter add to that confidence. Wireless turned in another solid performance in a competitive environment. Wireline's focus on profitability and strong demand for IP services brought margin stability and growing IP revenues. We are ready for our next transformative steps, and we are excited about the opportunity we have before us.

We've set some ambitious goals to transform our business, ever",3299,"Thanks, Mike, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in AT&T.
We are very excited about the progress we've seen in our business the last 3 years. We've set some ambitious goals to transform our business, every part of our business, to lay a new foundation for the future and for growth. The first quarter was another significant step in that transformation. To put it simply, we are executing very well. We have completed or are near completion with all of our Project VIP network initiatives. We are also ahead of plans with many of the transformational customer and operational initiatives that we now have under way. The results are impressive. You know the story.
Our 4G LTE network now covers 308 million people with ultrafast speeds. We also deployed new spectrum, densified the network and added DAS and WiFi capabilities to improve the quality and reach of our best-in-class network.
Our expanded wireline IP broadband footprint reaches 57 million customer locations, and we now are offering 75 megabit speeds in 90 cities. We've also deployed fiber to nearly 800,000 additional business locations with our 1 million goal in sight, enabling strategic services growth and Network on Demand possibilities. While transforming these networks, we've also invested heavily to transition our customer base. Many of those transitions are nearing completion as well. 
Several years ago, we started to move our postpaid base to smartphones and usage-based pricing. Today, 84% of our postpaid phone base use smartphones, and almost 90% are on usage-based plans. And just one year ago, we accelerated the shift to the no-device-subsidy model for smartphones when we launched Mobile Share Value plans. Customer response to these plans has been tremendous. About 60% of our postpaid smartphone subscribers already are on no-device-subsidy plans. The surge of customers coming to value plans provides for some expected tough comparisons when looking at year-over-year financial results, but our record-breaking churn demonstrates that we made the right move in introducing these plans.
We also moved to strengthen our position in new growth areas. In prepaid, we acquired Cricket and paired it with our LTE network to provide a premium prepaid experience. We also saw the future of the Internet of Things and developed platforms, such as the connected car and home automation. We now have more than 20 million connected devices on our network, and the future is very bright for additional growth.
In wireline, the transformation IP broadband is nearing completion. That means most of the cost associated with this transformation are also behind us. Today, nearly 80% of our broadband base is on IP, and about 90% of the customers with access to IP broadband already have it. And more than 30% of our business wireline revenues come from our strategic IP services.
And finally, we've been laser-focused on improving our operations, driving efficiencies across the board. We're seeing good traction with several Project Agile cost-savings initiatives, including digital first, which is our company-wide effort to make it easy for customers to do business online. The number of digital transactions with our customers has increased by the tens of millions the last 2 years, and we expect to see that increase by millions more in this coming year.
We also been reducing cycle times in provisioning new services. This improves our competitiveness, our revenue opportunities and the customer experience while reducing expenses as well, and we took a giant step with our leading software-defined network initiative when we launched Network on Demand capabilities for business customers in 100 cities. 
We continue to take steps to make our capital structure more efficient, including monetization of assets, reducing borrowing costs and implementing working capital improvements. This has contributed to our strong balance sheet and given us the financial strength we need to continue to invest and diversify our business. The moves to diversify our business also continue on track in the first quarter. Those details are on Slide 4.
We've executed Project VIP and our transformation well, doing the hard work necessary to enable the company to move forward. This puts us in a great position to achieve the vision we laid out for you last quarter, vision of a new AT&T, a diversified integrated wireless and wireline company for both business and consumers, uniquely positioned in a world of high-speed mobile connectivity and video. We expect the DIRECTV transaction will close this quarter. We have done a lot of work, identifying opportunities for additional cost synergies between these 2 great companies. This includes savings from supply chain, installation, customer care and even sending just one bill. This has increased our confidence that we can significantly exceed the original $1.6 billion expected in cost synergies. In fact, we now believe cost synergies alone will exceed a $2.5 billion run rate by year 3.
In wireless, we closed on Iusacell, the first of our Mexico wireless acquisitions, and we expect to close the Nextel Mexico deal shortly. Together, these properties will give us a leading spectrum position in a dynamic wireless market that is just beginning its transformation to the mobile Internet. We plan to deploy near-nationwide 4G LTE network, something we know how to do very well. It'll be covering up about 100 million people in a country that borders the United States. The cross-border opportunities that this opens up are exciting from both a consumer and a business standpoint.
We have also significantly improved our spectrum position here in the United States. Our Leap acquisition brought with it an average of 10 megahertz of spectrum in the top 100 markets, covering 137 million people. Some of it was unused spectrum. We've already put much of that unused spectrum to work in more than 200 markets, and we've begun shutting down the legacy CDMA networks. We expect that process to be complete by the end of the year, and we will quickly redeploy that spectrum as well.
We also made a major investment earlier this year when we acquired licenses for near-nationwide contiguous 2x10 megahertz block of high-quality AWS-3 spectrum. Needless to say, we feel good about our spectrum position. This takes a lot of uncertainty out of the process with our ability to add capacity and maintain quality in a cost-efficient manner. We know what we have, and we know what we need to do, and we have a clear path to delivering a network that customers want, that customers expect and that customers will use.
With that as background, let's take a look at our consolidated financial summary on Slide 5. Adjusted consolidated revenues grew to more than $32.6 billion, and that's up about $375 million when you adjust for the sale of our Connecticut wireline properties. This growth was driven by continued success in wireless, as we reposition our business model, strong demand for strategic business services and adjusted wireline consumer revenue growth. 
Adjusted wireline revenues were down about 1%, but revenues were essentially flat year-over-year if you adjust for the impact of foreign exchange and discontinued businesses. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.63. That includes adjustments for Leap integration expenses, as well as costs associated with the voluntary employee retirement plan. It also excludes a onetime $0.05 benefit from a tax-planning-related matter. And while we don't show this on an adjusted basis, first quarter 2014 earnings also include the income we received from our previous equity ownership at América Móvil as well as net income from our divested Connecticut wireline operations. Those 2 provided about $0.03 of EPS in the first quarter of last year that we don't have this year.
Our business also continues to generate solid cash flows with free cash flow of $2.8 billion. Cash from operations totaled $6.7 billion, and that includes an additional $500 million investment in our Next customer base. And capital expenditures were $4 billion. At the end of the quarter, our cash balance was $4.4 billion. And in terms of uses of cash, dividend payouts totaled $2.4 billion. At the same time, we maintained a solid balance sheet while continuing to invest in the business. During the quarter, we funded investments in AWS spectrum and Iusacell, and we're also well positioned for our planned investments in DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico.
Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA at the end of the quarter was 2.19. And as we said before, with our transformational investments in DIRECTV, Mexico and spectrum, we will go above our normal net debt-to-EBITDA target. But after we close the DIRECTV transaction, our focus with free cash flow after dividends will be on paying down debt and getting back to our target range.
Now let's turn to our operational highlights, starting with wireless on Slide 6. Our wireless results this quarter only include our domestic operations. Information on our Iusacell operations is included under the international segment in our financial statements, and it's separately broken out. 
The repositioning of our smartphone base by giving customers the choice of lower-priced service with no-device-subsidy plans continues to show positive results. Postpaid churn was 1.02%, the best first quarter that we have ever had and the best in the industry this quarter. This continues the positive trend we saw last year and comes in a very noisy and competitive marketplace. And prepaid churn also showed strong, continued signs of improvement, thanks to the strength of our Cricket operations.
Total net adds came in strong at 1.2 million and was led by gains in postpaid and connected devices. We added more than 440,000 postpaid subscribers in what is traditionally a slow net add quarter, thanks to strength in tablets. These tablet gains more than offset the decline of feature phones subscribers. We also grew our high-quality postpaid smartphone base by another 500,000 in the quarter. This includes postpaid upgrades and migrations, which we don't include in our net add number. And when you look at total branded smartphones, which includes both postpaid and prepaid, we added about 1.2 million smartphones to our base during the quarter. We also added about 1 million connected devices, thanks to a continued strong showing by connected cars. Connected device net adds were impacted by a change in how we report our session-based tablets. Previously, we included them as part of our prepaid base. Now they're reported as connected device subscribers. This gives us and you a better view of phone growth in prepaid, which has now essentially includes only phone activity.
You see that this quarter. Thanks to strong results from our Cricket offering, we had positive growth in prepaid. Cricket is just the latest example of our ability to integrate new businesses. The team has done a very good job of transforming this business. 
Retention is ahead of schedule. Churn is less than expected and, certainly, much less than historical levels prior to our ownership. And we're doing a great job of moving customers off the legacy CDMA network. More than 90% of Cricket customers already are on the GSM platform. However, we do expect to see some pressure over the next quarters, as we complete the transition to GSM and shut down the legacy CDMA networks.
Overall, postpaid gross adds and upgrades continue at a solid pace. We had about 6.2 million smartphone sales in the quarter, slightly higher than last year's total. Our postpaid upgrade rate was 6.6%. Smartphones were 94% of all phone sales and now make up about 84% of our postpaid phone base. We still have about 16% of our phone base to transition to smartphones, but the bulk of the smartphone transformation has been completed. Transforming our phone base to LTE smartphones and moving those customers to no-subsidy and usage-based pricing has been a big investment for us. But once again, we made these investments, executed our plan and are now in a strong position to move forward.
Now let's look at the progress we're making with shifting our customers to AT&T Next and Mobile Share. That information and revenue were on Slide 7.
AT&T Next sales reached record levels, nearly 2/3 of smartphone sales. Another 5% brought their own devices to our network. That means 70% of phone sales in the quarter didn't carry a subsidy. Total wireless revenue was up about 2%, driven by 36% growth in equipment revenue. The customers who choose to bring their own devices don't increase equipment expense for us, so the no-device-subsidy model works for our customers and us, whether it's with Next or with Bring Your Own Device. As expected, service revenues this quarter were impacted by Mobile Share Value plans. But because we have now passed the anniversary of the introduction of these plans, we expect the year-over-year comparisons will improve in the coming quarters. 
At the end of the first quarter, more than 70% of our postpaid base is on Mobile Share plans, with more than 60% of the postpaid smartphone base on no-device-subsidy pricing. This means our first quarter Next flow share percentage has exceeded the percentage of smartphone subs on no-device-subsidy pricing. Mobile Share customers continue to buy up to larger buckets of data. About half of all accounts are on plans 10 gigabytes or larger, and about 20% are on plans of 15 GB or more. That's more than twice as many as a year ago. This helped drive a 14% increase in data billings. As expected, the strong Next take rate helped drive third -- the third consecutive quarter of sequential phone ARPU growth when you factor in Next billings. The metric gives you a more accurate idea of what an average customer pays us each month. Phone-only ARPU with Next was more than $66 in the quarter, with the average monthly Next billings about $60 and growing. That strong sequential increase comes even when you factor in the impact of our new data rollover plan, which generated about $0.25 of ARPU pressure in the quarter. As the Next base grows, so does the impact on billings. More than 30% of our smartphone base is now on AT&T Next, but 65% of our sales were on Next. So our ARPU with Next is expected to continue to grow. 
Now let's move to our wireline operations on Slide 8.
Our focus on profitability and transforming to IP technologies can be seen in our wireline results. On the business side, strategic business services are now close to 1/3 of the business wireline revenues, and we continue to see strong demand for those services. Adjusted strategic business service revenues improved by more than 15% in the quarter, and when you adjust for FX, growth was more than 17%. Adjusted wireline business revenues were down 3.3%. However, about half of that decline comes from the impact of FX and our discontinued low-margin businesses, such as global hubbing.
If you consider those items, the decline would have been 1.7%. And if you look at our combined business wireline and wireless operations, revenue actually increased year-over-year. While overall wireline business operations saw pressure, it was most pronounced in wholesale, in part due to our focus on profitable sales and the continued impacts of network roaming. Enterprise revenue was down less than 1% when you adjust for Connecticut and FX.
Small business revenues were also down. However, there are some positive signs with new business starts and growing sales from our fiber build. We also took a significant step recently in our transition to software-defined networks. We introduced Network on Demand for business customers in more than 100 cities. This allows businesses to easily order,add or change network services on their own in real time.
In consumer, U-verse services now make up about 70% of consumer revenues that helped drive adjusted consumer revenue growth of more than 2%. U-verse started the year with solid subscriber gains, increasing penetration and strong revenue growth, including adding more than 400,000 IP broadband subscribers. That helped drive a net gain of almost 70,000 new subscribers to our overall broadband base. We are nearing the completion of our broadband conversion to IP. About 80% of our broadband base is now on IP. That's 90% of our IP-eligible customers. So we expect the number of migrations to ease throughout the year as well as the costs associated with those conversions. At the same time, we continue to increase broadband speeds. We expanded our 75-megabit service to nearly 90 cities, and we offer GigaPower in 10 markets, including a just-announced deployment in Chicago. We also hit a milestone with our voice-over-IP services in the quarter. We now have more than 5 million VoIP subscribers. All this helped drive an increase in adjusted U-verse consumer revenues of almost 20%. 
Now let's move to margins, starting with wireless margins on Slide 9.
Wireless service margins were essentially stable year-over-year. There was pressure from customers on no-device-subsidy pricing in advance of upgrades and from the full quarter of inclusion of Cricket operations. And our new data rollover plan also had about a 20-basis-point impact on margins. This was offset by the impact of AT&T Next and cost-saving initiatives in the quarter.
Wireline margins continue to stabilize, and operating margins were flat year-over-year. There was pressure from noncash benefit expenses and TV content costs, but this was offset by growth in consumer and strategic business service revenues and solid execution on our cost initiatives. For the quarter, our adjusted consolidated operating margin was 18.5% compared to 19.6% in the year-ago quarter and 18.9% 2 years ago. But most of the year-over-year difference is due to our strategic investments in Mexico and Cricket. Cost efficiencies continue to be a priority with us. We just discussed the success of our digital-first initiative earlier. We also made headway in cutting cycle times to provision new business services. We're seeing up to a 40% reduction in cycle times on some IP products, with more than a 50% reduction in the fiber-ready buildings. Our software-defined network initiatives will help even more. 
Before we open up the call for your questions, let me do a quick recap of the quarter on Slide 10.
The first quarter was another big step in the transformation and diversification of our company. Customers are moving to Mobile Share Value plans and AT&T Next in increasing numbers. This helped drive industry-leading postpaid churn and more than 1.2 million wireless net adds. The success of the migration to IP technologies can clearly be seen in our wireline revenue numbers. IP services now make up 70% of our consumer revenues, and our migration to IP broadband is near complete.
In business -- strategic business services, which include our IP services, is close to 1/3 of the wireline business revenues. Strong demand has revenue growing at more than 15%. At the same time, the moves we are making to diversify our business through video and international operations are on track. We are confident the DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico deals will close this quarter, and we are taking steps to get all plans in place to close these transactions quickly.
Our solid balance sheet and cash flows provide the financial strength to invest and to make these transformative moves. We feel very confident with our stand-alone guidance for the year. We're on track and on plan. In fact, we're actually ahead of plan in many of the areas, including free cash flow.
That gives us even greater confidence that we can hit our growth targets for the year while also being prepared for the DIRECTV and Nextel Mexico acquisitions.
We are on the starting blocks for a very exciting year for AT&T. We have made the investments, have done the hard work necessary to position us to be a very different company, and we are ready for the opportunity ahead of us.

Real quickly, Simon. The base of most of our savings that we previously announced was going to content contracts as we understood them to be standard in the industry, and that was the basis for a large part of our $1.6 billion original target; that, along with some of the normal synergies associated with bringing 2 public companies together. The initial ones are the opportunities we now see and going to, for example, one single truck roll to install products, so combining the installation of both our broadband capabilities and our video capabilities in the one truck roll or getting the customers on one single bill, one single customer care operation. The ability to go to our supply chain to get better pricing with regard to our equipment because, specifically, one of us was buying set-top boxes and other equipment in lower numbers than the other one was. And so when you combine those, we were confident we can get some more supply chain savings. There's also the standard cost of things like combined advertising, combined customer care, combined activities. But that's what we've built up to this $2.5 billion. They aren't cost savings, but we believe that they're very much real, very achievable. And we believe that they'll grow certainly in that third years when they get to the 2.5 level, but they are significant during the 2017 third-year time frame. They will build starting in '15 but build really in '16 and really move towards significant amounts in '17. With regard to our confidence in the transaction closing, it really comes down to what that -- what the transaction about. And that is bringing customers greater choice, bringing more competition to the marketplace, bringing expanded opportunities for customers to get bundled services, services that they want and, really, to improve the broadband capacity that's out there for customers through our additional investments of some of these savings. So as we continue to go through the process, we continue to feel good about where we're at, and we are optimistic and continue to believe we'll close it this quarter."

With your comments with regard to service revenues, when you look at our service revenues this quarter, clearly, what has impacted by, so to speak, a full year of opportunity for customers to transition to Mobile Share and really not -- only about a month and no time prior to the first quarter of '14 and only about a month of 2014 first quarter for customers to transition. So this is going to be the starkest comparison or the most significant comparison time. We expect that those comparisons to get easier or to be less challenging as we go through the year because we've established much more of a stable Mobile Share Value base as of the end of the first quarter compared to where we were at the end of the first quarter last year."

Y",574,"So John, let me try to make sure I hit all these and ask me -- challenge me -- if I skip one, let me know. First, I think we mentioned that we had about 65% take rate on Next on about a 0.2 million net adds upgrade sales. So around 4 million Next sales. You guys can do the math on an average price of the phone to get kind of the gross receivable. We mentioned that we increased our receivables, net increase in our investment, our customers by about $500 million. The offset to the rest of the purchase price was about $1.5 billion of factoring and then some collections from customers for previously sold Next phones in early '14 or even a few that we sold in '13 that are now paying us monthly fees that we are collecting and keeping at the company, that we're not subject to prior monetizations or securitizations. On the net adds, at 70%, I think the key assumption there is we've seen this 60%, 65% Next take rate before, and we've seen it again this quarter. The one thing I will tell you is that the -- to get it to 70%, we had about 5% or about 300 -- a little over 300,000 BYOD devices. Those are great net adds for us. While they don't bring any equipment revenue, they do -- they don't bring any equipment expense, and so that's a good deal for us. They often join Mobile Share Value plans, so they are sticky customers. That is the unknown. If you will, that 300,000 is a little bit below what it was running on a quarterly basis the last 3 quarters of last year, but this is typically a slower -- first quarter is typically a slower quarter. We're still encouraged by the level that -- that will be the determinant of where we come out, whether we come out in that 60% to 65% range or if we get higher than that. We'll just have to wait and see. But I do feel very good about the fact that, in total, that no-device subsidy is at 70%. And quite frankly, the overall base on Mobile Share Value for smartphones is at 62%. So we're running hotter than that. And then third, the amount of those customers that are actually paying us monthly for Next today is down in the 32% range. So I'm very optimistic that the monthly Next ARPU piece, the monthly billings piece, is going to pick up from that $6 level. EBITDA margins, we're going to continue to focus on -- particularly on wireline on a cost savings. I think you're aware that we did an early -- a voluntary early retirement program. I think our take rates were on that. We're in the 3,300 range. So we'll see some savings from that going forward. Additionally, we did see some pressure in the first quarter as we converted some of our former backhaul or interconnection in Connecticut from company-owned to leased arrangements. So they moved out of depreciation and some of those characteristics into COE, and we'll manage through that and manage the efficiencies of our operations. We'll overcome that during the year. So those are the things we're working on to improve those margins. And as I said, we're still confident with our guidance, and that the guidance included improving margins in wireline, wireless and overall."

I think the -- we'd get you the detailed numbers, but it's probably about 19.5 million accounts, and there's about 2.9 devices per account. And yes, that really does help with churn. Additionally, our smartphone churn is lower than our total postpaid. Effectively, our feature phone churn is higher. And as we've reduced that base down to 16% now of our base and -- of our postpaid base and we're seeing flow share of only about 6%, we're optimistic that we can increase the smartphone base and that will give us another lever to really attempt to manage churn to a lower level.

I think with your first question, Amir, I think you'll continue to see us taking actions on the strategy that we have laid out already, that we are going to continue to focus on profitable customers and providing smartphone growth, Mobile Share Value, getting customers on Next or BYOD and continuing to migrate. Now we've got 90% migrated to usage-based plans and use the LTE deployment of phones in the, so to speak, year-over-year growth that we -- data growth we've seen on those phones of about 50% to then drive data growth and then drive higher buckets. So that's the strategy. They're sure -- I'm certain we'll have some promotional activity as we always do, but I wouldn't suggest to you that it would be out of the ordinary, out of the normal process. I will also suggest to you that we are just in the beginning phases of the connected car, of the Internet of Things and of the opportunities that, that's going to provide us. This really deep high-quality 308 million people covered with LTE or have LTE available to them is really a great thing for all the Internet of Thing products and services, whether they be the connected cars or the other platforms we have out there. And we believe that over terms, that we'll see really great growth there. I think we added close to 700,000 connected cars in the quarter. So it still has a long way to go, but it's growing very quickly. And remember, what we're seeing today is really just mostly the wholesale arrangement and here is -- we mature through this process. We'll get that opportunity to get the retail arrangement. With regard to Google, I would suggest to you I'm not an expert on the matter. So I don't mean to be, but I understand your commentary about it's very limited. So I understand it's limited. It's got a very limited number of devices. It's not generally the way we like to present options to customers. We like to provide a lot. I understand it's limited in this case. My understanding also is, is there going to be very limited distribution and customer care. And those things are items that we found our customers value. So we'll just have to wait and see, but it's just another one of the plays in the environment that's out there."

One, I won't give any detailed plans about post-DTV/AT&T. I don't think it'll be prudent at this time. But what I will tell you is that over-the-top distribution of video on wireless, on broadband connections with or without linear subscription is something that I'm sure we'll see and something that we will see be a part of packages in the future. My own experience is that I see it as an add-on to a subscription package, and I think we believe that, that will be the way a lot of the opportunities will go. But we're certainly open to it, and we're going to certainly be in a position to help develop that part of the process. I won't go into the Verizon situation or any specific office on our part. With regard to deleveraging, and I will go this way, we're expecting free cash flow to exceed dividends and provide cash not only in this year but into the future to pay down debt. That's one. Two, we're expecting EBITDA to expand not only just from the acquisition of DTV but from the content savings -- or excuse me, from the cost savings that we've talked about even today. And that will expand EBITDA even more, which will, by simple math, help the metrics of net debt-to-EBITDA. Third, we'll continue to look at all aspects of our asset portfolio. As I've mentioned before, we have about a $300 billion total asset portfolio today, and we'll only get larger with DTV and Nextel Mexico. And so we will continue to look for opportunities. I would suggest to you that if you look at our record over the last 30 [ph] years, we have a pretty reliable record of generating over $15 billion worth of cash from asset monetizations, and we've done it very tax efficiently. So we've netted a significant amount of that cash to be able to use, and we'll just continue to do the same process that we've done. I don't want anyone -- I wouldn't expect anyone to think that we are complete in that process, but I'm not going to get into listing any specific items."

We'll make sure it's out there on the AT&T website. I don't have those numbers right in front of me. With regard to the wireline business and the VIP project, and specifically, I think, Mike, you're probably referring to the 57 million IP broadband locations. I'd suggest to you this, what we really need to see is the DIRECTV deals are closed. Because the transaction -- the key to being successful in that area is that customers want to bundle. And so with the closing of the transaction, we'll be able to have a bundle not only of the video services that DTV provides but of the broadband services that we can provide. As I mentioned before, about 30 million of those 57 million broadband locations, a little bit under that number, don't currently have a video product. Once we can do a real bundle with owner's economics and provide the efficiencies of one truck roll, the efficiencies of one service call, the efficiency of one troubleshooting call for the customers, one offer, one pricing structure, we believe that, that will not only be good for our company, but it will be very good for customers that they'll have a new competitive offer out in the marketplace. And so we think that the completion of our DIRECTV-AT&T merger is a key factor in that process and a key factor bringing great quality services to customers. And from our surveys and from the information I've seen, it's what customers want. So that will be the focus point. I would suggest to you that we'll probably have more to say on that and give some insights to that when we have our Investor Day, which will likely be within about a month after the closing of DTV."

So that is what is getting capitalized. With regard to the fixed wireless local loop, Colby, I wouldn't suggest to you that anything's changed at this time. We still have the commitments out there in the DTV transaction, and we still stand ready to live up to those and to satisfy those in full. We think that's a clear benefit for the consumer and the marketplace as a part of that transaction, so we're -- but we're still confident that we can satisfy that. And we'll see how that comes out. That's probably the -- the finalization of the DTV deal is probably going to have to come before.

Our customer transformation is on track, and we are seeing tangible results in our digital first and software-defined network initiatives. Our performance in the first quarter adds to that confidence. Wireless turned in another solid performance in a competitive environment. Wireline's focus on profitability and strong demand for IP services brought margin stability and growing IP revenues. We are ready for our next transformative steps, and we are excited about the opportunity we have before us.

John will provide an update with perspective on the quarter and then we'll follow that with a Q&A session.
Let me remind you that our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website, and att.com/investor.relations.
I need to call your attention on Page 2 to our safe harbor statement. Before we begin, the safe harbor statement says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. And as such, they are subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially and additional information is available on the Investor Relations page of AT&T's website.
Before I turn it over to John, let me cover Slide 3, cover our consolidated financial summary. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.69. That's up more than 11% over last year's second quarter. This includes adjustments for a noncash charge related to Leap's Network decommissioning and other merger-related costs, which include DIRECTV in Mexico. This strong year-over-year growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexican wireless operations, as well as the impact from our divested Connecticut wireline business and our equity investment in América Móvil.
Consolidated revenues grew to $33 billion. It's up more than 2% when you adjust for the sale of our Connecticut wireline property. This growth was driven by continued solid performance in wireless as we reposition our smartphone base. We had impressive gains in strategic business services and strong wireline consumer revenue growth.
Cash flows also grew significantly in the quarter. Cash from ops for the quarter totaled more than $9 billion, up more than 13% over last year's second quarter. And free cash flow was $4.5 billion and more than $7 billion on a year-to-date basis. And that brought our free cash flow dividend payout to 67% on a year-to-date basis.
And so with that overview, I'll now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens, and he'll discuss our operational highlights. John?"

As you can see in our second quarter results, our moves to transform the company are working and working well. We grew revenues, expand the margins and achieved double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Cash flows were strong, allowing us to invest in our business, return substantial value to shareholders and strengthen our cash position.
Our moves to reposition our smartphone customer base are working, achieving the expected results. Almost 80% of the smartphone base is already on Mobile Share Value plans, and 68% of our smartphone sales and upgrades were on AT&T Next. When you're adding the customers who brought their own device, nearly 3/4 of smartphone sales were without subsidies. This helped drive strong postpaid phone-only with Next ARPU growth and best ever service margins.
In Wireline, our transition to IT services continues at a strong cliff. U-verse services are more than 70% of consumer revenues and helped drive near 4% adjusted revenue growth. Strategic services are now 1/3 of our Wireline business revenues and continue to grow at a very strong pace.
So all in all, a very strong quarter as we begin the diversification of our company. Our growth and cost initiatives, such as Project VIP and Project Agile, are working. We're executing at a high level, and we have a solid foundation for growth as we move forward.
Now let's take a closer look at our operational highlights, starting with wireless on Slide 5. Our wireless strategy is working. Our efforts to reposition of the smartphone base to the no subsidy model have taken hold. We continue to see solid evidence that our efforts are paying off.
First, the most significant shift of our smartphone customers to Mobile Share Value plans is behind us. This has helped stabilize service revenues, which were essentially flat for the quarter. There was heavy promotional activity on last year's second quarter, which pressured service revenues. So our disciplined sales approach this year helped in our year-over-year comparison.
Second, as service revenues stabilize and the number of customers using AT&T Next increases, we have seen our postpaid phone ARPU with Next increase steadily. It was up more than 6% year-over-year. And our postpaid phone-only revenues increased sequentially, reaching its highest level in 3 quarters. We are about halfway through the expected Next sales cycle as customers upgrade their smartphones. As they do, we expect continued ARPU with Next growth as more customers upgrade.
Our focus on costs, Cricket's operational efficiencies and other cost savings programs, such as Project Agile, help drive strong margin expansion in the quarter. Our adjusted wireless EBITDA service margin was 48.5%, our best performance ever, and an almost 600 basis point improvement over last year's second quarter.
The story of the last 6 quarters has been repositioning our smartphone base. This has moved subscribers away from the heavy handset subsidies in exchange for lower monthly pricing. For last several quarters, customers on pre-Next pricing have been added of us, but we are starting to see the benefits of the strategy. Let's talk more about that on Slide 6. 
We've made remarkable progress in transitioning our customers to Mobile Share Value plans. In a little more than 1 year, nearly 2/3 of our smartphone base has moved to the no subsidy discount pricing of Mobile Share Value. Our customers continue to choose these plans, the growth rate is slowing as the penetration has been achieved. 
On the other hand, the revenue growth opportunity with AT&T Next has much farther to go. About 68% of our smartphone sales in the quarter were on AT&T Next, but our Next customer base is only about 37%. That gives us substantial opportunity to grow revenues as these customers upgrade their smartphones.
We expect penetration rates for both Mobile Share Value and AT&T Next to continue to grow. AT&T Next and Bring Your Own Device are about 90% of postpaid smartphone sales are company-owned stores and have programs -- and we have programs in place to generate similar or better rates in our other channels.
In the Value Mobile Share Value plans continues to draw new customers. Only about 12% of our smartphone base is still on unlimited data plans, and that has been steadily dropping as customers choose to move to our new Mobile Share Value plans.
We also continue to see growth in the percentage of our postpaid base on Mobile Share value family plans or business plans. That total has reached 96% this past quarter. These plans tend to be more sticky with lower churn. We also turned in another strong net add quarter as postpaid, prepaid and connected devices drove our highest net adds in more than 3 years. Those details are on Slide 7.
Total net adds came in at 2.1 million subscribers, including 410,000 postpaid subscribers and 1.4 million connected devices. Cricket is really kicking in the gear. Prepaid voice had a strong turnaround year from 1 year ago. We gained more than 330,000 prepaid voice customers after losing about that many in the year ago quarter.
Our process has been benefited by our ability to transition the Cricket customers to our new high-quality 4G LTE network. Our strong sales efforts and the near completion of the Cricket integration helped drive that turnaround.
97% of Cricket customers are now on our GSM platform as we continue the integration and as we shut down the CDMA networks. These are premium prepaid customers. Almost all are choosing smartphones when they go onto our GSM platform, and about 2/3 of the gross adds are choosing our highest value plans. Those are plans that have higher ARPU.
In fact, those ARPU levels are similar and sometimes better than other carrier's postpaid ARPU. And we're doing this integration faster and with less churn than we originally anticipated even with our network conversion. We had our lowest ever prepaid churn, thanks to continued progress with Cricket even as we decommission the networks.
We also had our second largest connected device net add quarter ever. Our leadership in Connected Cars drove that growth. Our relationship with 8 car manufacturers producing more than half of the new Connected Cars in the United States is driving this as more and more manufacturers make connectivity a key part of their new car strategies.
The company had 7.2 million branded smartphone gross adds and upgrades in the second quarter. We increased our high-quality branded smartphone base by about 1.2 million in the quarter. This includes branded upgrades and migrations, which we don't include in our net add number.
This smartphone momentum, plus strength in prepaid, led to a positive branded voice net adds in the quarter. Churn continues to be solid. Postpaid churn was down slightly from the first quarter of this year. And for the year, we are still running below last year's best ever annual postpaid churn record of 1.04%. 
Total churn was also impressive. It dropped 16 basis points to 1.31% from 1.47% in the year ago quarter, driven in large part by the significant improvements in prepaid. And branded churn was also down year-over-year as we added more than 740,000 branded devices. Now let's look at our wireline operation.
That information is on Slide 8. The repositioning of our wireline base also is working. The challenge here is to maintain margins while transitioning customers to IP services from higher-margin legacy services. And that's not a simple task. But the team's extraordinary efforts to control costs and focus on profitability has helped stabilize or even expand margins as we made this transition. That was true this quarter, even with about $40 million or 30 basis points of additional pressure from spring storms that hit our network and our footprint.
We have taken several measures to make this possible. You know of our efforts a low-margin Wholesale businesses causes revenue pressure, but it does improve the future of our business. Our customer service focus has helped reduce cycle times in provisioning services for customers and added network on demand capabilities with our next generation network investments.
These efforts were recently recognized by IDC, which named AT&T a leader in seeking new innovations to improve customer service. Our Project Agile is more of a mindset than just a cost efficiency program. We're not only finding ways to take cost out of our business, but also working to make things simpler to start with for both our customers and us. 
Our transformation IP technologies continue to drive strong performance in both strategic business services and wireline consumer in the quarter. Adjusted strategic service revenues grew by nearly 14%. And when you adjust for the foreign exchange pressure, growth was even stronger, coming in at more than 16%.
At the same time, we see the impact of IP with our data revenues. Total data revenues are nearly 60% of wireline business revenues and more than half of those revenues are from strategic services as we transition customers from legacy data services. This has helped drive total data year-over-year revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter.
Adjusted wireline business revenues were down 3.9%. However, if you adjust for the impact of our discontinued wholesale businesses and FX, the decline would've been 1.7%. There was revenue pressure across our wireline business operation, but was most pronounced in wholesale, where we have been focusing on profitable sales even if it meant a reduction in revenue.
Small business revenue was down slightly over the first quarter of the year, but we continue to see fiber sales accelerate. And we are very excited to hear that AT&T has been named the highest ranked brand in overall business wireline customer satisfaction performance in the J.D. Power small-to-medium business segment for 2015. That's quite a tribute to the business team's efforts in this space.
On the consumer side, U-verse services more than 70% of consumer revenues and adjusted revenues grew about 19% year-over-year. That helped drive our strongest consumer revenue growth in 5 quarters, growing by 3.7% when adjusting for the sale of Connecticut operations. You also see our focus on profitability and repositioning our customer base with U-verse. Video net adds dropped with the fewer promotions and are targeting of high-value subscribers.
We did add about 240,000 IP broadband customers in the quarter as we continue to reposition our DSL base to IP. The work is nearing completion with less than 1 million eligible DSL subscribers left to transition.
Now let's look at consolidated margins, which are on Slide 9. The strength in wireless and stable wireline margins had a positive impact on consolidated margins. In the second quarter, our adjusted EBITDA grew to $11.1 billion and the adjusted consolidated margin was 33.6% compared to 31.5% last year. That's a more than 200 basis point improvement. Adjusted operating margin also is showing continued improvement. It was $6.5 billion, up 12.4% year-over-year.
And adjusted operating income margin grew to 19.6%, up more than 190 basis points from the year earlier second quarter. This was largely due to cost focus initiatives, which included Project Agile, our strength in wireless, growth in consumer revenues and gains in strategic business services. 
The company also benefited from lower trailing expenses from capital spending as Project VIP was completed. And our move to next generation networks is starting to make a real difference as well.
Now let's move to cash flow, where it had an outstanding quarter. The summary is on Slide 10. Our ability to generate cash continues to be strong.
Cash from operations totaled $9.2 billion, that's nearly 4x our dividend commitment and our best cash generation in 7 quarters. And we generated $15.9 billion in cash year-to-date. Capital expenditures totaled $4.7 billion and $8.7 billion year-to-date. We still expect standalone capital spending in the $18 billion range this year, but we are now including our expansion efforts in Mexico in that amount.
Free cash flow was $4.5 billion and $7.2 billion year-to-date. We are well on our way to hitting our standalone free cash flow guidance we gave you earlier this year. We now expect standalone free cash flow, excluding any impact from DIRECTV, in the $12 billion range or better, and this includes the operational and capital impacts from our Mexican acquisitions.
In terms of uses of cash. Dividends totaled $2.4 billion, which gives us a free cash flow to dividend payout ratio of 55% for the quarter and about 67% year-to-date.
Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.15, similar to the first quarter. We did issue debt in the second quarter to help finance our acquisition activities. Our long-range goal is to get these levels back to the 1.8 range and expect our cash focus to be on paying down debt in the near term.
The strong financial performance in the first half of the year sets us up well for the transformation and diversification of our business. Now let me close with a quick summary in the quarter on Slide 11 before we get to your questions.
Our transformation plan is working. When you build a great network, develop next generation products and focus on the customer, good things happen. This focus drove strong results in the quarter that's all growing revenues, expanding margins and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. But just as important was our ability to generate cash from our business, which we did. All this is in line or better than guidance that we gave you earlier this year. These results add to our confidence that we're on track to our stand-alone guidance metrics. 
Wireless financials were solid as we near completion of our shift to Mobile Share Value plans. Next take rates continues to increase, helping drive increasing postpaid phone with Next ARPU. Our prepaid brands are doing great and our expense management helped drive our best ever service margins.
Our move into Mexico positions us as the only company who owns and operates a North American mobile service area that will serve more than 400 million people with 4G LTE service. And we expect to reach 350 million people by year-end. Owning these network assets not only provide a high level of service quality for our customers, but also gives us owner's economics advantages.
We're also very pleased that in order to approve our DIRECTV transaction with certain conditions, it's circulating at the SEC. We expect final approval at any time. We won't be able to address any of your questions about the deal today during this call, but I can tell you this. 
First, as far as any conditions that Chairman Wheeler alluded to earlier this week, we feel very confident that we can make an adequate return on any investment we make as part of this deal. Our threshold for investment in determining what's best for our shareholders has not changed.
Second, we still fully expect to achieve $2.5 billion worth of cost synergies from this transaction. That also has not changed.
We plan to webcast an Analyst Day from Dallas very soon after the deal closes to discuss our strategy in much more detail. We are more confident than ever about the opportunity this transaction brings. We are building a unique communications and entertainment company that we believe will not only transform us, but transform our industry as well. And we are very anxious to talk with you about it. With that, Lori, let's go ahead and take some questions."

So the discipline sales approach that the team took was really important to driving that good performance in service revenues. While we're not giving specific guidance on either on service margins or on the specific amount of wireless margins, we're going to stay with our guidance that we did have out there that we continue to expect to grow overall revenues in our business and that we're going to continue to expect to grow margins, both on the wireless and on the consolidated side.

I think I mentioned that 2/3 of our Cricket customers are buying out of the higher plans. Those are $50, $60 month plus. 2/3 more of our customers are buying those plans. And those ARPUs are higher than the feature phone ARPUs we're losing. And quite frankly, higher than a lot of -- some people in the markets postpaid ARPU. So we're getting great tradeoff. The beauty of that, though, and I think it's helping margins is there's very low acquisitions subsidy cost with regard to those customers.

One is we made significant progress with regard to Cricket and the integration of it. So we've been able to free up a lot of spectrum of the year-to-date in capacity had a very efficient and low-cost rate. So we've been able to serve customers more effectively had. Secondly, we have -- the Cricket -- as you know, the company we bought was operating at a -- it will say that challenge environment with challenge results from a margin and operating come perspective. The team has put in place integration plans and activated those and effectuated those. They are now improving and growing EBITDA and operating contribution in that piece of it. So if you go back if you look at the prior public company we bought the lead company the senses if you can turn those numbers positive, you can have a real improvement on your quarter, that's 1. Two, we have seen efforts in our customer tier and specifically, in our mobility customer care centers, where we've done a whole variety of settings, whether it's the sales guys keeping consistent sales offers out there, with the -- whether it's the retail side is having the sales agent having to spend more time to make sure customers explain it, whether it's moving towards getting it right the first time and getting the first call resolution or it's our extensive investments over the last few years in digital first and allowing customers to, for example, order, upgrade, by different packages, pay their bills. Those types of things other smartphones. All that is driven call volumes down significantly into our care centers to the tune of we will probably have a drop for this year of about 10 million phone calls out of our mobility carrier centers alone. So that's another activity that's going. Our LTE network is a lower cost network, and we're continuing to see -- people use more data and buying up into bigger plans. That's helping. Additionally, what -- we are seeing our customers -- we want to hold their phones longer under the next plan, at least longer than we had initially expected. And with that, we are seeing cost savings there. So those are all part of what we saw in the second quarter. And we're optimistic that we'll be able to continue much of that momentum maybe at different levels, but we're owing to be able to continue that momentum going forward. So we're optimistic about that. With regard to the transaction. I won't make any comments. With regard to GigaPower, we've announced an effort to go into 25 major markets to place fiber to the premise in those. We have done it inserted some initial markets in Dallas and Austin, some others. Our initial results have been very encouraging. Our sales have exceeded our expectations. We're seeing great, if you will, Net Promoter Scores from our customers who take those services. And we're encouraged by that. And I think based on prints, the comments with regard to it is that, but we are encouraged by what we've seen out of GigaPower and the capabilities it brings, not only to our customers, but to us as a service provider."

As you can see, it really had any impact in the sense that our revenues grew 3.7% or almost 4%. So it was from this disciplined approach of not getting out of hand with regard to promotional pricing. That's how we think about it. When we are incapable of bundling all of our services together, we're very optimistic about our ability to compete. With regard to our IP broadband, it really has more to do this time, not only with the seasonality, but also with the fact that we were converting our DSL at a very high rate to our IP broadband or a high-speed broadband. That process has left -- has achieved 13 million of these high-speed broadband, and we're only about 1 million left. So come from a number of years ago, where we had 14 million to convert, we're down to 1. And so you'll see -- it's just a different pool to draw from. Once again, as we have a somewhat Charles Brady footprint in the current time, the opportunities before us are clear with that high-quality broadband service that we have. I'll leave it at that."

That's having a significant impact on the global -- on the Wholesale business. That's the first point. The second point we're saying is a continued -- not only pressure on the legacy analog sources, but a movement towards for efficient IP strategic services. So when the customers move up, sometimes they have more services in place. But even after they drop the legacy services, the strategic services oftentimes have more efficiency. And so until the volumes grow to absorb that, there's a disconnect between those revenue sources. But with that being said, we still feel very good about the -- our win percentages and our ability to hold onto that business and our ability to grow going forward. The biggest first issue with regard to wholesale, though, is the fact that we decided to get ourselves. And then the second piece is they've transitioned to strategic services, to ethernet and other things. But we will continue to be positive. We'll continue to be able to compete well in that wholesale space. With regard to GigaPower, just we're not giving out cost per unit price this time. And let me give you some insights into why that would be challenging at this point. There is a difference between whether you do it on an aerial basis or very capable basis. This multi dwelling units were they do it today single home and a single residence. So all of those factors, at this stage, could mislead folks with any factual numbers.

But quite frankly, they're right now a great network. So they're getting great service with cost efficient plans. We're able to do it because they're paying for their own phones.

So they're having a great experience, that's one. Two, we're giving the pricing. We can do that because they're paying their own phones essentially. So they are still assuming our operations team is working very hard to integrate the quality of our networks, our backbone in our cost structure. All of those things was driving the trend there is really I'm sure has a lot to do with these great networks that they're ready. So I would suggest to that. On the Connected Car, there's kind of 3 relationships I think of when I think of that connected side. There's one of the wholesale relationship with manufacturer pressure/dealers that's the ability to deliver on-time information, real-time information to the particularly from the cars for our letter with the designed, marketing activities, announces, upgrades to mapping and so on and so forth. And that's a wholesale relationship we have with the auto manufacturers. As we continue to develop applications and they continue to develop applications and information inside out of that process, we'll continue to -- where helpful to continue to grow that revenue. The key to that is much of that activity can be done enough. And then hours. And so we -- the automotive [indiscernible] and get to that time in debt in that data in times when it's very cost efficient for us to do that. So we can utilize our networks when they are somewhat under utilized and they can still a really good quality data. There's that's ability to put it into a long-term value plan and part of our Mobile Share Value plans is had on service. We're just getting started with that. We're very optimistic about the opportunities there. But quite frankly, the cars first are just rolling off. And secondly, there's some promotional time and promotional activities with that capabilities available before we sign them up to the retail package. So that process is just getting started. We feel very good about it. And I think it fits within the overall connected life strategy that our mobility team is running. And then lastly, there's the prepaid opportunity for somebody with us and on the car, but wants to utilize of that connectivity in that car. And we are seeing some utilization of that today and we'll continue to see that develop. We're optimistic and very jazzed up, so to speak about the opportunities of the Connected Car I would suggest the company that's our scale insights. We look to this to being not only a success in the today's that as in today's relationships with our business customers, but a success going forward in revenue generation and margin generation improvement."

John will provide an update with perspective on the quarter and then we'll follow that with a Q&A session.
Let me remind you that our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website, and that's att.com/investor.relations.
I need to call your attention on Page 2 to our safe harbor statement. Before we begin, the safe harbor statement says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking, and as such, they are subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially. And additional information is available on the Investor Relations page of AT&T's website.
Before I turn it over to John, let me cover Slide 3, cover our consolidated financial summary. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.69. That's up more than 11% over last year's second quarter. This includes adjustments for a noncash charge related to Leap's network decommissioning and other merger-related costs, which include DIRECTV in Mexico. This strong year-over-year growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexican wireless operations as well as the impact from our divested Connecticut wireline business and our equity investment in América Móvil.
Consolidated revenues grew to $33 billion. It's up more than 2% when you adjust for the sale of our Connecticut wireline property. This growth was driven by continued solid performance in wireless, as we reposition our smartphone base. We had impressive gains in strategic business services and strong wireline consumer revenue growth.
Cash flows also grew significantly in the quarter. Cash from ops for the quarter totaled more than $9 billion, up more than 13% over last year's second quarter. And free cash flow was $4.5 billion and more than $7 billion on a year-to-date basis. And that brought our free cash flow dividend payout to 67% on a year-to-date basis.
And so with that overview, I'll now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens, and he'll discuss our operational highlights. John?"

As you can see in our second quarter results, our moves to transform the company are working and working well. We grew revenues, expand the margins and achieved double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Cash flows were strong, allowing us to invest in our business, return substantial value to shareholders and strengthen our cash position.
Our moves to reposition our smartphone customer base are working, achieving the expected results. Almost 80% of the smartphone base is already on Mobile Share Value plans, and 68% of our smartphone sales and upgrades were on AT&T Next. When you're adding the customers who brought their own device, nearly 3/4 of smartphone sales were without subsidies. This helped drive strong postpaid phone-only with Next ARPU growth and best-ever service margins.
In wireline, our transition to IP services continues at a strong clip. U-verse services are more than 70% of consumer revenues and helped drive near-4% adjusted revenue growth. Strategic services are now 1/3 of our wireline business revenues and continue to grow at a very strong pace.
So all in all, a very strong quarter as we begin the diversification of our company. Our growth in cost initiatives, such as Project VIP and Project Agile, are working. We are executing at a high level, and we have a solid foundation for growth as we move forward.
Now let's take a closer look at our operational highlights, starting with wireless on Slide 5. Our wireless strategy is working. Our efforts to reposition of the smartphone base to the no-subsidy model have taken hold. We continue to see solid evidence that our efforts are paying off.
First, the most significant shift of our smartphone customers to Mobile Share Value plans is behind us. This has helped stabilize service revenues, which were essentially flat for the quarter. There was heavy promotional activity in last year second quarter, which pressured service revenues, so our disciplined sales approach this year helped in our year-over-year comparison.
Second, as service revenues stabilize and the number of customers using AT&T Next increases, we have seen our postpaid phone ARPU with Next increase steadily. It was up more than 6% year-over-year. And our postpaid phone-only revenues increased sequentially, reaching its highest level in 3 quarters. We are about half way through the expected Next sales cycle as customers upgrade their smartphones. As they do, we expect continued ARPU with Next growth as more customers upgrade.
Our focus on costs, Cricket's operational efficiencies and other cost-savings programs, such as Project Agile, help drive strong margin expansion in the quarter. Our adjusted wireless EBITDA service margin was 48.5%, our best performance ever, and an almost 600 basis point improvement over last year's second quarter.
The story over the last 6 quarters has been repositioning our smartphone base. This has moved subscribers away from the heavy handset subsidies in exchange for lower monthly pricing. For the last several quarters, customers on pre-Next pricing have been added of us, but we are starting to see the benefits of the strategy.
 Let's talk more about that on Slide 6.  We've made remarkable progress in transitioning our customers to Mobile Share Value plans. In a little more than a year, nearly 2/3 of our smartphone base has moved to the no-subsidy discount pricing of Mobile Share Value. Our customers continue to choose these plans, the growth rate is slowing as the penetration has been achieved. 
On the other hand, the revenue growth opportunity with AT&T Next has much farther to go. About 68% of our smartphone sales in the quarter were on AT&T Next, but our Next customer base is only about 37%. That gives us substantial opportunity to grow revenues as these customers upgrade their smartphones.
We expect penetration rates for both Mobile Share Value and AT&T Next to continue to grow. AT&T Next and Bring Your Own Device are about 90% of postpaid smartphone sales are company-owned stores and have programs -- and we have programs in place to generate similar or better rates in our other channels.
And the Mobile Share Value plans continues to drive new customers. Only about 12% of our smartphone base is still on unlimited data plans, and that has been steadily dropping as customers choose to move to our new Mobile Share Value plans.  We also continue to see growth in the percentage of our postpaid base on Mobile Share Value family plans or business plans. That total has reached 96% in this past quarter. These plans tend to be more sticky with lower churn. We also turned in another strong net-add quarter as postpaid, prepaid and connected devices drove our highest net adds in more than 3 years. Those details are on Slide 7.
Total net adds came in at 2.1 million subscribers, including 410,000 postpaid subscribers and 1.4 million connected devices. Cricket is really kicking into gear. Prepaid voice had a strong turnaround year from a year ago. We gained more than 330,000 prepaid voice customers, after losing about that many in the year-ago quarter.
Our process has been benefited by our ability to transition the Cricket customers to our new high-quality 4G LTE network. Our strong sales efforts and the near completion of the Cricket integration helped drive that turnaround.  97% of Cricket customers are now on our GSM platform as we continue the integration and as we shut down the CDMA networks. These are premium prepaid customers. Almost all are choosing smartphones when they go onto our GSM platform, and about 2/3 of the gross adds are choosing our highest-value plans those are plans that have higher ARPU.
In fact, those ARPU levels are similar and sometimes better than other carrier's postpaid ARPU. And we're doing this integration faster and with less churn than we originally anticipated, even with our network conversion. We had our lowest ever prepaid churn, thanks to continued progress with Cricket, even as we decommission the networks.
We also had our second largest connected device net-add quarter ever. Our leadership in Connected Cars drove that growth. Our relationship with 8 car manufacturers producing more than half of the new Connected Cars in the United States is driving this, as more and more manufacturers make connectivity a key part of their new car strategies.
The company had 7.2 million branded smartphone gross adds and upgrades in the second quarter. We increased our high-quality branded smartphone base by about 1.2 million in the quarter. This includes branded upgrades and migrations, which we don't include in our net add number.
This smartphone momentum, plus strength in prepaid, led to a positive branded voice net adds in the quarter. Churn continues to be solid. Postpaid churn was down slightly from the first quarter of this year. And for the year, we are still running below last year's best-ever annual postpaid churn record of 1.04%. 
Total churn was also impressive. It dropped 16 basis points to 1.31% from 1.47% in the year-ago quarter, driven in large part by the significant improvements in prepaid. And branded churn was also down year-over-year, as we added more than 740,000 branded devices. 
Now let's look at our wireline operation.  That information is on Slide 8. The repositioning of our wireline base also is working. The challenge here is to maintain margins while transitioning customers to IP services from higher-margin legacy services. That's not a simple task. But the team's extraordinary efforts to control costs and focus on profitability has helped stabilize or even expand margins as we made this transition. That was true this quarter, even with about $40 million or 30 basis points of additional pressure from spring storms that hit our network and our footprint.
We have taken several measures to make this possible. You know of our efforts to access [ph] low-margin wholesale businesses causes revenue pressure, but it does improve the future of our business. Our customer service focus has helped reduce cycle times in provisioning services for customers and added network-on-demand capabilities with our next-generation network investments.  These efforts were recently recognized by IDC, which named AT&T a leader in seeking new innovations to improve customer service. Our Project Agile is more of a mindset than just the cost efficiency program. We're not only finding ways to take costs out of our business but also working to make things simpler to start with for both our customers and us. 
Our transformation IP technologies continued to drive strong performance in both strategic business services and wireline consumer in the quarter. 
Adjusted strategic service revenues grew by nearly 14%. And when you adjust for the foreign exchange pressure, growth was even stronger, coming in at more than 16%.  
At the same time, we see the impact of IP with our data revenues. Total data revenues are nearly 60% of wireline business revenues and more than half of those revenues are from strategic services as we transition customers from legacy data services. This has helped drive total data year-over-year revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter.
Adjusted wireline business revenues were down 3.9%. However, if you adjust for the impact of our discontinued wholesale businesses and FX, the decline would have been 1.7%. There was revenue pressure across our wireline business operation, but was most pronounced in wholesale, where we have been focusing on profitable sales, even if it meant a reduction in revenue.
Small business revenue was down slightly over the first quarter of the year, but we continue to see fiber sales accelerate. And we are very excited to hear that AT&T has been named the highest-ranked brand in overall business wireline customer satisfaction performance in the J.D. Power small-to-medium business segment for 2015. That's quite a tribute to the business team's efforts in this space.
On the consumer side, U-verse services more than 70% of consumer revenues, and adjusted revenues grew about 19% year-over-year. That helped drive our strongest consumer revenue growth in 5 quarters, growing by 3.7% when adjusting for the sale of Connecticut operations. You also see our focus on profitability and repositioning our customer base with U-verse. Video net adds dropped with fewer promotions and our targeting of high-value subscribers.  We did add about 240,000 IP broadband customers in the quarter, as we continue to reposition our DSL base to IP. The work is nearing completion with less than 1 million eligible DSL subscribers left to transition.
Now let's look at consolidated margins, which are on Slide 9. The strength in wireless and stable wireline margins had a positive impact on consolidated margins. In the second quarter, our adjusted EBITDA grew to $11.1 billion, and the adjusted consolidated margin was 33.6% compared to 31.5% last year. That's a more than 200 basis point improvement. Adjusted operating margin also is showing continued improvement. It was $6.5 billion, up 12.4% year-over-year.
And adjusted operating income margin grew to 19.6%, up more than 190 basis points from the year-earlier second quarter. This was largely due to cost-focus initiatives, which included Project Agile, our strength in wireless, growth in consumer revenues and gains in strategic business services. 
The company also benefited from lower trailing expenses from capital spending, as Project VIP was completed. And our move to next-generation networks is starting to make a real difference as well.
Now let's move to cash flow, where we had an outstanding quarter. The summary is on Slide 10. Our ability to generate cash continues to be strong.
Cash from operations totaled $9.2 billion, that's nearly 4x our dividend commitment and our best cash generation in 7 quarters. And we generated $15.9 billion in cash year-to-date. Capital expenditures totaled $4.7 billion and $8.7 billion, year-to-date. We still expect standalone capital spending in the $18 billion range this year, but we are now including our expansion efforts in Mexico in that amount.
Free cash flow was $4.5 billion, and $7.2 billion year-to-date. We are well on our way to hitting our standalone free cash flow guidance we gave you earlier this year. We now expect standalone free cash flow, excluding any impact from DIRECTV, in the $12 billion range or better, and this includes the operational and capital impacts from our Mexican acquisitions.
In terms of uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.4 billion, which gives us a free cash flow to dividend payout ratio of 55% for the quarter and about 67% year-to-date.
Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.15, similar to the first quarter. We did issue debt in the second quarter to help finance our acquisition activities. Our long-range goal is to get these levels back to the 1.8 range and expect our cash focus to be on paying down debt in the near term.
The strong financial performance in the first half of the year sets us up well for the transformation and diversification of our business. 
Now let me close with a quick summary of the quarter on Slide 11 before we get to your questions.
Our transformation plan is working. When you build the great network, develop next-generation products and focus on the customer, good things happen. This focus drove strong results in the quarter that saw growing revenues, expanding margins and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. But just as important was our ability to generate cash from our business, which we did. All this is in line or better than guidance that we gave you earlier this year. These results add to our confidence that we are on track to hear our stand-alone guidance metrics. 
Wireless financials were solid as we near completion of our shift to Mobile Share Value plans. Next take rates continue to increase, helping drive increasing postpaid phone with Next ARPU. Our prepaid brands are doing great, and our expense management helped drive our best-ever service margins.
Our move into Mexico positions us as the only company who owns and operates a North American mobile service area that will serve more than 400 million people with 4G LTE service, and we expect to reach 350 million people by year-end. Owning these network assets not only provide a high level of service quality for our customers but also gives us owners' economics advantages.
We're also very pleased that in order to approve our DIRECTV transaction with certain conditions, it's circulating at the SEC. We expect final approval at any time. We won't be able to address any of your questions about the deal today during this call, but I can tell you this. 
First, as far as any conditions that Chairman Wheeler alluded to earlier this week, we feel very confident that we can make an adequate return on any investment we make as part of this deal. Our threshold for investment in determining what's best for our shareholders has not changed.  Second, we still fully expect to achieve $2.5 billion worth of cost synergies from this transaction. That also has not changed.
We plan to webcast an Analyst Day from Dallas, very soon after the deal closes, to discuss our strategy in much more detail. We are more confident than ever about the opportunity this transaction brings. We are building a unique communications and entertainment company that we believe will not only transform us but transform our industry as well. And we are very anxious to talk with you about it. 
With that, Lori, let's go ahead and take some questions."

So the disciplined sales approach that the team took was really important to driving that good performance in service revenues. While we're not giving specific guidance on either on service margins or on the specific amount of wireless margins, we're going to stay with our guidance that we did have out there that we continue to expect to grow overall revenues in our business and that we're going to continue to expect to grow margins, both on the wireless and on the consolidated side. So I'll stick with that. But yes, we are very encouraged by it. The discipline that the team has shown is impressive, and we see every reason to continue that focus and discipline."

On a branded net-add basis, we were negative; on voice, we're positive. We added voice customers. Now on the postpaid category, we did lose some feature phones which have our lowest ARPUs. But on the prepaid side, with both our Cricket and GoPhone brands, we added some premium customers. I think I mentioned that 2/3 of the Cricket customers are buying out of the higher plans. Those are $50- and $60-a-month plans. 2/3 or more of our customers are buying those plans. And those ARPUs are higher than the feature phone ARPUs we're losing, and quite frankly, higher than a lot of -- than some people in the market's postpaid ARPU. So we're getting great tradeoff. The beauty of that, though, and I think it's helping margins, is there's very low acquisition subsidy cost with regard to those customers.

One is, we made significant progress with regard to Cricket and the integration of it. So we've been able to free up a lot of spectrum of the year to take in capacity in a very efficient and low-cost way to be able to serve customers more effectively, get LTE add. 
Secondly, we have -- the Cricket, as you know, the company we've bought was operating at a -- and it will say that challenged environment will challeng results from a margin and operating come perspective. The team has put in place integration plans and activated those and effectuated those. They are now improving and growing EBITDA and operating contribution in that piece of it. So if you go back and look at the prior public company, we bought the Leap Company. [indiscernible] the senses of if you can turn those numbers positive, you can have a real improvement on your quarter. That's one. Two, we have seen efforts in our customer tier, and specifically in our mobility customer care centers, where we've done a whole variety of things, whether it's the sales guys keeping consistent sales offers out there with -- whether it's the retail stores having the sales agent spend more time to make sure customers explain it, whether it's moving towards getting it right the first time and getting the first-call resolution or it's our extensive investments over the last few years in digital-first allowing customers to, for example, order, upgrade, buy different packages, pay their bills, those types of things on their smartphones. All that has driven call volumes down significantly into our care centers to the tune of we will probably have a drop for this year of about 10 million phone calls out of our mobility care centers alone. So that's another activity that's going. Our LTE network is a lower-cost network, and we're continuing to see people use more data and buying up into bigger plans. That's helping. Additionally, we are seeing our customers seems to want to hold their phones longer under the Next plan, at least longer than we had initially expected, and with that, we are seeing cost savings there. So those are all part of what we saw in the second quarter. And we're optimistic that we'll be able to continue much of that momentum maybe at different levels, but we are going to be able to continue that momentum going forward. So we're optimistic about that. With regard to the transaction, I won't make any comments. With regard to GigaPower, we've announced an effort to go into 25 major markets to place fiber-to-the-prem in those. We have done it and started in some initial markets in Dallas and Austin, some others. Our initial results have been very encouraging. Our sales have exceeded our expectations. We're seeing great, if you will, Net Promoter Scores from our customers who take those services, and we're encouraged by that.

And last year's full year was our best year ever. And secondly, as I mentioned, if you peal through our numbers, you can see our total churn dropped 16 basis points, which means our prepaid churn, which I did mention, and its best quarter ever for us, and our prepaid churns are really improving. So we're really focused on it, and we believe that gives us that opportunity to really generate value are still being very competitive in the marketplace."

So if you can maybe give us a little color in terms what you saw, what you didn't like it and where you have really focused strategically, that would be helpful.

One, with regard to we do have a tremendous focus on driving costs out of our wireline business, and as all of you know, when legacy services drop off, they usually have very high margins ago with them. So as we're growing our strategic services, our U-verse services, we're really, we really focused on controlling cost so we can replace that to maintain our profitability. With that being said, on the U-verse video side, the first point to make is second quarter is always seasonally challenge. You have a lot of relocations. You've got a lot of students returning from college. And with our currently limited footprint with regard to video capabilities, it's always a challenge for us. The issue then is, do you go out and do a lot of promotional activities to stimulate growth. We chose to be very disciplined and very limited in those promotional activities. As you can see, it really had impact in the sense that our revenues grew 3.7%, or almost 4%. So it was from this disciplined approach of not getting out of hand with regard to promotional pricing. That's how we think about it. When we are incapable of bundling all of our services together, we're very optimistic about our ability to compete. With regard to our IP broadband, it really has more to do at this time not only with the seasonality but also with the fact that we were converting our DSL at a very high rate to our IP broadband or a high-speed broadband. That process has left -- has achieved 13 million of these high-speed broadband, and we're only about 1 million left. So coming from a number of years ago where we had 14 million to convert, we're down to 1 million. And so you'll see -- it's just a different pool to draw from. Once again, as we have a somewhat [indiscernible] video footprint at the current time, the opportunities before us are clear with that high-quality broadband service that we have. So I'll leave it with that."

That's having a significant impact on the global -- on the wholesale business. That's the first point. The second point what we're saying is a continued not only pressure on the legacy analogue services but a movement towards for efficient IP strategic services. So when the customer move up, sometimes they have both services in place. But even after they drop the legacy services, the strategic services oftentimes have more efficiency, and so until the volumes grow to absorb that, there is a disconnect between those revenue sources. But with that being said, we still feel very good about the -- our win percentages and our ability to hold onto that business and our ability to grow going forward. The biggest first issue with regard to wholesale, though, is the fact that we decided to get out of that business. And then the second piece is some of this growing as they've transitioned to strategic services to Ethernet and other things. But we will continue to be positive. We'll continue to be able to compete well in that wholesale space. With regard to GigaPower, I would suggest we're not giving out cost per unit price this time, and let me give you some insights into why that would be challenging at this point. There is a difference between whether you do it on an aerial basis or a very capable basis. There's differences between whether you do it in multi-dwelling units or whether you do to the single home and a single residence. So all of those factors at this stage could mislead folks with regard to any kind of factual numbers, so we've chosen not to do that.

One, great plans, great attention to our customers, but quite frankly, they're right on a great network. So they're getting great service with cost-efficient plans, and we're able to do it because they're paying for their own phones. So it's really just a lot of hard work by our network team in getting these customers converted from the network that they were on, the CDMA network they were on, on to our LTE networks, so they're having a great experience. That's one. Two, we're giving a good pricing. We can do that because they're paying their own phones, essentially. So -- and then our sales team and our operations team is working very hard to integrate the quality of our networks, our backbone, and our cost structure. All of those things are what's driving it. But the churn is really, I'm sure, has a lot to do with this great network that they're riding on. So I would suggest to you that. On the Connected Car, there's kind of 3 relationships I think of. When I think of that Connected Car on our revenue side, there's one of the wholesale relationship with the auto manufacturer/dealers, and that's the ability to deliver on-time information, real-time information to the cars or take it from the cars for whether it be design, marketing activities, analysis, upgrades to mapping, so on and so forth. And that's a wholesale relationship we have with the auto manufacturers. And as we continue to develop applications and they continue to develop applications and information needs out of that process, we'll continue -- we're helpful to continue to grow that revenue. The key to that is much of that activity could be done in off-peak hours, and so we can -- the auto manufacturers can gather [ph] that time and gather that data at times when it's very cost-efficient for us to do it. So we can utilize our networks when they are somewhat underutilized and they can still get really good quality data. Two, there is that ability to put it into a Mobile Share Value plan, and part of our Mobile Share Value plans is an add-on service. We're just getting started with that. We're very optimistic about the opportunities there. But quite frankly, the cars: first is just rolling off; and secondly, there are some promotional time and promotional activities where that capability is available before when we sign them up to a retail package. So that process is just getting started. We feel very good about it and think it fits within the overall Connected Life strategy that our mobility team is running. And then lastly, there is a prepaid opportunity for somebody who doesn't own the car but yet wants to utilize that connectivity in that car. And we are seeing some utilization of that today, and we'll continue to see that develop. We're optimistic and very jazzed up, so to speak, about the opportunities of the Connected Car. I would suggest you that company that's our scale and size, we look to this to being not only a success in today's net adds and today's relationships with our business customers but a success going forward in revenue generation and margin generation improvement."

As Lori said, I'm Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John will provide an update with perspective on the quarter and then we'll follow that with a Q&A session.
Let me remind you that our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website, and that's att.com/investor.relations.
I need to call your attention on Page 2 to our safe harbor statement. Before we begin, the safe harbor statement says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking and, as such, they’re subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially. And additional information is available on the Investor Relations page of AT&T's website.
Before I turn it over to John, let me cover Slide 3, cover our consolidated financial summary. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.69. That's up more than 11% over last year's second quarter. This includes adjustments for a noncash charge related to Leap's network decommissioning and other merger-related costs, which include DIRECTV and Mexico. This strong year-over-year growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexican wireless operations, as well as the impact from our divested Connecticut wireline business and our equity investment in América Móvil.
Consolidated revenues grew to $33 billion. It's up more than 2% when you adjust for the sale of our Connecticut wireline property. This growth was driven by continued solid performance in wireless, as we reposition our smartphone base. We had impressive gains in strategic business services and strong wireline consumer revenue growth.
Cash flows also grew significantly in the quarter. Cash from ops for the quarter totaled more than $9 billion, up more than 13% over last year's second quarter. And free cash flow was $4.5 billion and more than $7 billion on a year-to-date basis. And that brought our free cash flow dividend payout to 67% on a year-to-date basis.
And so with that overview, I'll now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens, and he'll discuss our operational highlights. John?"

Thanks for joining us today, and as always, thanks for your interest in AT&T. As you can see, in our second quarter results, our moves to transform the company are working and working well.

As you can see, in our second quarter results, our moves to transform the company are working and working well. We grew revenues, expanded margins and achieved double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Cash flows were strong, allowing us to invest in our business, return substantial value to shareholders and strengthen our cash position.
Our moves to reposition our smartphone customer base are working, achieving the expected results. Almost 80% of the smartphone base is already on Mobile Share Value plans, and 68% of our smartphone sales and upgrades were on AT&T Next. When you add in the customers who brought their own device, nearly 3/4 of smartphone sales were without subsidies. This helped drive strong postpaid phone-only with Next ARPU growth and best-ever service margins.
In wireline, our transition to IP services continues at a strong clip. U-verse services are more than 70% of consumer revenues and helped drive near-4% adjusted revenue growth. Strategic services are now 1/3 of our wireline business revenues and continue to grow at a very strong pace.
So all in all, a very strong quarter as we begin the diversification of our company. Our growth in cost initiatives, such as Project VIP and Project Agile, are working. We’re executing at a high level, and we have a solid foundation for growth as we move forward.
Now let's take a closer look at our operational highlights, starting with wireless on Slide 5. Our wireless strategy is working. Our efforts to reposition the smartphone base to the no-subsidy model have taken hold. We continue to see solid evidence that our efforts are paying off.
First, the most significant shift of our smartphone customers to Mobile Share Value plans is behind us. This has helped stabilize service revenues, which were essentially flat for the quarter. There was heavy promotional activity in last year's second quarter, which pressured service revenues, so our disciplined sales approach this year helped in our year-over-year comparison.
Second, as service revenues stabilize and the number of customers using AT&T Next increases, we have seen our postpaid phone ARPU with Next increase steadily. It was up more than 6% year-over-year. And our postpaid phone-only, revenues increased sequentially, reaching its highest level in 3 quarters. We are about halfway through the expected Next sales cycle as customers upgrade their smartphones. As they do, we expect continued ARPU with Next growth as more customers upgrade.
Our focus on costs, Cricket's operational efficiencies and other cost-savings programs, such as Project Agile, helped drive strong margin expansion in the quarter. Our adjusted wireless EBITDA service margin was 48.5%, our best performance ever, and an almost 600 basis point improvement over last year's second quarter.
The story of the last 6 quarters has been repositioning our smartphone base. This has moved subscribers away from the heavy handset subsidies in exchange for lower monthly pricing. For the last several quarters, customers on pre-Next pricing have been ahead of us, but we are starting to see the benefits of the strategy.
Let's talk more about that on Slide 6.  We've made remarkable progress in transitioning our customers to Mobile Share Value plans. In a little more than a year, nearly 2/3 of our smartphone base has moved to the no-subsidy discount pricing of Mobile Share Value. While customers continue to choose these plans, the growth rate is slowing as the penetration has been achieved. 
On the other hand, the revenue growth opportunity with AT&T Next has much farther to go. About 68% of our smartphone sales in the quarter were on AT&T Next, but our Next customer base is only about 37%. That gives us substantial opportunity to grow revenues as these customers upgrade their smartphones.
We expect penetration rates for both Mobile Share Value and AT&T Next to continue to grow. AT&T Next and Bring Your Own Device are about 90% of postpaid smartphone sales are company-owned stores and have programs -- and we have programs in place to generate similar or better rates in our other channels.
And the value of Mobile Share Value plans continues to drive new customers. Only about 12% of our smartphone base is still on unlimited data plans, and that has been steadily dropping as customers choose to move to our new Mobile Share Value plans. We also continue to see growth in the percentage of our postpaid base on Mobile Share Value family plans or business plans. That total has reached 96% in this past quarter. These plans tend to be more sticky with lower churn. We also turned in another strong net-add quarter as postpaid, prepaid and connected devices drove our highest net adds in more than 3 years. Those details are on Slide 7.
Total net adds came in at 2.1 million subscribers, including 410,000 postpaid subscribers and 1.4 million connected devices. Cricket is really kicking into gear. Prepaid voice had a strong turnaround year from a year ago. We gained more than 330,000 prepaid voice customers, after losing about that many in the year-ago quarter.
Our process has been benefited by our ability to transition the Cricket customers to our new high-quality 4G LTE network. Our strong sales efforts and the near completion of the Cricket integration helped drive that turnaround. 97% of Cricket customers are now on our GSM platform as we continue the integration and as we shut down the CDMA networks. These are premium prepaid customers. Almost all are choosing smartphones when they go onto our GSM platform, and about 2/3 of the gross adds are choosing our highest-value plans; those are plans that have higher ARPU.
In fact, those ARPU levels are similar and sometimes better than other carriers' postpaid ARPU. And we're doing this integration faster and with less churn than we originally anticipated, even with our network conversion. We had our lowest ever prepaid churn, thanks to continued progress with Cricket, even as we decommission the networks.
We also had our second largest connected device net-add quarter ever. Our leadership in connected cars drove that growth. Our relationship with 8 car manufacturers, producing more than half of the new connected cars in the United States, is driving this, as more and more manufacturers make connectivity a key part of their new car strategies.
The company had 7.2 million branded smartphone gross adds and upgrades in the second quarter. We increased our high-quality branded smartphone base by about 1.2 million in the quarter. This includes branded upgrades and migrations, which we don't include in our net add number.
This smartphone momentum, plus strength in prepaid, led to a positive branded voice net adds in the quarter. Churn continues to be solid. Postpaid churn was down slightly from the first quarter of this year. And for the year, we are still running below last year's best-ever annual postpaid churn record of 1.04%. 
Total churn was also impressive. It dropped 16 basis points to 1.31% from 1.47% in the year-ago quarter, driven in large part by the significant improvements in prepaid. And branded churn was also down year-over-year, as we added more than 740,000 branded devices. 
Now let's look at our wireline operation.  That information is on Slide 8. The repositioning of our wireline base also is working. The challenge here is to maintain margins while transitioning customers to IP services from higher-margin legacy services. That's not a simple task. But the team's extraordinary efforts to control costs and focus on profitability has helped stabilize or even expand margins as we made this transition. That was true this quarter, even with about $40 million or 30 basis points of additional pressure from spring storms that hit our network and our footprint.
We have taken several measures to make this possible. You know of our efforts to exit low-margin wholesale businesses causes revenue pressure, but it does improve the future of our business. Our customer service focus has helped reduce cycle times in provisioning services for customers and added network-on-demand capabilities with our next-generation network investments.  These efforts were recently recognized by IDC, which named AT&T a leader in seeking new innovations to improve customer service. 
Our Project Agile is more of a mindset than just the cost-efficiency program. We're not only finding ways to take costs out of our business, but also working to make things simpler to start with for both our customers and us. Our transformation IP technologies continue to drive strong performance in both strategic business services and wireline consumer in the quarter. 
Adjusted strategic service revenues grew by nearly 14%. And when you adjust for the foreign exchange pressure, growth was even stronger, coming in at more than 16%.  
At the same time, we see the impact of IP with our data revenues. Total data revenues are nearly 60% of wireline business revenues and more than half of those revenues are from strategic services as we transition customers from legacy data services. This has helped drive total data year-over-year revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter.
Adjusted wireline business revenues were down 3.9%. However, if you adjust for the impact of our discontinued wholesale businesses and FX, the decline would have been 1.7%. There was revenue pressure across our wireline business operation, but was most pronounced in wholesale, where we have been focusing on profitable sales, even if it meant a reduction in revenue.
Small business revenue was down slightly over the first quarter of the year, but we continue to see fiber sales accelerate. And we are very excited to hear that AT&T has been named the highest-ranked brand in overall business wireline customer satisfaction performance in the J.D. Power small-to-medium business segment for 2015. That's quite a tribute to the business team's efforts in this space.
On the consumer side, U-verse service was more than 70% of consumer revenues, and adjusted revenues grew about 19% year-over-year. That helped drive our strongest consumer revenue growth in 5 quarters, growing by 3.7% when adjusting for the sale of Connecticut operations. You also see our focus on profitability and repositioning our customer base with U-verse. Video net adds dropped with fewer promotions and our targeting of high-value subscribers. We did add about 240,000 IP broadband customers in the quarter, as we continue to reposition our DSL base to IP. That work is nearing completion with less than 1 million eligible DSL subscribers left to transition.
Now let's look at consolidated margins, which are on Slide 9. The strength in wireless and stable wireline margins had a positive impact on consolidated margins. In the second quarter, our adjusted EBITDA grew to $11.1 billion, and the adjusted consolidated margin was 33.6% compared to 31.5% last year. That's a more than 200-basis-point improvement. 
Adjusted operating income also is showing continued improvement. It was $6.5 billion, up 12.4% year-over-year. And adjusted operating income margin grew to 19.6%, up more than 190 basis points from the year-earlier second quarter. This was largely due to cost-focus initiatives, which included Project Agile, our strength in wireless, growth in consumer revenues and gains in strategic business services. 
The company also benefited from lower trailing expenses from capital spending, as Project VIP was completed. And our move to next-generation networks is starting to make a real difference as well.
Now let's move to cash flow, where we had an outstanding quarter. The summary is on Slide 10. Our ability to generate cash continues to be strong. Cash from operations totaled $9.2 billion; that's nearly 4x our dividend commitment and our best cash generation in 7 quarters. And we generated $15.9 billion in cash year-to-date. 
Capital expenditures totaled $4.7 billion and $8.7 billion year-to-date. We still expect stand-alone capital spending in the $18 billion range this year, but we are now including our expansion efforts in Mexico in that amount.
Free cash flow was $4.5 billion and $7.2 billion year-to-date. We are well on our way to hitting our stand-alone free cash flow guidance we gave you earlier this year. We now expect stand-alone free cash flow, excluding any impact from DIRECTV, in the $12 billion range or better, and this includes the operational and capital impacts from our Mexican acquisitions.
In terms of uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.4 billion, which gives us a free cash flow to dividend payout ratio of 55% for the quarter and about 67% year-to-date.
Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.15, similar to the first quarter. We did issue debt in the second quarter to help finance our acquisition activities. Our long-range goal is to get these levels back to the 1.8 range and expect our cash focus to be on paying down debt in the near term.
This strong financial performance in the first half of the year sets us up well for the transformation and diversification of our business. 
Now let me close with a quick summary of the quarter on Slide 11 before we get to your questions.
Our transformation plan is working. When you build a great network, develop next-generation products and focus on the customer, good things happen. This focus drove strong results in the quarter that saw growing revenues, expanding margins and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. But just as important was our ability to generate cash from our business, which we did. All this is in line or better than guidance that we gave you earlier this year. These results add to our confidence that we're on track to hear our stand-alone guidance metrics. 
Wireless financials were solid as we near completion of our shift to Mobile Share Value plans. Next take rates continue to increase, helping drive increasing postpaid phone with Next ARPU. Our prepaid brands are doing great, and our expense management helped drive our best-ever service margins.
Our move into Mexico positions us as the only company who owns and operates a North American mobile service area that will serve more than 400 million people with 4G LTE service, and we expect to reach 350 million people by year-end. Owning these network assets not only provides a high level of service quality for our customers, but also gives us owners' economics advantages.
We're also very pleased that in order to approve our DIRECTV transaction with certain conditions is circulating at the SEC. We expect final approval at any time. We won't be able to address any of your questions about the deal today during this call, but I can tell you this. 
First, as far as any conditions that Chairman Wheeler alluded to earlier this week, we feel very confident that we can make an adequate return on any investment we make as part of this deal. Our threshold for investment in determining what's best for our shareholders has not changed. Second, we still fully expect to achieve $2.5 billion worth of cost synergies from this transaction. That also has not changed.
We plan to webcast an Analyst Day from Dallas, very soon after the deal closes, to discuss our strategy in much more detail. We are more confident than ever about the opportunity this transaction brings. We are building a unique communications and entertainment company that we believe will not only transform us, but transform our industry as well. And we are very anxious to talk with you about it. 
With that, Lori, let's go ahead and take some questions."

So the disciplined sales approach that the team took was really important to driving that good performance in service revenues. While we're not giving specific guidance on -- either on service margins or on the specific amount of wireless margins, we're going to stay with our guidance that we did have out there that we continue to expect to grow overall revenues in our business and that we're going to continue to expect to grow margins, both on the wireless and on the consolidated side.

On a branded net-add basis, we weren't negative on voice, we're positive. We added voice customers. Now, on the postpaid category, we did lose some feature phones which have our lowest ARPUs. But on the prepaid side, with both our Cricket and GoPhone brands, we added some premium customers. I think I mentioned that 2/3 of the Cricket customers are buying out of the higher plans. Those are $50- and $60-a-month plans. About 2/3 or more of our customers are buying those plans. And those ARPUs are higher than the feature phone ARPUs we're losing, and quite frankly, higher than a lot of -- than some people in the market's postpaid ARPU. So we're getting great tradeoff.

One is we made significant progress with regard to Cricket and the integration of it. So we've been able to free up a lot of spectrum over the year to take in capacity in a very efficient and low-cost way, to be able to serve customers more effectively, get more LTE add. Secondly, we have -- the Cricket, as you know, the company we bought was operating at a -- and we'll say that challenged environment would challenge results from a margin and operating income perspective. The team has put in place integration plans and activated those and effectuated those. They're now improving and growing EBITDA and operating contribution in that piece of it. So if you go back and look at the prior public company, we bought the Leap Company. You can get a sense of if you can turn those numbers positive, you can have a real improvement on your quarter. That's one. Two, we have seen efforts in our customer care, and specifically in our mobility customer care centers, where we've done a whole variety of things, whether it's the sales guys keeping consistent sales offers out there with -- whether it's the retail stores having the sales agent spend more time to make sure customers explain it, whether it's moving towards getting it right the first time and getting the first-call resolution or it's our extensive investments over the last few years in digital-first and allowing customers to, for example, order, upgrade, buy different packages, pay their bills, those types of things on their smartphones. All that has driven call volumes down significantly into our care centers to the tune of we will probably have a drop for this year of about 10 million phone calls out of our mobility care centers alone. So that's another activity that's going. Our LTE network is a lower-cost network, and we're continuing to see people use more data and buying up into bigger plans. That's helping. Additionally, we are seeing our customers seem to want to hold their phones longer under the Next plan, at least longer than we had initially expected. And with that, we are seeing cost savings there. So those are all part of what we saw in the second quarter. And we're optimistic that we'll be able to continue much of that momentum. Maybe at different levels, but we are going to be able to continue that momentum going forward. So we're optimistic about that. With regard to the transaction, I won't make any comments with regard to GigaPower. We've announced an effort to go into 25 major markets to place fiber-to-the-prem in those. We have done it and started in some initial markets in Dallas and Austin, some others. Our initial results have been very encouraging. Our sales have exceeded our expectations. We're seeing great, if you will, Net Promoter Scores from our customers who take those services, and we're encouraged by that. And I think, based on prudence, I'll leave the comments with regard to it at that, but we are encouraged by what we've seen out at GigaPower and the capabilities it brings not only to our customers but to us as a service provider."

What I would tell you is that we're not responding to each and every one from a discounting program. We have shown that kind of discipline. We have responded with an effort to make customer care easier, customer service easier, customer data situations, like rollover data, where we can meet some of the customers' pain points and satisfy them. And we've done a great job in providing value customer solution with our prepaid brands. Those are the kinds of things we're going to do and continue to do. I think you've seen it in our numbers that this disciplined approach has paid off. And as I mentioned, we did have positive voice net adds, so we feel good about what it's done to the positioning. Quite frankly, the biggest strategy play that we've had in that wireless space was probably the acquisition of Cricket and giving us that capability, that platform and that distribution to really serve those value customers in a different way. But if you will, yes, it's a competitive market. It continues to be noisy, a competitive market. But it's been that way for some time. And I wouldn't expect it necessarily to change, but I do like our ability to compete with the tools that we have that are different than our competitors. Having that premium prepaid, having Mobile Share Value, having Next, haven't connected cars and connected devices, having all those tools in this great network, I believe we are in the best position to compete going forward and are looking forward to that opportunity."

So as we're growing",348,"So okay, a couple of things. One, with regard to we do have a tremendous focus on driving costs out of our wireline business, and as all of you know, when legacy services drop off, they usually have very high margins that go with them. So as we're growing our strategic services and our U-verse services, we're really focused on controlling costs so we can replace that to maintain our profitability. With that being said, on the U-verse video side, the first point to make is second quarter's always seasonally challenged. You've got a lot of relocations. You've got a lot of students returning from college. And with our not -- currently limited footprint with regard to video capabilities, it's always a challenge for us. The issue then is do you go out and do a lot of promotional activities to stimulate growth. We chose to be very disciplined and very limited in those promotional activities. As you can see, it really had a unique impact in the sense that our revenues grew 3.7%, or almost 4%. So it was from this disciplined approach of not getting out of hand with regard to promotional pricing. That's how we think about it. When we are capable of bundling all our services together, we're very optimistic about our ability to compete. With regard to our IP broadband, it really has more to do at this time not only with the seasonality but also with the fact that we were converting our DSL at a very high rate to our IP broadband, our high-speed broadband. That process has left -- has achieved 13 million of these high-speed broadband, and we're only about 1 million left. So coming from a number of years ago where we had 14 million to convert, we're down to 1 million. And so you'll see it's just a different pool to draw from. Once again, as we have a somewhat challenged video footprint at the current time, the opportunities before us are clear with that high-quality broadband service that we have. So I'll leave it at that."

So very pleased with it, expect we'll continue to do it, but the differential year-over-year was not dramatic as it may have been in some prior quarters. That's one.

That's having a significant impact on the global -- on the wholesale business. That's the first point. The second point what we're saying is the continued not only pressure on the legacy analogue services but a movement towards for efficient IP strategic services. So when the customers move up, sometimes they have both services in place. But even after they shut off the legacy services, the strategic services oftentimes have more efficiency. And so until the volumes grow to absorb that, there's a disconnect between those revenue sources. But with that being said, we still feel very good about the -- our win percentages and our ability to hold onto that business and our ability to grow going forward. The biggest first issue with regard to wholesale, though, is the fact that we've decided to get out of some business. And then the second piece is some of it's growing as they've transitioned to strategic services, to Ethernet and other things. But we will continue to be positive and we continue to be able to compete well in that wholesale space. With regard to GigaPower, I would suggest we're not giving out costs per unit pricing this time, and let me give you some insights into why that would be challenging at this point. There is a difference between whether you do it on an aerial basis or a buried cable basis. There's differences between whether you do it to multi-dwelling units or whether you do it to a single home and a single residence. So all of those factors, at this stage, could mislead folks with regard to any kind of factual numbers, so we've chosen not to do that. But we are just getting started with the fiber-to-the-prem activity. We're very pleased with it. I can suggest to you that we're probably still in the early stages of it.

One, great plans, great attention to our customers, but quite frankly, they're riding on a great network. So they're getting great service with cost-efficient plans, and we're able to do it because they're paying for their own phones. So it's really just a lot of hard work by our network team in getting these customers converted from the network that they were on, the CDMA network they were on, on to our LTE networks, so they're having a great experience. That's one. Two, we're giving a good pricing. We can do that because they're paying for their own phones, essentially. So -- and then our sales team and our operations team is working very hard to integrate the quality of our networks, our backbone, and our cost structure. All of those things are what's driving it. But the churn is really -- I'm sure, has a lot to do with this great network that they're riding on. So I would suggest to you that. On the connected car, there's kind of 3 relationships I think of. When I think of that connected car on our revenue side, there's one of the wholesale relationship with the auto manufacturer/dealers, and that's the ability to deliver on-time information, real-time information to the cars or take it from the cars for whether it be design, marketing activities, analysis, upgrades to mapping, so on and so forth. That's a wholesale relationship we have with the auto manufacturers. And as we continue to develop applications and they continue to develop applications and information needs out of that process, we'll continue -- we're hopeful to continue to grow that revenue. The key to that is much of that activity can be done in off-peak hours, and so we can -- the auto manufacturers can gather their time in -- gather that data at times when it's very cost-efficient for us to do it. So we can utilize our networks when they're somewhat underutilized and they can still get really good quality data. Two, there's that ability to put it into a Mobile Share Value plan, and part of our Mobile Share Value plans is an add-on service. We're just getting started with that. We're very optimistic about the opportunities there. But quite frankly, the cars: first, we're just rolling off; and secondly, there are some promotional time and promotional activities where that capability is available before we sign them up to a retail package. So that process is just getting started. We feel very good about it and think it fits within the overall connected life strategy that our mobility team is running. And then lastly, there's a prepaid opportunity for someone who doesn't own the car but yet wants to utilize that connectivity in that car. And we are seeing some utilization of that today, and we'll continue to see that develop. We're optimistic and very jazzed up, so to speak, about the opportunities of the connected car. I would suggest to you that a company that's our scale and size, we look to this to being not only a success in today's net adds and today's relationships with our business customers, but a success going forward in revenue generation and margin generation improvement."

Let me remind you that our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website, and that's att.com/investor.relations.
I need to call your attention on Page 2 to our safe harbor statement. Before we begin, the safe harbor statement says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking and, as such, they’re subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may differ materially. And additional information is available on the Investor Relations page of AT&T's website.
Before I turn it over to John, let me cover Slide 3, cover our consolidated financial summary. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.69. That's up more than 11% over last year's second quarter. This includes adjustments for a noncash charge related to Leap's network decommissioning and other merger-related costs, which include DIRECTV and Mexico. This strong year-over-year growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexican wireless operations, as well as the impact from our divested Connecticut wireline business and our equity investment in América Móvil.
Consolidated revenues grew to $33 billion. It's up more than 2% when you adjust for the sale of our Connecticut wireline property. This growth was driven by continued solid performance in wireless, as we reposition our smartphone base. We had impressive gains in strategic business services and strong wireline consumer revenue growth.
Cash flows also grew significantly in the quarter. Cash from ops for the quarter totaled more than $9 billion, up more than 13% over last year's second quarter. And free cash flow was $4.5 billion and more than $7 billion on a year-to-date basis. And that brought our free cash flow dividend payout to 67% on a year-to-date basis.
And so with that overview, I'll now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens, and he'll discuss our operational highlights. John?"

Thanks for joining us today, and as always, thanks for your interest in AT&T. As you can see, in our second quarter results, our moves to transform the company are working and working well.

As you can see, in our second quarter results, our moves to transform the company are working and working well. We grew revenues, expanded margins and achieved double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Cash flows were strong, allowing us to invest in our business, return substantial value to shareholders and strengthen our cash position.
Our moves to reposition our smartphone customer base are working, achieving the expected results. Almost 80% of the smartphone base is already on Mobile Share Value plans, and 68% of our smartphone sales and upgrades were on AT&T Next. When you add in the customers who brought their own device, nearly 3/4 of smartphone sales were without subsidies. This helped drive strong postpaid phone-only with Next ARPU growth and best-ever service margins.
In wireline, our transition to IP services continues at a strong clip. U-verse services are more than 70% of consumer revenues and helped drive near-4% adjusted revenue growth. Strategic services are now 1/3 of our wireline business revenues and continue to grow at a very strong pace.
So all in all, a very strong quarter as we begin the diversification of our company. Our growth in cost initiatives, such as Project VIP and Project Agile, are working. We’re executing at a high level, and we have a solid foundation for growth as we move forward.
Now let's take a closer look at our operational highlights, starting with wireless on Slide 5. Our wireless strategy is working. Our efforts to reposition the smartphone base to the no-subsidy model have taken hold. We continue to see solid evidence that our efforts are paying off.
First, the most significant shift of our smartphone customers to Mobile Share Value plans is behind us. This has helped stabilize service revenues, which were essentially flat for the quarter. There was heavy promotional activity in last year's second quarter, which pressured service revenues, so our disciplined sales approach this year helped in our year-over-year comparison.
Second, as service revenues stabilize and the number of customers using AT&T Next increases, we have seen our postpaid phone ARPU with Next increase steadily. It was up more than 6% year-over-year. And our postpaid phone-only, revenues increased sequentially, reaching its highest level in 3 quarters. We are about halfway through the expected Next sales cycle as customers upgrade their smartphones. As they do, we expect continued ARPU with Next growth as more customers upgrade.
Our focus on costs, Cricket's operational efficiencies and other cost-savings programs, such as Project Agile, helped drive strong margin expansion in the quarter. Our adjusted wireless EBITDA service margin was 48.5%, our best performance ever, and an almost 600 basis point improvement over last year's second quarter.
The story of the last 6 quarters has been repositioning our smartphone base. This has moved subscribers away from the heavy handset subsidies in exchange for lower monthly pricing. For the last several quarters, customers on pre-Next pricing have been ahead of us, but we are starting to see the benefits of the strategy.
Let's talk more about that on Slide 6.  We've made remarkable progress in transitioning our customers to Mobile Share Value plans. In a little more than a year, nearly 2/3 of our smartphone base has moved to the no-subsidy discount pricing of Mobile Share Value. While customers continue to choose these plans, the growth rate is slowing as the penetration has been achieved. 
On the other hand, the revenue growth opportunity with AT&T Next has much farther to go. About 68% of our smartphone sales in the quarter were on AT&T Next, but our Next customer base is only about 37%. That gives us substantial opportunity to grow revenues as these customers upgrade their smartphones.
We expect penetration rates for both Mobile Share Value and AT&T Next to continue to grow. AT&T Next and Bring Your Own Device are about 90% of postpaid smartphone sales are company-owned stores and have programs -- and we have programs in place to generate similar or better rates in our other channels.
And the value of Mobile Share Value plans continues to drive new customers. Only about 12% of our smartphone base is still on unlimited data plans, and that has been steadily dropping as customers choose to move to our new Mobile Share Value plans. We also continue to see growth in the percentage of our postpaid base on Mobile Share Value family plans or business plans. That total has reached 96% in this past quarter. These plans tend to be more sticky with lower churn. We also turned in another strong net-add quarter as postpaid, prepaid and connected devices drove our highest net adds in more than 3 years. Those details are on Slide 7.
Total net adds came in at 2.1 million subscribers, including 410,000 postpaid subscribers and 1.4 million connected devices. Cricket is really kicking into gear. Prepaid voice had a strong turnaround year from a year ago. We gained more than 330,000 prepaid voice customers, after losing about that many in the year-ago quarter.
Our process has been benefited by our ability to transition the Cricket customers to our new high-quality 4G LTE network. Our strong sales efforts and the near completion of the Cricket integration helped drive that turnaround. 97% of Cricket customers are now on our GSM platform as we continue the integration and as we shut down the CDMA networks. These are premium prepaid customers. Almost all are choosing smartphones when they go onto our GSM platform, and about 2/3 of the gross adds are choosing our highest-value plans; those are plans that have higher ARPU.
In fact, those ARPU levels are similar and sometimes better than other carriers' postpaid ARPU. And we're doing this integration faster and with less churn than we originally anticipated, even with our network conversion. We had our lowest ever prepaid churn, thanks to continued progress with Cricket, even as we decommission the networks.
We also had our second largest connected device net-add quarter ever. Our leadership in connected cars drove that growth. Our relationship with 8 car manufacturers, producing more than half of the new connected cars in the United States, is driving this, as more and more manufacturers make connectivity a key part of their new car strategies.
The company had 7.2 million branded smartphone gross adds and upgrades in the second quarter. We increased our high-quality branded smartphone base by about 1.2 million in the quarter. This includes branded upgrades and migrations, which we don't include in our net add number.
This smartphone momentum, plus strength in prepaid, led to a positive branded voice net adds in the quarter. Churn continues to be solid. Postpaid churn was down slightly from the first quarter of this year. And for the year, we are still running below last year's best-ever annual postpaid churn record of 1.04%. 
Total churn was also impressive. It dropped 16 basis points to 1.31% from 1.47% in the year-ago quarter, driven in large part by the significant improvements in prepaid. And branded churn was also down year-over-year, as we added more than 740,000 branded devices. 
Now let's look at our wireline operation.  That information is on Slide 8. The repositioning of our wireline base also is working. The challenge here is to maintain margins while transitioning customers to IP services from higher-margin legacy services. That's not a simple task. But the team's extraordinary efforts to control costs and focus on profitability has helped stabilize or even expand margins as we made this transition. That was true this quarter, even with about $40 million or 30 basis points of additional pressure from spring storms that hit our network and our footprint.
We have taken several measures to make this possible. You know of our efforts to exit low-margin wholesale businesses causes revenue pressure, but it does improve the future of our business. Our customer service focus has helped reduce cycle times in provisioning services for customers and added network-on-demand capabilities with our next-generation network investments.  These efforts were recently recognized by IDC, which named AT&T a leader in seeking new innovations to improve customer service. 
Our Project Agile is more of a mindset than just the cost-efficiency program. We're not only finding ways to take costs out of our business but also working to make things simpler to start with for both our customers and us. Our transformation IP technologies continue to drive strong performance in both strategic business services and wireline consumer in the quarter. 
Adjusted strategic service revenues grew by nearly 14%. And when you adjust for the foreign exchange pressure, growth was even stronger, coming in at more than 16%.  
At the same time, we see the impact of IP with our data revenues. Total data revenues are nearly 60% of wireline business revenues and more than half of those revenues are from strategic services as we transition customers from legacy data services. This has helped drive total data year-over-year revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter.
Adjusted wireline business revenues were down 3.9%. However, if you adjust for the impact of our discontinued wholesale businesses and FX, the decline would have been 1.7%. There was revenue pressure across our wireline business operation, but was most pronounced in wholesale, where we have been focusing on profitable sales, even if it meant a reduction in revenue.
Small business revenue was down slightly over the first quarter of the year, but we continue to see fiber sales accelerate. And we are very excited to hear that AT&T has been named the highest-ranked brand in overall business wireline customer satisfaction performance in the J.D. Power small-to-medium business segment for 2015. That's quite a tribute to the business team's efforts in this space.
On the consumer side, U-verse service was more than 70% of consumer revenues, and adjusted revenues grew about 19% year-over-year. That helped drive our strongest consumer revenue growth in 5 quarters, growing by 3.7% when adjusting for the sale of Connecticut operations. You also see our focus on profitability and repositioning our customer base with U-verse. Video net adds dropped with fewer promotions and our targeting of high-value subscribers. We did add about 240,000 IP broadband customers in the quarter, as we continue to reposition our DSL base to IP. That work is nearing completion with less than 1 million eligible DSL subscribers left to transition.
Now let's look at consolidated margins, which are on Slide 9. The strength in wireless and stable wireline margins had a positive impact on consolidated margins. In the second quarter, our adjusted EBITDA grew to $11.1 billion, and the adjusted consolidated margin was 33.6% compared to 31.5% last year. That's a more than 200 basis point improvement. 
Adjusted operating income also is showing continued improvement. It was $6.5 billion, up 12.4% year-over-year. And adjusted operating income margin grew to 19.6%, up more than 190 basis points from the year-earlier second quarter. This was largely due to cost-focus initiatives, which included Project Agile, our strength in wireless, growth in consumer revenues and gains in strategic business services. 
The company also benefited from lower trailing expenses from capital spending, as Project VIP was completed. And our move to next-generation networks is starting to make a real difference as well.
Now let's move to cash flow, where we had an outstanding quarter. The summary is on Slide 10. Our ability to generate cash continues to be strong. Cash from operations totaled $9.2 billion, that's nearly 4x our dividend commitment and our best cash generation in 7 quarters. And we generated $15.9 billion in cash year-to-date. 
Capital expenditures totaled $4.7 billion and $8.7 billion year-to-date. We still expect stand-alone capital spending in the $18 billion range this year, but we are now including our expansion efforts in Mexico in that amount.
Free cash flow was $4.5 billion and $7.2 billion year-to-date. We are well on our way to hitting our stand-alone free cash flow guidance we gave you earlier this year. We now expect stand-alone free cash flow, excluding any impact from DIRECTV, in the $12 billion range or better, and this includes the operational and capital impacts from our Mexican acquisitions.
In terms of uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.4 billion, which gives us a free cash flow to dividend payout ratio of 55% for the quarter and about 67% year-to-date.
Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.15, similar to the first quarter. We did issue debt in the second quarter to help finance our acquisition activities. Our long-range goal is to get these levels back to the 1.8 range and expect our cash focus to be on paying down debt in the near term.
This strong financial performance in the first half of the year sets us up well for the transformation and diversification of our business. 
Now let me close with a quick summary of the quarter on Slide 11 before we get to your questions.
Our transformation plan is working. When you build a great network, develop next-generation products and focus on the customer, good things happen. This focus drove strong results in the quarter that saw growing revenues, expanding margins and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. But just as important was our ability to generate cash from our business, which we did. All this is in line or better than guidance that we gave you earlier this year. These results add to our confidence that we're on track to hear our stand-alone guidance metrics. 
Wireless financials were solid as we near completion of our shift to Mobile Share Value plans. Next take rates continue to increase, helping drive increasing postpaid phone with Next ARPU. Our prepaid brands are doing great, and our expense management helped drive our best-ever service margins.
Our move into Mexico positions us as the only company who owns and operates a North American mobile service area that will serve more than 400 million people with 4G LTE service, and we expect to reach 350 million people by year-end. Owning these network assets not only provides a high level of service quality for our customer but also gives us owners' economics advantages.
We're also very pleased that in order to approve our DIRECTV transaction with certain conditions is circulating at the SEC. We expect final approval at any time. We won't be able to address any of your questions about the deal today during this call, but I can tell you this. 
First, as far as any conditions that Chairman Wheeler alluded to earlier this week, we feel very confident that we can make an adequate return on any investment we make as part of this deal. Our threshold for investment in determining what's best for our shareholders has not changed. Second, we still fully expect to achieve $2.5 billion worth of cost synergies from this transaction. That also has not changed.
We plan to webcast an Analyst Day from Dallas, very soon after the deal closes, to discuss our strategy in much more detail. We are more confident than ever about the opportunity this transaction brings. We are building a unique communications and entertainment company that we believe will not only transform us but transform our industry as well. And we are very anxious to talk with you about it. 
With that, Lori, let's go ahead and take some questions."

On the service revenues, we did get a little bit of benefit this year -- this quarter, from the promotional activity that took place last year. So the disciplined sales approach that the team took was really important to driving that good performance in service revenues. While we're not giving specific guidance on -- either on service margins or on the specific amount of wireless margins, we're going to stay with our guidance that we did have out there that we continue to expect to grow overall revenues in our business and that we're going to continue to expect to grow margins, both on the wireless and on the consolidated side. So I'll stick with that. But yes, we are very encouraged by it. The discipline that the team has shown is impressive, and we see every reason to continue that focus and discipline."

But on the prepaid side, with both our Cricket and GoPhone brands, we added some premium customers. I think I mentioned that 2/3 of the Cricket customers are buying out of the higher plans. Those are $50- and $60-a-month plans. About 2/3 or more of our customers are buying those plans. And those ARPUs are higher than the feature phone ARPUs we're losing, and quite frankly, higher than a lot of -- than some people in the market's postpaid ARPU. So we're getting great tradeoff.

There's about almost $750 million of sequential costs went away after you subtract out the merger and integration expenses. So could you kind of parse down what happened quarter-over-quarter in the wireless business? And can we expect this as a starting point to be where we should look at wireless margins for the rest of the year and into '16? And then, I guess, as a second question, it's no secret we're all trying to figure out the implications of the potential conditions here. But I think as a level set in that conversation, could you kind of go through what you're able to talk about in terms of the scope of the current GigaPower initiative, the economics around that initiative, cost to home passed and so we could kind of all be on the same page in that conversation?"

One is we made significant progress with regard to Cricket and the integration of it. So we've been able to free up a lot of spectrum over the year to take in capacity in a very efficient and low-cost way, to be able to serve customers more effectively, get more LTE add. Secondly, we have -- the Cricket, as you know, the company we bought was operating at a -- and we'll say that challenged environment would challenge results from a margin and operating income perspective. The team has put in place integration plans and activated those and effectuated those. They're now improving and growing EBITDA and operating contribution in that piece of it. So if you go back and look at the prior public company, we bought the Leap Company. You can get a sense of if you can turn those numbers positive, you can have a real improvement on your quarter. That's one. Two, we have seen efforts in our customer care, and specifically in our mobility customer care centers, where we've done a whole variety of things, whether it's the sales guys keeping consistent sales offers out there with -- whether it's the retail stores having the sales agent spend more time to make sure customers explain it, whether it's moving towards getting it right the first time and getting the first-call resolution or it's our extensive investments over the last few years in digital-first and allowing customers to, for example, order, upgrade, buy different packages, pay their bills, those types of things on their smartphones. All that has driven call volumes down significantly into our care centers to the tune of we will probably have a drop for this year of about 10 million phone calls out of our mobility care centers alone. So that's another activity that's going. Our LTE network is a lower-cost network, and we're continuing to see people use more data and buying up into bigger plans. That's helping. Additionally, we are seeing our customers seem to want to hold their phones longer under the Next plan, at least longer than we had initially expected. And with that, we are seeing cost savings there. So those are all part of what we saw in the second quarter. And we're optimistic that we'll be able to continue much of that momentum. Maybe at different levels, but we are going to be able to continue that momentum going forward. So we're optimistic about that. With regard to the transaction, I won't make any comments. With regard to GigaPower, we've announced an effort to go into 25 major markets to place fiber-to-the-prem in those. We have done it and started in some initial markets in Dallas and Austin, some others. Our initial results have been very encouraging. Our sales have exceeded our expectations. We're seeing great, if you will, Net Promoter Scores from our customers who take those services, and we're encouraged by that. And I think, based on prudence, I'll leave the comments with regard to it at that, but we are encouraged by what we've seen out at GigaPower and the capabilities it brings not only to our customers but to us as a service provider."

What I would tell you is that we're not responding to each and every one from a discounting program. We have shown that kind of discipline. We have responded with an effort to make customer care easier, customer service easier, customer data situations, like rollover data, where we can meet some of the customers' pain points and satisfy them. And we've done a great job in providing value customer solution with our prepaid brands. Those are the kinds of things we're going to do and continue to do. I think you've seen it in our numbers that this disciplined approach has paid off. And as I mentioned, we did have positive voice net adds, so we feel good about what it's done to the positioning. Quite frankly, the biggest strategy play that we've had in that wireless space was probably the acquisition of Cricket and giving us that capability, that platform and that distribution to really serve those value customers in a different way. But if you will, yes, it's a competitive market. It continues to be noisy, a competitive market. But it's been that way for some time. And I wouldn't expect it necessarily to change, but I do like our ability to compete with the tools that we have that are different than our competitors. Having that premium prepaid, having Mobile Share Value, having Next, haven't connected cars and connected devices, having all those tools in this great network, I believe we are in the best position to compete going forward and are looking forward to that opportunity."

One, with regard to we do have a tremendous focus on driving costs out of our wireline business, and as all of you know, when legacy services drop off, they usually have very high margins that go with them. So as we're growing our strategic services and our U-verse services, we're really focused on controlling costs so we can replace that to maintain our profitability. With that being said, on the U-verse video side, the first point to make is second quarter's always seasonally challenged. You've got a lot of relocations. You've got a lot of students returning from college. And with our not -- currently limited footprint with regard to video capabilities, it's always a challenge for us. The issue then is do you go out and do a lot of promotional activities to stimulate growth. We chose to be very disciplined and very limited in those promotional activities. As you can see, it really had a unique impact in the sense that our revenues grew 3.7%, or almost 4%. So it was from this disciplined approach of not getting out of hand with regard to promotional pricing. That's how we think about it. When we are capable of bundling all our services together, we're very optimistic about our ability to compete. With regard to our IP broadband, it really has more to do at this time not only with the seasonality but also with the fact that we were converting our DSL at a very high rate to our IP broadband, our high-speed broadband. That process has left -- has achieved 13 million of these high-speed broadband, and we're only about 1 million left. So coming from a number of years ago where we had 14 million to convert, we're down to 1 million. And so you'll see it's just a different pool to draw from. Once again, as we have a somewhat challenged video footprint at the current time, the opportunities before us are clear with that high-quality broadband service that we have. So I'll leave it at that."

That's having a significant impact on the global -- on the wholesale business. That's the first point. The second point what we're saying is the continued not only pressure on the legacy analogue services but a movement towards for efficient IP strategic services. So when the customers move up, sometimes they have both services in place. But even after they shut off the legacy services, the strategic services oftentimes have more efficiency. And so until the volumes grow to absorb that, there's a disconnect between those revenue sources. But with that being said, we still feel very good about the -- our win percentages and our ability to hold onto that business and our ability to grow going forward. The biggest first issue with regard to wholesale, though, is the fact that we've decided to get out of some business. And then the second piece is some of it's growing as they've transitioned to strategic services, to Ethernet and other things. But we will continue to be positive and we continue to be able to compete well in that wholesale space. With regard to GigaPower, I would suggest we're not giving out costs per unit pricing this time, and let me give you some insights into why that would be challenging at this point. There is a difference between whether you do it on an aerial basis or a buried cable basis. There's differences between whether you do it to multi-dwelling units or whether you do it to a single home and a single residence. So all of those factors, at this stage, could mislead folks with regard to any kind of factual numbers, so we've chosen not to do that. But we are just getting started with the fiber-to-the-prem activity. We're very pleased with it. I can suggest to you that we're probably still in the early stages of it.

One, great plans, great attention to our customers, but quite frankly, they're riding on a great network. So they're getting great service with cost-efficient plans, and we're able to do it because they're paying for their own phones. So it's really just a lot of hard work by our network team in getting these customers converted from the network that they were on, the CDMA network they were on, on to our LTE networks, so they're having a great experience. That's one. Two, we're giving a good pricing. We can do that because they're paying for their own phones, essentially. So -- and then our sales team and our operations team is working very hard to integrate the quality of our networks, our backbone, and our cost structure. All of those things are what's driving it. But the churn is really -- I'm sure, has a lot to do with this great network that they're riding on. So I would suggest to you that. On the connected car, there's kind of 3 relationships I think of. When I think of that connected car on our revenue side, there's one of the wholesale relationship with the auto manufacturer/dealers, and that's the ability to deliver on-time information, real-time information to the cars or take it from the cars for whether it be design, marketing activities, analysis, upgrades to mapping, so on and so forth. That's a wholesale relationship we have with the auto manufacturers. And as we continue to develop applications and they continue to develop applications and information needs out of that process, we'll continue -- we're hopeful to continue to grow that revenue. The key to that is much of that activity can be done in off-peak hours, and so we can -- the auto manufacturers can gather their time in -- gather that data at times when it's very cost-efficient for us to do it. So we can utilize our networks when they're somewhat underutilized and they can still get really good quality data. Two, there's that ability to put it into a Mobile Share Value plan, and part of our Mobile Share Value plans is an add-on service. We're just getting started with that. We're very optimistic about the opportunities there. But quite frankly, the cars: first, we're just rolling off; and secondly, there are some promotional time and promotional activities where that capability is available before we sign them up to a retail package. So that process is just getting started. We feel very good about it and think it fits within the overall connected life strategy that our mobility team is running. And then lastly, there's a prepaid opportunity for someone who doesn't own the car but yet wants to utilize that connectivity in that car. And we are seeing some utilization of that today, and we'll continue to see that develop. We're optimistic and very jazzed up, so to speak, about the opportunities of the connected car. I would suggest to you that a company that's our scale and size, we look to this to being not only a success in today's net adds and today's relationships with our business customers, but a success going forward in revenue generation and margin generation improvement."

With regard to the data plans, we're seeing customers -- couple of things. We continue to see customers bought the bigger data plans, some of the 20-gig and bigger plans. And the unique thing that's helped our service revenues this quarter was we continued to see people do some overages. Even though we gave over -- we gave rollover out to our customers to help them manage their plans, they took advantage of it. We continue to see some over usage. So we view that as opportunity to get the customers to buy some bigger buckets and move themselves out of that stressed opportunity. But usage continues to be a positive for our revenue opportunities and continue to be something our network guys watch very closely so we keep this high-quality service. Thank you. 
Thanks, Lori. For everyone on the call, I want to thank you for being with us today. In closing, let me say this. For the last 3 years, we have laid a plan that deployed next-generation networks, that developed some innovative products and services and that has been focused on repositioning our customer base. And at the same time, we've been focused on cost management. Second quarter results show that this strategy is working. We now stand ready to continue this process with our strategic investments in spectrum and Leap in Mexico as well as our pending transaction with DIRECTV. We are ready to take advantage of our new opportunities as we transform our business and our industry. 
Thanks again for being on the call, and as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T. Have a good evening. Thank you very much."

Before we discuss the quarter, I'd like to take a moment and do a quick reset of what we have put in place at AT&T. 
With the close of our DTV acquisition, we became a unique U.S. competitor. We are the first scaled communications and video provider to offer customers fully integrated nationwide products. Our focus is on profitable growth, and we believe that we have in place the products and the platforms that will enable our success. First, you're probably familiar with our new operating segments, business solutions, entertainment and Internet services, consumer mobility and international. These segments are built on a series of investments that have set the stage for a new kind of company. Our network investments for the last 3 years is unprecedented. At a time when customers value and need connectivity more than ever, our integrated high-speed wireless and wireline IP networks are in place, ready to meet the growing data demand. We invested in a deep spectrum position when you combine the spectrum we bought in the AWS auction, along with the WCS spectrum we already own, we have 40 megahertz of spectrum in the pipeline that we can use to meet growing customer demand. Plus, we've added our spectrum from Leap. This provides an efficient way to meet the increasing demand for mobile data. We're also investing in next-generation software-defined networks. We plan to virtualize and control more than 75% of our network by 2020 using cloud infrastructure and SDN. Behind all this is our focus on profitability. Our improving margins are due in large part to our ability to reduce cost and manage our customer base, including letting our customers manage the smartphone handset cycle. Project agile savings are coming through. Automation and digital first have reduced call volumes by an average of 2 million calls a month. Simplified offers help us well. So do the simple blocking and tackling efforts of expense controls, getting it right the first time and working capital efficiencies. We're all serving smarter and growing revenues with [indiscernible] low margins businesses such as global hubbing. We have seen increasing capital efficiencies, not just with lower trailing operating expense, but also driving lower unit cost as we continue to invest in our world class networks. In effect, we are doing more for less. Our expected cost synergies from DirecTV give us even more runway to reduce costs. We are uniquely positioned as a company. No other company has the assets and capabilities in place that we do. We are confident that our investments have positioned us with a sustainable and efficient long-term leadership position. 
With that as background, let me cover our consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 4. I'll begin by reminding you that third quarter results include DIRECTV operations since our acquisition as of July 25. These results exclude the first 24 days of DIRECTV operations in July. Our financial results this quarter provide further support that our strategy is on target. Consolidated revenues, margins and adjusted earnings all delivered solid growth in the quarter, and our cash flows were exceptionally strong. In the third quarter, our adjusted EPS was $0.74. That's up nearly 14% over last year's third quarter. This includes adjustments for mostly noncash Cricket network decommissioning and DIRECTV merger-related costs. The strong growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexico Wireless operations. Consolidated revenues grew to $39.1 billion. That's up nearly 19% year-over-year, mostly due to our acquisition of DIRECTV, but we grew revenues even if you exclude DIRECTV. And again, this number does not include the first 24 days of DIRECTV revenue as we are reporting under GAAP counting. If you add those revenues to our GAAP number, consolidated revenues for the quarter would have been more than $41.2 billion. Besides DIRECTV, we also had growth from solid gains in our business solutions segments, including strategic business services and data and strong IP data revenue growth in our entertainment and Internet services segment. We also had another strong quarter generating cash. Cash from operating activities for the quarter totaled almost $11 billion, up more than 20% over last year's third quarter, and free cash flow was $5.5 billion. That brought our free cash flow dividend payout ratio to 57% for the year. And when you take a look at the last 2 quarters, you can see that we're delivering the financial results that we expected when we started to transform our business. Combine the second and third quarters and you'll see adjusted EPS up more than 12%, $20 billion of cash from operations and $10 billion of free cash flow and record mobility EBITDA service margins in each quarter. Those are the kind of financial metrics we are shooting for and we firmly believe we are positioned to keep that rolling. 
Now let's take a look at our operational highlights, starting with business solutions on Slide 5. Our business solutions segment includes both wireless and wireline results from our business customers. Mobility is the way business gets done these days and going to market with a total connectivity solution plays to the strengths of our company. We can see the benefits of this approach in this quarter. Business wireless and strategic services revenue growth more than offset declines in legacy wireline products. Wireless revenue growth was driven by gains in both wireless service and equipment revenue. Margins were an even better story. Our focus on profitable revenue growth and cutting costs from the business drove a nearly 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in EBITDA margin. Breaking this segment down further, we saw revenue growth in 3 of our 4 customer categories, enterprise, small business and the public sector. Our business wireline revenues were down due to pressure from legacy services, but we continue to see growth stabilization in our wireline data revenues. Total data revenues grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and now comprise nearly 60% of wireline business revenues. Growth in our most advanced data products is outpacing declines in legacy data services. Strategic business services revenue grew by more than 12% year-over-year. And when you adjust for foreign exchange, growth was even stronger, coming in at more than 15%. We also have improving year-over-year wireline small business trends in the last few quarters, and that continued in the third quarter. Plus, when you include mobility solutions, we actually grew small business revenues. This gives you a better idea of how our business solutions team is competing and winning. 
Mobility is just one advantage we bring to the business market. We continue to drive the fiber deeper into our wireline network. We have deployed fiber to 950,000 new business customer locations. As you can see on our business results, we're just beginning to tap this growth opportunity. Our move to software-defined network architecture is not only allowing us to add compelling new services such as NetBond and Network on Demand, but it's also helping us reduce cycle times and move to a lower-cost capital and operation structure. Network on Demand has been met with strong customer response. The product allows customers to adjust network bandwidth as needed in real time. Today, it's available in more than 170 cities, driving improvement in cycle times, and we've already signed more than 275 customer deals. Business solutions focus is making the Network on Demand, the office mobile and the cloud highly secure. That's how we're running our business and we're excited by the results. 
Now, let me talk about our entertainment and Internet solutions results on Slide 6. This is basically our former consumer wireline business and the DIRECTV U.S. operations. Even though we had DIRECTV only for part of the quarter, the results reflect the growing revenue and increased profitability that we expect to receive. Reported revenue almost doubled year-over-year, and even more dramatic was the improvement in margins. Our EBITDA margins came in at more than 22%. That's up more than 800 basis points year-over-year. Essentially, we have converted our quality video business with limited scale into an industry leader, earning solid margins for our DIRECTV acquisition. And we think there's plenty of room to improve even more with the expected cost synergies from the DTV deal. During the past few weeks, we have reached a multiyear agreement with Viacom for U-verse and DIRECTV subscribers, and we believe we're in a path for the best content pricing going forward. Our approach is to develop a win-win situation for both us and the content providers and encourage them to look at our wireless and broadband assets to widen their distributions. Early results have been promising. We're also seeing some early success on the revenue synergies. For example, we are selling DIRECTV in virtually all our 2,200 company-owned stores. The next step is launching certified dealers and online as well as ramping up sales in our call centers. It's starting to make an impact. DIRECTV net adds picked up shortly after the deal closed and were solid throughout the rest of the quarter. That drove 26,000 satellite [ph] net adds post deal close. We now have more than 25 million video subscribers in the U.S. It's important that we do this right coming out of the gate. We've been holding back much of our cross-selling promotions as we train service reps and technicians for our premium single service experience so we will see the benefit of those strategies impact future quarters. As expected, U.S. video subscribers declined in the quarter. Net adds dropped with fewer promotions and shifting our focus to the lower content cost DIRECTV platform. We added 192,000 IP broadband customers in the quarter as migrations from our DSL base continued to slow. U-verse video losses also put some pressure on broadband numbers due to their high attachment rates, but we are confident we can work through this as our single service experience for broadband and satellite is rolled out. As we said, it's early in our integration of DIRECTV. We don't even have a full quarter of results, yet our integration efforts are on or ahead of targets and early results indicate this deal will prove to be everything we thought it would be and more. 
Now let's move to our mobility results on Slide 7. AT&T Mobility operations are now divided between the business solutions and the customer wireless segment. That information is in the investor briefing and staff profile. For comparison purposes, the company is also providing supplemental information for its total domestic wireless operations. 
Let's start first with the total domestic wireless operations financials. We have a compelling value proposition, great network, superior customer service and fair pricing. All of these sometimes get lost in the competitive noise. Our focus is to bring the best customer experience while increasing profitability and not just chase customer accounts. Our third quarter results drive that point home. We had our highest ever wireless service EBITDA margins at 49.4%. Our consumer mobility business helped drive that service margins of more than 50%. AT&T Next sales are a big part of that success, but we also have been very aggressive in taking costs out of the business and increasing efficiencies in our Cricket operations. Total wireless revenues were flat year-over-year. Lower year-over-year smartphone upgrade volumes impacted equipment revenues and Mobile Share Value plans did the same to service revenues. As expected, with most of the conversion to Mobile Share Value plans behind us, we saw increasing stability with our service revenues, which were essentially flat to the second quarter levels. We also continue to see steady growth of AT&T Next and Mobile Share Value plans. About 2/3 of our postpaid smartphone base is on no subsidy pricing with more than 40% on Next. That gives us substantial opportunity to continue to grow equipment revenue as these customers upgrade their smartphones. For the quarter, nearly 80% of the smartphone sales were on Next or BYOD. We also continue to see growing phone only ARPU plus Next, which increased by nearly 5% year-over-year. We also turned in another strong net add quarter as postpaid tablets, Cricket and the connected car drove our highest net adds in nearly 5 years. Those details are on Slide 8. Total net adds came in at 2.5 million as we continue to see the impact of our Cricket acquisition and connected car strategy. The company added 289,000 postpaid subscribers with about 620,000 tablets and computing devices. We also had a record 1.6 million connected device net adds. Most of these were connected cars where we added about 1 million. Or perhaps the biggest story in the quarter had to be our continued strength in premium prepaid. This has been a remarkable turnaround story for us. We added 466,000 prepaid voice subscribers in the quarter after losing subscribers in the year-ago third quarter. These subscriber gains came from both Cricket and our GoPhone products. We also completed our Cricket network conversion in the quarter. We are seeing Cricket deliver great ARPUs. In fact, the ARPU from Cricket smartphones net adds is nearly $10 more than our postpaid feature phone ARPU losses. We continue to grow our branded smartphone base. We added 1 million in the quarter. Branded voice subscribers were also positive in the quarter. Total churn was down year-over-year, thanks to lower prepaid churn, even with shutting down the Cricket network. Postpaid churn for the quarter was up year-over-year as we focus on higher value subscribers. However, year-to-date postpaid churn is running at 1.06%, just slightly higher than last year's best ever full year churn of 1.04%. 
Here's another way to look at churn. We are adding premium prepaid subscribers whose ARPU is higher and subsidy costs are lower than postpaid feature phone subscribers who have the highest postpaid churn. And our success in the prepaid market is resulting in improvement in total churn. Cricket gives us a quality prepaid offering for the more value conscious customer. Same great network, quality customer service and the flexibility prepaid delivers with subscriber acquisition costs that are much lower than the postpaid voice. 
Now let's look at our international operations. That information is on Slide 9. Our international segment provides wireless services in Mexico and satellite entertainment services in Latin America. Let's start with Mexico. 
We are taking the first steps in our investment cycle in Mexico and pushing hard to replicate the same great 4G LTE network experience there that we have in the United States. So far, we're making great progress. By the end of the third quarter, we've already covered about 29 million people with our 4G LTE network. And as of today, we now cover more than 30 million. This puts us on plan to reach 40 million by the end of the year and provide a high-quality platform to sell on. Mexico's financials reflect our network investment and the work being done to bring and Nextel's operations together. This is the heavy lifting of the wireless business, but we've done it before and we're confident we can do it again successfully. We're also confident that we will grow market share. We have a great leadership team in place and a solid plan, not only we deploy the highest quality network, but deliver a superb customer experience as well. It's a great opportunity and the potential synergies over 400 million pop North American calling area make it even better than we first imagined. Our Latin American DIRECTV operations are showing solid growth on a local currency basis, but foreign exchange rates, including our decision to adapt the [indiscernible] rate in Venezuela are pressuring our results. Revenues, ARPUs and margins are all pressured by FX and subscribers also being hampered by challenging economies in the region. But importantly, our Latin American businesses have cash flows that allow us the opportunity to better position our operations. We'll continue to work through these headwinds and work at operational efficiencies in Latin America. 
Now let's move to consolidated margins on Slide 10. Our focus on profitable growth is clearly seen in our consolidated margins. Adjusted consolidated operating margins came in at 20.3% in the quarter. This was a dramatic improvement over the year-ago third quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin was nearly 200 basis points higher than a year ago. There were several reasons for this improvement. First, the DIRECTV acquisition increased the profitability of our pay-TV business, but just as important was our focused sales approach in wireless and U-verse video. Project Agile savings also are coming in ahead of plan. Our simplified offers and increased efforts to take care of customers on the first call has produced results. Call volumes of our mobility centers continue to drop down an average of 2 million calls a month when compared to the year-ago third quarter. We also have been highly effective with our cost optimization efforts. That has helped drive down costs for excess and in our supply chain. We're also keeping an eye on the force by many minimizing outsourcing expenses. Overall force has been managed through voluntary retirement programs, normal attritions and normal reductions in operations. Trailing operating expenses from capital investments also were down year-over-year. We also are highly efficient with our capital spending and unit costs are decreasing, essentially doing more for less. All of these adds up, and DIRECTV gives us an update to expand margins. We have our target to get to $2.5 billion or more in savings. We already are realizing some of that in our content and supply relationships. We really like our momentum here, and we are confident we can continue to expand margins and cut costs even with pressure from our international operations. We also believe healthy cash flows are fundamental to our success. 
Let's look at Slide 11 for those details. We continue to execute and deliver strong cash flows. In fact, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance for the year. In the third quarter, cash from operations totaled $10.8 billion. That's our best cash generation in 12 quarters, and we generated $26.7 billion in cash year-to-date. Capital expenditures totaled $5.3 billion, about the same as last year's third quarter. Free cash flow was $5.5 billion and $12.8 billion year-to-date. In terms of uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.4 billion, which gives us a dividend payout ratio of 44% for the quarter and 57% for the full year. Our net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio was 2.28, which was better than our original expectation. Our focus is on maintaining a strong balance sheet. We paid down more than $5 billion in debt early and we still have more than $6 billion of cash on hand. These strong cash flows are fundamental part of our business. This gives us the financial strength to invest in our business, reduce debt and return substantial value to our shareholders. 
Now let me take a -- now let me close with a quick summary and updated guidance on Slide 12 before we get to your questions. First, let's address guidance. We are increasing our full year EPS outlook to the 2 68 to 2 74 range. We also now expect free cash flow to be in the $15 billion range or better this year. All other full year guidance is reaffirmed. Our focus on profitability is a big reason we're able to do this. In the quarter, we saw growing revenues, expanding margins and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. But just as important is our ability to generate cash from our business. Cash from operations was strong and free cash flow gave us excellent dividend coverage. We are seeing positive signs in our largest segment, business solutions. Customers appreciate our integrated solutions approach and are migrating to our newest software-defined network services. We also saw our highest ever wireless service EBITDA margins with an incredible turnaround story in prepaid unfolding. And we closed the DTV acquisition in the third quarter and integration process is on target and positioned to exceed expectations. This is an exciting time for us we believe we have the pieces in place to redefine our business in our industry. 
With that, I will turn it back to Mike so we can get your questions."

So we've been putting them to through a training program and we expect the rollout in the fully trained on installing satellite in the home in probably November or so, the early part of November, such that we will then be able to sell a single truck roll installation for broadband and video. We're very excited about that. It'll be a measured approach. We're going to have -- we will have everybody trained on the first day, but we're excited about what that will bring.

And it's driven by, I think, savings across the board, whether it's a lower number of calls into the call centers, whether it's really top-notch performance of our digital first initiatives, whether it's the streamlining of our installation process through our -- what we call Project Halo or high automation low overhead process, whether the Software Defined Networks. All of those things just blocking and tackling and taking calls into the call centers and getting answers right the first time. All of those things, all of those things are driving cost savings. And we have seen some better performance. as I mentioned, and our business solutions, our business solutions team is really doing well in a tough economy, particularly in the enterprise and the public sector space, but really well in the small business space, and that gives us optimism. So we mentioned with wireless, you are seeing growth in those -- in that area, but we are seeing the acceptance of our Network on Demand, our NetBond, our Software Defined Networks all moving customers in a positive direction. So it's all of those things giving us optimism for the fourth quarter. With that being said, certainly, wireless and it's performance goes without question that is helping drive earnings performance."

Secondly, with the rollout this quarter of the, if you will, one truck roll or single service experience where we can install TV and broadband at the same time, we not only expect the satellite-TV to pick up, but we also expect the broadband, IP broadband, to pick up because people buy those things together.

Additionally, in this quarter, I want to point out we had about $0.01 of help from the cap [ph] funding activity that went on and what we applied for. By the same token, we had about $0.01 [indiscernible] pressure from the Mexico operations that we had last year. And when we look at our income tax expense, but for the -- setting aside anything that we traded otherwise, there's about $0.02 of income tax pressure, EPS pressure from income taxes. So when you look at the fulfillment accounting and the other kind of unique items that occurred, they kind of balance off with the [indiscernible] funding and fulfillment accounting generating about $0.03 of benefit in Mexico and the income tax is generating about $0.03 of pressure.

So we try to be very upfront with regard to our financial presentation. So hopefully, we've been successful at that, but we try to do that to make sure you had that information. Two, I would suggest to you that if you look at margins and EBITDAs and probabilities are -- they are certainly different, but they're not materially different. They don't significantly skew one way or the other. So I just -- I make that observation for you. With regard to how you model, I leave that to you guys. Finally, I can tell you the way we focus though is what the business relationships were selling and what our consumer relationships were selling, and that's how we focus on it. But I think the information is there to do it either way. I think it's going to be a matter of what you're most comfortable with. As we go forward and we see the platform we built with connected devices, show -- start showing more growth even than it already has, it'll be beneficial for everyone to have this split. 
With regard to CapEx, I'm not going to get into specific dollars on a quarterly basis, but I'll give you these insights. On DTV Latin America, our Latin American properties, I would expect that they will be generally self-sufficient, that the cash flows that they generate will be self-sufficient to cover their CapEx needs. I would suggest to you, if we have customer growth opportunities, we'll be prudent about that to make sure that we don't miss out on good customer. But generally speaking, it's going to be self-sufficient from a cash perspective. On Mexico, I would suggest to you that the $3 billion we announced some months ago with regard to the buildout, it's still a good number. We start on that process. I won't tell you that every POP, every 4G LTE POP cost the same amount to create. Some of the networks were more advanced in so some of the earlier achievement may be at a more efficient cost unit cost. But I would suggest to you the $3 billion is still a good number. And then we'll continue to invest, albeit at a slower rate because we've built the platforms out. We'll continue to invest in fiber, in wireless capacity and in success base capital for satellite video product, much of the same way you would've seen us in the past, taking into account the fact that the ramp-up in CapEx for the IP is now behind us. We've got -- we're 950,000 business customer locations passed with fiber. We committed to a million. We'll get to the million, but that's the only piece that isn't done."

But quite frankly, right now, our customers seem quite pleased with the installment program and simply put, they seem to like it because at the end of the term, they own the phone and the phones have continued use and functionality for them and they continue to use that. And to some extent, we're saying that from -- we're seeing side of that from this continued use of Bring Your Own Device activities in our company where people are bringing in devices that they already own and hooking up during network. But from a company perspective, it's more of a decision, and Ralph and Wendler and team follow really closely. It's more about what the customers want. And if we see that the customers are going to want that program, we're certainly consider. We certainly have the capability to do it. But right now, what we believe customer satisfaction comes from that ability to own the phone at the end of that I would term and the feel comfortable about that. And what finally, the difference in price, I don't think is measurable from the least of the depending upon what situation you have, but when you get down to the real cause of it, it seems like it's worth that well for us by doing installment plan."

On the value side, the customers, it's more about being able to provide investors the full scope customer experience and take care of all things. That's what we're concerned about. From a perspective of the -- if they buy the phone somewhere else and bring it to us, we're thrilled with serving them that way. We don't have the cost of handling the phone or we don't, quite frankly, can have the cost of financing the phone on the installed plan or through a subsidized program. So we're open to it. Right now, one of the equipment installment program that Apple has, in a sense as a high number of phones through that program, and that's why we love to serve our customers that way and that's how they choose to buy their phones Apple and Apple finance system. That's something we can work with. It's really more about what does the customer wanted and how do we make sure we keep -- we provide choices and services to make it easy for our customers. 
With regard to our broadband trends, and specifically in DSL, the first comment I'd make is over the last few years, the real trend has been the migration from DSL to IP broadband, and it's been something that we've encouraged ourselves and we're beginning to complete that process or near completion where the DSL customers we have left is a much lower percentage than have IP broadband capabilities from us. So we are through that migration process. And then secondly, they don't have television in these areas or I should say, we didn't have a video offering, at least we're generally out of the U-verse footprint. But now we do and now we'll be able to provide them a video offering through DIRECTV, and we are very pleased with that. So we are hopeful that now this nationwide video service will help us improving our overall broadband positioning, but particularly, our U-verse broadband footprint there we had the higher speeds where customers generally buy video and broadband together, we now can sell that together. So that's how we're thinking about that. That's how we look to it. But I tell you, on the consumer side, we're down into the 2 million range on total DSL customers. That's basic number step profile, but I would suggest to you, it has changed dramatically over the course of 4, 5 years where it used to be 90% plus of our broadband base and now it's a much lower percentage. So we've gone through that migration. Not completely, but almost completely."

Before we discuss the quarter, I'd like to take a moment and do a quick reset of what we have put in place at AT&T. 
With the close of our DTV acquisition, we became a unique U.S. competitor. We are the first scaled communications and video provider to offer customers fully-integrated nationwide products. Our focus is on profitable growth and we believe that we have in place the products and the platforms that will enable our success. First, you're probably familiar with our new operating segments, business solutions, entertainment and Internet services, consumer mobility and international. These segments are built on a series of investments that have set the stage for a new kind of company. Our network investments for the last 3 years is unprecedented. At a time when customers value and need connectivity more than ever, our integrated high-speed wireless and wireline IP networks are in place, ready to meet the growing data demand. We invested in a deep spectrum position. When you combine the spectrum we bought in the AWS auction, along with the WCS spectrum we already own, we have 40 megahertz of spectrum in the pipeline that we can use to meet growing customer demand. Plus, we've added our spectrum from Leap. This provides an efficient way to meet the increasing demand for mobile data. We're also investing in next-generation software-defined networks. We plan to virtualize and control more than 75% of our network by 2020, using cloud infrastructure and SDN. Behind all this is our focus on profitability. Our improving margins are due in large part to our ability to reduce cost and manage our customer base, including letting our customers manage the smartphone handset cycle. Project Agile savings are coming through. Automation and digital-first have reduced customer call volumes by an average of 2 million calls a month. Simplified offers help us well, so do the simple blocking and tackling efforts of expense controls, getting it right the first time and working capital efficiencies. We also are being smarter and growing revenues. We've exited some low margins businesses such as global hubbing. We have seen increasing capital efficiencies, not just with lower trailing operating expense but also driving lower unit cost as we continue to invest in our world class networks. In effect, we are doing more for less, and our expected cost synergies from DirecTV give us even more runway to reduce costs. We are uniquely positioned as a company. No other company has the assets and capabilities in place that we do. We are confident that our investments have positioned us with a sustainable and efficient long-term leadership position. 
With that as background, let me cover our consolidated financial summary which is on Slide 4. I'll begin by reminding you that third quarter results include DIRECTV operations since our acquisition as of July 25. These results exclude the first 24 days of DIRECTV operations in July. Our financial results this quarter provide further support that our strategy is on target. Consolidated revenues, margins and adjusted earnings all delivered solid growth in the quarter, and our cash flows were exceptionally strong. In the third quarter, our adjusted EPS was $0.74, that's up nearly 14% over last year's third quarter. This includes adjustments for mostly noncash Cricket network decommissioning and DIRECTV merger-related costs. The strong growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexico Wireless operations. Consolidated revenues grew to $39.1 billion, that's up nearly 19% year-over-year, mostly due to our acquisition of DIRECTV, but we grew revenues even if you exclude DIRECTV. And again, this number does not include the first 24 days of DIRECTV revenue as we are reporting under GAAP counting. If you add those revenues to our GAAP number, consolidated revenues for the quarter would have been more than $41.2 billion. Besides DIRECTV, we also had growth from solid gains in our business solutions segment, including strategic business services and data and strong IP data revenue growth in our entertainment and Internet services segment. We also had another strong quarter generating cash. Cash from operating activities for the quarter totaled almost $11 billion, up more than 20% over last year's third quarter, and free cash flow was $5.5 billion. That brought our free cash flow dividend payout ratio to 57% for the year. And when you take a look at the last 2 quarters, you can see that we're delivering the financial results that we expected when we started to transform our business. Combine the second and third quarters and you'll see adjusted EPS up more than 12%, $20 billion of cash from operations and $10 billion of free cash flow and record mobility EBITDA service margins in each quarter. Those are the kind of financial metrics we are shooting for and we firmly believe we are positioned to keep that rolling. 
Now let's take a look at our operational highlights, starting with business solutions on Slide 5. Our business solutions segment includes both wireless and wireline results from our business customers. Mobility is the way business gets done these days and going to market with a total connectivity solution plays to the strengths of our company. We can see the benefits of this approach in this quarter. Business wireless and strategic services revenue growth more than offset declines in legacy wireline products. Wireless revenue growth was driven by gains in both wireless service and equipment revenue. Margins were an even better story. Our focus on profitable revenue growth and cutting costs from the business drove a nearly 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in EBITDA margin. Breaking this segment down further, we saw revenue growth in 3 of our 4 customer categories: enterprise, small business and the public sector. Our business wireline revenues were down due to pressure from legacy services, but we continue to see growth stabilization in our wireline data revenues. Total data revenues grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and now comprise nearly 60% of wireline business revenues. Growth in our most advanced data products is outpacing declines in legacy data services. Strategic business services revenue grew by more than 12% year-over-year. And when you adjust for foreign exchange, growth was even stronger, coming in at more than 15%. We also have improving year-over-year wireline small business trends in the last few quarters, and that continued in the third quarter. Plus, when you include mobility solutions, we actually grew small business revenues. This gives you a better idea of how our business solutions team is competing and winning. 
Mobility is just one advantage we bring to the business market. We continue to drive fiber deeper into our wireline network. We have deployed fiber to 950,000 new business customer locations. As you can see on our business results, we're just beginning to tap this growth opportunity. Our move to software-defined network architecture is not only allowing us to add compelling new services such as NetBond and Network on Demand, but it's also helping us reduce cycle times and move to a lower-cost capital and operation structure. Network on Demand has been met with strong customer response. The product allows customers to adjust network bandwidth as needed in real time. Today, it's available in more than 170 cities, driving improvement in cycle times, and we've already signed more than 275 customer deals. Business solutions focus is making the Network on Demand, the office mobile and the cloud highly secure. That's how we're running our business and we are excited by the results. 
Now, let me talk about our entertainment and Internet solutions results on Slide 6. This is basically our former consumer wireline business and the DIRECTV U.S. operations. Even though we had DIRECTV only for part of the quarter, the results reflect the growing revenue and increased profitability that we expect to receive. Reported revenue almost doubled year-over-year, but even more dramatic was the improvement in margins. Our EBITDA margins came in at more than 22%, that's up more than 800 basis points year-over-year. Essentially, we have converted our quality video business with limited scale into an industry leader, earning solid margins through our DIRECTV acquisition. And we think there's plenty of room to improve, even more with the expected cost synergies from the DTV deal. During the past few weeks, we have reached a multiyear agreement with Viacom for U-verse and DIRECTV subscribers, and we believe we are in a path for the best content pricing going forward. Our approach is to develop a win-win situation for both us and the content providers and encourage them to look at our wireless and broadband assets to widen their distributions. Early results have been promising. We're also seeing some early success on the revenue synergies. For example, we are selling DIRECTV in virtually all our 2,200 company-owned stores. The next step is launching certified dealers and online as well as ramping up sales in our call centers. It's starting to make an impact. DIRECTV net adds picked up shortly after the deal closed and were solid throughout the rest of the quarter. That drove 26,000 satellite net adds post deal close. We now have more than 25 million video subscribers in the U.S. It's important that we do this right coming out of the gate. We've been holding back much of our cross-selling promotions as we train service reps and technicians for our premium, single service experience, so we will see the benefit of those strategies impact future quarters. As expected, U-verse video subscribers declined in the quarter. Net adds dropped with fewer promotions and shifting our focus to the lower content cost DIRECTV platform. We added 192,000 IP broadband customers in the quarter as migrations from our DSL base continued to slow. U-verse video losses also put some pressure on broadband numbers due to our high attachment rates, but we are confident we can work through this as our single service experience for broadband and satellite is rolled out. As we said, it's early in our integration of DIRECTV. We don't even have a full quarter of results, yet our integration efforts are on or ahead of target and early results indicate this deal will prove to be everything we thought it would be and more. 
Now let's move to our mobility results on Slide 7. AT&T Mobility operations are now divided between the business solutions and the customer wireless segment. That information is in the investor briefing and staff profile. For comparison purposes, the company is also providing supplemental information for its total domestic wireless operations. 
Let's start first with the total domestic wireless operations financials. We have a compelling value proposition, great network, superior customer service and fair pricing. All this sometimes get lost in the competitive noise. Our focus is to provide the best customer experience while increasing profitability and not just chase customer counts. Our third quarter results drive that point home. We had our highest ever wireless service EBITDA margins at 49.4%. Our consumer mobility business helped drive the service margins of more than 50%. AT&T Next sales are a big part of that success but we also have been very aggressive in taking costs out of the business and increasing efficiencies in our Cricket operations. Total wireless revenues were flat year-over-year. Lower year-over-year smartphone upgrade volumes impacted equipment revenues and Mobile Share Value plans did the same to service revenues. As expected, with most of the conversion to Mobile Share Value plans behind us, we saw increasing stability with our service revenues which were essentially flat with second quarter levels. We also continue to see steady growth of AT&T Next and Mobile Share Value plans. About 2/3 of our postpaid smartphone base is on no subsidy pricing with more than 40% on Next. That gives us substantial opportunity to continue to grow equipment revenue as these customers upgrade their smartphones. For the quarter, nearly 80% of the smartphone sales were on Next or BYOD. We also continue to see growing phone only ARPU plus Next which increased by nearly 5% year-over-year. We also turned in another strong net add quarter as postpaid tablets, Cricket and the connected car drove our highest net adds in nearly 5 years. Those details are on Slide 8. Total net adds came in at 2.5 million as we continue to see the impact of our Cricket acquisition and connected car strategy. The company added 289,000 postpaid subscribers with about 620,000 tablets and computing devices. We also had a record of 1.6 million connected device net adds. Most of these were connected cars where we added about 1 million. Or perhaps the biggest story in the quarter had to be our continued strength in premium prepaid. This has been a remarkable turnaround story for us. We added 466,000 prepaid voice subscribers in the quarter after losing subscribers in the year-ago third quarter. These subscriber gains came from both Cricket and our GoPhone products. We also completed our Cricket network conversion in the quarter. We are seeing Cricket deliver great ARPUs. In fact, the ARPU from Cricket smartphones net adds is nearly $10 more than our postpaid feature phone ARPU losses. We continue to grow our branded smartphone base. We added 1 million in the quarter. Branded voice subscribers were also positive in the quarter. Total churn was down year-over-year, thanks to lower prepaid churn, even with shutting down the Cricket network. Postpaid churn for the quarter was up year-over-year as we focused on higher value subscribers. However, year-to-date postpaid churn is running at 1.06%, just slightly higher than last year's best ever full year churn of 1.04%. 
Here's another way to look at churn. We are adding premium prepaid subscribers whose ARPU is higher and subsidy costs are lower than postpaid feature phone subscribers who have the highest postpaid churn. And our success in the prepaid market is resulting in improvement in total churn. Cricket gives us a quality prepaid offering for the more value-conscious customer. Same great network, quality customer service and the flexibility prepaid delivers with subscriber acquisition costs that are much lower than our postpaid voice. 
Now let's look at our international operations. That information is on Slide 9. Our international segment provides wireless services in Mexico and satellite entertainment services in Latin America. Let's start with Mexico. 
We are taking the first steps in our investment cycle in Mexico and pushing hard to replicate the same great 4G LTE network experience there that we have in the United States. So far, we're making great progress. By the end of the third quarter, we've already covered about 29 million people with our 4G LTE network. And as of today, we now cover more than 30 million. This puts us on plan to reach 40 million by the end of the year and provide a high-quality platform to sell on. Mexico's financials reflect our network investment and the work being done to bring Iusacell and Nextel's operations together. This is the heavy lifting of the wireless business but we have done it before and we're confident we can do it again successfully. We're also confident that we will grow market share. We have a great leadership team in place and a solid plan, not only to deploy the highest quality network but deliver a superb customer experience as well. It's a great opportunity and the potential synergies of our 400 million top North American calling area make it even better than we first imagined. Our Latin American DIRECTV operations are showing solid growth on a local currency basis but foreign exchange rates, including our decision to adopt the Somali rate in Venezuela are pressuring our results. Revenues, ARPUs and margins are all pressured by FX and subscribers are also being hampered by challenging economies in the region. But importantly, our Latin American businesses have cash flows that allow us the opportunity to better position our operations. We'll continue to work through these headwinds and work at operational efficiencies in Latin America. 
Now let's move to consolidated margins on Slide 10. Our focus on profitable growth is clearly seen in our consolidated margins. Adjusted consolidated operating margins came in at 20.3% in the quarter. This was a dramatic improvement over the year-ago third quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin was nearly 200 basis points higher than a year ago. There were several reasons for this improvement. First, the DIRECTV acquisition increased the profitability of our pay-TV business, but just as important was our focused sales approach in wireless and U-verse video. Project Agile savings also are coming in ahead of plan. Our simplified offers and increased efforts to take care of customers on the first call has produced results. Call volumes in our mobility centers continue to drop down an average of 2 million calls a month when compared to the year-ago third quarter. We also have been highly effective with our cost optimization efforts. That has helped drive down costs for excess and in our supply chain. We're also keeping an eye on the force by many minimizing outsourcing expenses. Overall force has been managed through voluntary retirement programs, normal attritions and normal reductions in operations. Trailing operating expenses from capital investments also were down year-over-year. We also have been highly efficient with our capital spending and unit costs are decreasing, essentially doing more for less. All this adds up and DIRECTV gives us an opportunity to expand margins. We have our target to get to $2.5 billion or more in savings. We already are realizing some of that in our content and supply relationships. We really like our momentum here and we are confident we can continue to expand margins and cut costs, even with pressure from our international operations. We also believe healthy cash flows are fundamental to our success. 
Let's look at Slide 11 for those details. We continue to execute and deliver strong cash flows. In fact, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance for the year. In the third quarter, cash from operations totaled $10.8 billion, that's our best cash generation in 12 quarters, and we generated $26.7 billion in cash year-to-date. Capital expenditures totaled $5.3 billion, about the same as last year's third quarter. Free cash flow was $5.5 billion and $12.8 billion year-to-date. In terms of uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.4 billion which gives us a dividend payout ratio of 44% for the quarter and 57% for the full year. Our net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio was 2.28 which was better than our original expectation. Our focus is on maintaining a strong balance sheet. We paid down more than $5 billion in debt early and we still have more than $6 billion of cash on hand. These strong cash flows are a fundamental part of our business. This gives us the financial strength to invest in our business, reduce debt and return substantial value to our shareholders. 
Now let me take a close -- now let me close with a quick summary and updated guidance on Slide 12 before we get to your questions. First, let's address guidance. We are increasing our full year EPS outlook to the $2.68 to $2.74 range. We also now expect free cash flow to be in the $15 billion range or better this year. All other full year guidance is reaffirmed. Our focus on profitability is a big reason we're able to do this. In the quarter, we saw growing revenues, expanding margins and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. But just as important was our ability to generate cash from our business. Cash from operations was strong and free cash flow gave us excellent dividend coverage. We are seeing positive signs at our largest segment, business solutions. Customers appreciate our integrated solutions approach and are migrating to our newest software-defined network services. We also saw our highest ever wireless service EBITDA margins, with an incredible turnaround story in prepaid unfolding. And we closed the DTV acquisition in the third quarter and the integration process is on target and positioned to exceed expectations. This is an exciting time for us. We believe we have the pieces in place to redefine our business in our industry. 
With that, I will turn it back to Mike so we can get your questions."

A couple of things, one, there's always some seasonality in the fourth quarter with the holiday sales at our wireless business with purchase of handsets and so forth. So there's always some seasonality. As you would find also with our wireline which is a large business segment. Also, we generally have larger tax payments at the end of the year than we do early on. So those are the things that are impacting us. But I would tell you, if you do kind of a year-over-year comparison where we're at and what we're projecting with regard to the $15 billion range or better, I think you'll see that we're continuing to have really good cash flows throughout the rest of this year. Secondly, with regard to future years, we would stand by what we've said earlier, that is that we expect free cash flow to provide us with a dividend payout ratio that's in the 70s. We're not moving away from that. We're not shying away from that at all and expect that to continue to be the case. We're certainly proud of these results and glad that we exceeded what we had promised, but we're going to be careful and prudent in predicting our results as we go forward. But we're really excited about where we stand in the future cash generation of this business."

Let me take that quickly. First of all, the first revenue synergy that we've really gone after and we've seen good success and quite frankly, we're very excited about the results is in the cross-selling of DIRECTV or the satellite products in our company-owned stores. We have about 2,300 company-owned stores and virtually all of them are actively selling DIRECTV now. And some of them never sold a video product before, so it was -- we had to do some training and some learning. But what we found is we came through the quarter, we were able to sell more and more out of those stores and we got very optimistic

service those customers on an integrated basis and we're moving forward. We're starting to sell that we're -- based on the really great news we saw from the retail chain, we're really optimistic about seeing those sales results unfold in the fourth quarter and next year. Last thing is our service technicians have been installing broadband for us or U-verse for us, but they ended installing DIRECTV. So we've been putting them to through a training program and we're expecting that to rollout, the first set of technicians to roll out after fully training on installing satellite in the home in probably November or so, early part of November, such that we will then be able to sell a single truck roll installation for broadband and video. We're very excited about that. It'll be a measured approach. We're going to have to -- we don't have everybody trained on the first day but we're excited about what that will bring. I think that will bring not only good performance in the fourth quarter but quite frankly, really look forward to that kind of performance, positive performance and impact next year. So that's kind of the way we're thinking about some of those things, Amir."

Additionally, in this quarter, I want to point out we had about $0.01 of help from the CAF funding activity that went on and what we applied for. By the same token, we had about $0.01 of hurt or pressure from the Mexico operations that we didn't have last year. And if you look at our income tax expense but for the -- setting aside anything that we traded otherwise, there's about $0.02 of income tax pressure, EPS pressure from income taxes. So when you look at the fulfillment accounting and the other kind of unique items that occurred, they kind of balanced off with the CAF funding and fulfillment accounting, generating about $0.03 of benefit in Mexico and the income tax is generating about $0.03 of pressure.

100231,311894007,880619,"AT&T, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,"Earnings Calls","AT&T Inc.","Executives","Yes, so a couple of things. One, David, for investors and analysts, we provided total wireless and then provided the consumer wireless, the ability to get to the business wireless. So we try to be very upfront with regard to our financial presentation. So",484,"Yes, so a couple of things. One, David, for investors and analysts, we provided total wireless and then provided the consumer wireless, the ability to get to the business wireless. So we try to be very upfront with regard to our financial presentation. So hopefully, we've been successful at that, but we try to do that to make sure you had that information. Two, I would suggest even as you look at it, the margins and EBITDAs and profitabilities are -- they are certainly different but they're not materially different. They don't significantly skew one way or the other. So I just -- I'd make that observation for you. With regard to how you model, I'll leave that to you guys, modeling. I can tell you the way we focus though is what the business relationships we're selling and what are consumer relationships we're selling, and that's how we focus on it. But I think the information is there to do it either way and I think it's going to be a matter of what you're most comfortable with. As we go forward and we see the platform we built with connected devices, show -- start showing more growth even than it already has, it'll be beneficial for everyone to have this split. 
With regard to CapEx, I won't get into specific dollars on a quarterly basis but I'll give you these insights. On DTV Latin America, our Latin American properties, I would expect that they will be generally self-sufficient, that the cash flows that they generate will be self-sufficient to cover their CapEx needs. I would suggest to you, if we have customer growth opportunities, we'll be prudent about that to make sure that we don't miss out on good customers. But generally speaking, it's going to be self-sufficient from a cash perspective. On Mexico, I would suggest to you that the $3 billion we announced some months ago with regard to the buildout, it's still a good number. We started on that process. I won't tell you that every POP, every 4G LTE POP costs the same amount to create. Some of the networks were more advanced and so some of the earlier achievement may be at a more efficient cost, unit cost. But I would suggest to you, the $3 billion is still a good number. And then we'll continue to invest, albeit at a slower rate because we've built the platforms out. We'll continue to invest in fiber, in wireless capacity and in success based capital for our satellite video product, much in the same way you would've seen us in the past, taking into account the fact that the ramp-up in CapEx for the VIP is now behind us. We've got -- we're 950,000 business customer locations pass through fiber. We're committed to 1 million, we'll get to the 1 million, so that's the only piece that isn't done."

Secondly, I would leave it -- Jeff, I would leave it to you guys to talk about it or to decide whether others in the industry are taking this approach. It appears to us from where we see customers moving around, that some of the other carriers are not taking the same approach and they're focused more on customer counts than they are necessarily on the profitability of the customers. But I think you would be the better judge of figuring that out. And I say that based on the offers I see that we are dealing with in the noise in the market. On the $2.5 billion, I think first and foremost, you'll see it in our results. But with regard to updating you, I think we'll continue to update you on the process like we did -- like we've done today where we've talked about how the retail stores are generating sales, exceeding our expectations, how the single truck roll is going to start rolling out in November, those kinds of things. And I think you'll see us also update you like we did with the Viacom announcement where we basically said that we're going to get best in the industry pricing for our platform. And so that would imply that we are getting to and -- getting to or meeting or exceeding our synergy targets. With regard to specifically reporting on the $2.5 billion number, I don't expect to be doing that in this -- the rest of this year or early next year because we are still in the midst of really getting it done, and we're more focused on getting it done than we are on reporting out on what it is."

But quite frankly, right now, our customers seem quite pleased with the installment program and simply put, they seem to like it because at the end of their term, they own the phone. And the phones have continued use and functionality for them and they continue to use that. And to some extent, we're seeing that from a -- we're seeing a side of that from this continued use of Bring Your Own Device activities in our company where people are bringing in devices that they already own and hooking them up to our network. But from a company perspective, it's more of a decision and Ralph de la Vega and Glenn Lurie and the team follow it really closely. It's more about what the customers want. And if we see that the customers are going to want that program, we'll certainly consider and we still have the capability to do it. But right now, what we believe is the customer's satisfaction comes from that ability to own the phone at the end of that agreed term and they feel real comfortable about that.

On the value side, the customers, it's more about being able to provide in the stores, the full scope customer experience and take care of all of these. That's what we're concerned about. From a perspective of the -- if they buy the phone somewhere else and bring it to us, we're thrilled with serving them in that way. We don't have the cost of handling the phone or we don't, quite frankly, have the cost of financing the phone here on an installment plan or through a subsidized program. So we're open to it. Right now, under the equipment installment program that Apple has, they sent us a high number of phones through that program, and that's fine, we'd love to serve our customers that way. And if that's how they choose to buy their phones through Apple and Apple finances system, that's something we can definitely work with. So that's -- it's really more about what does the customer want and how do we make sure we keep -- we provide choices and services to make it easy for our customers. 
With regard to our broadband trends and specifically in DSL, the first comment I'd make is over the last few years, the real trend has been the migration from DSL to IP broadband. And that's been something that we've encouraged ourselves and we're beginning to complete that process or near completion where the DSL customers we have left is a much lower percentage than have IP broadband capabilities from us. So we are through that migration process. And then secondly, they don't have television in these areas or I should say, we didn't have a video offering. At least we're generally out of the U-verse footprint but now, we do. And now, we'll be able to provide them a video offering through DIRECTV and we're very pleased with that. So we are hopeful that now, this nationwide video service will help us in improving our overall broadband positioning. But particularly, our U-verse broadband footprint where we have the higher speeds and where customers generally buy video and broadband together, we now can sell that together. So that's how we're thinking about it, that's how we look to it. But I'll tell you, I think on the consumer side, we're down into the 2 million range on total DSL customers. That's on I think, the exact number will be on the staff profile. But I would suggest to you, it has changed dramatically over the course of 4, 5 years where it used to be 90% plus of our broadband base and now it's a much lower percentage. So we've gone through that migration, not completely but almost completely.
With that, I want to thank all of you for being on the call today and I'd just give you a few closing comments before we go. 
The third quarter clearly delivered on our transformation strategy. We saw double-digit growth on our key financial metrics, including another outstanding free cash flow quarter. The integration of DIRECTV is also on track. We expect to meet or beat our $2.5 billion cost synergy target, and we're just beginning to unleash potential promotional activities to drive bundled sales. You can see our increased confidence in the guidance update where we raised our adjusted EPS and free cash flow expectations for the year. We believe this is just the beginning. We are positioned as a unique competitor and the first scaled communications and video provider to offer fully integrated nationwide products and we fully expect to increase our momentum as we go forward. 
Thanks again for being on the call. On your way home tonight, please don't text and drive. Remember, it can wait. And as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T and have a good evening."

Before we discuss the quarter, I'd like to take a moment and do a quick reset of what we have put in place at AT&T. 
With the close of our DTV acquisition, we became a unique U.S. competitor. We are the first scaled communications and video provider to offer customers fully-integrated nationwide products. Our focus is on profitable growth and we believe that we have in place the products and the platforms that will enable our success. First, you're probably familiar with our new operating segments, business solutions, entertainment and Internet services, consumer mobility and international. These segments are built on a series of investments that have set the stage for a new kind of company. 
Our network investments for the last 3 years is unprecedented. At a time when customers value and need connectivity more than ever, our integrated high-speed wireless and wireline IP networks are in place, ready to meet the growing data demand. We invested in a deep spectrum position. When you combine the spectrum we bought in the AWS auction, along with the WCS spectrum we already own, we have 40 megahertz of spectrum in the pipeline that we can use to meet growing customer demand. Plus, we've added our spectrum from Leap. This provides an efficient way to meet the increasing demand for mobile data. We're also investing in next-generation software-defined networks. We plan to virtualize and control more than 75% of our network by 2020, using cloud infrastructure and SDN. 
Behind all this is our focus on profitability. Our improving margins are due in large part to our ability to reduce cost and manage our customer base, including letting our customers manage the smartphone handset cycle. Project Agile savings are coming through. Automation and digital-first have reduced customer call volumes by an average of 2 million calls a month. Simplified offers help us well, so do the simple blocking and tackling efforts of expense controls, getting it right the first time and working capital efficiencies. We also are being smarter and growing revenues. We've exited some low margins businesses such as global hubbing. We have seen increasing capital efficiencies, not just with lower trailing operating expense but also driving lower unit cost as we continue to invest in our world class networks. In effect, we are doing more for less, and our expected cost synergies from DIRECTV give us even more runway to reduce costs. We are uniquely positioned as a company. No other company has the assets and capabilities in place that we do. We are confident that our investments have positioned us with a sustainable and efficient long-term leadership position. 
With that as background, let me cover our consolidated financial summary which is on Slide 4. I'll begin by reminding you that third quarter results include DIRECTV operations since our acquisition as of July 25. These results exclude the first 24 days of DIRECTV operations in July. Our financial results this quarter provide further support that our strategy is on target. Consolidated revenues, margins and adjusted earnings all delivered solid growth in the quarter, and our cash flows were exceptionally strong. In the third quarter, our adjusted EPS was $0.74, that's up nearly 14% over last year's third quarter. This includes adjustments for mostly noncash Cricket network decommissioning and DIRECTV merger-related costs. The strong growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexico Wireless operations. Consolidated revenues grew to $39.1 billion, that's up nearly 19% year-over-year, mostly due to our acquisition of DIRECTV, but we grew revenues even if you exclude DIRECTV. And again, this number does not include the first 24 days of DIRECTV revenue as we are reporting under GAAP accounting. 
If you add those revenues to our GAAP number, consolidated revenues for the quarter would have been more than $41.2 billion. Besides DIRECTV, we also had growth from solid gains in our business solutions segment, including strategic business services and data and strong IP data revenue growth in our entertainment and Internet services segment. We also had another strong quarter generating cash. Cash from operating activities for the quarter totaled almost $11 billion, up more than 20% over last year's third quarter, and free cash flow was $5.5 billion. That brought our free cash flow dividend payout ratio to 57% for the year. And when you take a look at the last 2 quarters, you can see that we're delivering the financial results that we expected when we started to transform our business. Combine the second and third quarters and you'll see adjusted EPS up more than 12%, $20 billion of cash from operations and $10 billion of free cash flow and record mobility EBITDA service margins in each quarter. Those are the kind of financial metrics we are shooting for and we firmly believe we are positioned to keep that rolling. 
Now let's take a look at our operational highlights, starting with business solutions on Slide 5. Our business solutions segment includes both wireless and wireline results from our business customers. Mobility is the way business gets done these days and going to market with a total connectivity solution plays to the strengths of our company. We can see the benefits of this approach in this quarter. Business wireless and strategic services revenue growth more than offset declines in legacy wireline products. Wireless revenue growth was driven by gains in both wireless service and equipment revenue. Margins were an even better story. Our focus on profitable revenue growth and cutting costs from the business drove a nearly 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in EBITDA margin. 
Breaking this segment down further, we saw revenue growth in 3 of our 4 customer categories: enterprise, small business and the public sector. Our business wireline revenues were down due to pressure from legacy services, but we continue to see growth stabilization in our wireline data revenues. Total data revenues grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and now comprise nearly 60% of wireline business revenues. Growth in our most advanced data products is outpacing declines in legacy data services. Strategic business services revenue grew by more than 12% year-over-year. And when you adjust for foreign exchange, growth was even stronger, coming in at more than 15%. We also have improving year-over-year wireline small business trends in the last few quarters, and that continued in the third quarter. Plus, when you include mobility solutions, we actually grew small business revenues. This gives you a better idea of how our business solutions team is competing and winning. 
Mobility is just one advantage we bring to the business market. We continue to drive fiber deeper into our wireline network. We have deployed fiber to 950,000 new business customer locations. As you can see on our business results, we're just beginning to tap this growth opportunity. Our move to software-defined network architecture is not only allowing us to add compelling new services such as NetBond and Network on Demand, but it's also helping us reduce cycle times and move to a lower-cost capital and operation structure. Network on Demand has been met with strong customer response. The product allows customers to adjust network bandwidth as needed in real time. Today, it's available in more than 170 cities, driving improvement in cycle times, and we've already signed more than 275 customer deals. Business solutions focus is making the Network on Demand, the office mobile and the cloud highly secure. That's how we're running our business and we are excited by the results. 
Now, let me talk about our entertainment and Internet solutions results on Slide 6. This is basically our former consumer wireline business and the DIRECTV U.S. operations. Even though we had DIRECTV only for part of the quarter, the results reflect the growing revenue and increased profitability that we expect to receive. Reported revenue almost doubled year-over-year, but even more dramatic was the improvement in margins. Our EBITDA margins came in at more than 22%, that's up more than 800 basis points year-over-year. Essentially, we have converted our quality video business with limited scale into an industry leader, earning solid margins through our DIRECTV acquisition. And we think there's plenty of room to improve, even more with the expected cost synergies from the DTV deal. 
During the past few weeks, we have reached a multiyear agreement with Viacom for U-verse and DIRECTV subscribers, and we believe we are in a path for the best content pricing going forward. Our approach is to develop a win-win situation for both us and the content providers and encourage them to look at our wireless and broadband assets to widen their distributions. Early results have been promising. We're also seeing some early success on the revenue synergies. For example, we are selling DIRECTV in virtually all our 2,200 company-owned stores. The next step is launching certified dealers and online as well as ramping up sales in our call centers. 
It's starting to make an impact. DIRECTV net adds picked up shortly after the deal closed and were solid throughout the rest of the quarter. That drove 26,000 satellite net adds post deal close. We now have more than 25 million video subscribers in the U.S. It's important that we do this right coming out of the gate. We've been holding back much of our cross-selling promotions as we train service reps and technicians for our premium, single service experience, so we will see the benefit of those strategies impact future quarters. As expected, U-verse video subscribers declined in the quarter. Net adds dropped with fewer promotions and shifting our focus to the lower content cost DIRECTV platform. 
We added 192,000 IP broadband customers in the quarter as migrations from our DSL base continued to slow. U-verse video losses also put some pressure on broadband numbers due to our high attachment rates, but we are confident we can work through this as our single service experience for broadband and satellite is rolled out. As we said, it's early in our integration of DIRECTV. We don't even have a full quarter of results, yet our integration efforts are on or ahead of target and early results indicate this deal will prove to be everything we thought it would be and more. 
Now let's move to our mobility results on Slide 7. AT&T Mobility operations are now divided between the business solutions and the customer wireless segment. That information is in the investor briefing and staff profile. For comparison purposes, the company is also providing supplemental information for its total domestic wireless operations. 
Let's start first with the total domestic wireless operations financials. We have a compelling value proposition, great network, superior customer service and fair pricing. All this sometimes get lost in the competitive noise. Our focus is to provide the best customer experience while increasing profitability and not just chase customer counts. Our third quarter results drive that point home. We had our highest ever wireless service EBITDA margins at 49.4%. Our consumer mobility business helped drive the service margins of more than 50%. AT&T Next sales are a big part of that success but we also have been very aggressive in taking costs out of the business and increasing efficiencies in our Cricket operations. 
Total wireless revenues were flat year-over-year. Lower year-over-year smartphone upgrade volumes impacted equipment revenues and Mobile Share Value plans did the same to service revenues. As expected, with most of the conversion to Mobile Share Value plans behind us, we saw increasing stability with our service revenues which were essentially flat with second quarter levels. We also continue to see steady growth of AT&T Next and Mobile Share Value plans. About 2/3 of our postpaid smartphone base is on no subsidy pricing with more than 40% on Next. That gives us substantial opportunity to continue to grow equipment revenue as these customers upgrade their smartphones. 
For the quarter, nearly 80% of the smartphone sales were on Next or BYOD. We also continue to see growing phone only ARPU plus Next which increased by nearly 5% year-over-year. We also turned in another strong net add quarter as postpaid tablets, Cricket and the connected car drove our highest net adds in nearly 5 years. Those details are on Slide 8. Total net adds came in at 2.5 million as we continue to see the impact of our Cricket acquisition and connected car strategy. The company added 289,000 postpaid subscribers with about 620,000 tablets and computing devices. We also had a record of 1.6 million connected device net adds. Most of these were connected cars where we added about 1 million. 
Or perhaps the biggest story in the quarter had to be our continued strength in premium prepaid. This has been a remarkable turnaround story for us. We added 466,000 prepaid voice subscribers in the quarter after losing subscribers in the year-ago third quarter. These subscriber gains came from both Cricket and our GoPhone products. We also completed our Cricket network conversion in the quarter. We are seeing Cricket deliver great ARPUs. In fact, the ARPU from Cricket smartphones net adds is nearly $10 more than our postpaid feature phone ARPU losses. We continue to grow our branded smartphone base. We added 1 million in the quarter. Branded voice subscribers were also positive in the quarter. Total churn was down year-over-year, thanks to lower prepaid churn, even with shutting down the Cricket network. Postpaid churn for the quarter was up year-over-year as we focused on higher value subscribers. However, year-to-date postpaid churn is running at 1.06%, just slightly higher than last year's best ever full year churn of 1.04%. 
Here's another way to look at churn. We are adding premium prepaid subscribers whose ARPU is higher and subsidy costs are lower than postpaid feature phone subscribers who have the highest postpaid churn. And our success in the prepaid market is resulting in improvement in total churn. Cricket gives us a quality prepaid offering for the more value-conscious customer. Same great network, quality customer service and the flexibility prepaid delivers with subscriber acquisition costs that are much lower than our postpaid voice. 
Now let's look at our international operations. That information is on Slide 9. Our international segment provides wireless services in Mexico and satellite entertainment services in Latin America. Let's start with Mexico. 
We are taking the first steps in our investment cycle in Mexico and pushing hard to replicate the same great 4G LTE network experience there that we have in the United States. So far, we're making great progress. By the end of the third quarter, we've already covered about 29 million people with our 4G LTE network. And as of today, we now cover more than 30 million. This puts us on plan to reach 40 million by the end of the year and provide a high-quality platform to sell on. Mexico's financials reflect our network investment and the work being done to bring Iusacell and Nextel's operations together. This is the heavy lifting of the wireless business but we have done it before and we're confident we can do it again successfully. We're also confident that we will grow market share. We have a great leadership team in place and a solid plan, not only to deploy the highest quality network but deliver a superb customer experience as well. It's a great opportunity and the potential synergies of our 400 million pop North American calling area make it even better than we first imagined. Our Latin American DIRECTV operations are showing solid growth on a local currency basis but foreign exchange rates, including our decision to adopt the Simadi rate in Venezuela are pressuring our results. Revenues, ARPUs and margins are all pressured by FX and subscribers are also being hampered by challenging economies in the region. But importantly, our Latin American businesses have cash flows that allow us the opportunity to better position our operations. We'll continue to work through these headwinds and work at operational efficiencies in Latin America. 
Now let's move to consolidated margins on Slide 10. Our focus on profitable growth is clearly seen in our consolidated margins. Adjusted consolidated operating margins came in at 20.3% in the quarter. This was a dramatic improvement over the year-ago third quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin was nearly 200 basis points higher than a year ago. There were several reasons for this improvement. First, the DIRECTV acquisition increased the profitability of our pay-TV business, but just as important was our focused sales approach in wireless and U-verse video. Project Agile savings also are coming in ahead of plan. Our simplified offers and increased efforts to take care of customers on the first call has produced results. Call volumes in our mobility centers continue to drop down an average of 2 million calls a month when compared to the year-ago third quarter. We also have been highly effective with our cost optimization efforts. That has helped drive down costs for excess and in our supply chain. We're also keeping an eye on the force by many minimizing outsourcing expenses. Overall force has been managed through voluntary retirement programs, normal attritions and normal reductions in operations. Trailing operating expenses from capital investments also were down year-over-year. We also have been highly efficient with our capital spending and unit costs are decreasing, essentially doing more for less. All this adds up and DIRECTV gives us an opportunity to expand margins. We have our target to get to $2.5 billion or more in savings. We already are realizing some of that in our content and supplier relationships. We really like our momentum here and we are confident we can continue to expand margins and cut costs, even with pressure from our international operations. We also believe healthy cash flows are fundamental to our success. 
Let's look at Slide 11 for those details. We continue to execute and deliver strong cash flows. In fact, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance for the year. In the third quarter, cash from operations totaled $10.8 billion, that's our best cash generation in 12 quarters, and we generated $26.7 billion in cash year-to-date. Capital expenditures totaled $5.3 billion, about the same as last year's third quarter. Free cash flow was $5.5 billion and $12.8 billion year-to-date. In terms of uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.4 billion which gives us a dividend payout ratio of 44% for the quarter and 57% for the full year. Our net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio was 2.28 which was better than our original expectation. Our focus is on maintaining a strong balance sheet. We paid down more than $5 billion in debt early and we still have more than $6 billion of cash on hand. These strong cash flows are a fundamental part of our business. This gives us the financial strength to invest in our business, reduce debt and return substantial value to our shareholders. 
Now let me take a close -- now let me close with a quick summary and updated guidance on Slide 12 before we get to your questions. First, let's address guidance. We are increasing our full year EPS outlook to the $2.68 to $2.74 range. We also now expect free cash flow to be in the $15 billion range or better this year. All other full year guidance is reaffirmed. Our focus on profitability is a big reason we're able to do this. In the quarter, we saw growing revenues, expanding margins and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. But just as important was our ability to generate cash from our business. Cash from operations was strong and free cash flow gave us excellent dividend coverage. We are seeing positive signs at our largest segment, business solutions. Customers appreciate our integrated solutions approach and are migrating to our newest software-defined network services. 
We also saw our highest ever wireless service EBITDA margins, with an incredible turnaround story in prepaid unfolding. And we closed the DTV acquisition in the third quarter and the integration process is on target and positioned to exceed expectations. This is an exciting time for us. We believe we have the pieces in place to redefine our business in our industry. 
With that, I will turn it back to Mike so we can get your questions."

A couple of things, one, there's always some seasonality in the fourth quarter with the holiday sales at our wireless business with purchase of handsets and so forth. So there's always some seasonality. As you would find also with our wireline which is a large business segment. Also, we generally have larger tax payments at the end of the year than we do early on. So those are the things that are impacting us. But I would tell you, if you do kind of a year-over-year comparison where we're at and what we're projecting with regard to the $15 billion range or better, I think you'll see that we're continuing to have really good cash flows throughout the rest of this year. Secondly, with regard to future years, we would stand by what we've said earlier, that is that we expect free cash flow to provide us with a dividend payout ratio that's in the 70s. We're not moving away from that. We're not shying away from that at all and expect that to continue to be the case. We're certainly proud of these results and glad that we exceeded what we had promised, but we're going to be careful and prudent in predicting our results as we go forward. But we're really excited about where we stand in the future cash generation of this business."

At your analyst update, you had highlighted that there are areas for potential cross synergies, revenue synergies and opportunities. Specifically, I'm thinking about the 15 million DIRECTV households that don't have access to AT&T wireless services. I was wondering if you can give us some color in terms of how you plan on going after that opportunity and how we should think about leveraging the breadth of the full portfolio to target sort of areas where you may have one subscriber on one service and not on the other."

Let me take that quickly. First of all, the first revenue synergy that we've really gone after and we've seen good success and quite frankly, we're very excited about the results is in the cross-selling of DIRECTV as a satellite product in our company-owned stores. We have about 2,300 company-owned stores and virtually all of them are actively selling DIRECTV now. And some of them never sold a video product before, so it was -- we had to do some training and some learning. But what we found as we came through the quarter, we were able to sell more and more out of those stores and we got very optimistic about it and were -- gives us optimism for the fourth quarter. So that sales effort and that first line of synergy, if you will, from revenue opportunities, from the retail distribution chain is working and we're real optimistic about it. The second one with regard to cross-selling DIRECTV to wireless customers, we need to go through a process of making sure our privacy policies and a bunch of other administrative policies are lined up consistently so customers had a seamless experience and an easy experience. We've done all that and I think we've now got in place our -- more of our call centers to service those customers on an integrated basis and we're moving forward. We're starting to sell that we're -- based on the really great news we saw from the retail chain, we're really optimistic about seeing those sales results unfold in the fourth quarter and next year. Last thing is our service technicians have been installing broadband for us or U-verse for us, but they haven't been installing DIRECTV. So we've been putting them to through a training program and we're expecting that to rollout, the first set of technicians to roll out after fully training on installing satellite in the home in probably November or so, early part of November, such that we will then be able to sell a single truck roll installation for broadband and video. We're very excited about that. It'll be a measured approach. We're going to have to -- we don't have everybody trained on the first day but we're excited about what that will bring. I think that will bring not only good performance in the fourth quarter but quite frankly, really look forward to that kind of performance, positive performance and impact next year. So that's kind of the way we're thinking about some of those things, Amir."

All of those things, whether it's just blocking and tackling, taking calls into the call centers and getting answers right the first time, all of those things, all of those things are driving cost savings.

One, certainly, the low-cost -- the lower-cost platform has been our first choice for net adds. Two, we did -- because of our focus on profitability, we really got away from promotional pricing and those customers who were cost sensitive that just had a propensity to churn. When you first put those steps in place, we saw a little bit of a higher churn in the second quarter. We're seeing it a little bit higher in the third quarter because of that disciplined approach. But I would tell you that we still have a solid, very good, very high-quality customer base in U-verse, and we're certainly looking to continue to serve those customers with the best products and services. So I think we're focused on lowering churn and keeping those customers quite satisfied."

On a year-over-year basis, in this quarter, the fulfillment accounting had about a $0.02 impact. That is the differential between applying it to DIRECTV and U-verse this quarter as opposed to just applying it to the U-verse product last third quarter '14. And so that did give us some help. Additionally, in this quarter, I want to point out we had about $0.01 of help from the CAF funding activity that went on and what we applied for. By the same token, we had about $0.01 of hurt or pressure from the Mexico operations that we didn't have last year. And if you look at our income tax expense but for the -- setting aside anything that we traded otherwise, there's about $0.02 of income tax pressure, EPS pressure from income taxes. So when you look at the fulfillment accounting and the other kind of unique items that occurred, they kind of balanced off with the CAF funding and fulfillment accounting, generating about $0.03 of benefit in Mexico and the income tax is generating about $0.03 of pressure. So we treated those all as going -- because they're going to be going forward, because they were going to be continuing, we want to make sure I pointed that out. With that being said, Brett, I interrupted you before you got ask your question. I apologize."

Or is this really just AT&T Wireless the way it's always been run, and we really should be just thinking about dividing it between the 2 pieces? That'd be the first one and the second one is on CapEx. Could you -- there's so many now, new parts of the business. Could you kind of give us how CapEx is now being allocated between kind of the Latin America, the Mexico and then domestic business units and how we should think about all those different pieces trending?"

One, David, for investors and analysts' ease, we provided total wireless and then provided the consumer wireless, the ability to get to the business wireless. So we try to be very upfront with regard to our financial presentation. So hopefully, we've been successful at that, but we try to do that to make sure you had that information. Two, I would suggest even as you look at it, the margins and EBITDAs and profitabilities are -- they are certainly different but they're not materially different. They don't significantly skew one way or the other. So I just -- I'd make that observation for you. With regard to how you model, I'll leave that to you guys, modeling. I can tell you the way we focus though is what the business relationships we're selling and what are consumer relationships we're selling, and that's how we focused on it. But I think the information is there to do it either way and I think it's going to be a matter of what you're most comfortable with. As we go forward and we see the platform we built with connected devices, show -- start showing more growth even than it already has, it'll be beneficial for everyone to have this split. With regard to CapEx, I won't get into specific dollars on a quarterly basis but I'll give you these insights. On DTV Latin America, our Latin American properties, I would expect that they will be generally self-sufficient, that the cash flows that they generate will be self-sufficient to cover their CapEx needs. I would suggest to you, if we have customer growth opportunities, we'll be prudent about that to make sure that we don't miss out on good customer growth. But generally speaking, it's going to be self-sufficient from a cash perspective. On Mexico, I would suggest to you that the $3 billion we announced some months ago with regard to the buildout, it's still a good number. We started on that process. I won't tell you that every POP, every 4G LTE POP costs the same amount to create. Some of the networks were more advanced and so some of the earlier achievement may be at a more efficient cost, unit cost. But I would suggest to you, the $3 billion is still a good number. And then we'll continue to invest, albeit at a slower rate because we've built the platforms out. We'll continue to invest in fiber, in wireless capacity and in success based capital for our satellite video product, much in the same way you would've seen us in the past, taking into account the fact that the ramp-up in CapEx for the VIP is now behind us. We've got -- we're 950,000 business customer locations pass through fiber. We're committed to 1 million, we'll get to the 1 million, so that's the only piece that isn't done."

But I think you would be the better judge of figuring that out. And I say that based on the offers I see that we are dealing with in the noise in the market. On the $2.5 billion, I think first and foremost, you'll see it in our results. But with regard to updating you, I think we'll continue to update you on the process like we did -- like we've done today where we've talked about how the retail stores are generating sales, exceeding our expectations, how the single truck roll is going to start rolling out in November, those kinds of things.

But quite frankly, right now, our customers seem quite pleased with the installment program and simply put, they seem to like it because at the end of their term, they own the phone. And the phones have continued use and functionality for them and they continue to use that. And to some extent, we're seeing that from a -- we're seeing a side of that from this continued use of Bring Your Own Device activities in our company where people are bringing in devices that they already own and hooking them up to our network. But from a company perspective, it's more of a decision and Ralph de la Vega and Glenn Lurie and the team follow it really closely. It's more about what the customers want. And if we see that the customers are going to want that program, we'll certainly consider and we still have the capability to do it. But right now, what we believe is the customer's satisfaction comes from that ability to own the phone at the end of that agreed to term and they feel real comfortable about that.

On the value side, the customers, it's more about being able to provide in the stores, the full scope customer experience and take care of all of these. That's what we're concerned about. From a perspective of the -- if they buy the phone somewhere else and bring it to us, we're thrilled with serving them in that way. We don't have the cost of handling the phone or we don't, quite frankly, have the cost of financing the phone either on an installment plan or through a subsidized program. So we're open to it. Right now, under the equipment installment program that Apple has, they sent us a high number of phones through that program, and that's fine, we'd love to serve our customers that way. And if that's how they choose to buy their phones through Apple and Apple finances them, that's something we can definitely work with. So that's -- it's really more about what does the customer want and how do we make sure we keep -- we provide choices and services to make it easy for our customers. With regard to our broadband trends and specifically in DSL, the first comment I'd make is over the last few years, the real trend has been the migration from DSL to IP broadband. And that's been something that we've encouraged ourselves and we're beginning to complete that process or near completion where the DSL customers we have left is a much lower percentage than have IP broadband capabilities from us. So we are through that migration process. And then secondly, they don't have television in these areas or I should say, we didn't have a video offering. Now these were generally out of the U-verse footprint but now, we do. And now, we'll be able to provide them a video offering through DIRECTV and we're very pleased with that. So we are hopeful that now, this nationwide video service will help us in improving our overall broadband positioning. But particularly, our U-verse broadband footprint where we have the higher speeds and where customers generally buy video and broadband together, we now can sell that together. So that's how we're thinking about it, that's how we look to it. But I'll tell you, I think on the consumer side, we're down into the 2 million range on total DSL customers. That's not -- I think, the exact number will be on the staff profile. But I would suggest to you, it has changed dramatically over the course of 4, 5 years where it used to be 90% plus of our broadband base and now it's a much lower percentage. So we've gone through that migration, not completely but almost completely.
With that, I want to thank all of you for being on the call today and I'd just give you a few closing comments before we go. 
The third quarter clearly delivered on our transformation strategy. We saw double-digit growth on our key financial metrics, including another outstanding free cash flow quarter. The integration of DIRECTV is also on track. We expect to meet or beat our $2.5 billion cost synergy target, and we're just beginning to unleash potential promotional activities to drive bundled sales. You can see our increased confidence in the guidance update where we raised our adjusted EPS and free cash flow expectations for the year. We believe this is just the beginning. We are positioned as a unique competitor and the first scaled communications and video provider to offer fully integrated nationwide products and we fully expect to increase our momentum as we go forward. 
Thanks again for being on the call. On your way home tonight, please don't text and drive. Remember, it can wait. And as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T and have a good evening."

With the close of our DTV acquisition, we became a unique U.S. competitor. We are the first scaled communications and video provider to offer customers fully-integrated nationwide products. Our focus is on profitable growth and we believe that we have in place the products and the platforms that will enable our success. First, you're probably familiar with our new operating segments, business solutions, entertainment and Internet services, consumer mobility and international. These segments are built on a series of investments that have set the stage for a new kind of company. 
Our network investments for the last 3 years is unprecedented. At a time when customers value and need connectivity more than ever, our integrated high-speed wireless and wireline IP networks are in place, ready to meet the growing data demand. We invested in a deep spectrum position. When you combine the spectrum we bought in the AWS auction, along with the WCS spectrum we already own, we have 40 megahertz of spectrum in the pipeline that we can use to meet growing customer demand. Plus, we've added our spectrum from Leap. This provides an efficient way to meet the increasing demand for mobile data. We're also investing in next-generation software-defined networks. We plan to virtualize and control more than 75% of our network by 2020, using cloud infrastructure and SDN. 
Behind all this is our focus on profitability. Our improving margins are due in large part to our ability to reduce cost and manage our customer base, including letting our customers manage the smartphone handset cycle. Project Agile savings are coming through. Automation and digital-first have reduced customer call volumes by an average of 2 million calls a month. Simplified offers help us well, so do the simple blocking and tackling efforts of expense controls, getting it right the first time and working capital efficiencies. We also are being smarter and growing revenues. We've exited some low margins businesses such as global hubbing. We have seen increasing capital efficiencies, not just with lower trailing operating expense but also driving lower unit cost as we continue to invest in our world class networks. In effect, we are doing more for less, and our expected cost synergies from DIRECTV give us even more runway to reduce costs. We are uniquely positioned as a company. No other company has the assets and capabilities in place that we do. We are confident that our investments have positioned us with a sustainable and efficient long-term leadership position. 
With that as background, let me cover our consolidated financial summary which is on Slide 4. I'll begin by reminding you that third quarter results include DIRECTV operations since our acquisition as of July 25. These results exclude the first 24 days of DIRECTV operations in July. Our financial results this quarter provide further support that our strategy is on target. Consolidated revenues, margins and adjusted earnings all delivered solid growth in the quarter, and our cash flows were exceptionally strong. In the third quarter, our adjusted EPS was $0.74, that's up nearly 14% over last year's third quarter. This includes adjustments for mostly noncash Cricket network decommissioning and DIRECTV merger-related costs. The strong growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexico Wireless operations. Consolidated revenues grew to $39.1 billion, that's up nearly 19% year-over-year, mostly due to our acquisition of DIRECTV, but we grew revenues even if you exclude DIRECTV. And again, this number does not include the first 24 days of DIRECTV revenue as we are reporting under GAAP accounting. 
If you add those revenues to our GAAP number, consolidated revenues for the quarter would have been more than $41.2 billion. Besides DIRECTV, we also had growth from solid gains in our business solutions segment, including strategic business services and data and strong IP data revenue growth in our entertainment and Internet services segment. We also had another strong quarter generating cash. Cash from operating activities for the quarter totaled almost $11 billion, up more than 20% over last year's third quarter, and free cash flow was $5.5 billion. That brought our free cash flow dividend payout ratio to 57% for the year. And when you take a look at the last 2 quarters, you can see that we're delivering the financial results that we expected when we started to transform our business. Combine the second and third quarters and you'll see adjusted EPS up more than 12%, $20 billion of cash from operations and $10 billion of free cash flow and record mobility EBITDA service margins in each quarter. Those are the kind of financial metrics we are shooting for and we firmly believe we are positioned to keep that rolling. 
Now let's take a look at our operational highlights, starting with business solutions on Slide 5. Our business solutions segment includes both wireless and wireline results from our business customers. Mobility is the way business gets done these days and going to market with a total connectivity solution plays to the strengths of our company. We can see the benefits of this approach in this quarter. Business wireless and strategic services revenue growth more than offset declines in legacy wireline products. Wireless revenue growth was driven by gains in both wireless service and equipment revenue. Margins were an even better story. Our focus on profitable revenue growth and cutting costs from the business drove a nearly 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in EBITDA margin. 
Breaking this segment down further, we saw revenue growth in 3 of our 4 customer categories: enterprise, small business and the public sector. Our business wireline revenues were down due to pressure from legacy services, but we continue to see growth stabilization in our wireline data revenues. Total data revenues grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and now comprise nearly 60% of wireline business revenues. Growth in our most advanced data products is outpacing declines in legacy data services. Strategic business services revenue grew by more than 12% year-over-year. And when you adjust for foreign exchange, growth was even stronger, coming in at more than 15%. We also have improving year-over-year wireline small business trends in the last few quarters, and that continued in the third quarter. Plus, when you include mobility solutions, we actually grew small business revenues. This gives you a better idea of how our business solutions team is competing and winning. 
Mobility is just one advantage we bring to the business market. We continue to drive fiber deeper into our wireline network. We have deployed fiber to 950,000 new business customer locations. As you can see on our business results, we're just beginning to tap this growth opportunity. Our move to software-defined network architecture is not only allowing us to add compelling new services such as NetBond and Network on Demand, but it's also helping us reduce cycle times and move to a lower-cost capital and operation structure. Network on Demand has been met with strong customer response. The product allows customers to adjust network bandwidth as needed in real time. Today, it's available in more than 170 cities, driving improvement in cycle times, and we've already signed more than 275 customer deals. Business solutions focus is making the Network on Demand, the office mobile and the cloud highly secure. That's how we're running our business and we are excited by the results. 
Now, let me talk about our entertainment and Internet solutions results on Slide 6. This is basically our former consumer wireline business and the DIRECTV U.S. operations. Even though we had DIRECTV only for part of the quarter, the results reflect the growing revenue and increased profitability that we expect to receive. Reported revenue almost doubled year-over-year, but even more dramatic was the improvement in margins. Our EBITDA margins came in at more than 22%, that's up more than 800 basis points year-over-year. Essentially, we have converted our quality video business with limited scale into an industry leader, earning solid margins through our DIRECTV acquisition. And we think there's plenty of room to improve, even more with the expected cost synergies from the DTV deal. 
During the past few weeks, we have reached a multiyear agreement with Viacom for U-verse and DIRECTV subscribers, and we believe we are in a path for the best content pricing going forward. Our approach is to develop a win-win situation for both us and the content providers and encourage them to look at our wireless and broadband assets to widen their distributions. Early results have been promising. We're also seeing some early success on the revenue synergies. For example, we are selling DIRECTV in virtually all our 2,200 company-owned stores. The next step is launching certified dealers and online as well as ramping up sales in our call centers. 
It's starting to make an impact. DIRECTV net adds picked up shortly after the deal closed and were solid throughout the rest of the quarter. That drove 26,000 satellite net adds post deal close. We now have more than 25 million video subscribers in the U.S. It's important that we do this right coming out of the gate. We've been holding back much of our cross-selling promotions as we train service reps and technicians for our premium, single service experience, so we will see the benefit of those strategies impact future quarters. As expected, U-verse video subscribers declined in the quarter. Net adds dropped with fewer promotions and shifting our focus to the lower content cost DIRECTV platform. 
We added 192,000 IP broadband customers in the quarter as migrations from our DSL base continued to slow. U-verse video losses also put some pressure on broadband numbers due to our high attachment rates, but we are confident we can work through this as our single service experience for broadband and satellite is rolled out. As we said, it's early in our integration of DIRECTV. We don't even have a full quarter of results, yet our integration efforts are on or ahead of target and early results indicate this deal will prove to be everything we thought it would be and more. 
Now let's move to our mobility results on Slide 7. AT&T Mobility operations are now divided between the business solutions and the customer wireless segment. That information is in the investor briefing and staff profile. For comparison purposes, the company is also providing supplemental information for its total domestic wireless operations. 
Let's start first with the total domestic wireless operations financials. We have a compelling value proposition, great network, superior customer service and fair pricing. All this sometimes get lost in the competitive noise. Our focus is to provide the best customer experience while increasing profitability and not just chase customer counts. Our third quarter results drive that point home. We had our highest ever wireless service EBITDA margins at 49.4%. Our consumer mobility business helped drive the service margins of more than 50%. AT&T Next sales are a big part of that success but we also have been very aggressive in taking costs out of the business and increasing efficiencies in our Cricket operations. 
Total wireless revenues were flat year-over-year. Lower year-over-year smartphone upgrade volumes impacted equipment revenues and Mobile Share Value plans did the same to service revenues. As expected, with most of the conversion to Mobile Share Value plans behind us, we saw increasing stability with our service revenues which were essentially flat with second quarter levels. We also continue to see steady growth of AT&T Next and Mobile Share Value plans. About 2/3 of our postpaid smartphone base is on no subsidy pricing with more than 40% on Next. That gives us substantial opportunity to continue to grow equipment revenue as these customers upgrade their smartphones. 
For the quarter, nearly 80% of the smartphone sales were on Next or BYOD. We also continue to see growing phone only ARPU plus Next which increased by nearly 5% year-over-year. We also turned in another strong net add quarter as postpaid tablets, Cricket and the connected car drove our highest net adds in nearly 5 years. Those details are on Slide 8. Total net adds came in at 2.5 million as we continue to see the impact of our Cricket acquisition and connected car strategy. The company added 289,000 postpaid subscribers with about 620,000 tablets and computing devices. We also had a record of 1.6 million connected device net adds. Most of these were connected cars where we added about 1 million. 
Or perhaps the biggest story in the quarter had to be our continued strength in premium prepaid. This has been a remarkable turnaround story for us. We added 466,000 prepaid voice subscribers in the quarter after losing subscribers in the year-ago third quarter. These subscriber gains came from both Cricket and our GoPhone products. We also completed our Cricket network conversion in the quarter. We are seeing Cricket deliver great ARPUs. In fact, the ARPU from Cricket smartphones net adds is nearly $10 more than our postpaid feature phone ARPU losses. We continue to grow our branded smartphone base. We added 1 million in the quarter. Branded voice subscribers were also positive in the quarter. Total churn was down year-over-year, thanks to lower prepaid churn, even with shutting down the Cricket network. Postpaid churn for the quarter was up year-over-year as we focused on higher value subscribers. However, year-to-date postpaid churn is running at 1.06%, just slightly higher than last year's best ever full year churn of 1.04%. 
Here's another way to look at churn. We are adding premium prepaid subscribers whose ARPU is higher and subsidy costs are lower than postpaid feature phone subscribers who have the highest postpaid churn. And our success in the prepaid market is resulting in improvement in total churn. Cricket gives us a quality prepaid offering for the more value-conscious customer. Same great network, quality customer service and the flexibility prepaid delivers with subscriber acquisition costs that are much lower than our postpaid voice. 
Now let's look at our international operations. That information is on Slide 9. Our international segment provides wireless services in Mexico and satellite entertainment services in Latin America. Let's start with Mexico. 
We are taking the first steps in our investment cycle in Mexico and pushing hard to replicate the same great 4G LTE network experience there that we have in the United States. So far, we're making great progress. By the end of the third quarter, we've already covered about 29 million people with our 4G LTE network. And as of today, we now cover more than 30 million. This puts us on plan to reach 40 million by the end of the year and provide a high-quality platform to sell on. Mexico's financials reflect our network investment and the work being done to bring Iusacell and Nextel's operations together. This is the heavy lifting of the wireless business but we have done it before and we're confident we can do it again successfully. We're also confident that we will grow market share. We have a great leadership team in place and a solid plan, not only to deploy the highest quality network but deliver a superb customer experience as well. It's a great opportunity and the potential synergies of our 400 million pop North American calling area make it even better than we first imagined. Our Latin American DIRECTV operations are showing solid growth on a local currency basis but foreign exchange rates, including our decision to adopt the Simadi rate in Venezuela are pressuring our results. Revenues, ARPUs and margins are all pressured by FX and subscribers are also being hampered by challenging economies in the region. But importantly, our Latin American businesses have cash flows that allow us the opportunity to better position our operations. We'll continue to work through these headwinds and work at operational efficiencies in Latin America. 
Now let's move to consolidated margins on Slide 10. Our focus on profitable growth is clearly seen in our consolidated margins. Adjusted consolidated operating margins came in at 20.3% in the quarter. This was a dramatic improvement over the year-ago third quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin was nearly 200 basis points higher than a year ago. There were several reasons for this improvement. First, the DIRECTV acquisition increased the profitability of our pay-TV business, but just as important was our focused sales approach in wireless and U-verse video. Project Agile savings also are coming in ahead of plan. Our simplified offers and increased efforts to take care of customers on the first call has produced results. Call volumes in our mobility centers continue to drop down an average of 2 million calls a month when compared to the year-ago third quarter. We also have been highly effective with our cost optimization efforts. That has helped drive down costs for excess and in our supply chain. We're also keeping an eye on the force by many minimizing outsourcing expenses. Overall force has been managed through voluntary retirement programs, normal attritions and normal reductions in operations. Trailing operating expenses from capital investments also were down year-over-year. We also have been highly efficient with our capital spending and unit costs are decreasing, essentially doing more for less. All this adds up and DIRECTV gives us an opportunity to expand margins. We have our target to get to $2.5 billion or more in savings. We already are realizing some of that in our content and supplier relationships. We really like our momentum here and we are confident we can continue to expand margins and cut costs, even with pressure from our international operations. We also believe healthy cash flows are fundamental to our success. 
Let's look at Slide 11 for those details. We continue to execute and deliver strong cash flows. In fact, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance for the year. In the third quarter, cash from operations totaled $10.8 billion, that's our best cash generation in 12 quarters, and we generated $26.7 billion in cash year-to-date. Capital expenditures totaled $5.3 billion, about the same as last year's third quarter. Free cash flow was $5.5 billion and $12.8 billion year-to-date. In terms of uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.4 billion which gives us a dividend payout ratio of 44% for the quarter and 57% for the full year. Our net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio was 2.28 which was better than our original expectation. Our focus is on maintaining a strong balance sheet. We paid down more than $5 billion in debt early and we still have more than $6 billion of cash on hand. These strong cash flows are a fundamental part of our business. This gives us the financial strength to invest in our business, reduce debt and return substantial value to our shareholders. 
Now let me take a close -- now let me close with a quick summary and updated guidance on Slide 12 before we get to your questions. First, let's address guidance. We are increasing our full year EPS outlook to the $2.68 to $2.74 range. We also now expect free cash flow to be in the $15 billion range or better this year. All other full year guidance is reaffirmed. Our focus on profitability is a big reason we're able to do this. In the quarter, we saw growing revenues, expanding margins and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. But just as important was our ability to generate cash from our business. Cash from operations was strong and free cash flow gave us excellent dividend coverage. We are seeing positive signs at our largest segment, business solutions. Customers appreciate our integrated solutions approach and are migrating to our newest software-defined network services. 
We also saw our highest ever wireless service EBITDA margins, with an incredible turnaround story in prepaid unfolding. And we closed the DTV acquisition in the third quarter and the integration process is on target and positioned to exceed expectations. This is an exciting time for us. We believe we have the pieces in place to redefine our business in our industry. 
With that, I will turn it back to Mike so we can get your questions."

A couple of things, one, there's always some seasonality in the fourth quarter with the holiday sales at our wireless business with purchase of handsets and so forth. So there's always some seasonality. As you would find also with our wireline which is a large business segment. Also, we generally have larger tax payments at the end of the year than we do early on. So those are the things that are impacting us. But I would tell you, if you do kind of a year-over-year comparison where we're at and what we're projecting with regard to the $15 billion range or better, I think you'll see that we're continuing to have really good cash flows throughout the rest of this year. Secondly, with regard to future years, we would stand by what we've said earlier, that is that we expect free cash flow to provide us with a dividend payout ratio that's in the 70s. We're not moving away from that. We're not shying away from that at all and expect that to continue to be the case. We're certainly proud of these results and glad that we exceeded what we had promised, but we're going to be careful and prudent in predicting our results as we go forward. But we're really excited about where we stand in the future cash generation of this business."

At your analyst update, you had highlighted that there are areas for potential cross synergies, revenue synergies and opportunities. Specifically, I'm thinking about the 15 million DIRECTV households that don't have access to AT&T wireless services. I was wondering if you can give us some color in terms of how you plan on going after that opportunity and how we should think about leveraging the breadth of the full portfolio to target sort of areas where you may have one subscriber on one service and not on the other."

Let me take that quickly. First of all, the first revenue synergy that we've really gone after and we've seen good success and quite frankly, we're very excited about the results is in the cross-selling of DIRECTV as a satellite product in our company-owned stores. We have about 2,300 company-owned stores and virtually all of them are actively selling DIRECTV now. And some of them never sold a video product before, so it was -- we had to do some training and some learning. But what we found as we came through the quarter, we were able to sell more and more out of those stores and we got very optimistic about it and were -- gives us optimism for the fourth quarter. So that sales effort and that first line of synergy, if you will, from revenue opportunities, from the retail distribution chain is working and we're real optimistic about it. The second one with regard to cross-selling DIRECTV to wireless customers, we need to go through a process of making sure our privacy policies and a bunch of other administrative policies are lined up consistently so customers had a seamless experience and an easy experience. We've done all that and I think we've now got in place our -- more of our call centers to service those customers on an integrated basis and we're moving forward. We're starting to sell that we're -- based on the really great news we saw from the retail chain, we're really optimistic about seeing those sales results unfold in the fourth quarter and next year. Last thing is our service technicians have been installing broadband for us or U-verse for us, but they haven't been installing DIRECTV. So we've been putting them to through a training program and we're expecting that to rollout, the first set of technicians to roll out after fully training on installing satellite in the home in probably November or so, early part of November, such that we will then be able to sell a single truck roll installation for broadband and video. We're very excited about that. It'll be a measured approach. We're going to have to -- we don't have everybody trained on the first day but we're excited about what that will bring. I think that will bring not only good performance in the fourth quarter but quite frankly, really look forward to that kind of performance, positive performance and impact next year. So that's kind of the way we're thinking about some of those things, Amir."

All of those things, whether it's just blocking and tackling, taking calls into the call centers and getting answers right the first time, all of those things, all of those things are driving cost savings.

Secondly, with the rollout this quarter of the, if you will, one truck roll or single service experience where we can install TV and broadband at the same time, we not only expect the satellite-TV to pick up, but we also expect the broadband, IP broadband to pick up because people buy those things together. And so we're hopeful that we're going to see -- we'll be able to show you some improvements and trend improvements, continuing off of the third quarter in the fourth quarter. I won't make any predictions about specific levels but we are optimistic of what we've seen so far.

That is the differential between applying it to DIRECTV and U-verse this quarter as opposed to just applying it to the U-verse product last third quarter '14. And so that did give us some help. Additionally, in this quarter, I want to point out we had about $0.01 of help from the CAF funding activity that went on and what we applied for. By the same token, we had about $0.01 of hurt or pressure from the Mexico operations that we didn't have last year. And if you look at our income tax expense but for the -- setting aside anything that we traded otherwise, there's about $0.02 of income tax pressure, EPS pressure from income taxes. So when you look at the fulfillment accounting and the other kind of unique items that occurred, they kind of balanced off with the CAF funding and fulfillment accounting, generating about $0.03 of benefit in Mexico and the income tax is generating about $0.03 of pressure. So we treated those all as going -- because they're going to be going forward, because they were going to be continuing, we want to make sure I pointed that out.

One, David, for investors and analysts' ease, we provided total wireless and then provided the consumer wireless, the ability to get to the business wireless. So we try to be very upfront with regard to our financial presentation. So hopefully, we've been successful at that, but we try to do that to make sure you had that information. Two, I would suggest even as you look at it, the margins and EBITDAs and profitabilities are -- they are certainly different but they're not materially different. They don't significantly skew one way or the other. So I just -- I'd make that observation for you. With regard to how you model, I'll leave that to you guys, modeling. I can tell you the way we focus though is what the business relationships we're selling and what are consumer relationships we're selling, and that's how we focused on it. But I think the information is there to do it either way and I think it's going to be a matter of what you're most comfortable with. As we go forward and we see the platform we built with connected devices, show -- start showing more growth even than it already has, it'll be beneficial for everyone to have this split. With regard to CapEx, I won't get into specific dollars on a quarterly basis but I'll give you these insights. On DTV Latin America, our Latin American properties, I would expect that they will be generally self-sufficient, that the cash flows that they generate will be self-sufficient to cover their CapEx needs. I would suggest to you, if we have customer growth opportunities, we'll be prudent about that to make sure that we don't miss out on good customer growth. But generally speaking, it's going to be self-sufficient from a cash perspective. On Mexico, I would suggest to you that the $3 billion we announced some months ago with regard to the buildout, it's still a good number. We started on that process. I won't tell you that every POP, every 4G LTE POP costs the same amount to create. Some of the networks were more advanced and so some of the earlier achievement may be at a more efficient cost, unit cost. But I would suggest to you, the $3 billion is still a good number. And then we'll continue to invest, albeit at a slower rate because we've built the platforms out. We'll continue to invest in fiber, in wireless capacity and in success based capital for our satellite video product, much in the same way you would've seen us in the past, taking into account the fact that the ramp-up in CapEx for the VIP is now behind us. We've got -- we're 950,000 business customer locations pass through fiber. We're committed to 1 million, we'll get to the 1 million, so that's the only piece that isn't done."

But I think you would be the better judge of figuring that out. And I say that based on the offers I see that we are dealing with in the noise in the market.

And quite finally, the difference in price, I don't think is measurable from the least of the -- depending upon what situation you have but when you get down to the real cost of it, it seems like it's worth that well for us by doing installment plans."

Broadly, do you see value in actually selling the phone to the customer? In other words, does it matter whether somebody gets an new iPhone from you or gets it from -- orders it from Apple and sits on their books? And secondly, on broadband, a couple of quarters now where you're overall losing customers. Just a little insight on what the trends are in DSL and particularly, where those losses are coming. Are those people in areas where you don't offer U-verse? Or is it migrate -- conditional migration over to U-verse in areas where you do offer it?"

On the value side, the customers, it's more about being able to provide in the stores, the full scope customer experience and take care of all of these. That's what we're concerned about.

On the value side, the customers, it's more about being able to provide in the stores, the full scope customer experience and take care of all of these. That's what we're concerned about. From a perspective of the -- if they buy the phone somewhere else and bring it to us, we're thrilled with serving them in that way. We don't have the cost of handling the phone or we don't, quite frankly, have the cost of financing the phone either on an installment plan or through a subsidized program. So we're open to it. Right now, under the equipment installment program that Apple has, they sent us a high number of phones through that program, and that's fine, we'd love to serve our customers that way. And if that's how they choose to buy their phones through Apple and Apple finances them, that's something we can definitely work with. So that's -- it's really more about what does the customer want and how do we make sure we keep -- we provide choices and services to make it easy for our customers. With regard to our broadband trends and specifically in DSL, the first comment I'd make is over the last few years, the real trend has been the migration from DSL to IP broadband. And that's been something that we've encouraged ourselves and we're beginning to complete that process or near completion where the DSL customers we have left is a much lower percentage than have IP broadband capabilities from us. So we are through that migration process. And then secondly, they don't have television in these areas or I should say, we didn't have a video offering. Now these were generally out of the U-verse footprint but now, we do. And now, we'll be able to provide them a video offering through DIRECTV and we're very pleased with that. So we are hopeful that now, this nationwide video service will help us in improving our overall broadband positioning. But particularly, our U-verse broadband footprint where we have the higher speeds and where customers generally buy video and broadband together, we now can sell that together. So that's how we're thinking about it, that's how we look to it. But I'll tell you, I think on the consumer side, we're down into the 2 million range on total DSL customers. That's not -- I think, the exact number will be on the staff profile. But I would suggest to you, it has changed dramatically over the course of 4, 5 years where it used to be 90% plus of our broadband base and now it's a much lower percentage. So we've gone through that migration, not completely but almost completely.
With that, I want to thank all of you for being on the call today and I'd just give you a few closing comments before we go. 
The third quarter clearly delivered on our transformation strategy. We saw double-digit growth on our key financial metrics, including another outstanding free cash flow quarter. The integration of DIRECTV is also on track. We expect to meet or beat our $2.5 billion cost synergy target, and we're just beginning to unleash potential promotional activities to drive bundled sales. You can see our increased confidence in the guidance update where we raised our adjusted EPS and free cash flow expectations for the year. We believe this is just the beginning. We are positioned as a unique competitor and the first scaled communications and video provider to offer fully integrated nationwide products and we fully expect to increase our momentum as we go forward. 
Thanks again for being on the call. On your way home tonight, please don't text and drive. Remember, it can wait. And as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T and have a good evening."
