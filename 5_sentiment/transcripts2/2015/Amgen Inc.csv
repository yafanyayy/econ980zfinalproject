Thank you, Arvind, and thank all of you for joining our call this afternoon. 2014 was really an outstanding year for us and let me start to the financial highlights, which include revenue growth of 7% enabling us to eclipse $20 billion for the first",549,"Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and thank all of you for joining our call this afternoon. 2014 was really an outstanding year for us and let me start to the financial highlights, which include revenue growth of 7% enabling us to eclipse $20 billion for the first time. Consistent with our international expansion objectives, sales outside of the U.S. grew by double-digit rates in 2014. Our adjusted operating income growth of 22% reflects our commitment to generating operating leverage from our business. As you know, one of our objectives for 2014 was to deliver to shareholders $800 million of improved profitability from Enbrel. We exceeded that objective in 2014. In addition, our free cash flow grew by 40% to $7.8 billion. This strong financial performance and our confidence in the longer-term outlook enabled us to increase our dividend by 30% at 2014 and by 30% again for 2015, while increasing our stock buyback plans as well.
Turning now to our progress with innovation, we have an extraordinary flow of data from our pipeline in 2014. We generated positive pivotal data for 6 innovative programs and submitted 4 of them for regulatory approvals. To remind you, this includes filings for 2 immuno-oncology molecules, BLINCYTO and T-VEC, and 2 cardiovascular molecules, ecolocumab and Aberdeen. In December, we received approval for 2 projects, including BLINCYTO and our On-Body Injector for Neulasta. BLINCYTO is an immuno-oncology agent which addresses an important need for acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients who currently have very limited options. More generally, we're excited about the proof of concept represented by this approval and look forward to progressing our programs in other forms of cancer as well.
Our On-Body Injector for Neulasta also represents an important innovation for cancer patients, and one which will help improve patient experience for those undergoing chemotherapy and at higher risks of infection. I'd like to point out, of course, that launches are now already underway for both of these products.
While 2014 was a watershed year for us in research and development, 2015 is sure to be another important year, starting with the prospects of launching 3 additional innovative products, including evolocumab, of course, for hypercholesterolemia; ivabradine for heart failure; and T-VEC for metastatic melanoma. And in addition to these launches in 2015, we expect regulatory submissions for Kyprolis, which we announced earlier today, brodalumab, and potentially AMG 416 as well as the start of a Phase III program for AMG 334 in migraine and Phase III read outs for 2 of our biosimilar programs.
As we discussed in July and October, we began last year the process of transforming our company and importantly, we initiated this from a position of strength. David will update you monetarily on our progress with that transformation and the benefits achieved in 2014. We are on track, as reflected in our $1.5 billion growth in operating income and 6-point operating margin improvement last year, even while absorbing the full year impact of Onyx and investing in our long-term opportunities. Across our company, we'll continue our transformation efforts in 2015 and deliver more progress against our long-term objectives.
Before I hand over to David, let me thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their unwavering focus on delivering for patients and for shareholders. David?"

Turning to the fourth quarter of Page 5 of the Slide deck, revenues grew to $5.3 billion by 6% year-over-year, with 8% product sales growth, driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenues at $187 million decre",1309,"Okay. Thanks, Bob. Turning to the fourth quarter of Page 5 of the Slide deck, revenues grew to $5.3 billion by 6% year-over-year, with 8% product sales growth, driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenues at $187 million decreased by $55 million versus the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting a reduced level of partnership payments received for brodalumab compared to last year's fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income at $2 billion grew 15% from prior year. On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 15.9% improved by 0.1 points. Research and development expenses at $1.2 billion were flat versus prior year and included the $60 million upfront payment to Kite Pharma for our cancer immunotherapy collaboration.
SG&A expenses were flat year-on-year. On October 31, 2014, the company passed the one-year anniversary of the first step down in Enbrel-related payments. This resulted in a year-over-year expense decline of approximately $100 million in Q4. This compares to year-over-year expense declines of approximately $250 million per quarter in the first 3 quarters of 2014. Additionally, we incurred incremental expenses in Q4 in preparation for new product launches. These increased investments were offset through savings for our transformation through a more focused operating model, as well as through a reduced Enbrel-related payments. Other income and expenses were flat year-over-year at $173 million in the quarter.
The tax rate was 10.2% for the quarter, a 2.5-point decrease versus Q4 2013. This decrease was primarily due to the favorable tax benefit from the extension of the 2014 federal R&D tax credit which occurred at Q4 of 2014, which was offset partially by unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings. As a result, adjusted net income increased 20%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 19%.
In summary, our fourth quarter results from operations were in line with our previous expectations, while overall results in the quarter benefited from the extension of the R&D tax credit, which was approved in late December and have been removed from our previous guidance. You will find a summary of our 2014 full year results on Page 6 of the presentation.
Our 2014 full year revenues grew 7% to $20.1 billion, and adjusted earnings per share grew 14% to $8.70 per share. Product sales grew 6% year-over-year and other revenues increased by $252 million over the same period a year ago, primarily driven by our Nexavar and Stivarga partnerships.
For the full year, adjusted operating income grew to $8.5 billion, a 22% increase based on the combination of solid revenue growth, along with stable operating expenses, which were down 1% year-over-year.
On an adjusted basis, cost of sales margin was flat at 15.8% year-over-year. Research and development expenses increased 5%, driven by the addition of Onyx and support for later-stage clinical programs. These increases were offset partially by lower spending associated with marketed product support.
SG&A expenses were down 10%, driven primarily by reduced Enbrel-related expenses, offset partially by the addition of Onyx and increased commercial expenses in preparation for new product launches.
Other income and expenses were unfavorable 7% year-over-year due to higher interest expense and portfolio rebalancing, partially offset by higher interest income. The tax rate was 14.9% for the full year, up 5.7 points versus 2013. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a favorable resolution in 2013 of our federal income tax audit, as well as the retroactive extension of the 2012 federal R&D tax credit in 2013.
During 2014, the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax was 1.9 points higher in cost of sales and 3.3 points lower in our adjusted tax rate. We would expect a similar impact to continue through 2017.
Turning to Page 7. I would like to take a moment to provide an update on Amgen's transformation initiatives which we previously discussed at our July and October 2014 investor events. 2015 marks an exciting year as we are in full execution mode towards our focused operating model. We were advancing a number of key initiatives to streamline processes, increase agility and efficiency and improve operating performance. We also have completed and largely implemented the first phase of reductions in workforce announced in July, which will total approximately 3,000 and have made significant progress on reducing our facilities footprint towards the 23% goal.
In terms of the 2014 impact, all areas of operating expense benefited as our transformation to a focused operating model began to generate cost efficiencies. In 2014, we realized approximately $300 million of cost savings towards our $1.5 billion goal. This includes lower labor cost from workforce reductions and sales force optimization. It also includes lower external expenses from improved contracting and sourcing and rationalizing discretionary spend categories.
In 2015, we expect incremental savings of at least $400 million. This will, in large part, be driven by the annualization of savings following the reductions in workforce which occurred in late 2014. It also includes greater use of shared services and further external spend improvements, resulting from the rigorous transformation initiatives developed over the past year. These savings will be redeployed to underwrite launch investments and one-time transition costs incurred as part of the transformation implementation.
As a result of revenue growth and expense discipline in 2015, we will further improve adjusted operating margins on the trajectory to our 2018 target of 52% to 54% through improved operating leverage. We will continue to provide periodic updates on our transformation progress going forward.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 8. Based on our confidence in the performance of the business going forward, we announced the commitment to return 60% of adjusted net income to shareholders through 2018, while continuing to invest strongly in our business. For the full year 2014, we generated $7.8 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $2.2 billion over the prior year. This increase was driven by higher sales and profitability, as well as improvement in working capital, a portion of which are permanent.
As a result of this strong cash flow performance, total debt outstanding declined to $30.7 billion and total cash and investments increased to $27 billion. As a result, net debt improved by $5.6 billion to $3.7 billion at year-end 2014. Additionally, for 2014, we increased our quarterly dividend per share by 30% to $0.61, with payments totaling $1.9 billion. We also announced another 30% increase to the dividend to $0.79 per share, starting with our first quarter 2015 payment.
Finally, at our October meeting, we indicated the intent to accelerate the reinitiation of our share repurchase program with up to $2 billion of repurchases by the end of 2015. In the fourth quarter, we took a first step towards this commitment with $153 million deployed to repurchase approximately 900,000 shares in the period. We intend to continue repurchases at a stepped up level in 2015.
At the end of 2014, we have approximately 3.8 million remaining under our board authorized share repurchase program.
I will now turn to guidance for 2015, please turn to Page 9. As you will recall, we provided preliminary 2015 guidance at our October business review. In terms of what has changed since that time, we completed 2014 with solid, in-line operating performance with full year results of 7% revenue growth, 22% adjusted operating income growth and 14% adjusted EPS growth. With this background, we remain confident in the outlook for 2015 despite additional potential foreign exchange headwinds.
Today, we are reaffirming our 2015 revenue guidance of $20.8 billion to $28.1 billion, adjusted tax rate of 18% to 19%, which excludes the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in 2015, and adjusted earnings per share of $9.05 to $9.40 per share. Finally, capital expenditures are planned at $800 million this year.
This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Tony."

You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the fourth quarter, starting on Slide #11The underlying prescription demand remains strong, as we enter 2015. In 2014, the majority of products grew, in volume terms, across both the U.S. and x U.S. markets in quarter 4, as well as on a full year basis. Globally, product sales grew 8% year-over-year and 6% for the full year. Our international business grew 11% in the fourth quarter, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange. Our new and emerging markets delivered just over $1 billion in sales in 2014. So far, the first quarter of 2015 is playing out as anticipated. We are on track for the full year. And let me remind you that products like Prolia and Enbrel is starting to experience slower first quarters.
In assessing quarter-over-quarter performance, it's important to note U.S. wholesale inventory dynamics. On average, wholesale inventory levels return to normal from rather low levels at the end of quarter 3. There are some exceptions on the product basis which I'll cover later.
Let me now turn to the fourth quarter performance, beginning with Enbrel. Enbrel delivered strong growth of 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Underlying demand remains strong, as both the rheumatology and dermatology segments grew on a value basis by 24%. As expected in the fourth quarter, we saw inventory levels increase from the relatively low levels reported in quarter 3. Quarter 4 ended with approximately $40 million higher wholesale inventories than normal. We expect to see the drawdown of the slight build along with the typical seasonality in the first quarter. We remain confident in the value potential of Enbrel and expect to continue to drive meaningful growth during 2015.
Now turn to our franchise starting with Neulasta. Neulasta delivered year-over-year growth of 7% in the fourth quarter. The growth was driven mainly by price and to a lesser extent, unit demand, which included the benefit of the commercial rise required outside the U.S. from Roche as part of our international expansion strategy. Above said, the FDA recently approved the Neulasta On-Body Injector, and we look forward to bringing this innovative product to patients to the U.S. shortly. The Neulasta On-Body Injector benefits patient needs and provides an important differentiation from potential future competition.
X NEUPOGEN, which declined 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter due so branded competition in the U.S. as well as unfavorable changes in inventory levels and foreign exchange rates. Like Neulasta, this was partially offset by the benefit of the commercial rise required of Roche. In the U.S., 15 months since the launch of its first new competitor, NEUPOGEN has obtained over 80% share of the short-acting segment. The balance of the market is split between granacs [ph] and glucana [ph]. We continue to compete account by account and reinforce NEUPOGEN's long track record of clinical efficacy and reliable supply to patients. With potential competition from biosimilars expected in the U.S., we will leverage the success we've had in the U.S. versus branded competition, as well as our considerable experience with NEUPOGEN biosimilars in Europe.
I'll now move to work franchise starting with Prolia. Prolia delivered 33% growth year-over-year, as we continue to capture share in both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., unit share grew 6 percentage points over the year, exiting at 19% in the fourth quarter. We continue to see strong response from our DTC campaign, with 1 in 3 patients start postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment being prescribed Prolia.
In Europe, we completed the buyback of the Prolia TSK and transitioned the entire business to Amgen. We now also have reimbursement across all EU countries. Unit share grew 4 percentage points over the year, exiting at 13% in the fourth quarter. Both the U.S. and Europe have opportunity for continued growth.
XGEVA continue to capture share in the U.S. and EU markets and we expect to see segment share growth throughout 2015. U.S. unit share increased 4 percentage points over the year and is now just under half the segment. In Europe, unit share increased 8 percentage points for the year and is now just over 1/3 of the European market. Our brand strategy continues to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile.
Vectibix grew 3% year-over-year and continues to show strong unit growth across all regions, gaining share in first-line metastatic colorectal cancer in both the U.S. and Europe.
Now let me turn to Kyprolis, which delivered year-over-year growth of 25%, following the acquisition of Onyx in quarter 4 2013. Quarter-to-quarter, we saw continued unit growth at 6% in the U.S., but overall, net sales declined slightly due to an inventory drawdown. Kyprolis continues to maintain leading share in the third line multiple myeloma setting.
Announced earlier, I'm delighted to be completed the submission of the regulatory applications for treatment of relapse multiple myeloma in both the U.S. and Europe. Getting this into the label in the U.S. and launching in Europe will be the next major inflection point for Kyprolis. We look forward to enabling more patients to benefit from Kyprolis following these regulatory approvals.
Next is EPOGEN, which grew 3% year-over-year. Increases in price were offset by unit declines. Fourth quarter 2013 volume included a few large customer buy ins that did not occur in the fourth quarter 2014.
Our sales grew 2% year-over-year with the unit growth, you customer buy is in the quarter. Sensipar is saw year-over-year growth of 3%, as 10% unit growth and higher prices were offset by a low inventory levels.
Nplate continues to grow in both the U.S. and European markets, driving 7% unit growth. Quarter 4 was negatively impacted by inventory declines. Lastly We are pleased with the launch of following the swift FDA approval in December. Position and patient responses are indicative of the significant unmet need for patients with relapsed and refractory ALL. 
Regarding our upcoming launches, I'd like to share with you that our cardiovascular specialty sales force is now in place, focusing on disease state awareness and profiling target segments. We look forward to launching Corlanor, the new brand name for [indiscernible] in the U.S. and the new global brand name for evolocumab later this year. We see a significant opportunity to address unmet needs with these 2 benefits. In the U.S., over one million medically eligible chronic heart failure patients could benefit from Corlanor treatment once approved. In the U.S., Europe and Japan, over 25 million people have risk for cardiovascular disease have LDL above 100 grams per deciliter, despite current treatments and to benefit from once approved.
In closing, I'm confident in the strength of our underlying business. I'd like to thank the Amgen teams around the world for their outstanding performance in 2014. Looking forward, our focus in 2015 will be threefold: Firstly, the broader performance of growth products such as Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Sensipar and Nplate; secondly, the success we depend on matured brands for potential the new biosimilars and branded competition; and thirdly, to launch of several important new medicines.
I'll now pass it to Sean."

I'd like to thank the FDA at Amgen staff who worked tirelessly to drive this outcome. BLINCYTO provides patients with a breakthrough therapy for a terrible disease relapse refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL, validates our fight for immune ecology platform. We look forward to introducing our next drug, AMG 330 into the clinic directed at acute myelogenous leukemia later this year.
We were also very pleased to receive FDA approval for the novel on by the injection system for Neulasta, which will help address the issue of cutting to administer Neulasta no sooner than 24 hours following chemotherapy, which can be difficult for cancer patients and interfere with optimal use of the products.
As we announced today, we have submitted marketing applications for Kyprolis in the U.S. and Europe and for myeloma. Based on the INSPIRE data, which as you know was presented in detail at the ASH meeting and published in the Journal of medicine last year. We look forward to working with the regulators to make Kyprolis available to patients with earlier stage relapsed multiple myeloma, globally.
Two of our submissions under review by FDA did receive 3 months to their target action date. T-VEC for metastatic melanoma and ivabradine fourth quarter make heart failure. In the case of T-VEC, the agency requested additional manufactured data for this very unique product, which may require additional review time. In the case of -- the agency required more of the existing clinical data and were originally edge of the total for our heart failure specific submission, also potentially requiring the additional review time. We provided the data for both programs as requested. And we continue to work productively with regulators to bring these innovative medicines to patients who need them as soon as possible.
For or evolocumab, our coronary intravascular ultrasound study, which is critical for the product has completed enrollment, and our outcome study continues to enroll very well. We're also working closely with regulators on our filings.
We will also be presenting some new analyses from our evolocumab clinical program at the upcoming American college of scientific sessions including analyses of cardiovascular events in our ongoing open label extension studies.
AMG 334 or CGRP receptor antibody performed a very nicely in the dose study in patients with episodic migraine, resulting in our decision to move aggressively into Phase III later this year. This data will be presented at the scientific pharm in the first half of this year. A phase IIb dose study in chronic migraines is currently enrolling. We feel AMG 334 has the clear potential to be the best in class agent for migraine prophylaxis, with a favorable dose and schedule as a result of blocking the receptor rather than the ligand. We generated positive data from 3 Phase III psoriasis studies of ivabradine, our receptor and interceptor in 2014 including 2 studies will demonstrate superiority And we and our partner, AstraZeneca plan to file the data later this year. We also expect Phase III head-to-head data for AMG 416, our intravenous calcimimetic against Sensipar in the first half of this year. This year, we will also be reviewing the results of our phase IIb study with the oral formulation AMG 423 or [indiscernible], the data reader developing with site to kinetics. These data state of will be critical in informing our decisions on advancing AMG 423 into Phase III.
Turning to our oncology pipeline, in addition to our T-VEC study with evolocumab, we study of a static with antibody and enter the planning stage for additional such combination with checkpoint studies in other tumor types. We presented BLINCYTO's Phase II data for both minimal residual disease positive patients with ALL and our pivotal relapse refractory study in ALL at ash, along with Phase II data from our lymphoblastic the. We also present the data from Vectibix Phase II PEAK study, and Phase III client studies, supporting our approval for first-line use with follow up with metastatic colorectal cancer at the ASCO annual meeting and ASCO gastrointestinal cancer symposium. And we terminated our program [indiscernible] access in ovarian cancer as well as our rilotumumab program directed in gastric cancer due to this results.
Our recently announced collaboration with Pharma on the technology complements our existing body and oncolytic virus platforms, growing our overall immunotherapy capabilities. We have a very robust discovery program in Amgen, and the tight collaboration provides another modality we can employ in these targets in both liquid and solid tumors. Our biosimilar's programs are abandoned with Phase IIb data for our the new biosimilar in moderate to severe arthritis expected this quarter, and Phase III data for our Avastin biosimilar in advanced non-small cell lung cancer expected in the second half of this year.
Finally, I'd like to recognize the strong execution of the R&D organization and delivering for patients. 2014 was an unprecedented year for Amgen in terms of the volume of pivotal data and regulatory submissions with multiple clinical and regulatory milestones ahead of us in 2015. Bob?"

One is Amgen has about 75% of its sales currently are in the U.S. and 25% our non-U.S. So vis-à-vis other global companies, we have a relatively more limited level of exposure. Secondly, we have a 3-year rolling hedge program, so we're able to significantly offset in the short term foreign exchange movements, either plus or minus. And if you then look at where we are in terms of rates on a current basis, if you look at the year-over-year effect on revenue, if we were to stay at the current exchange rates through the balance of 2015, that would have about $250 million impact unfavorable year-over-year. So about 1 percentage point on revenue and above $0.05 a share versus what we've given as our original guidance. So with that in mind, we felt that it would be appropriate, given the range that we are working with and other developments that we felt that it appropriate to maintain our existing guidance despite those potential headwinds."

So it's likely that, that is difficult to overcome, our receptor antagonist is just more efficient and potent in ways to address this particular biology. And I think that will translate into a situation where the amount of drug that has to be administered presumably subcutaneously will be an issue for the clinical approach profiles. And I expect us to have the most favorable profile with respect to that, just basically on those principles. So we'll see how it plays out, but that's what I would expect. We haven't had our end of Phase II discussions with the agencies yet because we just saw the data quite recently. It's clear that both episodic and chronic migraine are separate regulatory entities, and that you can have an approval, for example, Botox is approved in chronic and not in episodic, you can have separate approvals. Whether the programs can be prosecuted together with some kind of efficiencies and how to coordinate those activities, it's something that we'll be -- we will be exploring with regulators.

Thank you, Arvind, and thank all of you for joining our call this afternoon. 2014 was really an outstanding year for us, and let me start with the financial highlights which include revenue growth of 7%, enabling us to eclipse $20 billion for the first time. Consistent with our international expansion objectives, sales outside of the U.S. grew by double-digit rates in 2014. Our adjusted operating income growth of 22% reflects our commitment to generating operating leverage from our business.
As you know, one of our objectives for 2014 was to deliver to shareholders $800 million of improved profitability from Enbrel. We exceeded that objective in 2014. In addition, our free cash flow grew by 40% to $7.8 billion. This strong financial performance and our confidence in the longer-term outlook enabled us to increase our dividend by 30% at 2014 and by 30% again for 2015 while increasing our stock buyback plans as well.
Turning now to our progress with innovation. We have an extraordinary flow of data from our pipeline in 2014. We generated positive pivotal data for 6 innovative programs and submitted 4 of them for regulatory approvals. To remind you, this includes filings for 2 immuno-oncology molecules, BLINCYTO and T-VEC; and 2 cardiovascular molecules, evolocumab and ivabradine.
In December, we received FDA approval for 2 products, including BLINCYTO and our on-body injector for Neulasta. BLINCYTO is an immuno-oncology agent which addresses an important need for acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients who currently have very limited options. More generally, we're excited about the proof of concept represented by this approval and look forward to progressing our BiTE programs in other forms of cancer as well. Our on-body injector for Neulasta also represents an important innovation for cancer patients and one which will help improve patient experience for those undergoing chemotherapy and at higher risks of infection. I'd like to point out, of course, that launches are now already underway for both of these products.
While 2014 was a watershed year for us in research and development, 2015 is sure to be another important year starting with the prospects of launching 3 additional innovative products including evolocumab, of course, for hypercholesterolemia; ivabradine for heart failure; and T-VEC for metastatic melanoma. And in addition to these launches in 2015, we expect regulatory submissions for Kyprolis, which we announced earlier today; brodalumab; and potentially, AMG 416; as well as the start of a Phase III program for AMG 334 in migraine and Phase III readouts from 2 of our biosimilar programs.
As we discussed in July and October, we began last year the process of transforming our company and importantly, we initiated this from a position of strength. David will update you momentarily on our progress with that transformation and the benefits achieved in 2014. We are on track, as reflected in our $1.5 billion growth in operating income and 6-point operating margin improvement last year, even while absorbing the full year impact of Onyx and investing in our long-term opportunities. Across our company, we'll continue our transformation efforts in 2015 and deliver more progress against our long-term objectives.
Before I hand over to David, let me thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their unwavering focus on delivering for patients and for shareholders. David?"

Other revenues at $187 million (sic) [$157 million] decreased by $55 million versus the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting a reduced level of partnership payments received for brodalumab compared to last year's fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income at $2 billion grew 15% from prior year. On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 15.9% improved by 0.1 points. Research and development expenses at $1.2 billion were flat versus prior year and included the $60 million upfront payment to Kite Pharma for our cancer immunotherapy collaboration.
SG&A expenses were flat year-on-year. On October 31, 2014, the company passed the 1-year anniversary of the first step-down in Enbrel-related payments. This resulted in a year-over-year expense decline of approximately $100 million in Q4. This compares to year-over-year expense declines of approximately $250 million per quarter in the first 3 quarters of 2014.
Additionally, we incurred incremental expenses in Q4 in preparation for new product launches. These increased investments were offset through savings from our transformation to a more focused operating model as well as through the reduced Enbrel-related payments. Other income and expenses were flat year-over-year at $173 million in the quarter.
The tax rate was 10.2% for the quarter, a 2.5-point decrease versus Q4 2013. This decrease was primarily due to the favorable tax benefit from the extension of the 2014 federal R&D tax credit which occurred in Q4 of 2014, which was offset partially by unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings. As a result, adjusted net income increased 20%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 19%.
In summary, our fourth quarter results from operations were in line with our previous expectations, while overall results in the quarter benefited from the extension of the R&D tax credit, which was approved in late December and have been removed from our previous guidance. You will find a summary of our 2014 full year results on Page 6 of the presentation.
Our 2014 full year revenues grew 7% to $20.1 billion, and adjusted earnings per share grew 14% to $8.70 per share. Product sales grew 6% year-over-year, and other revenues increased by $252 million over the same period a year ago, primarily driven by our Nexavar and Stivarga partnerships. For the full year, adjusted operating income grew to $8.5 billion, a 22% increase based on the combination of solid revenue growth along with stable operating expenses, which were down 1% year-over-year.
On an adjusted basis, cost of sales margin was flat at 15.8% year-over-year. Research and development expenses increased 5% driven by the addition of Onyx and support for later-stage clinical programs. These increases were offset partially by lower spending associated with marketed product support. SG&A expenses were down 10% driven primarily by reduced Enbrel-related expenses, offset partially by the addition of Onyx and increased commercial expenses in preparation for new product launches.
Other income and expenses were unfavorable 7% year-over-year due to higher interest expense and portfolio rebalancing partially offset by higher interest income. The tax rate was 14.9% for the full year, up 5.7 points versus 2013. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a favorable resolution in 2013 of our federal income tax audit as well as the retroactive extension of the 2012 federal R&D tax credit in 2013.
During 2014, the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax was 1.9 points higher in cost of sales and 3.3 points lower in our adjusted tax rate. We would expect a similar impact to continue through 2017.
Turning to Page 7. I would like to take a moment to provide an update on Amgen's transformation initiatives which we previously discussed at our July and October 2014 investor events.
2015 marks an exciting year as we are in full execution mode towards our focused operating model. We were advancing a number of key initiatives to streamline processes, increase agility and efficiency and improve operating performance. We also have completed and largely implemented the first phase of reductions in workforce announced in July, which will total approximately 3,000 and have made significant progress on reducing our facilities footprint towards the 23% goal.
In terms of the 2014 impact, all areas of operating expense benefited as our transformation to a focused operating model began to generate cost efficiencies. In 2014, we realized approximately $300 million of cost savings towards our $1.5 billion goal. This includes lower labor cost from workforce reductions and sales force optimization. It also includes lower external expenses from improved contracting and sourcing and rationalizing discretionary spend categories.
In 2015, we expect incremental savings of at least $400 million. This will, in large part, be driven by the annualization of savings following the reductions in workforce which occurred in late 2014. It also includes greater use of shared services and further external spend improvements, resulting from the rigorous transformation initiatives developed over the past year. These savings will be redeployed to underwrite launch investments and one-time transition costs incurred as part of the transformation implementation.
As a result of revenue growth and expense discipline in 2015, we will further improve adjusted operating margins on the trajectory to our 2018 target of 52% to 54% through improved operating leverage. We will continue to provide periodic updates on our transformation progress going forward.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 8. Based on our confidence in the performance of the business going forward, we announced a commitment to return 60% of adjusted net income to shareholders through 2018 while continuing to invest strongly in our business. For the full year 2014, we generated $7.8 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $2.2 billion over the prior year. This increase was driven by higher sales and profitability as well as improvement in working capital, a portion of which are permanent.
As a result of this strong cash flow performance, total debt outstanding declined to $30.7 billion and total cash and investments increased to $27 billion. As a result, net debt improved by $5.6 billion to $3.7 billion at year-end 2014. Additionally, for 2014, we increased our quarterly dividend per share by 30% to $0.61, with payments totaling $1.9 billion. We also announced another 30% increase to the dividend to $0.79 per share starting with our first quarter 2015 payment.
Finally, at our October meeting, we indicated the intent to accelerate the re-initiation of our share repurchase program with up to $2 billion of repurchases by the end of 2015. In the fourth quarter, we took a first step towards this commitment with $153 million deployed to repurchase approximately 900,000 shares in the period. We intend to continue repurchases at a stepped up level in 2015. At the end of 2014, we had approximately $3.8 billion remaining under our board authorized share repurchase program.
I will now turn to guidance for 2015, please turn to Page 9. As you will recall, we provided preliminary 2015 guidance at our October business review. In terms of what has changed since that time, we completed 2014 with solid, in-line operating performance with full year results of 7% revenue growth, 22% adjusted operating income growth and 14% adjusted EPS growth. With this background, we remain confident in the outlook for 2015 despite additional potential foreign exchange headwinds.
Today, we are reaffirming our 2015 revenue guidance of $20.8 billion to $21.3 billion; adjusted tax rate of 18% to 19%, which excludes the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in 2015; and adjusted earnings per share of $9.05 to $9.40 a share. Finally, capital expenditures are planned at $800 million this year.
This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Tony."

You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the fourth quarter starting on Slide #11. The underlying prescription demand remains strong as we enter 2015. In 2014, the majority of products grew in volu",1200,"Thank you, David. Good afternoon, folks. You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the fourth quarter starting on Slide #11. The underlying prescription demand remains strong as we enter 2015. In 2014, the majority of products grew in volume terms across both the U.S. and x U.S. markets in quarter 4 as well as on a full year basis. Globally, product sales grew 8% year-over-year and 6% for the full year. Our international business grew 11% in the fourth quarter, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange. Our new and emerging markets delivered just over $1 billion in sales in 2014.
So far, the first quarter of 2015 is playing out as anticipated. We are on track for the full year, and let me remind you that products like Prolia and Enbrel historically experience slower first quarters.
In assessing quarter-over-quarter performance, it's important to note U.S. wholesaler inventory dynamics. On average, wholesaler inventory levels returned to normal from rather low levels at the end of quarter 3. There are some exceptions on a product basis which I'll cover later.
Let me now turn to the fourth quarter performance, beginning with Enbrel. Enbrel delivered strong growth of 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Underlying demand remained strong, as both the rheumatology and dermatology segments grew on a value basis by 24%. As expected, in the fourth quarter we saw inventory levels increase from the relatively low levels we reported in quarter 3.
Quarter 4 ended with approximately $40 million higher wholesaler inventory than normal. We expect to see the drawdown of the slight build along with the typical seasonality in the first quarter. We remain confident in the value potential of Enbrel and expect to continue to drive meaningful growth during 2015.
Now turn to our filgrastim franchise, starting with Neulasta. Neulasta delivered year-over-year growth of 7% in the fourth quarter. The growth was driven mainly by price and to a lesser extent, unit demand, which included the benefit of the commercial rights we acquired outside the U.S. from Roche as part of our international expansion strategy. As Bob said, the FDA recently approved the Neulasta on-body injector, and we look forward to bringing this innovative product to patients in the U.S. shortly. The Neulasta on-body injector better serves patient needs and provides an important differentiation from potential future competition.
Next, NEUPOGEN, which declined 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to branded short-acting competition in the U.S. as well as unfavorable changes in inventory levels and foreign exchange rates. Like Neulasta, this was partially offset by the benefit of the commercial rights we acquired from Roche.
In the U.S., 15 months since the launch of its first new competitor, NEUPOGEN has obtained over 80% share of the short-acting segment. The balance of the market is split between Granix and Leukine. We continue to compete account by account and reinforce NEUPOGEN's long track record of clinical efficacy and reliable supply to patients. With potential competition from biosimilars expected in the U.S., we will leverage the success we've had in the U.S. versus branded competition as well as our considerable experience with NEUPOGEN biosimilars in Europe.
I'll now move to our denosumab franchise, starting with Prolia. Prolia delivered 33% growth year-over-year as we continue to capture share in both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., unit share grew 6 percentage points over the year, exiting at 19% in the fourth quarter. We continue to see strong response from our DTC campaign, with 1 in 3 patients who start postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment being prescribed Prolia.
In Europe, we completed the buyback of the Prolia rights from GSK and transitioned the entire business to Amgen. We now also have reimbursement across all EU countries. Unit share grew 4 percentage points over the year, exiting at 13% in the fourth quarter. Both the U.S. and Europe have opportunity for continued growth.
XGEVA continues to capture share in the U.S. and EU markets, and we expect to see continued segment share growth throughout 2015. U.S. unit share increased 4 percentage points over the year and is now just under half the segment. In Europe, unit share increased 8 percentage points over the year and is now just over 1/3 of the European market. Our brand strategy continues to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile.
Vectibix grew 29% year-over-year and continues to show strong unit growth across all regions, gaining share in first-line metastatic colorectal cancer in both the U.S. and Europe.
Now let me turn to Kyprolis, which delivered year-over-year growth of 25% following the acquisition of Onyx in quarter 4 2013. Quarter-over-quarter, we saw continued unit growth at 6% in the U.S. But overall, net sales declined slightly due to an inventory drawdown. Kyprolis continues to maintain leading share in the third-line multiple myeloma setting.
As announced earlier, I'm delighted that we completed the submission of the regulatory applications for the treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma in both the U.S. and Europe. Getting this into the label in the U.S. and launching in Europe will be the next major inflection point for Kyprolis. We look forward to enabling more patients to benefit from Kyprolis following these regulatory approvals.
Next is EPOGEN, which grew 3% year-over-year. Increases in price were offset by unit declines. Fourth quarter 2013 volume included a few large customer buy-ins that did not occur in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Aranesp sales grew 2% year-over-year with unit growth from a few large customer buy-ins in the U.S. Sensipar saw year-over-year growth of 3%, as 10% unit growth and higher prices were offset by low inventory levels.
Nplate continues to grow in both the U.S. and European markets, driving 7% unit growth. Quarter 4 was negatively impacted by inventory declines.
Lastly, BLINCYTO. We are pleased with the initial launch of BLINCYTO following the swift FDA approval in December. Physician and patient responses are indicative of the significant unmet need for patients with relapsed and refractory ALL.
Regarding our upcoming launches, I'd like to share with you that our cardiovascular specialty sales force is now in place, focusing on disease state awareness and profiling target segments. We look forward to launching Corlanor, the new brand name for ivabradine in the U.S. and Repatha, the new global brand name for evolocumab, later this year.
We see a significant opportunity to address unmet need with these 2 medicines. In the U.S., over 1 million medically eligible chronic heart failure patients could benefit from Corlanor treatment once approved. In the U.S., Europe and Japan, over 25 million people at risk for cardiovascular disease have LDL above 100 grams per deciliter despite current treatments and could benefit from Repatha once approved.
In closing, I'm confident in the strength of our underlying business. I'd like to thank the Amgen teams around the world for their outstanding performance in 2014. Looking forward, our focus in 2015 will be threefold: firstly, to build on the performance of growth products such as Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Sensipar and Nplate; secondly, to successfully defend our mature brands from potential new biosimilars and branded competition; and thirdly, to launch several important new medicines.
Let me now pass it to Sean."
24816,281280980,749700,"Amgen Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2015",2015-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. 2014 was a very productive year for R&D, and the last several months had been eventful as well with one regulatory highlight being the FDA approval of BLINCYTO in a remarkable 2.5 months after initial submission. I'd like",904,"Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. 2014 was a very productive year for R&D, and the last several months had been eventful as well with one regulatory highlight being the FDA approval of BLINCYTO in a remarkable 2.5 months after initial submission. I'd like to thank the FDA and Amgen staff who worked tirelessly to drive this outcome. BLINCYTO provides patients with a breakthrough therapy for a terrible disease, relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia or ALL, and clearly validates our BiTE immuno-oncology platform. We look forward to introducing our next BiTE, AMG 330, into the clinic directed at acute myelogenous leukemia later this year.
We were also very pleased to receive FDA approval for a novel on-body injection system for Neulasta, which will help address the issue of having to administer Neulasta no sooner than 24 hours following chemotherapy, which can be difficult for cancer patients and interfere with the optimal use of the product.
As we announced today, we have submitted marketing applications for Kyprolis in the U.S. and Europe in relapsed multiple myeloma based on the ASPIRE data, which as you know was presented in detail at the ASH meeting and published in New England Journal of Medicine late last year. We look forward to working with regulators to make Kyprolis available to patients with earlier stage relapsed multiple myeloma globally.
Two of our submissions under review by FDA did receive 3-month extensions to their target action date: T-VEC for metastatic melanoma and Corlanor, or ivabradine, for chronic heart failure. In the case of T-VEC, the agency requested additional manufacturing data for this very unique product, which may require additional review time. In the case of Corlanor, the agency requested more of the existing clinical data than were originally agreed to for our heart failure-specific submission, also potentially requiring the additional review time. We provided the data for both programs as requested, and we continue to work productively with regulators to bring these innovative medicines to the patients that need them as soon as possible.
For Repatha, or evolocumab, our coronary intravascular ultrasound study, which is critical for the product, has completed enrollment, and our outcome study continues to enroll very well. We're also working closely with regulators on our filings. We will also be presenting some new analyses from our evolocumab clinical program at the upcoming American College of Cardiology scientific sessions including analyses of cardiovascular events in our ongoing open label extension studies.
AMG 334, our CGRP receptor antibody, performed very nicely in a Phase IIb dose-ranging study in patients with episodic migraine, resulting in our decision to move aggressively into Phase III later this year. This data will be presented at a scientific forum in the first half of this year. A Phase IIb dose-ranging study in chronic migraine is currently enrolling. We feel AMG 334 has the clear potential to be a best-in-class agent for migraine prophylaxis, with a favorable dose and schedule as a result of blocking the receptor rather than the ligand. We generated positive data from 3 Phase III psoriasis studies of brodalumab, our IL-17 receptor antibody, in 2014 including 2 studies that demonstrate its superiority to STELARA. And we and our partners at AstraZeneca plan to file this data later this year.
We also expect Phase III head-to-head data for AMG 416, our intravenous calcimimetic, against Sensipar in the first half of this year. This year, we will also be reviewing the results of our Phase IIb study with the oral formulation of AMG 423, or omecamtiv mecarbil, the innovative cardiac myosin activator we were developing with Cytokinetics. These data will be critical in informing our decisions on advancing AMG 423 into Phase III.
Turning to our oncology pipeline. In addition to our T-VEC combination study with evolocumab, we've initiated a combination metastatic melanoma study with T-VEC and Merck's PD-1 antibody and are in the planning stage for additional such combination with checkpoint inhibitor studies in other tumor types.
We presented BLINCYTO Phase II data for both minimal residual disease positive patients with ALL and our pivotal relapsed/refractory study in ALL at ASH, along with Phase II data from our lymphoma study. We also presented data from Vectibix Phase II PEAK study and Phase III PRIME studies, supporting our approval for first-line use with FOLFOX in metastatic colorectal cancer at the ASCO Annual Meeting and ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium. And we terminated our trebananib program directed against the angiopoietin axis in recurring ovarian cancer as well as our rilotumumab program directed against the MET axis in gastric cancer due to disappointing results.
Our recently announced collaboration with Kite Pharma on CAR T cell technology complements our existing BiTE and oncolytic virus platforms, broadening our overall immunotherapy capabilities. We have a very robust antigen discovery program at Amgen, and the Kite collaboration provides another modality we can employ against these targets in both liquid and solid tumors. Our biosimilars programs are advancing with Phase III data for our HUMIRA biosimilar in moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis expected this quarter and Phase III data for our Avastin biosimilar in advanced non-small cell lung cancer expected in the second half of this year.
Finally, I'd like to recognize the strong execution of the R&D organization in delivering for patients. 2014 was an unprecedented year for Amgen in terms of the volume of pivotal data and regulatory submissions with multiple clinical and regulatory milestones ahead of us in 2015. Bob?"

It's true in animal models. We're seeing the same thing in the clinic. So it's likely that, that is difficult to overcome. A receptor antagonist is just a more efficient and potent way to address this particular biology. And I think that will translate into a situation where the amount of drug that has to be administered presumably subcutaneously will be an issue for the clinical approach profiles, and I expect us to have the most favorable profile with respect to that just basically on those principles. So we'll see how it plays out, but that's what I would expect. We haven't had our end of Phase II discussions with the agencies yet because we just saw the data quite recently. It's clear that both episodic and chronic migraine are separate regulatory entities and that you can have an approval, for example, Botox is approved in chronic and not in episodic. You can have separate approvals. Whether the programs can be prosecuted together with some kind of efficiencies and how to coordinate those activities is something that we'll be -- we will be exploring with regulators.

Remember, this of course is a receptor-blocking antibody rather than a ligand sequester, and we know there are multiple ligands for the receptor.

And I think that number will be the first example of that question, and then of course we'll see CLARION, which we'll look at that same question in the first-line setting.

Thank you, Arvind, and thank all of you for joining our call this afternoon. 2014 was really an outstanding year for us, and let me start with the financial highlights which include revenue growth of 7%, enabling us to eclipse $20 billion for the first time. Consistent with our international expansion objectives, sales outside of the U.S. grew by double-digit rates in 2014. Our adjusted operating income growth of 22% reflects our commitment to generating operating leverage from our business.
As you know, one of our objectives for 2014 was to deliver to shareholders $800 million of improved profitability from Enbrel. We exceeded that objective in 2014. In addition, our free cash flow grew by 40% to $7.8 billion. This strong financial performance and our confidence in the longer-term outlook enabled us to increase our dividend by 30% at 2014 and by 30% again for 2015 while increasing our stock buyback plans as well.
Turning now to our progress with innovation. We have an extraordinary flow of data from our pipeline in 2014. We generated positive pivotal data for 6 innovative programs and submitted 4 of them for regulatory approvals. To remind you, this includes filings for 2 immuno-oncology molecules, BLINCYTO and T-VEC; and 2 cardiovascular molecules, evolocumab and ivabradine.
In December, we received FDA approval for 2 products, including BLINCYTO and our on-body injector for Neulasta. BLINCYTO is an immuno-oncology agent which addresses an important need for acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients who currently have very limited options. More generally, we're excited about the proof of concept represented by this approval and look forward to progressing our BiTE programs in other forms of cancer as well. Our on-body injector for Neulasta also represents an important innovation for cancer patients and one which will help improve patient experience for those undergoing chemotherapy and at higher risks of infection. I'd like to point out, of course, that launches are now already underway for both of these products.
While 2014 was a watershed year for us in research and development, 2015 is sure to be another important year starting with the prospects of launching 3 additional innovative products including evolocumab, of course, for hypercholesterolemia; ivabradine for heart failure; and T-VEC for metastatic melanoma. And in addition to these launches in 2015, we expect regulatory submissions for Kyprolis, which we announced earlier today; brodalumab; and potentially, AMG 416; as well as the start of a Phase III program for AMG 334 in migraine and Phase III readouts from 2 of our biosimilar programs.
As we discussed in July and October, we began last year the process of transforming our company and importantly, we initiated this from a position of strength. David will update you momentarily on our progress with that transformation and the benefits achieved in 2014. We are on track, as reflected in our $1.5 billion growth in operating income and 6-point operating margin improvement last year, even while absorbing the full year impact of Onyx and investing in our launch opportunities. Across our company, we'll continue our transformation efforts in 2015 and deliver more progress against our long-term objectives.
Before I hand over to David, let me thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their unwavering focus on delivering for patients and for shareholders. David?"

Turning to the fourth quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck. Revenues grew to $5.3 billion by 6% year-over-year, with 8% product sales growth driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenues at $187 million (sic)",1310,"Okay. Thanks, Bob. Turning to the fourth quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck. Revenues grew to $5.3 billion by 6% year-over-year, with 8% product sales growth driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenues at $187 million (sic) [$157 million] decreased by $55 million versus the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting a reduced level of partnership payments received for brodalumab compared to last year's fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income at $2 billion grew 15% from prior year. On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 15.9% improved by 0.1 points. Research and development expenses at $1.2 billion were flat versus prior year and included the $60 million upfront payment to Kite Pharma for our cancer immunotherapy collaboration.
SG&A expenses were flat year-on-year. On October 31, 2014, the company passed the 1-year anniversary of the first step-down in Enbrel-related payments. This resulted in a year-over-year expense decline of approximately $100 million in Q4. This compares to year-over-year expense declines of approximately $250 million per quarter in the first 3 quarters of 2014.
Additionally, we incurred incremental expenses in Q4 in preparation for new product launches. These increased investments were offset through savings from our transformation to a more focused operating model as well as through the reduced Enbrel-related payments. Other income and expenses were flat year-over-year at $173 million in the quarter.
The tax rate was 10.2% for the quarter, a 2.5-point decrease versus Q4 2013. This decrease was primarily due to the favorable tax benefit from the extension of the 2014 federal R&D tax credit which occurred in Q4 of 2014, which was offset partially by unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings. As a result, adjusted net income increased 20%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 19%.
In summary, our fourth quarter results from operations were in line with our previous expectations, while overall results in the quarter benefited from the extension of the R&D tax credit, which was approved in late December and have been removed from our previous guidance. You will find a summary of our 2014 full year results on Page 6 of the presentation.
Our 2014 full year revenues grew 7% to $20.1 billion, and adjusted earnings per share grew 14% to $8.70 per share. Product sales grew 6% year-over-year, and other revenues increased by $252 million over the same period a year ago, primarily driven by our Nexavar and Stivarga partnerships. For the full year, adjusted operating income grew to $8.5 billion, a 22% increase based on the combination of solid revenue growth along with stable operating expenses, which were down 1% year-over-year.
On an adjusted basis, cost of sales margin was flat at 15.8% year-over-year. Research and development expenses increased 5% driven by the addition of Onyx and support for later-stage clinical programs. These increases were offset partially by lower spending associated with marketed product support. SG&A expenses were down 10% driven primarily by reduced Enbrel-related expenses, offset partially by the addition of Onyx and increased commercial expenses in preparation for new product launches.
Other income and expenses were unfavorable 7% year-over-year due to higher interest expense and portfolio rebalancing partially offset by higher interest income. The tax rate was 14.9% for the full year, up 5.7 points versus 2013. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to favorable resolution in 2013 of our federal income tax audit as well as the retroactive extension of the 2012 federal R&D tax credit in 2013.
During 2014, the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax was 1.9 points higher in cost of sales and 3.3 points lower in our adjusted tax rate. We would expect a similar impact to continue through 2017.
Turning to Page 7. I would like to take a moment to provide an update on Amgen's transformation initiatives which we previously discussed at our July and October 2014 investor events.
2015 marks an exciting year as we are in full execution mode towards our focused operating model. We were advancing a number of key initiatives to streamline processes, increase agility and efficiency and improve operating performance. We also have completed and largely implemented the first phase of reductions in workforce announced in July, which will total approximately 3,000, and have made significant progress on reducing our facilities footprint towards the 23% goal.
In terms of the 2014 impact, all areas of operating expense benefited as our transformation to a focused operating model began to generate cost efficiencies. In 2014, we realized approximately $300 million of cost savings towards our $1.5 billion goal. This includes lower labor cost from workforce reductions and sales force optimization. It also includes lower external expenses from improved contracting and sourcing and rationalizing discretionary spend categories.
In 2015, we expect incremental savings of at least $400 million. This will, in large part, be driven by the annualization of savings following the reductions in workforce which occurred in late 2014. It also includes greater use of shared services and further external spend improvements, resulting from the rigorous transformation initiatives developed over the past year. These savings will be redeployed to underwrite launch investments and one-time transition costs incurred as part of the transformation implementation.
As a result of revenue growth and expense discipline in 2015, we will further improve adjusted operating margins on the trajectory to our 2018 target of 52% to 54% through improved operating leverage. We will continue to provide periodic updates on our transformation progress going forward.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 8. Based on our confidence in the performance of the business going forward, we announced a commitment to return 60% of adjusted net income to shareholders through 2018 while continuing to invest strongly in our business. For the full year 2014, we generated $7.8 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $2.2 billion over the prior year. This increase was driven by higher sales and profitability as well as improvement in working capital, a portion of which are permanent.
As a result of this strong cash flow performance, total debt outstanding declined to $30.7 billion and total cash and investments increased to $27 billion. As a result, net debt improved by $5.6 billion to $3.7 billion at year-end 2014. Additionally, for 2014, we increased our quarterly dividend per share by 30% to $0.61, with payments totaling $1.9 billion. We also announced another 30% increase to the dividend to $0.79 per share starting with our first quarter 2015 payment.
Finally, at our October meeting, we indicated the intent to accelerate the re-initiation of our share repurchase program with up to $2 billion of repurchases by the end of 2015. In the fourth quarter, we took a first step towards this commitment with $153 million deployed to repurchase approximately 900,000 shares in the period. We intend to continue repurchases at a stepped up level in 2015. At the end of 2014, we had approximately $3.8 billion remaining under our board authorized share repurchase program.
I will now turn to guidance for 2015, please turn to Page 9. As you will recall, we provided preliminary 2015 guidance at our October business review. In terms of what has changed since that time, we completed 2014 with solid, in-line operating performance with full year results of 7% revenue growth, 22% adjusted operating income growth and 14% adjusted EPS growth. With this background, we remain confident in the outlook for 2015 despite additional potential foreign exchange headwinds.
Today, we are reaffirming our 2015 revenue guidance of $20.8 billion to $21.3 billion; adjusted tax rate of 18% to 19%, which excludes the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in 2015; and adjusted earnings per share of $9.05 to $9.40 a share. Finally, capital expenditures are planned at $800 million this year.
This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Tony."

You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the fourth quarter starting on Slide #11. The underlying prescription demand remains strong as we enter 2015. In 2014, the majority of products grew in volu",1200,"Thank you, David. Good afternoon, folks. You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the fourth quarter starting on Slide #11. The underlying prescription demand remains strong as we enter 2015. In 2014, the majority of products grew in volume terms across both the U.S. and x U.S. markets in quarter 4 as well as on a full year basis. Globally, product sales grew 8% year-over-year and 6% for the full year. Our international business grew 11% in the fourth quarter, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange. Our new and emerging markets delivered just over $1 billion in sales in 2014.
So far, the first quarter of 2015 is playing out as anticipated. We are on track for the full year, and let me remind you that products like Prolia and Enbrel historically experience slower first quarters.
In assessing quarter-over-quarter performance, it's important to note U.S. wholesaler inventory dynamics. On average, wholesaler inventory levels returned to normal from rather low levels at the end of quarter 3. There are some exceptions on a product basis which I'll cover later.
Let me now turn to the fourth quarter performance, beginning with Enbrel. Enbrel delivered strong growth of 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Underlying demand remained strong, as both the rheumatology and dermatology segments grew on a value basis by 24%. As expected, in the fourth quarter we saw inventory levels increase from the relatively low levels we reported in quarter 3.
Quarter 4 ended with approximately $40 million higher wholesaler inventories than normal. We expect to see the drawdown of the slight build along with the typical seasonality in the first quarter. We remain confident in the value potential of Enbrel and expect to continue to drive meaningful growth during 2015.
Now turn to our filgrastim franchise, starting with Neulasta. Neulasta delivered year-over-year growth of 7% in the fourth quarter. The growth was driven mainly by price and to a lesser extent, unit demand, which included the benefit of the commercial rights we acquired outside the U.S. from Roche as part of our international expansion strategy. As Bob said, the FDA recently approved the Neulasta on-body injector, and we look forward to bringing this innovative product to patients in the U.S. shortly. The Neulasta on-body injector better serves patient needs and provides an important differentiation from potential future competition.
Next, NEUPOGEN, which declined 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to branded short-acting competition in the U.S. as well as unfavorable changes in inventory levels and foreign exchange rates. Like Neulasta, this was partially offset by the benefit of the commercial rights we acquired from Roche.
In the U.S., 15 months since the launch of its first new competitor, NEUPOGEN has retained over 80% share of the short-acting segment. The balance of the market is split between Granix and Leukine. We continue to compete account by account and reinforce NEUPOGEN's long track record of clinical efficacy and reliable supply to patients. With potential competition from biosimilars expected in the U.S., we will leverage the success we've had in the U.S. versus branded competition as well as our considerable experience with NEUPOGEN biosimilars in Europe.
I'll now move to our denosumab franchise, starting with Prolia. Prolia delivered 33% growth year-over-year as we continue to capture share in both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., unit share grew 6 percentage points over the year, exiting at 19% in the fourth quarter. We continue to see strong response from our DTC campaign, with 1 in 3 patients who start postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment being prescribed Prolia.
In Europe, we completed the buyback of the Prolia rights from GSK and transitioned the entire business to Amgen. We now also have reimbursement across all EU countries. Unit share grew 4 percentage points over the year, exiting at 13% in the fourth quarter. Both the U.S. and Europe have opportunity for continued growth.
XGEVA continues to capture share in the U.S. and EU markets, and we expect to see continued segment share growth throughout 2015. U.S. unit share increased 4 percentage points over the year and is now just under half the segment. In Europe, unit share increased 8 percentage points over the year and is now just over 1/3 of the European market. Our brand strategy continues to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile.
Vectibix grew 29% year-over-year and continues to show strong unit growth across all regions, gaining share in first-line metastatic colorectal cancer in both the U.S. and Europe.
Now let me turn to Kyprolis, which delivered year-over-year growth of 25% following the acquisition of Onyx in quarter 4 2013. Quarter-over-quarter, we saw continued unit growth at 6% in the U.S. But overall, net sales declined slightly due to an inventory drawdown. Kyprolis continues to maintain leading share in the third-line multiple myeloma setting.
As announced earlier, I'm delighted that we completed the submission of the regulatory applications for the treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma in both the U.S. and Europe. Getting this into the label in the U.S. and launching in Europe will be the next major inflection points for Kyprolis. We look forward to enabling more patients to benefit from Kyprolis following these regulatory approvals.
Next is EPOGEN, which grew 3% year-over-year. Increases in price were offset by unit declines. Fourth quarter 2013 volume included a few large customer buy-ins that did not occur in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Aranesp sales grew 2% year-over-year with unit growth from a few large customer buy-ins in the U.S. Sensipar saw year-over-year growth of 3%, as 10% unit growth and higher prices were offset by low inventory levels.
Nplate continues to grow in both the U.S. and European markets, driving 7% unit growth. Quarter 4 was negatively impacted by inventory declines.
Lastly, BLINCYTO. We are pleased with the initial launch of BLINCYTO following a swift FDA approval in December. Physician and patient responses are indicative of the significant unmet need for patients with relapsed and refractory ALL.
Regarding our upcoming launches, I'd like to share with you that our cardiovascular specialty sales force is now in place, focusing on disease state awareness and profiling target segments. We look forward to launching Corlanor, the new brand name for ivabradine in the U.S., and Repatha, the new global brand name for evolocumab, later this year.
We see a significant opportunity to address unmet need with these 2 medicines. In the U.S., over 1 million medically eligible chronic heart failure patients could benefit from Corlanor treatment once approved. In the U.S., Europe and Japan, over 25 million people at risk for cardiovascular disease have LDL above 100 grams per deciliter despite current treatments and could benefit from Repatha once approved.
In closing, I'm confident in the strength of our underlying business. I'd like to thank the Amgen teams around the world for their outstanding performance in 2014. Looking forward, our focus in 2015 will be threefold: firstly, to build on the performance of growth products such as Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Sensipar and Nplate; secondly, to successfully defend our mature brands from potential new biosimilars and branded competition; and thirdly, to launch several important new medicines.
Let me now pass it to Sean."
24816,281280980,749703,"Amgen Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2015",2015-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. 2014 was a very productive year for R&D, and the last several months had been eventful as well with one regulatory highlight being the FDA approval of BLINCYTO in a remarkable 2.5 months after initial submission. I'd like",903,"Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. 2014 was a very productive year for R&D, and the last several months had been eventful as well with one regulatory highlight being the FDA approval of BLINCYTO in a remarkable 2.5 months after initial submission. I'd like to thank the FDA and Amgen staff who worked tirelessly to drive this outcome. BLINCYTO provides patients with a breakthrough therapy for a terrible disease, relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia or ALL, and clearly validates our BiTE immuno-oncology platform. We look forward to introducing our next BiTE, AMG 330, into the clinic directed at acute myelogenous leukemia later this year.
We were also very pleased to receive FDA approval for a novel on-body injection system for Neulasta, which will help address the issue of having to administer Neulasta no sooner than 24 hours following chemotherapy, which can be difficult for cancer patients and interfere with optimal use of the products.
As we announced today, we have submitted marketing applications for Kyprolis in the U.S. and Europe in relapsed multiple myeloma based on the ASPIRE data, which as you know was presented in detail at the ASH meeting and published in New England Journal of Medicine late last year. We look forward to working with regulators to make Kyprolis available to patients with earlier stage relapsed multiple myeloma globally.
2 of our submissions under review by FDA did receive 3-month extensions to their target action date: T-VEC for metastatic melanoma and Corlanor, or ivabradine, for chronic heart failure. In the case of T-VEC, the agency requested additional manufacturing data for this very unique product, which may require additional review time. In the case of Corlanor, the agency requested more of the existing clinical data than were originally agreed to for our heart failure-specific submission, also potentially requiring the additional review time. We provided the data for both programs as requested, and we continue to work productively with regulators to bring these innovative medicines to the patients that need them as soon as possible.
For Repatha, or evolocumab, our coronary intravascular ultrasound study, which is critical for the product, has completed enrollment, and our outcome study continues to enroll very well. We're also working closely with regulators on our filings. We will also be presenting some new analyses from our evolocumab clinical program at the upcoming American College of Cardiology scientific sessions including analyses of cardiovascular events in our ongoing open label extension studies.
AMG 334, our CGRP receptor antibody, performed very nicely in a Phase IIb dose-ranging study in patients with episodic migraine, resulting in our decision to move aggressively into Phase III later this year. These data will be presented at a scientific forum in the first half of this year. A Phase IIb dose-ranging study in chronic migraine is currently enrolling. We feel AMG 334 has the clear potential to be a best-in-class agent for migraine prophylaxis, with a favorable dose and schedule as a result of blocking the receptor rather than the ligand. We generated positive data from 3 Phase III psoriasis studies of brodalumab, our IL-17 receptor antibody, in 2014 including 2 studies that demonstrate its superiority to STELARA. And we and our partners at AstraZeneca plan to file this data later this year.
We also expect Phase III head-to-head data for AMG 416, our intravenous calcimimetic, against Sensipar in the first half of this year. This year, we will also be reviewing the results of our Phase IIb study with the oral formulation of AMG 423, or omecamtiv mecarbil, the innovative cardiac myosin activator we were developing with Cytokinetics. These data will be critical in informing our decision on advancing AMG 423 into Phase III.
Turning to our oncology pipeline. In addition to our T-VEC combination study with evolocumab, we've initiated a combination metastatic melanoma study with T-VEC and Merck's PD-1 antibody and are in the planning stage for additional such combination with checkpoint inhibitor studies in other tumor types.
We presented BLINCYTO Phase II data for both minimal residual disease positive patients with ALL and our pivotal relapsed/refractory study in ALL at ASH, along with Phase II data from our lymphoma study. We also presented data from Vectibix Phase II PEAK study and Phase III PRIME studies, supporting our approval for first-line use with FOLFOX in metastatic colorectal cancer at the ASCO Annual Meeting and ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium. And we terminated our trebananib program directed against the angiopoietin axis in recurring ovarian cancer as well as our rilotumumab program directed against the MET axis in gastric cancer due to disappointing results.
Our recently announced collaboration with Kite Pharma on CAR T cell technology complements our existing BiTE and oncolytic virus platforms, broadening our overall immunotherapy capabilities. We have a very robust antigen discovery program at Amgen, and the Kite collaboration provides another modality we can employ against these targets in both liquid and solid tumors. Our biosimilars programs are advancing with Phase III data for our HUMIRA biosimilar in moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis expected this quarter and Phase III data for our Avastin biosimilar in advanced non-small cell lung cancer expected in the second half of this year.
Finally, I'd like to recognize the strong execution of the R&D organization in delivering for patients. 2014 was an unprecedented year for Amgen in terms of the volume of pivotal data and regulatory submissions with multiple clinical and regulatory milestones ahead of us in 2015. Bob?"

It's true in animal models. We're seeing the same thing in the clinic. So it's likely that, that is difficult to overcome. A receptor antagonist is just a more efficient and potent way to address this particular biology. And I think that will translate into a situation where the amount of drug that has to be administered presumably subcutaneously will be an issue for the clinical approach profiles, and I expect us to have the most favorable profile with respect to that just basically on those principles. So we'll see how it plays out, but that's what I would expect. We haven't had our end of Phase II discussions with the agencies yet because we just saw the data quite recently. It's clear that both episodic and chronic migraine are separate regulatory entities in that you can have an approval, for example, Botox is approved in chronic and not in episodic. You can have separate approvals. Whether the programs can be prosecuted together with some kind of efficiencies and how to coordinate those activities is something that we'll be -- we will be exploring with regulators.

Remember, this of course is a receptor-blocking antibody rather than a ligand sequester, and we know there are multiple ligands for the receptor.

So through time, what we have found is that we continue to learn about our own innovative process, development efforts, et cetera, by virtue of the work that we're doing in our biosimilars program. And I think our dialogue with the regulators around the world is enhanced by the fact that we're recognized to be both an innovator and a company that's seeking to advance biosimilar molecules. So we're continuing to work both sides of this. As you know, we have 9 biosimilar molecules that are advancing successfully through the clinic, and we continue to believe that this will be a large revenue opportunity for us. So again, with respect to any individual program, the biosimilars HUMIRA in particular, as you know, we've generated Phase III -- positive Phase III data already.

As you can see from our results, we're off to a solid start so far in 2015, and our performance during the quarter is a good indication that we're on track to deliver our long-term objectives as well.
Financially, we delivered a strong quarter, really across the board. Our U.S. business delivered 15% growth and internationally, we were up 10% at constant currency. Product performance was solid across the portfolio, and I was especially pleased with the strong growth we delivered for Prolia, XGEVA, Kyprolis, Enbrel and Vectibix. 
Heading into the balance of the year, we have good momentum on our base business. And Tony will have more to say about that in a few minutes. Our earnings growth of 33% reflects the benefits of our transformation initiatives and our discipline in controlling expenses ahead of the launch investments that we'll make later this year. As David will share, based on the strong performance in the quarter, we're raising our 2015 earnings guidance. 
With the Corlanor approval last week, we're excited to bring the first new heart failure medicine to the market in the U.S. in almost a decade. Corlanor was approved to reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure, which as you know is a significant economic burden on our society. Through Corlanor, we look forward to establishing our presence in the cardiovascular field as we've prepared to launch Repatha later this year. 
In addition to Corlanor, we're launching BLINCYTO for patients with relapsed refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia and our Neulasta On-Body Injector, which addresses a real clinical problem with an innovative solution that enables the administration of Neulasta the day after chemotherapy.
R&D, as you know, is a core focus at Amgen and our pipeline continues to deliver results that position us well for future growth. We reported a third successful Phase III study for AMG 416, an intravenous calcimimetic for use in kidney disease and a second successful Phase III study for our lead biosimilar product, adalimumab.
In oncology, Kyprolis delivered impressive results, showing a doubling of progression-free survival versus oprozomib [ph] in relapsed multiple myeloma patients in our ENDEAVOR study, and of course, this data come on the back of the unprecedented progression-free survival data that we generated in our ASPIRE trial.
Kyprolis is currently under accelerated review in both the U.S. and Europe for multiple myeloma patients who've relapsed, and we're excited with the opportunity to bring this important medicine to many more patients globally. Sean will speak more about progress in our pipeline in a few moments.
And in summary, there's a lot to be pleased about with our progress so far this year. Our strategy is working and it's delivering results. We're executing effectively across the company, controlling the things that are ours to control. Our focus and priorities have never been more clear. Our launches are proceeding well and we're ready to launch Repatha later this year. We continue to grow key products including Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Sensipar and Nplate. We have strong momentum as we defend our base business against new competition, and our transformation efforts are delivering efficiencies and cost savings across the company and we're being very disciplined about capping them. Finally, we continue to advance our robust pipeline of important medicines setting the stage for long-term growth.
Before I hand over to David, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their unwavering commitment to delivering for patients and for shareholders. David?"

Turning to the first quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenues at $5 billion grew 11% year-over-year with 12% product sales growth, driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Total revenue and product sales were impacted 2% unfavorably due to foreign exchange headwinds.
Adjusted operating income at $2.4 billion grew 32% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved to 50% for the quarter reflecting strong growth and continued progress from our transformation initiatives. On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 15.1% improved by 0.6 points, driven by lower royalties and higher average net sales price, offset partially by product mix.
Research and development expenses of approximately $850 million were down 14% versus the prior year. R&D spend was favorably impacted by the transformation and process improvements across the area. SG&A expenses were flat on a year-over-year basis, as increased commercial investments in new product launches were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
Total operating expenses declined 3% year-on-year and 22% sequentially. This performance reflects the combination of the first quarter being typically the lowest expense level during the calendar year, plus a share of the $400 million of incremental savings expected during 2015 from our transformation initiative. Going forward, we expect quarterly expenses to increase in line to modestly above historical trends, reflecting increasing launch and R&D investments through the balance of 2015. Other income and expenses improved 9% on a year-over-year basis at $146 million in the quarter.
The adjusted tax rate was 17% for the quarter, a 1.6 point increase versus Q1 of 2014. This increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings, partially offset by a state audit settlement in the quarter. As a result, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 33% on a year-over-year basis.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 6. For the first quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow, an increase of $0.2 billion over the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales and profitability.
Total debt outstanding ended Q1 at $30.3 billion and cash and investments totaled $27.1 billion. Additionally, our first quarter 2015 dividend increased to $0.79 per share, an increase of 30% versus the prior period.
Finally, in the first quarter of 2015, we increased our share repurchase activity with over 450 million of share repurchases or approximately 3 million shares in the period. We intend to continue repurchases at a stepped-up level in 2015, consistent with a commitment to complete up to $2 billion of repurchases by the end of the year.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2015 on Page 7. We remain on track with our plans to continue supporting growth of the business, while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. With regard to our updated outlook for 2015 revenue, we are raising the bottom end of the range, resulting in a revised guidance of $20.9 billion to $21.3 billion for 2015. This reflects solid revenue performance in the first quarter, partially offset by the effects of foreign currency headwinds, which will exceed $200 million for 2015 at current rates versus our original planning framework. Versus 2014 results, we expect over a $300 million revenue impact or 2% in 2015 at current foreign exchange rates. Our revenue guidance also reflects progress on our product launch activities as well as our latest view of evolving competitive dynamics.
We're also increasing our 2015 earnings per share outlook to $9.35 to $9.65 from the previous $9.05 to $9.40 forecast. The increased earnings outlook reflects continued conviction in our strategy and a strong first quarter performance, along with an incremental expected headwind of $0.05 per share from foreign exchange. Versus 2014 results, we expect a $0.12 EPS impact in 2015 at current foreign exchange rates. We would also expect our quarterly tax rate increase throughout the balance of the year to be more in line with our guidance range of 18% to 19%, which as a reminder, excludes the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in 2015. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $800 million this year.
This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony."

I'm pleased to report that we're off to a strong start in our first quarter of 2015. We saw excellent execution across all aspects of our commercial strategy, launching products, growing our newer products and defending our mature in-line brands. Globally, product sales grew 12% year-over-year. As Bob mentioned, our U.S. business delivered outstanding results, with a 13% year-over-year growth and our international business grew 10% year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange.
Let me first update you on our new product launches. In the U.S., our recent launches of BLINCYTO for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the On-Body Injector for Neulasta are going very well with positive feedback from health care providers. BLINCYTO, as you know, was approved in 2.5 months by the FDA underscoring the unmet medical need in ALL patients. We are seeing a broad acceptance of the product with orders from most major institutions and good reimbursement access.
We launched the On-Body Injector for Neulasta during quarter one. Patients no longer have to return to the hospital 24 hours later after their chemo. The On-Body Injector simply infuses Neulasta return. While still in the early phases of our launch, we have seen good growth of prescribing with about 800 accounts ordering product to date.
And last Wednesday, we received the approval for Corlanor to reduce the risk of hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure. Corlanor is the first new medicine for chronic heart failure in the U.S. in almost a decade. Heart failure is a common condition that affects nearly 6 million people with annual cost of over $13 million -- $13 billion in the U.S. The majority of these costs are related to hospitalizations. And with Amgen estimate that as many as 1 million patients could be candidates for Corlanor therapy. 
Since our approval last week, our manufacturing team were working through the weekend, printing labels, packaging products and made our first shipment to wholesalers yesterday. The product will be in pharmacies later this week and our sales force are trained and in the field. We are excited about the opportunity and ready to bring this innovative new medicine to cardiologists and patients.
Let me now turn to the first quarter performance beginning with Enbrel. On Slide 12, you'll see that Enbrel delivered strong growth with 13% year-over-year primarily driven by price. Segment growth remains strong in both rheumatology and dermatology, growing 23% and 30%, respectively. Competition continues to intensify, particularly in dermatology where Enbrel has lost 5 points of value share in the last year, but still retains 27% share. Enbrel continues to be a logical choice for patients starting treatment with the biologic.
On Slide 13, you'll see that sequentially Enbrel's sales declined 17%. Unit declined 7% reflecting normal quarter one season patterns and price growth of 9%, and there was a 17% unfavorable impact from inventory. You may recall from our conference call in January that wholesale inventories ended 2014 at a higher than normal level by about $40 billion -- $40 million, and we expect the levels to return to normal in quarter one. However in the first quarter, the days on hand dropped to the low end of the range. Additionally, revised prescription data revealed that there was a modest end customer buy in, in the fourth quarter, which then burned off in quarter one.
To summarize, in quarter one, the lower than normal wholesale inventory level coupled with the end customer burn off negatively impacted sales. We expect Enbrel to deliver significant growth in 2015. And as we said before, we remain committed to Enbrel becoming a $5 billion brand.
I'll move now to Prolia. Prolia delivered 39% growth year-over-year, with 30% unit growth in the U.S. and 44% in international. Over the last year, Prolia market share grew 3 percentage points in the U.S. and about 4 percentage points in Europe. This performance is driven by our program particularly with access, improved adherence, along with direct-to-consumer marketing in the U.S. Prolia is now capturing 1 in 3 patients starting postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment in the United States. As you can see from the market prescription data, the expected Q2 pickup is underway.
XGEVA continues its solid performance with a 22% growth year-over-year. U.S. unit share increased 4 percentage points over last year and in Europe, units share increased about 7 percentage points. Our brand strategy continues to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition.
Over time, the Vectibix has received expanded indications into earlier lines of therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer in both the U.S. and Europe. This delivered an 18% year-over-year growth with exceptionally strong unit demand. We've also recently received an additional first line indication in combination with FOLFIRI in Europe.
Let me now turn to Kyprolis, which had a year-over-year growth of 59% and quarter-over-quarter growth of 19%. In the U.S., we received priority review for label expansion into second line based on the ASPIRE data with a late July PDUFA date. We have submitted our application into Europe and is currently under review. This data, together with our compelling ENDEAVOR data, should position Kyprolis as a best-in-class proteasome inhibitor.
Sensipar grew 24% year-over-year driven by 14% unit growth, price and inventory levels compared to quarter one in 2014. Nplate grew 12% year-over-year with strong unit growth in all regions across the world.
Now I'll turn to our mature brands, starting with the filgrastim franchise. Neulasta delivered year-over-year growth of 4% in the first quarter, driven mainly by price and inventory changes. As I mentioned earlier, we launched the On-Body Neulasta Injector during the quarter with very positive feedback from both providers and patients.
NEUPOGEN declined 13% year-over-year mainly due to branded short-acting competition in the U.S. The strong execution by our U.S. NEUPOGEN team resulted in relatively stable quarter-on-quarter sequential market share in the short-acting market around 80%. Granix sale was about 13% and Leukine about 5%. We continue to compete account by account and reinforce NEUPOGEN's long track record of clinical, efficacy and safety as well as our ability to reliably supply patients.
With potential competition from biosimilars expected in the U.S. this year, we will leverage the success we've had in the U.S. versus branded competition as well as our considerable experience with NEUPOGEN biosimilars in Europe.
Next up is EPOGEN, which had an unusual 16% year-over-year growth in the quarter. On top of price gains of 7%, EPOGEN's year-over-year growth benefit from a favorable compare for the quarter one, 2014 with end customers drew down inventory levels significantly. In addition, quarter one 2015 benefit from favorable accounting and discount adjustments as well as higher end customer inventories due to an SKU conversion.
From underlying dosing perspective, dosing and hemoglobin levels remain relatively stable and the unit demand is relatively flat. Aranesp sales grew 4% year-over-year with a unit growth of 6%. A portion of this growth reflects the timing of early tender orders in the Middle East versus 2014.
So in conclusion, I'd like to say -- firstly thank our Amgen customer-facing teams across the world. This is a unique moment in our company's history, where we are simultaneously launching, growing and defending more brands than ever before. I know our team is embracing the Amgen value of competing intensely to win, and has a clear focus on delivering value for shareholders, Amgen and most importantly, for patients. And now I'll pass it to Sean."

So it continues to be a very busy time for Amgen R&D, and so I would like to start with our cardiovascular program, specifically the recent U.S. approval for Corlanor or ivabradine, for chronic symptomatic systolic heart fail",1171,"Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. So it continues to be a very busy time for Amgen R&D, and so I would like to start with our cardiovascular program, specifically the recent U.S. approval for Corlanor or ivabradine, for chronic symptomatic systolic heart failure. Chronic heart failure is in the rise in the United States and represents a very large and growing health care expenditure burden, primarily due to the cost of repeated hospitalizations in these very fragile patients. In fact, reducing hospitalization and these patients is a specific focus of many health care including Medicare. A resting heart rate of 70 and appears to be a maladaptive response in setting of chronically reduced cardiac pump function, yet despite the availability of prescribed beta blockers, many heart failure patients in the United States maintain such an elevated heart rate at rest. For these patients, Corlanor's unique mechanism of action may potentially benefit them with respect to reducing their risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure. In the large outcome study performed by the colleague at Servier, called SHIFT, that risk was reduced by 26% compared to placebo on top of standard of care including beta blockade. Obviously, reduction and hospitalizations reflect patients doing better overall in terms of their heart failure management. We're not only thrilled with the prospect of making Corlanor available to chronic heart failure patients in the U.S., but we also view this as an excellent way to introduce ourselves as a company to the U.S. Cardiology Community as we prepare for the launch of our PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha. Of course, Repatha continues to be a main focus for us and we were very pleased to see the enthusiasm for this agent at the recent American College of Cardiology meetings in response to the data we presented there and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It's quite remarkable to see so much depth of understanding and appreciation of the potential benefit risk profile of a novel mechanism by cardiologists and lipid specialists. We were also pleased to have filed Repatha in Japan with our partners at Astellas. The last thing I'd like to mention on our cardiovascular portfolio is Omecamtiv mecarbil, or AMG 423, the novel mechanism agent we are advancing in systolic heart failure with psychokinetics. We look forward to seeing the data in the second half of this year with our Phase II chronic oral study which has now completed enrollment.
Turning to oncology, we were pleased to receive priority review from FDA on our Kyprolis sNDA for relapsed multiple myeloma based on the ASPIRE data, and we look forward to continued interactions with regulators to bring Kyprolis to patients in need. Also in the relapsed setting, we were quite encouraged by the ENDEAVOR data, demonstrating a doubling of progression-free survival on patients randomized to Kyprolis as compared to Velcade. We look forward to providing the details of these results at ASCO in the multiple myeloma oral session on Tuesday morning.
We are also initiating a Phase III study of the weekly dosing regimen for Kyprolis which we feel will be quite important for patients and caregivers. I'd also note that during the first quarter, Vectibix was approved in the EU for first-line metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with FOLFIRI and was also granted full approval in the EU.
Turning to T-VEC, we completed the Phase Ib portion of the T-VEC combination study we're performing in metastatic myeloma in collaboration with Merck and their PD-1 antibody, KEYTRUDA and we expect to advance next into the Phase III portion of this exciting study. 
We're in the final planning stages of the similar Phase Ib/III study in head and neck cancer with Merck and KEYTRUDA as well. Clearly, the vast majority of potential value of T-VEC lies in priming the immune system in combination with [indiscernible] inhibitors and other mechanisms that modulate the immune system's discrimination between cells and non-cells. We continue to explore opportunities both within our own pipeline as well as in collaboration with others.
In the meantime, despite the very rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape since the design of the T-VEC monotherapy study in melanoma, including the approval of multiple agents with Corlanor overall survival, we continue to believe that it is important to make T-VEC monotherapy available to the patient segments in which meaningful rates of durable response were observed in Phase III. We therefore look forward to our discussions on this topic at the FDA advisory committee meeting scheduled for April 29.
Finally, we have decided to stop administration of blinded investigational product in the Phase III study of trebananib in first-line ovarian cancer based on recommendations by the data safety monitoring committee who deemed the study unlikely to achieve its primary PFS endpoint.
In the inflammation space, our Phase III psoriasis data from Brodalumab, IL-17 receptor antagonist, was very well-received at the recent American Academy of Dermatology meeting, as we discussed in detail in our investor relation event. For those of you who were not able to participate, in addition to the very compelling efficacy data including superiority over [indiscernible], along with an overall balanced safety profile, we did note that we've seen suicidal ideation and behavior in our Brodalumab program in these patients known to be at risk for these events. However, we believe the evidence to date does not suggest the relationship between IL-17 innovation and suicidal ideation and behavior. Data has been provided to regulatory authorities and we will be discussing it with them on an ongoing basis. This topic will be an important and appropriate focus of regulators in their analysis of the risk-benefit profile during their review of the applications we plan to file for Brodalumab. Along with our partners at AstraZeneca, we do anticipate submitting a globally midyear. We also recently decided to stop the Phase II study with Brodalumab based on futility at a planned interim analysis.
In other areas, our Phase III head-to-head study at AMG 416 versus Sensipar in hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism was positive and we anticipate initiating global regulatory submissions in the second half of this year. 
Our biosimilars program also continues to advance with positive Phase III data for our HUMIRA biosimilar in rheumatoid arthritis. We view our migraine prophylaxis program with our CGS RPE receptor antagonist antibody, AMG 334, as a top priority, and we will strive to be both first and best in class in this field. We expect to present data from our phase IIb episodic migraine study at the International Headache Society Congress next month and to initiate Phase III later this year.
Finally, I'd like to just thank the R&D team at Amgen for their continued focus on innovation and execution of our key programs. In particular, recently, it was very nice to see you the level of acknowledgment paid to the remarkable breakthroughs in human genetics by the [indiscernible] in Iceland celebrated in both the scientific and press. There will certainly be much more to come in this very exciting era of biologic. Bob?"

One is we had indicated previously that we expect this year, our transformation to deliver about $400 million of incremental savings. And certainly, we saw a share -- a proportionate share of that already land here in Q1, and those savings will continue pretty steadily through the year. The second dynamic on cost then is around the cost trends, in particular, if I look at SG&A in the sales and marketing area, as well as R&D, we do expect to see rising costs, which is a combination of the fact that we inevitably normally, for the business the first quarter is the low point for expenses overall for the year, but I think importantly, for us right now, we do have these launches that are coming up.

Secondly, if you look at the particular pattern of savings in the first quarter, what you can observe, as I've mentioned is that and as we've talked before, we are investing, freeing up flexibility to invest in our launch portfolio, so you can expect that a substantial share of what we save in SG&A will be reinvested towards the launches. And then I think the third thing I'd comment as to R&D, that was a combination in the quarter of R&D tends to be rather lumpy in terms of the spend. So you saw a combination of savings that we're getting from our transformation in the quarter, as well as some of the inevitable lumpiness that occurs from quarter-to-quarter in that area. So I think bottom line is that we expect going forward through the year to see rising costs, which you typically see in a pattern through the year but see it a little more accentuated as a combination of rising costs with launch activities, as well as in the case of R&D, we still are continuing to invest in clinical trials and we'll see some increases there. And then as to the -- if I may one final comment, R versus D, basically as we've talked before, we've done work to look at all the processes across all of our business activities, and so we're seeing efficiencies in both of those areas, broadly."

As you can see from our results, we're off to a solid start so far in 2015, and our performance during the quarter is a good indication that we're on track to deliver our long-term objectives as well.
Financially, we delivered a strong quarter, really across the board. Our U.S. business delivered 15% growth and internationally, we were up 10% at constant currency. Product performance was solid across the portfolio, and I was especially pleased with the strong growth we delivered for Prolia, XGEVA, Kyprolis, ENBREL and Vectibix. 
Heading into the balance of the year, we have good momentum on our base business. And Tony will have more to say about that in a few minutes. Our earnings growth of 33% reflects the benefits of our transformation initiatives and our discipline in controlling expenses ahead of the launch investments that we'll make later this year. As David will share, based on the strong performance in the quarter, we're raising our 2015 earnings guidance. 
With the Corlanor approval last week, we're excited to bring the first new heart failure medicine to the market in the U.S. in almost a decade. Corlanor was approved to reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure, which as you know is a significant economic burden on our society. Through Corlanor, we look forward to establishing our presence in the cardiovascular field as we've prepared to launch Repatha later this year. 
In addition to Corlanor, we're launching BLINCYTO for patients with relapsed refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia and our Neulasta on-body injector, which addresses a real clinical problem with an innovative solution that enables the administration of Neulasta the day after chemotherapy.
R&D, as you know, is a core focus at Amgen and our pipeline continues to deliver results that position us well for future growth. We reported a third successful Phase III study for AMG 416, an intravenous calcimimetic for use in kidney disease and a second successful Phase III study for our lead biosimilar product, adalimumab.
In oncology, Kyprolis delivered impressive results, showing a doubling of progression-free survival versus bortezomib in relapsed multiple myeloma patients in our ENDEAVOR study, and of course, this data come on the back of the unprecedented progression-free survival data that we generated in our ASPIRE trial.
Kyprolis is currently under accelerated review in both the U.S. and Europe for multiple myeloma patients who've relapsed, and we're excited with the opportunity to bring this important medicine to many more patients globally. Sean will speak more about progress in our pipeline in a few moments.
In summary, there's a lot to be pleased about with our progress so far this year. Our strategy is working and it's delivering results. We're executing effectively across the company, controlling the things that are ours to control. Our focus and priorities have never been more clear. Our launches are proceeding well and we're ready to launch Repatha later this year. We continue to grow key products, including ENBREL, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Sensipar and Nplate. We have strong momentum as we defend our base business against new competition, and our transformation efforts are delivering efficiencies and cost savings across the company, and we're being very disciplined about capping them. Finally, we continue to advance our robust pipeline of important medicines setting the stage for long-term growth.
Before I hand over to David, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their unwavering commitment to delivering for patients and for shareholders. David?"

Turning to the first quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenues at $5 billion grew 11% year-over-year with 12% product sales growth, driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Total revenue and product sales were impacted 2% unfavorably due to foreign exchange headwinds.
Adjusted operating income at $2.4 billion grew 32% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved to 50% for the quarter, reflecting strong growth and continued progress from our transformation initiatives. On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 15.1% improved by 0.6 points, driven by lower royalties and higher average net sales price, offset partially by product mix.
Research and development expenses at approximately $850 million were down 14% versus the prior year. R&D spend was favorably impacted by the transformation and process improvements across the area. SG&A expenses were flat on a year-on-year basis, as increased commercial investments in new product launches were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
Total operating expenses declined 3% year-on-year and 22% sequentially. This performance reflects the combination of the first quarter being typically the lowest expense level during the calendar year, plus a share of the $400 million of incremental savings expected during 2015 from our transformation initiative. Going forward, we expect quarterly expenses to increase in line to modestly above historical trends, reflecting increasing launch and R&D investments through the balance of 2015. Other income and expenses improved 9% on a year-over-year basis at $146 million in the quarter.
The adjusted tax rate was 17% for the quarter, a 1.6 point increase versus Q1 of 2014. This increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings, partially offset by a state audit settlement in the quarter. As a result, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 33% on a year-over-year basis.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 6. For the first quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow, an increase of $0.2 billion over the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales and profitability.
Total debt outstanding ended Q1 at $30.3 billion and cash and investments totaled $27.1 billion. Additionally, our first quarter 2015 dividend increased to $0.79 per share, an increase of 30% versus the prior period.
Finally, in the first quarter of 2015, we increased our share repurchase activity with over 450 million of share repurchases or approximately 3 million shares in the period. We intend to continue repurchases at a stepped-up level in 2015, consistent with a commitment to complete up to $2 billion of repurchases by the end of the year.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2015 on Page 7. We remain on track with our plans to continue supporting growth of the business, while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. With regard to our updated outlook for 2015 revenue, we are raising the bottom end of the range, resulting in a revised guidance of $20.9 billion to $21.3 billion for 2015. This reflects solid revenue performance in the first quarter, partially offset by the effects of foreign currency headwinds, which will exceed $200 million for 2015 at current rates versus our original planning framework. Versus 2014 results, we expect over a $300 million revenue impact or 2% in 2015 at current foreign exchange rates. Our revenue guidance also reflects progress on our product launch activities as well as our latest view of evolving competitive dynamics.
We're also increasing our 2015 earnings per share outlook to $9.35 to $9.65 from the previous $9.05 to $9.40 forecast. The increased earnings outlook reflects continued conviction in our strategy and strong first quarter performance, along with an incremental expected headwind of $0.05 per share from foreign exchange. Versus 2014 results, we expect a $0.12 EPS impact in 2015 at current foreign exchange rates. We would also expect our quarterly tax rate to increase throughout the balance of the year to be more in line with our guidance range of 18% to 19%, which as a reminder, excludes the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in 2015. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $800 million this year.
This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony."

I'm pleased to report that we're off to a strong start in our first quarter of 2015. We saw excellent execution across all aspects of our commercial strategy, launching products, growing our newer products and defending our mature in-line brands. Globally, product sales grew 12% year-over-year. As Bob mentioned, our U.S. business delivered outstanding results, with a 15% year-over-year growth and our international business grew 10% year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange.
Let me first update you on our new product launches. In the U.S., our recent launches of BLINCYTO for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the on-body injector for Neulasta are going very well with positive feedback from health care providers. BLINCYTO, as you know, was approved in 2.5 months by the FDA underscoring the unmet medical need in ALL patients. We are seeing a broad acceptance of the product with orders from most major institutions and good reimbursement access.
We launched the on-body injector for Neulasta during quarter 1. Patients no longer have to return to the hospital 24 hours later after their chemo. The on-body injector simply infuses Neulasta return. While still in the early phases of our launch, we have seen good growth of prescribing with about 800 accounts ordering product to date.
And last Wednesday, we received the approval for Corlanor to reduce the risk of hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure. Corlanor is the first new medicine for chronic heart failure in the U.S. in almost a decade. Heart failure is a common condition that affects nearly 6 million people with annual cost of over $30 million -- $30 billion in the U.S. The majority of these costs are related to hospitalizations. And we at Amgen estimate that as many as 1 million patients could be candidates for Corlanor therapy. 
Since our approval last week, our manufacturing team were working through the weekend, printing labels, packaging products and made our first shipment to wholesalers yesterday. The product will be in pharmacies later this week and our sales force are trained and in the field. We're excited about the opportunity and ready to bring this innovative new medicine to cardiologists and patients.
Let me now turn to the first quarter performance beginning with ENBREL. On Slide 12, you'll see that ENBREL delivered strong growth with 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by price. Segment growth remains strong in both rheumatology and dermatology, growing 23% and 30%, respectively. Competition continues to intensify, particularly in dermatology where ENBREL has lost 5 points of value share over the last year, but still retains 27% share. ENBREL continues to be a logical choice for patients starting treatment with the biologic.
On Slide 13, you'll see that sequentially ENBREL'S sales declined 17%. Unit declined 7%, reflecting normal quarter 1 season patterns and price growth of 9%, and there was a 17% unfavorable impact from the inventory. You may recall from our conference call in January that wholesale inventories ended 2014 at a higher-than-normal level by about $40 billion -- $40 million, and we expect the levels to return to normal in quarter 1. However in the first quarter, the days on hand dropped to the low end of the range. Additionally, revised prescription data revealed that there was a modest end customer buy in, in the fourth quarter, which then burned off in quarter 1.
To summarize, in quarter 1, the lower-than-normal wholesale inventory level, coupled with the end customer burn off, negatively impacted sales. We expect ENBREL to deliver significant growth in 2015. And as we said before, we remain committed to ENBREL becoming a $5 billion brand.
I'll move now to Prolia. Prolia delivered 39% growth year-over-year, with 30% unit growth in the U.S. and 44% in international. Over the last year, Prolia market share grew 3 percentage points in the U.S. and about 4 percentage points in Europe. This performance is driven by our program, simply access, improved adherence, along with direct-to-consumer marketing in the U.S. Prolia is now capturing 1 in 3 patients starting postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment in the United States. As you can see from the market prescription data, the expected Q2 pickup is underway.
XGEVA continues its solid performance with a 22% growth year-over-year. U.S. unit share increased 4 percentage points over last year and in Europe, units share increased about 7 percentage points. Our brand strategy continues to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition.
Over time, Vectibix has received expanded indications into earlier lines of therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer in both the U.S. and Europe. This delivered an 18% year-over-year growth with exceptionally strong unit demand. We've also recently received an additional first line indication in combination with FOLFIRI in Europe.
Let me now turn to Kyprolis, which delivered year-on-year growth of 59% and quarter-over-quarter growth of 19%. In the U.S., we received priority review for label expansion into second line based on the ASPIRE data with a late July PDUFA date. We have submitted our application in Europe and is currently under review. This data, together with our compelling ENDEAVOR data, should position Kyprolis as a best-in-class proteasome inhibitor.
Sensipar grew 24% year-over-year, driven by 14% unit growth, price and inventory levels compared to quarter 1 in 2014. Nplate grew 12% year-over-year with strong unit growth in all regions across the world.
Now I'll turn to our mature brands, starting with the filgrastim franchise. Neulasta delivered year-over-year growth of 4% in the first quarter, driven mainly by price and inventory changes. As I mentioned earlier, we launched the on-body Neulasta injector during the quarter, with very positive feedback from both providers and patients.
NEUPOGEN declined 15% year-over-year, mainly due to branded short-acting competition in the U.S. The strong execution by our U.S. NEUPOGEN team resulted in relative stable quarter-on-quarter sequential market share in the short-acting market around 80%. Granix sale was about 15% and Leukine about 5%. We continue to compete account by account and reinforce NEUPOGEN's long track record of clinical, efficacy and safety as well as our ability to reliably supply patients.
With potential competition from biosimilars expected in the U.S. this year, we will leverage the success we've had in the U.S. versus branded competition as well as our considerable experience with NEUPOGEN biosimilars in Europe.
Next up is EPOGEN, which had an unusual 16% year-over-year growth in the quarter. On top of price gains of 7%, EPOGEN's year-over-year growth benefit from a favorable compare to quarter 1 2014, where end customers drew down inventory levels significantly. In addition, quarter 1 2015 benefit from favorable accounting and discount adjustments, as well as higher end customer inventories due to an SKU conversion.
From underlying business perspective, dosing and hemoglobin levels remain relatively stable and the unit demand is relatively flat. Aranesp sales grew 4% year-over-year with a unit growth of 6%. A portion of this growth reflects the timing of early tender orders in the Middle East versus 2014.
So in conclusion, I'd like to say -- I'd like to firstly thank our Amgen customer-facing teams across the world. This is a unique moment in our company's history, where we are simultaneously launching, growing and defending more brands than ever before. I know our team is embracing the Amgen value of competing intensely to win, and has a clear focus on delivering value for shareholders, Amgen and most importantly, for patients. Let me now pass it to Sean."

So it continues to be a very busy time for Amgen R&D, and so I would like to start with our cardiovascular program, specifically the recent U.S. approval for Corlanor or ivabradine, for chronic symptomatic systolic heart fail",1176,"Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. So it continues to be a very busy time for Amgen R&D, and so I would like to start with our cardiovascular program, specifically the recent U.S. approval for Corlanor or ivabradine, for chronic symptomatic systolic heart failure. Chronic heart failure is in the rise in the United States and represents a very large and growing health care expenditure burden, primarily due to the cost of repeated hospitalizations in these very fragile patients. In fact, reducing hospitalization in these patients is a specific focus of many health care systems, including Medicare. A resting heart rate of 70 or more appears to be a maladaptive response in the setting of chronically reduced cardiac pump function, yet despite the availability of the beta blockers, many heart failure patients in the United States maintain such an elevated heart rate at rest. For these patients, Corlanor's unique mechanism of action may potentially benefit them with respect to reducing their risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure. 
In the large outcome study performed by our colleague at Servier, called SHIFT, that risk was reduced by 26% compared to placebo on top of standard of care, including beta blockade. Obviously, reduction in hospitalizations reflect patients doing better overall in terms of their heart failure management. We're not only thrilled with the prospect of making Corlanor available to chronic heart failure patients in the U.S., but we also view this as an excellent way to introduce ourselves as a company to the U.S. cardiology community as we prepare for the launch of our PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha. Of course, Repatha continues to be a main focus for us, and we were very pleased to see the enthusiasm for this agent at the recent American College of Cardiology meetings in response to the data we presented there and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It's quite remarkable to see so much depth of understanding and appreciation of the potential benefit risk profile of a novel mechanism by cardiologists and lipid specialists. We were also pleased to have filed Repatha in Japan with our partners at Astellas. The last thing I'd like to mention, our cardiovascular portfolio is Omecamtiv mecarbil, or AMG 423, the novel mechanism agent we are advancing in systolic heart failure with Cytokinetics. We look forward to seeing the data in the second half of this year from our Phase II chronic oral study which has now completed enrollment.
Turning to oncology. We were pleased to receive priority review from FDA on our Kyprolis sNDA for relapsed multiple myeloma based on the ASPIRE data, and we look forward to continued interactions with regulators to bring Kyprolis to patients in need. Also in the relapsed setting, we were quite encouraged by the ENDEAVOR data, demonstrating a doubling of progression-free survival on patients randomized to Kyprolis as compared to Velcade. We look forward to providing the details of these results at ASCO in the multiple myeloma oral session on Tuesday morning.
We are also initiating a Phase III study of a weekly dosing regimen for Kyprolis which we feel will be quite important for patients and caregivers. I'd also note that during the first quarter, Vectibix was approved in the EU for first-line metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with FOLFIRI and was also granted full approval of the EU.
Turning to T-VEC. We completed the Phase Ib portion of the T-VEC combination study we're performing in metastatic myeloma in collaboration with Merck and their PD-1 antibody, KEYTRUDA, and we expect to advance next into the Phase III portion of this exciting study. 
We're in the final planning stages of the similar Phase Ib/III study in head and neck cancer with Merck and KEYTRUDA as well. Clearly, the vast majority of potential value of T-VEC lies in priming the immune system in combination with checkpoint inhibitors and other mechanisms that modulate the immune system's discrimination between cells and non-cells. We continue to explore [indiscernible], both within our own pipeline as well as in collaboration with others.
In the meantime, despite the very rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape since the design of the T-VEC monotherapy study in melanoma, including the approval of multiple agents with Corlanor overall survival, we continue to believe that it is important to make T-VEC monotherapy available to the patient segments in which meaningful rates of durable response were observed in Phase III. We therefore look forward to our discussions on this topic at the FDA advisory committee meeting scheduled for April 29.
Finally, we have decided to stop administration of blinded investigational product in the Phase III study of trebananib in first-line ovarian cancer based on recommendations by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, who deemed the study unlikely to achieve its primary PFS endpoint.
In the inflammation space, our Phase III psoriasis data from Brodalumab, our IL-17 receptor antagonist, was very well-received at the recent American Academy of Dermatology meeting, as we discussed in detail in our investor relation event. For those of you who were not able to participate, in addition to the very compelling efficacy data, including superiority over Stelara ustekinumab, along with an overall balanced safety profile, we did note that we've seen suicidal ideation and behavior in our Brodalumab PET program in these patients known to be at risk for these events. However, we believe the evidence to date does not suggest the cold relationship between IL-17 innovation and suicidal ideation and behavior. Data has been provided to regulatory authorities and we will be discussing it with them on an ongoing basis. This topic will be an important and appropriate focus of regulators in their analysis of the risk-benefit profile during their review of the applications we plan to file for Brodalumab. Along with our partners at AstraZeneca, we do anticipate submitting [indiscernible] globally mid-year. We also recently decided to stop the Phase II asthma study with Brodalumab based on futility at a planned interim analysis.
In other areas, our Phase III head-to-head study at AMG 416 versus Sensipar in hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism was positive, and we anticipate initiating global regulatory submissions in the second half of this year. Our biosimilars program also continues to advance with positive Phase III data for our HUMIRA biosimilar in rheumatoid arthritis. We view our migraine prophylaxis program with our CGRP receptor antagonist antibody, AMG 334, as a top priority, and we will strive to be both first and best in class in this field. We expect to present data from our phase IIb episodic migraine study at the International Headache Society Congress next month and to initiate Phase III later this year.
Finally, I'd like to just thank the R&D team at Amgen for their continued focus on innovation and execution of our key programs. In particular, recently, it was very nice to see the level of acknowledgment paid to the remarkable breakthroughs in human genetics by the [indiscernible] celebrated in both the scientific and lay press. There will certainly be much more to come in this very exciting era of biologic. Bob?"

One is we had indicated previously that we expect this year, our transformation to deliver about $400 million of incremental savings. And certainly, we saw a share -- a proportionate share that already land here in Q1, and those savings will continue pretty steadily through the year. The second dynamic on cost then is around the cost trends, in particular, if I look at SG&A in the sales and marketing area, as well as R&D, we do expect to see rising costs, which is a combination of the fact that we inevitably -- normally, for the business the first quarter is the low point for expenses overall for the year, but I think importantly, for us right now, we do have these launches that are coming up. We do expect to underwrite those launches significantly with this transformation savings, and we do expect the trend of spending to increase through the year.

Secondly, if you look at the particular pattern of savings in the first quarter, what you can observe, as I've mentioned is that and as we've talked before, we are investing, freeing up flexibility to invest in our launch portfolio, so you can expect that a substantial share of what we save in SG&A will be reinvested towards the launches. And then I think the third thing I'd comment as to R&D, that was a combination in the quarter of R&D tends to be rather lumpy in terms of the spend. So you saw a combination of savings that we're getting from our transformation in the quarter, as well as some of the inevitable lumpiness that occurs from quarter-to-quarter in that area. So I think bottom line is that we expect going forward through the year to see rising costs, which you typically see in a pattern through the year, but see it a little more accentuated as a combination of rising costs with launch activities, as well as in the case of R&D, we still are continuing to invest in clinical trials and we'll see some increases there.

Thank you, Arvind, and good afternoon, everyone, thank you for joining our call. As you can see from our results, we're off to a solid start so far in 2015, and our performance during the quarter is a good indication that we're on track to deliver our long-term objectives as well.
Financially, we delivered a strong quarter, really across the board. Our U.S. business delivered 15% growth and internationally, we were up 10% at constant currency. Product performance was solid across the portfolio, and I was especially pleased with the strong growth we delivered for Prolia, XGEVA, Kyprolis, ENBREL and Vectibix. 
Heading into the balance of the year, we have good momentum in our base business. And Tony will have more to say about that in a few minutes. Our earnings growth of 33% reflects the benefits of our transformation initiatives and our discipline in controlling expenses ahead of the launch investments that we'll make later this year. As David will share, based on the strong performance in the quarter, we're raising our 2015 earnings guidance. 
With the Corlanor approval last week, we're excited to bring the first new heart failure medicine to the market in the U.S. in almost a decade. Corlanor was approved to reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure, which as you know is a significant economic burden on our society. Through Corlanor, we look forward to establishing our presence in the cardiovascular field as we prepare to launch Repatha later this year. 
In addition to Corlanor, we're launching BLINCYTO for patients with relapsed refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia and our Neulasta on-body injector, which addresses a real clinical problem with an innovative solution that enables the administration of Neulasta the day after chemotherapy.
R&D, as you know, is a core focus at Amgen and our pipeline continues to deliver results that position us well for future growth. We reported a third successful Phase III study for AMG 416, an intravenous calcimimetic for use in kidney disease and a second successful Phase III study for our lead biosimilar product, adalimumab.
In oncology, Kyprolis delivered impressive results, showing a doubling of progression-free survival versus bortezomib in relapsed multiple myeloma patients in our ENDEAVOR study, and of course, these data come on the back of the unprecedented progression-free survival data that were generated in our ASPIRE trial.
Kyprolis is currently under accelerated review in both the U.S. and Europe for multiple myeloma patients who've relapsed, and we're excited with the opportunity to bring this important medicine to many more patients globally. Sean will speak more about progress in our pipeline in a few moments.
And in summary, there's a lot to be pleased about with our progress so far this year. Our strategy is working and it's delivering results. We're executing effectively across the company, controlling the things that are ours to control. Our focus and priorities have never been more clear. Our launches are proceeding well and we're ready to launch Repatha later this year. We continue to grow key products, including ENBREL, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Sensipar and Nplate. We have strong momentum as we defend our base business against new competition, and our transformation efforts are delivering efficiencies and cost savings across the company, and we're being very disciplined about capping them. Finally, we continue to advance our robust pipeline of important medicines, setting the stage for long-term growth.

Turning to the first quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenues at $5 billion grew 11% year-over-year with 12% product sales growth, driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Total revenue and product sales were impacted 2% unfavorably due to foreign exchange headwinds.
Adjusted operating income at $2.4 billion grew 32% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved to 50% for the quarter, reflecting strong growth and continued progress from our transformation initiatives. On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 15.1% improved by 0.6 points, driven by lower royalties and higher average net sales price, offset partially by product mix.
Research and development expenses at approximately $850 million were down 14% versus the prior year. R&D spend was favorably impacted by the transformation and process improvements across the area. SG&A expenses were flat on a year-on-year basis, as increased commercial investments in new product launches were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
Total operating expenses declined 3% year-on-year and 22% sequentially. This performance reflects the combination of the first quarter being typically the lowest expense level during the calendar year, plus a share of the $400 million of incremental savings expected during 2015 from our transformation initiative. Going forward, we expect quarterly expenses to increase in line to modestly above historical trends, reflecting increasing launch and R&D investments through the balance of 2015. Other income and expenses improved 9% on a year-over-year basis at $146 million in the quarter.
The adjusted tax rate was 17% for the quarter, a 1.6 point increase versus Q1 of 2014. This increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings, partially offset by a state audit settlement in the quarter. As a result, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 33% on a year-over-year basis.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 6. For the first quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow, an increase of $0.2 billion over the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales and profitability.
Total debt outstanding ended Q1 at $30.3 billion and cash and investments totaled $27.1 billion. Additionally, our first quarter 2015 dividend increased to $0.79 per share, an increase of 30% versus the prior period.
Finally, in the first quarter of 2015, we increased our share repurchase activity with over 450 million of share repurchases or approximately 3 million shares in the period. We intend to continue repurchases at a stepped-up level in 2015, consistent with a commitment to complete up to $2 billion of repurchases by the end of the year.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2015 on Page 7. We remain on track with our plans to continue supporting growth of the business, while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. With regard to our updated outlook for 2015 revenue, we are raising the bottom end of the range, resulting in a revised guidance of $20.9 billion to $21.3 billion for 2015. This reflects solid revenue performance in the first quarter, partially offset by the effects of foreign currency headwinds, which will exceed $200 million for 2015 at current rates versus our original planning framework. Versus 2014 results, we expect over a $300 million revenue impact or 2% in 2015 at current foreign exchange rates. Our revenue guidance also reflects progress on our product launch activities as well as our latest view of evolving competitive dynamics.
We're also increasing our 2015 earnings per share outlook to $9.35 to $9.65 from the previous $9.05 to $9.40 forecast. The increased earnings outlook reflects continued conviction in our strategy and strong first quarter performance, along with an incremental expected headwind of $0.05 per share from foreign exchange. Versus 2014 results, we expect a $0.12 EPS impact in 2015 at current foreign exchange rates. We would also expect our quarterly tax rate to increase throughout the balance of the year to be more in line with our guidance range of 18% to 19%, which as a reminder, excludes the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in 2015. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $800 million this year.
This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony."

You'll find the summary of our global sales performance for the first quarter on Slide #9. I'm pleased to report that we're off to a strong start in our first quarter of 2015. We saw excellent execution across",1254,"Thank you, David, and good afternoon, folks. You'll find the summary of our global sales performance for the first quarter on Slide #9. I'm pleased to report that we're off to a strong start in our first quarter of 2015. We saw excellent execution across all aspects of our commercial strategy, launching products, growing our newer products and defending our mature in-line brands. Globally, product sales grew 12% year-over-year. As Bob mentioned, our U.S. business delivered outstanding results, with a 15% year-over-year growth and our international business grew 10% year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange.
Let me first update you on our new product launches. In the U.S., our recent launches of BLINCYTO for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the on-body injector for Neulasta are going very well with positive feedback from health care providers. BLINCYTO, as you know, was approved in 2.5 months by the FDA underscoring the unmet medical need in ALL patients. We are seeing a broad acceptance of the product with orders from most major institutions and good reimbursement access.
We launched the on-body injector for Neulasta during quarter 1. Patients no longer have to return to the hospital 24 hours later after their chemo. The on-body injector simply infuses Neulasta return. While still in the early phases of our launch, we have seen good rates of prescribing with about 800 accounts ordering product to date.
And last Wednesday, we received the approval for Corlanor to reduce the risk of hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure. Corlanor is the first new medicine for chronic heart failure in the U.S. in almost a decade. Heart failure is a common condition that affects nearly 6 million people with annual cost of over $30 million -- $30 billion in the U.S. The majority of these costs are related to hospitalizations. And we at Amgen estimate that as many as 1 million patients could be candidates for Corlanor therapy. 
Since our approval last week, our manufacturing team were working through the weekend, printing labels, packaging products and made our first shipment to wholesalers yesterday. The product will be in pharmacies later this week and our sales force are trained and in the field. We're excited about the opportunity and ready to bring this innovative new medicine to cardiologists and patients.
Let me now turn to the first quarter performance beginning with ENBREL. On Slide 12, you'll see that ENBREL delivered strong growth with 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by price. Segment growth remains strong in both rheumatology and dermatology, growing 23% and 30%, respectively. Competition continues to intensify, particularly in dermatology where ENBREL has lost 5 points of value share over the last year, but still retains 27% share. ENBREL continues to be a logical choice for patients starting treatment with a biologic.
On Slide 13, you'll see that sequentially ENBREL'S sales declined 17%. Unit declined 7%, reflecting normal quarter 1 season patterns and price growth of 9%, and there was a 17% unfavorable impact from the inventory. You may recall from our conference call in January that wholesale inventories ended 2014 at a higher-than-normal level by about $40 billion -- $40 million, and we expect the levels to return to normal in quarter 1. However in the first quarter, the days on hand dropped to the low end of the range. Additionally, revised prescription data revealed that there was a modest end customer buy-in, in the fourth quarter, which then burnt off in quarter 1.
To summarize, in quarter 1, the lower-than-normal wholesale inventory level, coupled with the end customer burnoff, negatively impacted sales. We expect ENBREL to deliver significant growth in 2015. And as we've said before, we remain committed to ENBREL becoming a $5 billion brand.
I'll move now to Prolia. Prolia delivered 39% growth year-over-year, with 30% unit growth in the U.S. and 44% in international. Over the last year, Prolia market share grew 3 percentage points in the U.S. and about 4 percentage points in Europe. This performance is driven by our program, simplified access, improved adherence, along with direct-to-consumer marketing in the U.S. Prolia is now capturing 1 in 3 patients starting postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment in the United States. As you can see from the market prescription data, the expected Q2 pickup is underway.
XGEVA continues its solid performance with a 22% growth year-over-year. U.S. unit share increased 4 percentage points over last year and in Europe, units share increased about 7 percentage points. Our brand strategy continues to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition.
Over time, Vectibix has received expanded indications into earlier lines of therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer in both the U.S. and Europe. This delivered an 18% year-over-year growth with exceptionally strong unit demand. We've also recently received an additional first line indication in combination with FOLFIRI in Europe.
Let me now turn to Kyprolis, which delivered year-on-year growth of 59% and quarter-over-quarter growth of 19%. In the U.S., we received priority review for label expansion into second line based on the ASPIRE data with a late July PDUFA date. We have submitted our application in Europe and it is currently under review. These data, together with our compelling ENDEAVOR data, should position Kyprolis as a best-in-class proteasome inhibitor.
Sensipar grew 24% year-over-year, driven by 14% unit growth, price and inventory levels compared to quarter 1 in 2014. Nplate grew 12% year-over-year with strong unit growth in all regions across the world.
Now I'll turn to our mature brands, starting with the filgrastim franchise. Neulasta delivered year-over-year growth of 4% in the first quarter, driven mainly by price and inventory changes. As I mentioned earlier, we launched the on-body Neulasta injector during the quarter, with very positive feedback from both providers and patients.
NEUPOGEN declined 15% year-over-year, mainly due to branded short-acting competition in the U.S. The strong execution by our U.S. NEUPOGEN team resulted in relative stable quarter-on-quarter sequential market share in the short-acting market around 80%. Granix sale was about 15% and Leukine about 5%. We continue to compete account by account and reinforce NEUPOGEN's long track record of clinical, efficacy and safety as well as our ability to reliably supply patients.
With potential competition from biosimilars expected in the U.S. this year, we will leverage the success we've had in the U.S. versus branded competition as well as our considerable experience with NEUPOGEN biosimilars in Europe.
Next up is EPOGEN, which had an unusual 16% year-over-year growth in the quarter. On top of price gains of 7%, EPOGEN's year-over-year growth benefited from a favorable compare to quarter 1 2014, where end customers drew down inventory levels significantly. In addition, quarter 1 2015 benefited from favorable accounting and discount adjustments, as well as higher end customer inventories due to an SKU conversion.
From underlying business perspective, dosing and hemoglobin levels remain relatively stable and the unit demand is relatively flat. Aranesp sales grew 4% year-over-year with a unit growth of 6%. A portion of this growth reflects the timing of early tender orders in the Middle East versus 2014.
So in conclusion, I'd like to say -- I'd like to firstly thank our Amgen customer-facing teams across the world. This is a unique moment in our company's history, where we are simultaneously launching, growing and defending more brands than ever before. I know our team is embracing the Amgen value of competing intensely to win, and has a clear focus on delivering value for shareholders, Amgen and most importantly, for patients. And now I pass it to Sean."

Good afternoon. So it continues to be a very busy time for Amgen R&D, and today I would like to start with our cardiovascular program, specifically the recent U.S. approval for Corlanor or ivabradine, for chronic symptomatic systolic heart failure. Chronic heart failure is in the rise in the United States and represents a very large and growing health care expenditure burden, primarily due to the cost of repeated hospitalizations in these very fragile patients. In fact, reducing hospitalizations in these patients is a specific focus of many health care systems, including Medicare. A resting heart rate of 70 or more appears to be a maladaptive response in the setting of chronically reduced cardiac pump function, yet despite the availability of the beta blockers, many heart failure patients in the United States maintain such an elevated heart rate at rest. For these patients, Corlanor's unique mechanism of action may potentially benefit them with respect to reducing their risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure. 
In the large outcome study performed by our colleague at Servier, called SHIFT, that risk was reduced by 26% compared to placebo on top of standard of care, including beta blockade. Obviously, reduction in hospitalizations reflects patients doing better overall in terms of their heart failure management. We're not only thrilled with the prospect of making Corlanor available to chronic heart failure patients in the U.S., but we also view this as an excellent way to introduce ourselves as a company to the U.S. cardiology community as we prepare for the launch of our PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha. Of course, Repatha continues to be a main focus for us, and we were very pleased to see the enthusiasm for this agent at the recent American College of Cardiology meetings in response to the data we presented there and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It's quite remarkable to see so much depth of understanding and appreciation of the potential benefit risk profile of a novel mechanism by cardiologists and lipid specialists. We were also pleased to have filed Repatha in Japan with our partners at Astellas. The last thing I'd like to mention, our cardiovascular portfolio is Omecamtiv mecarbil, or AMG 423, the novel mechanism agent we are advancing in systolic heart failure with Cytokinetics. We look forward to seeing the data in the second half of this year from our Phase II chronic oral study which has now completed enrollment.
Turning to oncology. We were pleased to receive priority review from FDA on our Kyprolis sNDA for relapsed multiple myeloma based on the ASPIRE data, and we look forward to continued interactions with regulators to bring Kyprolis to patients in need. Also in the relapsed setting, we were quite encouraged by the ENDEAVOR data, demonstrating a doubling of progression-free survival on patients randomized to Kyprolis as compared to Velcade. We look forward to providing the details of these results at ASCO in the multiple myeloma oral session on Tuesday morning.
We are also initiating a Phase III study of a weekly dosing regimen for Kyprolis which we feel will be quite important for patients and caregivers. I'd also note that during the first quarter, Vectibix was approved in the EU for first-line metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with FOLFIRI and was also granted full approval of the EU.
Turning to T-VEC. We completed the Phase Ib portion of the T-VEC combination study we're performing in metastatic melanoma in collaboration with Merck and their PD-1 antibody, KEYTRUDA, and we expect to advance next into the Phase III portion of this exciting study. 
We're in the final planning stages of the similar Phase Ib/III study in head and neck cancer with Merck and KEYTRUDA as well. Clearly, the vast majority of potential value of T-VEC lies in priming the immune system in combination with checkpoint inhibitors and other mechanisms that modulate the immune system's discrimination between cells and non-cells. We continue to explore such opportunities, both within our own pipeline as well as in collaboration with others.
In the meantime, despite the very rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape since the design of the T-VEC monotherapy study in melanoma, including the approval of multiple agents with proven overall survival, we continue to believe that it is important to make T-VEC monotherapy available to the patient segments in which meaningful rates of durable response were observed in Phase III. We therefore look forward to our discussions on this topic at the FDA advisory committee meeting scheduled for April 29.
Finally, we have decided to stop administration of blinded investigational product in the Phase III study of trebananib in first-line ovarian cancer based on recommendations by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, who deemed the study unlikely to achieve its primary PFS endpoint.
In the inflammation space, our Phase III psoriasis data from Brodalumab, our IL-17 receptor antagonist, was very well-received at the recent American Academy of Dermatology meeting, as we discussed in detail at our investor relation event. For those of you who were not able to participate, in addition to the very compelling efficacy data, including superiority over STELARA or ustekinumab, along with an overall balanced safety profile, we did note that we've seen suicidal ideation and behavior in our Brodalumab PET program in these patients known to be at risk for these events. However, we believe the evidence to date does not suggest the causal relationship between IL-17 innovation and suicidal ideation and behavior. Data has been provided to regulatory authorities and we will be discussing it with them on an ongoing basis. This topic will be an important and appropriate focus of regulators in their analysis of the risk-benefit profile during their review of the applications we plan to file for Brodalumab. Along with our partners at AstraZeneca, we do anticipate submitting this agent globally mid-year. We also recently decided to stop the Phase II asthma study with Brodalumab based on futility at a planned interim analysis.
In other areas, our Phase III head-to-head study at AMG 416 versus Sensipar in hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism was positive, and we anticipate initiating global regulatory submissions in the second half of this year. Our biosimilars program also continues to advance with positive Phase III data for our HUMIRA biosimilar in rheumatoid arthritis. We view our migraine prophylaxis program with our CGRP receptor antagonist antibody, AMG 334, as a top priority, and we will strive to be both first and best in class in this field. We expect to present data from our phase IIb episodic migraine study at the International Headache Society Congress next month and to initiate Phase III later this year.
Finally, I'd like to thank the R&D team at Amgen for their continued focus on innovation and execution of our key programs. In particular, recently, it was very nice to see the level of acknowledgment paid to the remarkable breakthroughs in human genetics by deCode in Iceland, celebrated in both the scientific and lay press. There will certainly be much more to come in this very exciting era of biology. Bob?"

One is we had indicated previously that we expect this year, our transformation to deliver about $400 million of incremental savings. And certainly, we saw a share -- a proportionate share of that already land here in Q1, and those savings will continue pretty steadily through the year. The second dynamic on cost then is around the cost trends, in particular, if I look at SG&A in the sales and marketing area, as well as R&D, we do expect to see rising costs, which is a combination of the fact that we inevitably -- normally, for the business the first quarter is the low point for expenses overall for the year, but I think importantly, for us right now, we do have these launches that are coming up. We do expect to underwrite those launches significantly with this transformation savings, and we do expect the trend of spending to increase through the year.

Secondly, if you look at the particular pattern of savings in the first quarter, what you can observe, as I've mentioned, is that and as we've talked before, we are investing, freeing up flexibility to invest in our launch portfolio, so you can expect that a substantial share of what we save in SG&A will be reinvested towards the launches. And then I think the third thing I'd comment as to R&D, that was a combination in the quarter of R&D tends to be rather lumpy in terms of the spend. So you saw a combination of savings that we're getting from our transformation in the quarter, as well as some of the inevitable lumpiness that occurs from quarter-to-quarter in that area. So I think bottom line is that we expect going forward through the year to see rising costs, which you typically see in a pattern through the year, but see it a little more accentuated as a combination of rising costs with launch activities, as well as in the case of R&D, we still are continuing to invest in clinical trials and we'll see some increases there.

Thank you, Arvind, and good afternoon, everyone, thank you for joining our call. As you can see from our results, we're off to a solid start so far in 2015, and our performance during the quarter is a good indication that we're on track to deliver our long-term objectives as well.
Financially, we delivered a strong quarter, really across the board. Our U.S. business delivered 15% growth and internationally, we were up 10% at constant currency. Product performance was solid across the portfolio, and I was especially pleased with the strong growth we delivered for Prolia, XGEVA, Kyprolis, ENBREL and Vectibix. 
Heading into the balance of the year, we have good momentum in our base business. And Tony will have more to say about that in a few minutes. Our earnings growth of 33% reflects the benefits of our transformation initiatives and our discipline in controlling expenses ahead of the launch investments that we'll make later this year. As David will share, based on the strong performance in the quarter, we're raising our 2015 earnings guidance. 
With the Corlanor approval last week, we're excited to bring the first new heart failure medicine to the market in the U.S. in almost a decade. Corlanor was approved to reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure, which as you know is a significant economic burden on our society. Through Corlanor, we look forward to establishing our presence in the cardiovascular field as we prepare to launch Repatha later this year. 
In addition to Corlanor, we're launching BLINCYTO for patients with relapsed refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia and our Neulasta on-body injector, which addresses a real clinical problem with an innovative solution that enables the administration of Neulasta the day after chemotherapy.
R&D, as you know, is a core focus at Amgen and our pipeline continues to deliver results that position us well for future growth. We reported a third successful Phase III study for AMG 416, an intravenous calcimimetic for use in kidney disease and a second successful Phase III study for our lead biosimilar product, adalimumab.
In oncology, Kyprolis delivered impressive results, showing a doubling of progression-free survival versus bortezomib in relapsed multiple myeloma patients in our ENDEAVOR study, and of course, these data come on the back of the unprecedented progression-free survival data that were generated in our ASPIRE trial.
Kyprolis is currently under accelerated review in both the U.S. and Europe for multiple myeloma patients who've relapsed, and we're excited with the opportunity to bring this important medicine to many more patients globally. Sean will speak more about progress in our pipeline in a few moments.
And in summary, there's a lot to be pleased about with our progress so far this year. Our strategy is working and it's delivering results. We're executing effectively across the company, controlling the things that are ours to control. Our focus and priorities have never been more clear. Our launches are proceeding well and we're ready to launch Repatha later this year. We continue to grow key products, including ENBREL, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Sensipar and Nplate. We have strong momentum as we defend our base business against new competition, and our transformation efforts are delivering efficiencies and cost savings across the company, and we're being very disciplined about capping them. Finally, we continue to advance our robust pipeline of important medicines, setting the stage for long-term growth.
Before I hand over to David, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their unwavering commitment to delivering for patients and for shareholders. David?"

Turning to the first quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenues at $5 billion grew 11% year-over-year with 12% product sales growth, driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Total revenue and product sales were impacted 2% unfavorably due to foreign exchange headwinds.
Adjusted operating income at $2.4 billion grew 32% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved to 50% for the quarter, reflecting strong growth and continued progress from our transformation initiatives. On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 15.1% improved by 0.6 points, driven by lower royalties and higher average net sales price, offset partially by product mix.
Research and development expenses at approximately $850 million were down 14% versus the prior year. R&D spend was favorably impacted by the transformation and process improvements across the area. SG&A expenses were flat on a year-on-year basis, as increased commercial investments in new product launches were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
Total operating expenses declined 3% year-on-year and 22% sequentially. This performance reflects the combination of the first quarter being typically the lowest expense level during the calendar year, plus a share of the $400 million of incremental savings expected during 2015 from our transformation initiative. Going forward, we expect quarterly expenses to increase in line to modestly above historical trends, reflecting increasing launch and R&D investments through the balance of 2015. Other income and expenses improved 9% on a year-over-year basis at $146 million in the quarter.
The adjusted tax rate was 17% for the quarter, a 1.6 point increase versus Q1 of 2014. This increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings, partially offset by a state audit settlement in the quarter. As a result, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 33% on a year-over-year basis.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 6. For the first quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow, an increase of $0.2 billion over the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales and profitability.
Total debt outstanding ended Q1 at $30.3 billion and cash and investments totaled $27.1 billion. Additionally, our first quarter 2015 dividend increased to $0.79 per share, an increase of 30% versus the prior period.
Finally, in the first quarter of 2015, we increased our share repurchase activity with over 450 million of share repurchases or approximately 3 million shares in the period. We intend to continue repurchases at a stepped-up level in 2015, consistent with a commitment to complete up to $2 billion of repurchases by the end of the year.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2015 on Page 7. We remain on track with our plans to continue supporting growth of the business, while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. With regard to our updated outlook for 2015 revenue, we are raising the bottom end of the range, resulting in a revised guidance of $20.9 billion to $21.3 billion for 2015. This reflects solid revenue performance in the first quarter, partially offset by the effects of foreign currency headwinds, which will exceed $200 million for 2015 at current rates versus our original planning framework. Versus 2014 results, we expect over a $300 million revenue impact or 2% in 2015 at current foreign exchange rates. Our revenue guidance also reflects progress on our product launch activities as well as our latest view of evolving competitive dynamics.
We're also increasing our 2015 earnings per share outlook to $9.35 to $9.65 from the previous $9.05 to $9.40 forecast. The increased earnings outlook reflects continued conviction in our strategy and strong first quarter performance, along with an incremental expected headwind of $0.05 per share from foreign exchange. Versus 2014 results, we expect a $0.12 EPS impact in 2015 at current foreign exchange rates. We would also expect our quarterly tax rate to increase throughout the balance of the year to be more in line with our guidance range of 18% to 19%, which as a reminder, excludes the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in 2015. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $800 million this year.
This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony."

I'm pleased to report that we're off to a strong start in our first quarter of 2015. We saw excellent execution across all aspects of our commercial strategy, launching products, growing our newer products and defending our mature in-line brands. Globally, product sales grew 12% year-over-year. As Bob mentioned, our U.S. business delivered outstanding results, with a 15% year-over-year growth and our international business grew 10% year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange.
Let me first update you on our new product launches. In the U.S., our recent launches of BLINCYTO for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the on-body injector for Neulasta are going very well with positive feedback from health care providers. BLINCYTO, as you know, was approved in 2.5 months by the FDA underscoring the unmet medical need in ALL patients. We are seeing a broad acceptance of the product with orders from most major institutions and good reimbursement access.
We launched the on-body injector for Neulasta during quarter 1. Patients no longer have to return to the hospital 24 hours later after their chemo. The on-body injector simply infuses Neulasta return. While still in the early phases of our launch, we have seen good rates of prescribing with about 800 accounts ordering product to date.
And last Wednesday, we received the approval for Corlanor to reduce the risk of hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure. Corlanor is the first new medicine for chronic heart failure in the U.S. in almost a decade. Heart failure is a common condition that affects nearly 6 million people with annual cost of over $30 million -- $30 billion in the U.S. The majority of these costs are related to hospitalizations. And we at Amgen estimate that as many as 1 million patients could be candidates for Corlanor therapy. 
Since our approval last week, our manufacturing team were working through the weekend, printing labels, packaging products and made our first shipment to wholesalers yesterday. The product will be in pharmacies later this week and our sales force are trained and in the field. We're excited about the opportunity and ready to bring this innovative new medicine to cardiologists and patients.
Let me now turn to the first quarter performance beginning with ENBREL. On Slide 12, you'll see that ENBREL delivered strong growth with 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by price. Segment growth remains strong in both rheumatology and dermatology, growing 23% and 30%, respectively. Competition continues to intensify, particularly in dermatology where ENBREL has lost 5 points of value share over the last year, but still retains 27% share. ENBREL continues to be a logical choice for patients starting treatment with a biologic.
On Slide 13, you'll see that sequentially ENBREL'S sales declined 17%. Unit declined 7%, reflecting normal quarter 1 season patterns and price growth of 9%, and there was a 17% unfavorable impact from the inventory. You may recall from our conference call in January that wholesale inventories ended 2014 at a higher-than-normal level by about $40 billion -- $40 million, and we expect the levels to return to normal in quarter 1. However in the first quarter, the days on hand dropped to the low end of the range. Additionally, revised prescription data revealed that there was a modest end customer buy-in, in the fourth quarter, which then burnt off in quarter 1.
To summarize, in quarter 1, the lower-than-normal wholesale inventory level, coupled with the end customer burnoff, negatively impacted sales. We expect ENBREL to deliver significant growth in 2015. And as we've said before, we remain committed to ENBREL becoming a $5 billion brand.
I'll move now to Prolia. Prolia delivered 39% growth year-over-year, with 30% unit growth in the U.S. and 44% in international. Over the last year, Prolia market share grew 3 percentage points in the U.S. and about 4 percentage points in Europe. This performance is driven by our program, simplified access, improved adherence, along with direct-to-consumer marketing in the U.S. Prolia is now capturing 1 in 3 patients starting postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment in the United States. As you can see from the market prescription data, the expected Q2 pickup is underway.
XGEVA continues its solid performance with a 22% growth year-over-year. U.S. unit share increased 4 percentage points over last year and in Europe, units share increased about 7 percentage points. Our brand strategy continues to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition.
Over time, Vectibix has received expanded indications into earlier lines of therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer in both the U.S. and Europe. This delivered an 18% year-over-year growth with exceptionally strong unit demand. We've also recently received an additional first line indication in combination with FOLFIRI in Europe.
Let me now turn to Kyprolis, which delivered year-on-year growth of 59% and quarter-over-quarter growth of 19%. In the U.S., we received priority review for label expansion into second line based on the ASPIRE data with a late July PDUFA date. We have submitted our application in Europe and it is currently under review. These data, together with our compelling ENDEAVOR data, should position Kyprolis as a best-in-class proteasome inhibitor.
Sensipar grew 24% year-over-year, driven by 14% unit growth, price and inventory levels compared to quarter 1 in 2014. Nplate grew 12% year-over-year with strong unit growth in all regions across the world.
Now I'll turn to our mature brands, starting with the filgrastim franchise. Neulasta delivered year-over-year growth of 4% in the first quarter, driven mainly by price and inventory changes. As I mentioned earlier, we launched the on-body Neulasta injector during the quarter, with very positive feedback from both providers and patients.
NEUPOGEN declined 15% year-over-year, mainly due to branded short-acting competition in the U.S. The strong execution by our U.S. NEUPOGEN team resulted in relative stable quarter-on-quarter sequential market share in the short-acting market around 80%. Granix sale was about 15% and Leukine about 5%. We continue to compete account by account and reinforce NEUPOGEN's long track record of clinical, efficacy and safety as well as our ability to reliably supply patients.
With potential competition from biosimilars expected in the U.S. this year, we will leverage the success we've had in the U.S. versus branded competition as well as our considerable experience with NEUPOGEN biosimilars in Europe.
Next up is EPOGEN, which had an unusual 16% year-over-year growth in the quarter. On top of price gains of 7%, EPOGEN's year-over-year growth benefited from a favorable compare to quarter 1 2014, where end customers drew down inventory levels significantly. In addition, quarter 1 2015 benefited from favorable accounting and discount adjustments, as well as higher end customer inventories due to an SKU conversion.
From underlying business perspective, dosing and hemoglobin levels remain relatively stable and the unit demand is relatively flat. Aranesp sales grew 4% year-over-year with a unit growth of 6%. A portion of this growth reflects the timing of early tender orders in the Middle East versus 2014.
So in conclusion, I'd like to say -- I'd like to firstly thank our Amgen customer-facing teams across the world. This is a unique moment in our company's history, where we are simultaneously launching, growing and defending more brands than ever before. I know our team is embracing the Amgen value of competing intensely to win, and has a clear focus on delivering value for shareholders, Amgen and most importantly, for patients. And now I pass it to Sean."

So it continues to be a very busy time for Amgen R&D, and today I would like to start with our cardiovascular program, specifically the recent U.S. approval for Corlanor or ivabradine, for chronic symptomatic systolic heart f",1179,"Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. So it continues to be a very busy time for Amgen R&D, and today I would like to start with our cardiovascular program, specifically the recent U.S. approval for Corlanor or ivabradine, for chronic symptomatic systolic heart failure. Chronic heart failure is in the rise in the United States and represents a very large and growing health care expenditure burden, primarily due to the cost of repeated hospitalizations in these very fragile patients. In fact, reducing hospitalizations in these patients is a specific focus of many health care systems, including Medicare. A resting heart rate of 70 or more appears to be a maladaptive response in the setting of chronically reduced cardiac pump function, yet despite the availability of the beta blockers, many heart failure patients in the United States maintain such an elevated heart rate at rest. For these patients, Corlanor's unique mechanism of action may potentially benefit them with respect to reducing their risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure. 
In the large outcome study performed by our colleague at Servier, called SHIFT, that risk was reduced by 26% compared to placebo on top of standard of care, including beta blockade. Obviously, reduction in hospitalizations reflects patients doing better overall in terms of their heart failure management. We're not only thrilled with the prospect of making Corlanor available to chronic heart failure patients in the U.S., but we also view this as an excellent way to introduce ourselves as a company to the U.S. cardiology community as we prepare for the launch of our PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha. Of course, Repatha continues to be a main focus for us, and we were very pleased to see the enthusiasm for this agent at the recent American College of Cardiology meetings in response to the data we presented there and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It's quite remarkable to see so much depth of understanding and appreciation of the potential benefit risk profile of a novel mechanism by cardiologists and lipid specialists. We were also pleased to have filed Repatha in Japan with our partners at Astellas. The last thing I'd like to mention, our cardiovascular portfolio is Omecamtiv mecarbil, or AMG 423, the novel mechanism agent we are advancing in systolic heart failure with Cytokinetics. We look forward to seeing the data in the second half of this year from our Phase II chronic oral study which has now completed enrollment.
Turning to oncology. We were pleased to receive priority review from FDA on our Kyprolis sNDA for relapsed multiple myeloma based on the ASPIRE data, and we look forward to continued interactions with regulators to bring Kyprolis to patients in need. Also in the relapsed setting, we were quite encouraged by the ENDEAVOR data, demonstrating a doubling of progression-free survival on patients randomized to Kyprolis as compared to Velcade. We look forward to providing the details of these results at ASCO in the multiple myeloma oral session on Tuesday morning.
We are also initiating a Phase III study of a weekly dosing regimen for Kyprolis which we feel will be quite important for patients and caregivers. I'd also note that during the first quarter, Vectibix was approved in the EU for first-line metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with FOLFIRI and was also granted full approval of the EU.
Turning to T-VEC. We completed the Phase Ib portion of the T-VEC combination study we're performing in metastatic melanoma in collaboration with Merck and their PD-1 antibody, KEYTRUDA, and we expect to advance next into the Phase III portion of this exciting study. 
We're in the final planning stages of the similar Phase Ib/III study in head and neck cancer with Merck and KEYTRUDA as well. Clearly, the vast majority of potential value of T-VEC lies in priming the immune system in combination with checkpoint inhibitors and other mechanisms that modulate the immune system's discrimination between cells and non-cells. We continue to explore such opportunities, both within our own pipeline as well as in collaboration with others.
In the meantime, despite the very rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape since the design of the T-VEC monotherapy study in melanoma, including the approval of multiple agents with proven overall survival, we continue to believe that it is important to make T-VEC monotherapy available to the patient segments in which meaningful rates of durable response were observed in Phase III. We therefore look forward to our discussions on this topic at the FDA advisory committee meeting scheduled for April 29.
Finally, we have decided to stop administration of blinded investigational product in the Phase III study of trebananib in first-line ovarian cancer based on recommendations by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, who deemed the study unlikely to achieve its primary PFS endpoint.
In the inflammation space, our Phase III psoriasis data from Brodalumab, our IL-17 receptor antagonist, was very well-received at the recent American Academy of Dermatology meeting, as we discussed in detail at our investor relation event. For those of you who were not able to participate, in addition to the very compelling efficacy data, including superiority over STELARA or ustekinumab, along with an overall balanced safety profile, we did note that we've seen suicidal ideation and behavior in our Brodalumab PET program in these patients known to be at risk for these events. However, we believe the evidence to date does not suggest the causal relationship between IL-17 innovation and suicidal ideation and behavior. Data has been provided to regulatory authorities and we will be discussing it with them on an ongoing basis. This topic will be an important and appropriate focus of regulators in their analysis of the risk-benefit profile during their review of the applications we plan to file for Brodalumab. Along with our partners at AstraZeneca, we do anticipate submitting this agent globally mid-year. We also recently decided to stop the Phase II asthma study with Brodalumab based on futility at a planned interim analysis.
In other areas, our Phase III head-to-head study at AMG 416 versus Sensipar in hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism was positive, and we anticipate initiating global regulatory submissions in the second half of this year. Our biosimilars program also continues to advance with positive Phase III data for our HUMIRA biosimilar in rheumatoid arthritis. We view our migraine prophylaxis program with our CGRP receptor antagonist antibody, AMG 334, as a top priority, and we will strive to be both first and best in class in this field. We expect to present data from our Phase IIb episodic migraine study at the International Headache Society Congress next month and to initiate Phase III later this year.
Finally, I'd like to thank the R&D team at Amgen for their continued focus on innovation and execution of our key programs. In particular, recently, it was very nice to see the level of acknowledgment paid to the remarkable breakthroughs in human genetics by deCode in Iceland, celebrated in both the scientific and lay press. There will certainly be much more to come in this very exciting era of biology. Bob?"

One is we had indicated previously that we expect this year, our transformation to deliver about $400 million of incremental savings. And certainly, we saw a share -- a proportionate share of that already land here in Q1, and those savings will continue pretty steadily through the year. The second dynamic on cost then is around the cost trends, in particular, if I look at SG&A in the sales and marketing area, as well as R&D, we do expect to see rising costs, which is a combination of the fact that we inevitably -- normally, for the business the first quarter is the low point for expenses overall for the year, but I think importantly, for us right now, we do have these launches that are coming up. We do expect to underwrite those launches significantly with this transformation savings, and we do expect the trend of spending to increase through the year.

So I think bottom line is that we expect going forward through the year to see rising costs, which you typically see in a pattern through the year, but see it a little more accentuated as a combination of rising costs with launch activities, as well as in the case of R&D, we still are continuing to invest in clinical trials and we'll see some increases there. And then as to the -- if I may, one final comment, R versus D, basically as we've talked before, we've done work to look at all of the processes across all of our business activities, and so we're seeing efficiencies in both of those areas, broadly."

Thank you, Arvind, and let me welcome all of you who've dialed in for our second quarter earnings call.
The strategy we laid out in our 2014 Investor Day continues to deliver strong results, and our Q2 financial and operational performance is a good indication that we're on track to deliver our long-term objectives. This is an exciting time at Amgen. Not only are we delivering strong financial results, but our new product story continues to take shape as well. It was a successful second quarter on this front, both with recent launches and preparations for upcoming launches well underway.
We entered the year excited about 6 new product launches, and at the halfway point, we're already reporting progress on 5 of them. With its European approval, was the first PCSK9 inhibitor approved globally. We were pleased with the FDA Advisory Committee recommendation for approval in the United States and look forward to an approval on or before PDUFA date the next month.
When we acquired Onyx, we believed that Kyprolis would become part of the backbone of multiple myeloma therapy by demonstrating superiority over the current standard of care and moving into earlier lines of therapy.  The results of ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR exceeded our expectations. And we clearly have an attractive opportunity now with Kyprolis in our expanded indication in relapsed multiple myeloma.
The response to BLINCYTO has been positive with physicians and is making a difference in certain leukemia patients who've exhausted all other treatment options. The Neulasta On-body Injector, our innovative delivery system that provides differentiation in the marketplace, is performing well in the few short months since its launch.
We are making progress with Corlanor as well by communicating the value proposition to physicians and payers while paving the way for Repatha in the U.S. cardiology community.
It's very rewarding to see the difference with these innovative products are making for patients.
Beyond these products, our pipeline continued to deliver results, and Sean will provide additional details on our progress in a moment. In addition to what was accomplished in the second quarter, we have other pipeline milestones in the near term, including global regulatory submissions for AMG 416, our innovative and upcoming data for heart failure and process and of course, our biosimilar mab us well.
All of what I just talked about gives us confidence in the long-term growth of our business. And for this year, we're raising guidance again, and David Meline will share details of that with you momentarily.
In summary, I'm very pleased with our continued strong execution against our priorities for the year. And this includes our progress on the 5 newly launched products, the strong growth in our key products like ENBREL, Prolia, XGEVA, and Nplate and our ongoing transformation efforts.
Before turning over to David, let me just thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their commitment to deliver for patients and for our shareholders. David?"

Turning to the second quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenue of $5.4 billion grew 4% year-over-year, with product sales growth driven at 6% driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenue decreased $86 mil",882,"Okay. Thanks, Bob. Turning to the second quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenue of $5.4 billion grew 4% year-over-year, with product sales growth driven at 6% driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenue decreased $86 million year-over-year, due primarily to milestones recognized in the second quarter of last year. Total revenue and product sales were negatively impacted by approximately 2.5% due to foreign exchange headwinds.
Adjusted operating income of $2.6 billion grew 10% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 2 points to 49% for the quarter, reflecting our continued growth and the benefits from our transformation initiatives. On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 15.1% improved 0.8 points, driven by lower royalties and higher average net sales price. 
Research and development expenses at $918 million were down 6% versus the prior year. R&D spend was favorably impacted by the transformation and process improvements across the area, partially offset by increased support for later stage clinical programs.
SG&A expenses were up 2% on a year-over-year basis. increased commercial investments in new product launches were partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
Total operating expenses declined 1% year-over-year and increased 9% sequentially. For the quarter, operating expenses benefited by 3 percentage points from foreign exchange year-over-year. We also saw an increase of spending in Q2 versus the prior quarter, which is a typical pattern for the business.  In the second half of the year, we expect quarterly expenses to decrease in line to modestly above historical experience, reflecting increasing launch and R&D investments through the balance of 2015.
Other income and expenses declined by $65 million or 45% on a year-over-year basis to a net expense of $79 million in the quarter. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by gains in the strategic invest and venture investments. I would note that Q1 is a better indicator of the underlying run rate for other income and expenses in light of the investment gains in Q2.
The adjusted tax rate was 20% for the quarter, a 3.8 point increase versus Q2 2014. This increase was primarily due to unfavorable tax impact of changes in our geographic mix of earnings. Our tax rate for the first half of the year was 18.6%, consistent with our guidance for the year.  As a result, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 8% on a year-over-year basis.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 6. For the second quarter, we generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $0.6 billion over the prior year. This increase was driven by improved working capital and higher operating income as well as cash gains realized from a portion of our foreign exchange forward contracts. Total debt outstanding ended Q2 at $32 billion, and cash and investments totaled $30 billion.  Additionally, our second quarter 2015 dividend was $0.79 per share, an increase of 30% versus the prior year.
Finally, in the second quarter of 2015, we increased our share repurchase activity versus the prior year with $500 million of cash deployed to share repurchases or approximately 3.3 million shares in the period. We continued to execute on the commitment to repurchase $2 billion of shares by year-end 2015. And as of now, we have repurchased a total of $1.3 billion worth of shares at an average price of $157 since our business review last October.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2015 on Page 7. We remain on track with our plans to grow the business and invest for the future while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. In 2015, we remain on track to deliver over $400 million of efficiency savings from the transformation, most of which will be reinvested in the business.
With regards to our updated outlook for 2015 revenue, we are increasing our guidance to $21.1 billion to $21.4 billion from our prior range of $20.9 billion to $21.3 billion, reflecting solid revenue performance. Versus 2014 results, we expect unfavorable revenue impact of almost $400 million or 2% in 2015, assuming current foreign exchange rates prevail through year-end.  Our revenue guidance also reflects process and our product launch activities as well as our latest view of evolving competitive dynamics. 
We are also increasing our 2015 adjusted earnings per share outlook to $9.55 to $9.80 a share from the previous $9.35 to $9.65 forecast. The revised earnings outlook reflects continued conviction in our strategy and strong performance, including lower expenses due to cost discipline.  Versus 2014 results, we expect an approximate $0.11 adjusted EPS impact in 2015 at current foreign exchange rates.
Turning to the tax rate. For the full year, we expect to have an adjusted rate within the range of 18% to 19%. As a reminder, this excludes the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in 2015. 
We now expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year, which is $100 million lower than our previous guidance. 
As our results through the first half of the year highlights, our transformation efforts are now well established, and we are encouraged to see cost improvements across the business.
This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Tony."

You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the second quarter on Slide #9. Once again, we delivered a strong sales quarter. We saw excellent execution across all aspects of our commercial strategy.",1475,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, folks. You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the second quarter on Slide #9. Once again, we delivered a strong sales quarter. We saw excellent execution across all aspects of our commercial strategy. delivering newer products, defending Neulasta and EPOGEN and launching important new medicines. Globally, product product sales grew 6% year-on-year with our U.S. business delivered 9% year-over-year growth and our international business growing 5% year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange.
Let me now turn to the products, beginning with ENBREL. On Slide #11, you'll see that ENBREL delivered strong growth of 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by net selling price. Segment growth remains strong in rheumatology and dermatology, growing 23% and 28% respectively. Quarter-on-quarter, we held our share in rheumatology at 29%, while share in dermatology declined 1 percentage point to 26%.  New dermatology entrants are not simply taking share from the incumbents, but also growing the market. Quarter-on-quarter, ENBREL sales increased 21%. You will recall that in April, I described how the first quarter was negatively impacted by wholesale inventories and end customer industry
burn-off. in the second quarter, inventories returned to normal levels.  ENBREL has delivered significant growth for us. With exclusivity in the U.S. until 2029, we will continue to invest in ENBREL and believe that it is well on its way to becoming a $5 billion brand.
Sensipar grew 15% year-over-year, driven by strong unit growth in both the U.S. and Europe.
I'll now move to Prolia. Prolia delivered 29% growth year-on-year driven by volume increases in both the U.S. and in Europe. The graph on Slide 13 will remind you of the historical path of Prolia sales, in which the second and fourth quarters are our strongest. Our focus on direct-to-consumer marketing and simplifying patient access to the U.S. continued to drive higher new patient starts and improved patient adherence whilst on Prolia. This is led to unit share gains of about 4% in the U.S. and about 3 percentage points in Europe.
XGEVA grew 11% year-over-year, due to a share increase of about 4 percentage points in the U.S. and about 6 percentage points in Europe. The quarter-over-quarter decline in U.S. was driven by a Q1 customer buy-in. Absent the buy-in, the U.S. sequential unit growth was 6%. Our brand strategy continues to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition. We've also recently successfully negotiated expanded XGEVA access for patients in France, one of our largest markets outside the United States.
expansion of Vectibix to earlier lines therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer in both the U.S. and Europe continued to deliver growth. We continue to see unit growth in the U.S. of close to 40% and in Europe of 10%. The second quarter was also positively impacted by timing of shipments to our Japanese partner.
Nplate grew 6% year-over-year, driven by a 7% unit growth.
Now to Kyprolis, which delivered year-over-year growth of 53% and a quarter-over-quarter growth of 10%. We are very excited about the recent U.S. approval in relapsed or second line multiple myeloma. The ASPIRE data clearly demonstrated the longest period of progression-free survival in any Phase III trial to date. This is an important treatment regimen that now become available to a greater number of relapsed patients as shown on Slide #8.  The U.S. team launched this new indication on Monday this week. The ASPIRE data, with our compelling ENDEAVOR data which submitted to the FDA demonstrating superiority of Velcade in melanoma, strengthens Kyprolis' position as the best-in-class inhibitor. We anticipate further approval for Kyprolis outside the United States by the end of this year, including Europe, Canada and South America.
Let me now turn to our mature brands starting with pegfilgrastim franchise. Neulasta delivered year-over-year growth of 2% driven mainly by net selling price. The launch of the On-body Injector for Neulasta is growing exceptionally well. As a reminder, the On-body Injector means that patients no longer have to return to the hospital or clinic 24 after  . the On-body Injector delivers Neulasta at home at the appropriate time. I'm pleased to report that the Neulasta On-body Injector has already achieved 8% market share of the Neulasta business in its first full quarter [indiscernible]. And we continue to grow both the depth and the breadth of prescribing.  Over 50% of our Neulasta accounts have purchased the On-body Injector.
NEUPOGEN declined 14% year-over-year in the second quarter. This is primarily due to branded short acting competition in the U.S, which gained about 2 share points versus the first quarter. We continue to compete account by account and reinforced NEUPOGEN's long track record of clinical efficacy and safety as well as our ability to support patients reliably.
Turning now to our ESA products. EPOGEN declined 4% year-over-year, including an 11% decline. About 1/3 of this unit decline was due to competition. The remaining unit decline was a shift in focuses to Aranesp in some of our U.S. accounts. With select U.S. dialysis customers have an increasing interest in a long-acting ESA, were actively promoting aranesp them have seen some very early success.
Global Aranesp sales declined 7% year-over-year. There are some important underlying dynamics, however, as the U.S. saw an 8% unit growth for the year, driven by the shift in some dialysis business from EPOGEN to Aranesp that I just mentioned, while international sales declined year-over-year because of foreign exchange rates.
Although Aranesp has prolonged exclusivity in the U.S. extending to 2024, we know that biosimilars through EPOGEN, NEUPOGEN and Neulasta are making plans to launch in the U.S. market. Santos announced its intention to launch it short-acting biosimilar in the U.S. sometime after September 3 this year, and we expect other biosimilars may come in 2016.
Although Santos' biosimilar against NEUPOGEN will serve as the first true biosimilar entrant into the U.S. market, ranks has reserved somewhat of a proxy, having captured about 17% share of the short-acting pegfilgrastim market after abou t 18 months into the market. We are planning for the arrival of competition and have prepared to compete. We will leverage the success we have had in the U.S. versus branded competition as well as our considerable experience for beating ESA and NEUPOGEN biosimilars in Europe. We expect our products to continue to generate substantial cash flows for years to come even after competitors enter the market.
Let me now update you on our new product launches. As you know, our cholesterol-lowering medication, Repatha, was approved in Europe earlier this month. We are very excited to be making this new cholesterol-lowering medication available for patients and are actively engaged in our pending reimbursement across Europe. We anticipate the first European launches to began during the third quarter of this year.  In the U.S., we look forward to our upcoming FDA approval. Remember our PDUFA date is August 27. 
Our cardiovascular sales force is already in the field with their recent launch of Corlanor, which I'll discuss in a moment. And we're hearing a lot of excitement from our customers about the immediate launch of Repatha.
We already achieved 60%-plus penetration of eligible patients in the U.S. for BLINCYTO, our innovative antibody for acute leukemia. With the approval of Phase II data, we continue to expand awareness of the significant benefits of BLINCYTO across the physician base that treat the seriously ill patients. We look forward to expanding BLINCYTO's label and our black -- in platform into other cancer types.
Corlanor was approved in the second quarter as an add-on to CHS standard of care, and the team is making great progress with penetration and access. With Corlanor, we also paving the way for our Repatha launch. Our sales force have already called on the majority of our targeted cardiologists.
As I look ahead, this is a very exciting time for Amgen. I'm pleased with a strong performance in the first half of this year led by our growth products: ENBREL, Sensipar, Prolia, XGEVA, Nplate and of course, Kyprolis. This will give us an excellent momentum into the second half of the year. 
We've also made tremendous progress with 4 of our 6 innovative new launches this year. BLINCYTO, Corlanor and the Neulasta On-body Injector on all off to great starts. And on Monday, we launched Kyprolis into the expanded indication of relapsed multiple myeloma. 
We're anticipating the approval in the U.S. for T-VEC, our novel antibody metastatic melanoma later this year and Repatha in the U.S. imminently.
Our teams are laser focused, poised and ready for launch. We look forward to bringing these new innovative medicines to patients following the FDA approval.
Before I close, I'd like to express my thanks to our Amgen customer-facing teams across the world for their unwavering focus on delivering value to patients and shareholder alike. Let me now pass you to Sean."

And I'd like to begin from an R&D perspective with Repatha, which was the first approved PCSK9 inhibitor in the world based on our recent approval in the EU. It's important to keep in mind, I think, it was early work by Amgen research scientists that led to significant advances in elucidating the pathway by which PCSK9 regulates LDL-cholesterol and which led to the publication of the crystal structure of PCSK9 in 2007. I just want to recognize the effort within the Amgen R&D organization to advance this program from discovery research to the clinic in less than a decade. As I said before, having an in-house scientific expertise to elucidate complex biology is an often underappreciated attribute, but it's critical in establishing strong intellectual property.
In the U.S., we were quite pleased with the development of the FDA Advisory Committee and are working with agency to get Repatha to patients as soon as possible. The FDA's target action date is August 27.
We continue to be inspired by the potential for Repatha to help drive revolution in the global fight against cardiovascular disease, the world's greatest killer and are looking forward to the results in 2016 from our intravascular ultrasound imaging study that we're conducting in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic as well as our 27,500-patient outcomes trial, which was completed enrollemnt and for which we expect results no later than 2017. This is an event-driven study. And as we stated before, the FDA Advisory Committee meeting, there's a possibility can see the data in 2016.
Turning to oncology. We were very pleased to receive approval from FDA for our Kyprolis submission for relapsed multiple myeloma based on the ASPIRE data. Recall that in addition of Kyprolis to resulted in longest progression-free survival ever reported in the relapsed multiple myeloma side. And this regimen was considered by the expert discussion at the recent ASCO multiple myeloma session to be ""the standard of care.""
Again in the relapsed setting, we were quite encouraged by the response of physicians at ASCO to the ENDEAVOR data, demonstrating a doubling of progression free brand domestic Nplate compared head-to-head with Velcade in the context of much lower uropathy risks with Kyprolis.  We submitted the ENDEAVOR did in the United States, and we'll submit this data after the ASPIRE accelerated assessment study in the EU. 
We've recently completed enrollment in our Phase III CLARION study of Kyprolis versus Velcade in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients, and look forward to those results sometime in 2017. We have also initiated our Phase III study of once-weekly dosing for Kyprolis in the relapsed refractory setting potentially providing patients and physicians with a more convenient dosing option.
In our continued efforts to development that provide the greatest benefits for patients, we recently reported results of the studies demonstrating that Vectibix had an overall survival benefit versus best support care in a Phase III study at chemo refractory metastatic colorectal patients with type tumors.
We are gratified to see the support of the FDA advisory for the use of T-VEC as a monotherapy in the metastatic melanoma setting, and continue to work with regulators to bring this to patients. We see the greatest potential of T-VEC in combination with a so-called checkpoint inhibitors. And we continue to advance our collaborations with the Merck and take PD1 and Roche PDL1 antibodies that we've recently announced.
We also recently announced the positive Phase II study of BLINCYTO in Philadelphia chromosome positive relapsed refractory ALL, which demonstrated similar efficacy and safety to our U.S. approved indication in Philadelphia chromosome negative a LL. Approximately 1/4 of adults with ALL are Philadelphia chromosome positive. And our study included relapsed patients that were refractory to tyrosine kinase inhibitor with very poor prognosis. We look forward to discussing the results to regulators to determine next steps.
At ASCO, we presented data that demonstrated Prolia significantly reduced bone fractures in breast cancer patients receiving aromatase inhibitors, suggesting a potential benefit of initiating Prolia with aromatase inhibitor therapy to decrease the risk of fracture. Also in our bone programs, we're getting closer to seeing the data from Romosozumab, with the first placebo controlled in the postmenopausal study expected to read out in the first half of 2016. Recall that Romosozumab is our anti-sclerosing oath were developing with CP. Given to the extent that Romosozumab is increase both permission, the high-quality of that bone, coupled with strong human genetic validation for the pathway, all this lead us to believe we will see a significant reduction in fractures and Romosozumab will become an important addition to the treatment of osteoporosis.
One final regulatory update is we anticipate initiating global regulatory submissions in the third quarter for our innovative cinematic AMG 416 in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Our migraine prophylaxis program with CGRP receptor antagonist antibody AMG 334 is now enrolling Phase III episodic migraine studies. The 52-week data from our Phase IIb episodic migraine study were recently presented at the meeting of the American Headache Society, demonstrating durability effect with no new safety signals. Our Phase IIb chronic migraine study continues to enroll patients, and we look forward to seeing this data next year.  We continue to view AMG 334 is a very exciting opportunities to help patients suffering from this debilitating condition. 
In our earlier stage pipeline, we're looking forward to data from our Phase II study of the oral formulation of  , activator we're developing with cytogenetics in the heart failure in the fourth quarter of this year. We also continue to make progress on our pipe platform with our next molecule, AMG 330, close to initiating Phase I in acute myeloid setting, an area of profound unmet need. we're also advancing the molecules in the clinic in neuro science and immunooncology areas, and I look forward to speaking with you about these programs in the future.
Finally, I'd like to thank the Amgen R&D team for their continued focus on innovation and execution of our key programs. In particular, I was very proud of our command at the and the data at the recent FDA Advisory Committee meetings. Bob?"

And that's exactly what we're seeing in humans. particularly we measure that in the doses that are required to suppress the skin reactions in the capsaicin PD assays that used by many of the companies in early phase development. I think what it really comes down to, and what I've always referred to, is this will be -- this is an ambulatory otherwise well patient population. They are going to want the easiest potential dosing format once a month, let's say small volume, low-paying injection in a disposable auto injector. The question is whether all of these products can achieve that kind of profile. It's going to be easier for us to do that, we believe because we have a more potent agent, and so there's so much antibody that can be packed into unknown be there. And so it remains to be seen whether like antibodies can read that the bill and get a single injection monthly and some may or so made up. We feel confident about being able to do that. So I think it's a bearing out , but we'll have to see whether it translates into a real clinical differentiator in the marketplace and time will tell."

Thank you, Arvind, and let me welcome all of you who've dialed in for our second quarter earnings call.The strategy we laid out in our 2014 Investor Day continues to deliver strong results, and our Q2 financial and operational performance is a goo",504,"Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and let me welcome all of you who've dialed in for our second quarter earnings call.
The strategy we laid out in our 2014 Investor Day continues to deliver strong results, and our Q2 financial and operational performance is a good indication that we're on track to deliver our long-term objectives. This is an exciting time at Amgen. Not only are we delivering strong financial results, but our new product story continues to take shape as well. It was a successful second quarter on this front, both with recent launches and preparations for upcoming launches well underway.
We entered the year excited about 6 new product launches, and at the halfway point, we're already reporting progress on 5 of them. With its European approval, Repatha was the first PCSK9 inhibitor approved globally. We were pleased with the FDA Advisory Committee recommendation for approval in the United States and look forward to an approval on or before our PDUFA date the next month.
When we acquired Onyx, we believed that Kyprolis would become part of the backbone of multiple myeloma therapy by demonstrating superiority over the current standard of care and moving into earlier lines of therapy. The results of ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR exceeded our expectations, and we clearly have an attractive opportunity now with Kyprolis in our expanded indication in relapsed multiple myeloma.
The response to BLINCYTO has been positive with physicians and is making a difference in certain leukemia patients who've exhausted all other treatment options. The Neulasta on-body injector, our innovative delivery system that provides differentiation in the filgrastim marketplace, is performing well in the few short months since its launch.
We're making progress with Corlanor as well by communicating the value proposition to physicians and payers, while paving the way for Repatha in the U.S. cardiology community.
It's very rewarding to see the difference with these innovative products we're making for patients.
Beyond these products, our pipeline continued to deliver results, and Sean will provide additional details on our progress in a moment. In addition to what was accomplished in the second quarter, we have other pipeline milestones in the near term, including global regulatory submissions for AMG 416, our innovative calcimimetic, an upcoming data from Omecamtiv mecarbil and heart failure romosozumab in osteoporosis and, of course, our biosimilar bevacizumab as well.
All of what I just talked about gives us confidence in the long-term growth of our business. And for this year, we're raising guidance again, and David Meline will share details of that with you momentarily.
In summary, I'm very pleased with our continuing strong execution against our priorities for the year, and this includes our progress on the 5 newly launched products, the strong growth in our key products, like ENBREL, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate, and our ongoing transformation efforts.
Before turning over to David, let me just thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their commitment to deliver for patients and for our shareholders.

Turning to the second quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenue at $5.4 billion grew 4% year-over-year with product sales growth driven at 6%, driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenue decreased $86 mil",885,"Okay. Thanks, Bob. Turning to the second quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenue at $5.4 billion grew 4% year-over-year with product sales growth driven at 6%, driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenue decreased $86 million year-over-year due primarily to milestones recognized in the second quarter of last year. Total revenue and product sales were negatively impacted by approximately 2.5% due to foreign exchange headwinds.
Adjusted operating income at $2.6 billion grew 10% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 2 points to 49% for the quarter, reflecting our continued growth and the benefits from our transformation initiatives.
On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 15.1% improved 0.8 points driven by lower royalties and higher average net sales price.
Research and development expenses at $918 million were down 6% versus the prior year. R&D spend was favorably impacted by the transformation and process improvements across the area partially offset by increased support for later-stage clinical programs.
SG&A expenses were up 2% on a year-over-year basis. Increased commercial investments in new product launches were partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
Total operating expenses declined 1% year-on-year and increased 9% sequentially. For the quarter, operating expenses benefited by 3 percentage points from foreign exchange year-over-year. We also saw an increase of spending in Q2 versus the prior quarter, which is a typical pattern for the business.
In the second half of the year, we expect quarterly expenses to increase in line to modestly above historical experience, reflecting increasing launch and R&D investments through the balance of 2015.
Other income and expenses declined by $65 million or 45% on a year-over-year basis to a net expense of $79 million in the quarter. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by gains in the strategic invest -- and venture investments. I would note that Q1 is a better indicator of the underlying run rate for other income and expenses in light of the investment gains in Q2.
The adjusted tax rate was 20% for the quarter, a 3.8 point increase versus Q2 2014. This increase was primarily due to unfavorable tax impact of changes in our geographic mix of earnings. Our tax rate for the first half of the year was 18.6%, consistent with our guidance for the year. As a result, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 8% on a year-over-year basis.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 6. For the second quarter, we generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $0.6 billion over the prior year. This increase was driven by improved working capital and higher operating income as well as cash gains realized from a portion of our foreign exchange forward contracts.
Total debt outstanding ended Q2 at $32 billion, and cash and investments totaled $30 billion. Additionally, our second quarter 2015 dividend was $0.79 per share, an increase of 30% versus the prior year.
Finally, in the second quarter of 2015, we increased our share repurchase activity versus the prior year with $500 million of cash deployed to share repurchases or approximately 3.3 million shares in the period. We continue to execute on the commitment to repurchase $2 billion of shares by year-end 2015. And as of now, we have repurchased a total of $1.3 billion worth of shares at an average price of $157 since our business review last October.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2015 on Page 7. We remain on track with our plans to grow the business and invest for the future while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. In 2015, we remain on track to deliver over $400 million of the efficiency savings from the transformation, most of which will be reinvested in the business.
With regard to our updated outlook for 2015 revenue, we're increasing our guidance to $21.1 billion to $21.4 billion from our prior range of $20.9 billion to $21.3 billion, reflecting continued solid revenue performance. Versus 2014 results, we expect an unfavorable revenue impact of almost $400 million or 2% in 2015, assuming current foreign exchange rates prevail through year end. Our revenue guidance also reflects progress on our product launch activities as well as our latest view of evolving competitive dynamics.
We are also increasing our 2015 adjusted earnings per share outlook to $9.55 to $9.80 a share from the previous $9.35 to $9.65 forecast. The revised earnings outlook reflects continued conviction in our strategy and strong performance, including lower expenses due to cost discipline. Versus 2014 results, we expect an approximate $0.11 adjusted EPS impact in 2015 at current foreign exchange rates.
Turning to the tax rate. For the full year, we expect to have an adjusted rate within the range of 18% to 19%. As a reminder, this excludes the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in 2015.
We now expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year, which is $100 million lower than our previous guidance.
As our results through the first half of the year highlight, our transformation efforts are now well established, and we are encouraged to see cost improvements across the business.
This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Tony."

You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the second quarter on Slide #9. Once again, we delivered a strong sales quarter. We saw excellent execution across all aspects of our commercial strategy,",1503,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, folks. You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the second quarter on Slide #9. Once again, we delivered a strong sales quarter. We saw excellent execution across all aspects of our commercial strategy, growing our newer products, defending filgrastim and EPOGEN and launching important new medicines.
Globally, product sales grew 6% year-on-year, and our U.S. business delivered 9% year-over-year growth with our international business growing 5% year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange.
Let me now turn to the products beginning with ENBREL. On Slide #11, you'll see that ENBREL delivered strong growth of 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by net selling price. Segment growth remains strong in rheumatology and dermatology, growing 23% and 28%, respectively. Quarter-on-quarter, we held our share in rheumatology at 29%, while share in dermatology declined 1 percentage point to 26%. New dermatology entrants are not simply taking share from the incumbents but also growing the market. Quarter-on-quarter, ENBREL sales increased 21%. You will recall that in April, I described how the first quarter was negatively impacted by lower wholesale inventories and end-customer industry
burn-off. In the second quarter, inventories returned to normal levels.
ENBREL has delivered significant growth for us. With exclusivity in the U.S. until 2029, we will continue to invest in ENBREL and believe it is well on its way to becoming a $5 billion brand.
Sensipar grew 15% year-over-year driven by strong unit growth in both the U.S. and Europe.
I'll now move to Prolia. Prolia delivered 29% growth year-on-year driven by volume increases in both the U.S. and in Europe. The graph on Slide 13 will remind you of the historical path of the Prolia sales, in which the second and the fourth quarters are our strongest. Our focus on direct-to-consumer marketing and simplifying patient access in the U.S. continued to drive higher new patient starts and improve patient adherence once on Prolia. This has led to unit share gains of about 4% in the U.S. and about 3 percentage points in Europe.
XGEVA grew 11% year-over-year, driven [ph] by share increase of about 4 percentage points in the U.S. and about 6 percentage points in Europe. The quarter-over-quarter decline in the U.S. was driven by a Q1 customer buy-in. Absent the buy-in, the U.S. sequential unit growth was 6%. Our brand strategy continues to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition. We've also recently successfully negotiated expanded the XGEVA access for patients in France, one of our largest markets outside the United States.
The expansion of Vectibix into earlier lines of therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer in both the U.S. and Europe continued to deliver growth. We continue to see unit growth in the U.S. of 12% to 40% and in Europe of 9% to 10%. The second quarter was also positively impacted by timing of shipments to our Japanese partner.
Nplate grew 6% year-over-year driven by a 7% unit growth.
Now to Kyprolis, which delivered a year-over-year growth of 53% and a quarter-over-quarter growth of 10%. We are very excited about the recent U.S. approval in relapsed or second-line multiple myeloma. The ASPIRE data clearly demonstrated the longest period of progression-free survival in any Phase III trial to date. This is an important treatment regimen that now become available to a greater number of relapsed patients as shown on Slide #8. The U.S. team launched this new indication on Monday this week. The ASPIRE data, coupled with our compelling ENDEAVOR data, which we just submitted to the FDA, demonstrating superiority over Velcade in relapsed multiple myeloma, strengthens Kyprolis' position as the best-in-class proteasome inhibitor. We anticipate further approval for Kyprolis outside the United States by the end of this year, including Europe, Canada and South America.
Let me now turn to our mature brands starting with filgrastim franchise. Neulasta delivered a year-over-year growth of 2% driven mainly by net selling price. The launch of the on-body injector for Neulasta is growing exceptionally well. As a reminder, the on-body injector means that patients no longer have to return to the hospital or clinic 24 hours after they chemo. The on-body injector, some people [ph] delivers Neulasta at home at the appropriate time.
I'm pleased to report that the Neulasta on-body injector has already achieved 8% market share of the Neulasta business in its first full quarter [indiscernible]. And we continue to grow both the depth and the breadth of prescribing. Over 50% of our Neulasta accounts have purchased the on-body injector.
NEUPOGEN declined 14% year-over-year in the second quarter. This was primarily due to branded short-acting competition in the U.S., which gained about 2 share points versus the first quarter. We continue to compete account by account and reinforce NEUPOGEN's long track record of clinical efficacy and safety as well as our ability to supply patients reliably.
Turning now to our ESA products. EPOGEN declined 4% year-over-year, including an 11% decline. About 1/3 of this unit decline was due to competition. The remaining unit decline was a shift in purchases to Aranesp in some of our U.S. dialysis accounts. With select U.S. dialysis customers having an increase in interest in a long-acting ESA, we're actively promoting Aranesp to them and are seeing some early success.
Global Aranesp sales declined 7% over -- year-over-year. There are some important underlying dynamics, however, as the U.S. saw an 8% unit growth for the year driven by the shift in some dialysis business from EPOGEN to Aranesp that I just mentioned, while international sales declined year-over-year because of foreign exchange rates.
Although Aranesp has prolonged exclusivity in the U.S. extending to 2024, we know that biosimilars through EPOGEN, NEUPOGEN and Neulasta are making plans to launch in the U.S. market. Sandoz announced its intention to launch a short-acting filgrastim biosimilar in the U.S. sometime after September 3 this year, and we expect other biosimilars may come in 2016.
Although Sandoz's biosimilar against NEUPOGEN will serve as the first true biosimilar entrant into the U.S. market, Teva's Granix has served somewhat of a proxy, having captured about 17% share of the short-acting filgrastim market after about 18 months in the market.
We are planning for the arrival of new competition and are prepared to compete. We will leverage the success that we've had in the U.S. versus branded competition as well as our considerable experience competing against ESA and NEUPOGEN biosimilars in Europe. We expect our products to continue to generate substantial cash flows for years to come even after competitors enter the market.
Let me now update you on our new product launches. As you know, our cholesterol-lowering medication, Repatha, was approved in Europe earlier this month. We are very excited to be making this new cholesterol-lowering medication available for patients and are actively engaged in obtaining reimbursement across Europe. We anticipate the first European launches to begin during the third quarter of this year. In the U.S., we look forward to our coming FDA approval. Remember, our PDUFA date is August 27.
Our cardiovascular sales force is already in the field with the recent launch of Corlanor, which I'll discuss in a moment. And we're hearing a lot of excitement from our customers about the imminent launch of Repatha.
We've already achieved 60%-plus penetration of eligible patients in the U.S. for BLINCYTO, our innovative antibody for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. With an approval base in Phase II data, we continue to expand awareness of the significant benefits of BLINCYTO across the physician base that treats these seriously ill patients. We look forward to expanding BLINCYTO's label and our black [ph] platform into other cancer types.
Corlanor was approved in the second quarter as an add-on to CHF standard of care, and the team is making great progress with penetration and access. With Corlanor, we're also paving the way for our Repatha launch. Our CB [ph] sales force have already called on the majority of our targeted cardiologists.
As I look ahead, this is a very exciting time for Amgen. I'm pleased with the strong performance in the first half of this year led by our growth products: ENBREL, Sensipar, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate and, of course, Kyprolis. This will give us an excellent momentum into the second half of the year.
We've also made tremendous progress with 4 of our 6 innovative new launches this year. BLINCYTO, Corlanor and the Neulasta on-body injector are all off to great starts. And on Monday, we launched Kyprolis into the expanded indication of relapsed multiple myeloma.
We're anticipating the approval in the U.S. for T-VEC, our novel oncolytic for metastatic melanoma later this year, and Repatha in the U.S. imminently.
Our teams are laser-focused, poised and ready for launch. We look forward to bringing these new innovative medicines to patients following the FDA approval.
Before I close, I'd like to express my thanks to our Amgen customer-facing teams across the world for their unwavering focus on delivering value to patients and shareholders alike.
Let me now pass you to Sean."

And I'd like to begin, from an R&D perspective, with Repatha, which was the first approved PCSK9 inhibitor in the world based on our recent approval in the EU.",1076,"Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. It continues to be, as Tony said, an exciting time at Amgen. And I'd like to begin, from an R&D perspective, with Repatha, which was the first approved PCSK9 inhibitor in the world based on our recent approval in the EU. It's important to keep in mind that, I think, it was early work by Amgen research scientists that led to significant advances in elucidating the pathway by which PCSK9 regulates LDL cholesterol and which led to the publication of the crystal structure of PCSK9 in 2007. I just want to recognize the effort within the Amgen R&D organization to advance this program from discovery research to the clinic in less than a decade. As I said before, having the in-house scientific expertise to elucidate complex biology is an often underappreciated attribute, but it's critical in establishing strong intellectual property.
In the U.S., we were quite pleased with the vote of the FDA Advisory Committee and are working with the agency to get Repatha to patients as soon as possible. The FDA's target action date is August 27.
We continue to be inspired by the potential for Repatha to help strive a revolution in the global fight against cardiovascular disease, the world's greatest killer, and are looking forward to the results in 2016 from our intravascular ultrasound imaging study that we're conducting in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic as well as our 27,500 patient outcomes trial, which has completed enrollment and for which we expect results no later than 2017. This is an event-driven study. And as we stated before at the FDA Advisory Committee meeting, there's a possibility we could see the data in 2016.
Turning to oncology. We were very pleased to receive approval from FDA for our Kyprolis submission for relapsed multiple myeloma based on the ASPIRE data. Recall that the addition of Kyprolis to Revlimid and dexamethasone resulted in the longest progression-free survival ever reported in the relapsed multiple myeloma side. And this regimen was considered by the expert discussion at the recent ASCO multiple myeloma session to be ""the standard of care.""
Again, in the relapsed setting, we were quite encouraged by the response of physicians at ASCO to the ENDEAVOR data, demonstrating a doubling of progression-free survival on patients randomized to Kyprolis compared head to head without Velcade in the context of much lower peripheral neuropathy risk with Kyprolis. We submitted the ENDEAVOR data in the United States, and we'll submit these data after the ASPIRE accelerated assessment approval in the EU.
We've recently completed enrollment in our Phase III CLARION study of Kyprolis versus Velcade in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients and look forward to those results some time in 2017. We have also initiated our Phase III study of once-weekly dosing for Kyprolis in the relapsed refractory setting, potentially providing patients and physicians with a more convenient dosing option.
In our continued effort to develop medicines that provide the greatest benefit to patients, we recently reported results of the studies, demonstrating that Vectibix had an overall survival benefit versus best support of care in a Phase III study at chemo refractory metastatic colorectal cancer patients with RAS wild-type tumors.
We were gratified to see the support of the FDA Advisory Committee for the use of T-VEC as a monotherapy in the metastatic melanoma setting, and we continue to work with regulators to bring this agent to patients. We see the greatest potential of T-VEC in combination with a so-called checkpoint inhibitors, and we continue to advance our collaborations with the Merck anti-PD-1 and Roche anti-PDL1 antibodies that we've recently announced.
We also very recently announced the positive Phase II study of BLINCYTO in Philadelphia chromosome positive relapsed refractory ALL, which demonstrated similar efficacy and safety to our U.S.-approved indication in Philadelphia chromosome negative ALL. Approximately 1/4 of adults with ALL are Philadelphia chromosome positive. And our study included relapsed patients that were refractory to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies who have very poor prognosis. We look forward to discussing the results with regulators to determine next steps.
At ASCO, we presented data that demonstrated Prolia significantly reduced bone fractures in breast cancer patients receiving aromatase inhibitors, suggesting a potential benefit of initiating Prolia with aromatase inhibitor therapy to decrease the risk of fracture. Also in our bone programs, we're getting closer to seeing the fracture data from romosozumab with the first placebo controlled in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study expected to read out in the first half of 2016. Recall that romosozumab is our anti-sclerosing antibody we're developing with UCB. Given to the extent that romosozumab is able to increase bone formation, the high quality of that bone, coupled with strong human genetic validation for the pathway, all this lead us to believe we will see a significant reduction in fractures, and romosozumab will become an important addition to the treatment of osteoporosis.
One final regulatory update is we anticipate initiating global regulatory submissions in the third quarter for our innovative calcimimetic peptide AMG 416 in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.
Our migraine prophylaxis program with our CGRP receptor antagonist antibody, AMG 334, is now enrolling Phase III episodic migraine studies. The 52-week data from our Phase IIb episodic migraine study were recently presented at the meeting of the American Headache Society, demonstrating durability of effect with no new safety signals. Our Phase IIb chronic migraine study continues to enroll patients, and we look forward to seeing those data next year. We continue to view AMG 334 as a very exciting opportunity to help patients suffering from this debilitating condition.
In our earlier-stage pipeline, we're looking forward to data from our Phase II study of the oral formulation of Omecamtiv mecarbil, the niacin activator we're developing with Cytokinetics in the heart failure setting in the fourth quarter of this year. We also continue to make progress on our white [ph] platform with our next molecule, AMG 330, close to initiating Phase I in the acute myeloid leukemia setting, an area of profound unmet need. We're also advancing new molecules in the clinic in neuroscience and immuno-oncology areas, and I look forward to speaking with you about these programs in the future.
Finally, I'd like to thank the Amgen R&D team for their continued focus on innovation and execution of our key programs. In particular, I was very proud of our command at the science and the data at our recent FDA Advisory Committee meetings.

And that's exactly what we're seeing in humans as well as, particularly, you can measure that in the doses that are required to suppress the skin reactions in the capsaicin PD assays that were used by many of the companies in the early phase development. I think, really, what it comes down to and what I've always referred to is that this will be -- this is an ambulatory, otherwise well, patient population that are going to want the easiest potential dosing format, once a month, let's say, small volume, low-paying injection in a disposable auto injector. The question is whether the -- all of these products can achieve that kind of profile. It's going to be easier for us to do that, we believe, because we have a more potent agent. And so yes, there's only so much antibody that can be packed into a milliliter. And so it remains to be seen whether the ligand antibodies can thread that needle and get to a single injection monthly, some may; some may not. We're quite confident about being able to do that. So I think it's bearing out scientifically, but we'll have to see whether it translates into a real clinical differentiator in the marketplace, and time will tell."

Thank you, Arvind, and let me welcome all of you who've dialed in for our second quarter earnings call.
The strategy we laid out in our 2014 Investor Day continues to deliver strong results, and our Q2 financial and operational performance is a good indication that we're on track to deliver our long-term objectives. This is an exciting time at Amgen. Not only are we delivering strong financial results, but our new product story continues to take shape as well. It was a successful second quarter on this front, both with recent launches and preparations for upcoming launches well underway.
We entered the year excited about 6 new product launches, and at the halfway point, we're already reporting progress on 5 of them. With its European approval, Repatha was the first PCSK9 inhibitor approved globally. We were pleased with the FDA Advisory Committee recommendation for approval in the United States and look forward to an approval on or before our PDUFA date the next month.
When we acquired Onyx, we believed that Kyprolis would become part of the backbone of multiple myeloma therapy by demonstrating superiority over the current standard of care and moving into earlier lines of therapy. The results of ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR exceeded our expectations, and we clearly have an attractive opportunity now with Kyprolis in our expanded indication in relapsed multiple myeloma.
The response to BLINCYTO has been positive with physicians and is making a difference in certain leukemia patients who've exhausted all other treatment options. The Neulasta on-body injector, our innovative delivery system that provides differentiation in the filgrastim marketplace, is performing well in the few short months since its launch.
We're making progress with Corlanor as well by communicating the value proposition to physicians and payers, while paving the way for Repatha in the U.S. cardiology community.
It's very rewarding to see the difference that these innovative products we're making for patients.
Beyond these products, our pipeline continued to deliver results, and Sean will provide additional details on our progress in a moment. In addition to what was accomplished in the second quarter, we have other pipeline milestones in the near term, including global regulatory submissions for AMG 416, our innovative calcimimetic, an upcoming data from omecamtiv mecarbil and heart failure romosozumab in osteoporosis and, of course, our biosimilar bevacizumab as well.
All of what I just talked about gives us confidence in the long-term growth of our business. And for this year, we're raising guidance again, and David Meline will share details of that with you momentarily.
In summary, I'm very pleased with our continuing strong execution against our priorities for the year, and this includes our progress on the 5 newly launched products, the strong growth in our key products, like ENBREL, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate, and our ongoing transformation efforts.
Before turning over to David, let me just thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their commitment to deliver for patients and for our shareholders.

Turning to the second quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenue at $5.4 billion grew 4% year-over-year with product sales growth driven at 6%, driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenue decreased $86 mil",885,"Okay. Thanks, Bob. Turning to the second quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenue at $5.4 billion grew 4% year-over-year with product sales growth driven at 6%, driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenue decreased $86 million year-over-year due primarily to milestones recognized in the second quarter of last year. Total revenue and product sales were negatively impacted by approximately 2.5% due to foreign exchange headwinds.
Adjusted operating income at $2.6 billion grew 10% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 2 points to 49% for the quarter, reflecting our continued growth and the benefits from our transformation initiatives.
On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 15.1% improved 0.8 points driven by lower royalties and higher average net sales price.
Research and development expenses at $918 million were down 6% versus the prior year. R&D spend was favorably impacted by the transformation and process improvements across the area partially offset by increased support for later-stage clinical programs.
SG&A expenses were up 2% on a year-over-year basis. Increased commercial investments in new product launches were partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
Total operating expenses declined 1% year-on-year and increased 9% sequentially. For the quarter, operating expenses benefited by 3 percentage points from foreign exchange year-over-year. We also saw an increase of spending in Q2 versus the prior quarter, which is a typical pattern for the business.
In the second half of the year, we expect quarterly expenses to increase in line to modestly above historical experience, reflecting increasing launch and R&D investments through the balance of 2015.
Other income and expenses declined by $65 million or 45% on a year-over-year basis to a net expense of $79 million in the quarter. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by gains in our strategic invest -- and venture investments. I would note that Q1 is a better indicator of the underlying run rate for other income and expenses in light of the investment gains in Q2.
The adjusted tax rate was 20% for the quarter, a 3.8 point increase versus Q2 2014. This increase was primarily due to unfavorable tax impact of changes in our geographic mix of earnings. Our tax rate for the first half of the year was 18.6%, consistent with our guidance for the year. As a result, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 8% on a year-over-year basis.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 6. For the second quarter, we generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $0.6 billion over the prior year. This increase was driven by improved working capital and higher operating income as well as cash gains realized from a portion of our foreign exchange forward contracts.
Total debt outstanding ended Q2 at $32 billion, and cash and investments totaled $30 billion. Additionally, our second quarter 2015 dividend was $0.79 per share, an increase of 30% versus the prior year.
Finally, in the second quarter of 2015, we increased our share repurchase activity versus the prior year with $500 million of cash deployed to share repurchases or approximately 3.3 million shares in the period. We continue to execute on the commitment to repurchase $2 billion of shares by year-end 2015. And as of now, we have repurchased a total of $1.3 billion worth of shares at an average price of $157 since our business review last October.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2015 on Page 7. We remain on track with our plans to grow the business and invest for the future while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. In 2015, we remain on track to deliver over $400 million of the efficiency savings from the transformation, most of which will be reinvested in the business.
With regard to our updated outlook for 2015 revenue, we're increasing our guidance to $21.1 billion to $21.4 billion from our prior range of $20.9 billion to $21.3 billion, reflecting continued solid revenue performance. Versus 2014 results, we expect an unfavorable revenue impact of almost $400 million or 2% in 2015, assuming current foreign exchange rates prevail through year end. Our revenue guidance also reflects progress on our product launch activities as well as our latest view of evolving competitive dynamics.
We are also increasing our 2015 adjusted earnings per share outlook to $9.55 to $9.80 a share from the previous $9.35 to $9.65 forecast. The revised earnings outlook reflects continued conviction in our strategy and strong performance, including lower expenses due to cost discipline. Versus 2014 results, we expect an approximate $0.11 adjusted EPS impact in 2015 at current foreign exchange rates.
Turning to the tax rate. For the full year, we expect to have an adjusted rate within the range of 18% to 19%. As a reminder, this excludes the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in 2015.
We now expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year, which is $100 million lower than our previous guidance.
As our results through the first half of the year highlight, our transformation efforts are now well established, and we are encouraged to see cost improvements across the business.
This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Tony."

You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the second quarter on Slide #9. Once again, we delivered a strong sales quarter. We saw excellent execution across all aspects of our commercial strategy,",1500,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, folks. You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the second quarter on Slide #9. Once again, we delivered a strong sales quarter. We saw excellent execution across all aspects of our commercial strategy, growing our newer products, defending filgrastim and EPOGEN and launching important new medicines.
Globally, product sales grew 6% year-on-year, and our U.S. business delivered 9% year-over-year growth with our international business growing 5% year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange.
Let me now turn to the products, beginning with ENBREL. On Slide #11, you'll see that ENBREL delivered strong growth of 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by net selling price. Segment growth remains strong in rheumatology and dermatology, growing 23% and 28%, respectively. Quarter-on-quarter, we held our share in rheumatology at 29%, while share in dermatology declined 1 percentage point to 26%. New dermatology entrants are not simply taking share from the incumbents but also growing the market. Quarter-on-quarter, ENBREL sales increased 21%. You will recall that in April, I described how the first quarter was negatively impacted by lower wholesale inventories and end-customer industry
burn-off. In the second quarter, inventories returned to normal levels.
ENBREL has delivered significant growth for us. With exclusivity in the U.S. until 2029, we will continue to invest in ENBREL and believe it is well on its way to becoming a $5 billion brand.
Sensipar grew 15% year-over-year driven by strong unit growth in both the U.S. and Europe.
I'll now move to Prolia. Prolia delivered 29% growth year-on-year driven by volume increases in both the U.S. and in Europe. The graph on Slide 13 will remind you of the historical path of the Prolia sales, in which the second and the fourth quarters are our strongest. Our focus on direct-to-consumer marketing and simplifying patient access in the U.S. continued to drive higher new patient starts and improve patient adherence once on Prolia. This has led to unit share gains of about 4% in the U.S. and about 3 percentage points in Europe.
XGEVA grew 11% year-over-year, giving a share increase of about 4 percentage points in the U.S. and about 6 percentage points in Europe. The quarter-over-quarter decline in the U.S. was driven by a Q1 customer buy-in. Absent the buy-in, the U.S. sequential unit growth was 6%. Our brand strategy continues to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition. We've also recently successfully negotiated expanded XGEVA access for patients in France, one of our largest markets outside the United States.
The expansion of Vectibix into earlier lines of therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer in both the U.S. and Europe continued to deliver growth. We continue to see unit growth in the U.S. of 12% to 40% and in Europe of 9% to 10%. The second quarter was also positively impacted by timing of shipments to our Japanese partner.
Nplate grew 6% year-over-year driven by a 7% unit growth.
Now to Kyprolis, which delivered a year-over-year growth of 53% and a quarter-over-quarter growth of 10%. We are very excited about the recent U.S. approval in relapsed or second-line multiple myeloma. The ASPIRE data clearly demonstrated the longest period of progression-free survival in any Phase III trial to date. This is an important treatment regimen that will now become available to a greater number of relapsed patients as shown on Slide #8. The U.S. team launched this new indication on Monday this week. The ASPIRE data, coupled with our compelling ENDEAVOR data, which we just submitted to the FDA, demonstrates superiority over Velcade in relapsed multiple myeloma, strengthens Kyprolis' position as the best-in-class proteasome inhibitor. We anticipate further approval for Kyprolis outside the United States by the end of this year, including Europe, Canada and South America.
Let me now turn to our mature brands starting with the filgrastim franchise. Neulasta delivered a year-over-year growth of 2% driven mainly by net selling price. The launch of the on-body injector for Neulasta is growing exceptionally well. As a reminder, the on-body injector means that patients no longer have to return to the hospital or clinic 24 hours after chemo. The on-body injector, simply delivers Neulasta at home at the appropriate time.
I'm pleased to report that the Neulasta on-body injector has already achieved 8% market share of the Neulasta business in its first full quarter on the market. And we continue to grow both the depth and the breadth of prescribing. Over 50% of our Neulasta accounts have purchased the on-body injector.
NEUPOGEN declined 14% year-over-year in the second quarter. This was primarily due to branded short-acting competition in the U.S., which gained about 2 share points versus the first quarter. We continue to compete account by account and reinforce NEUPOGEN's long track record of clinical efficacy and safety as well as our ability to supply patients reliably.
Turning now to our ESA products. EPOGEN declined 4% year-over-year, including an 11% decline. About 1/3 of this unit decline was due to competition. The remaining unit decline was a shift in purchases to Aranesp in some of our U.S. dialysis accounts. With select U.S. dialysis customers having an increase in interest in a long-acting ESA, we're actively promoting Aranesp to them and are seeing some early success.
Global Aranesp sales declined 7% over -- year-over-year. There are some important underlying dynamics, however, as the U.S. saw an 8% unit growth for the year driven by the shift in some dialysis business from EPOGEN to Aranesp that I just mentioned, while international sales declined year-over-year because of foreign exchange rates.
Although Aranesp has prolonged exclusivity in the U.S. extending to 2024, we know that biosimilars to EPOGEN, NEUPOGEN and Neulasta are making plans to launch in the U.S. market. Sandoz announced its intention to launch a short-acting filgrastim biosimilar in the U.S. sometime after September 3 this year, and we expect other biosimilars may come in 2016.
Although Sandoz's biosimilar against NEUPOGEN will serve as the first true biosimilar entrant into the U.S. market, Teva's Granix has served somewhat of a proxy, having captured about 17% share of the short-acting filgrastim market after about 18 months on the market.
We are planning for the arrival of new competition and are prepared to compete. We will leverage the success that we've had in the U.S. versus branded competition as well as our considerable experience competing against ESA and NEUPOGEN biosimilars in Europe. We expect our products to continue to generate substantial cash flows for years to come even after competitors enter the market.
Let me now update you on our new product launches. As you know, our cholesterol-lowering medication, Repatha, was approved in Europe earlier this month. We are very excited to be making this new cholesterol-lowering medication available for patients and are actively engaged in obtaining reimbursement across Europe. We anticipate the first European launches to begin during the third quarter of this year. In the U.S., we look forward to upcoming FDA approval. Remember, our PDUFA date is August 27.
Our cardiovascular sales force is already in the field with the recent launch of Corlanor, which I'll discuss in a moment. And we're hearing a lot of excitement from our customers about the imminent launch of Repatha.
We've already achieved 60%-plus penetration of eligible patients in the U.S. for BLINCYTO, our innovative antibody for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. With an approval based on Phase II data, we continue to expand awareness of the significant benefits of BLINCYTO across the physician base that treats these seriously ill patients. We look forward to expanding BLINCYTO's label and our black [ph] platform into other cancer types.
Corlanor was approved in the second quarter as an add-on to CHF standard of care, and the team is making great progress with penetration and access. With Corlanor, we're also paving the way for our Repatha launch. Our CB sales force have already called on the majority of our targeted cardiologists.
As I look ahead, this is a very exciting time for Amgen. I'm pleased with the strong performance in the first half of this year led by our growth products: ENBREL, Sensipar, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate and, of course, Kyprolis. This will give us an excellent momentum into the second half of the year.
We've also made tremendous progress with 4 of our 6 innovative new launches this year. BLINCYTO, Corlanor and the Neulasta on-body injector are all off to great starts. And on Monday, we launched Kyprolis into the expanded indication of relapsed multiple myeloma.
We're anticipating the approval in the U.S. for T-VEC, our novel oncolytic for metastatic melanoma later this year, and Repatha in the U.S. imminently.
Our teams are laser-focused, poised and ready for launch. We look forward to bringing these new innovative medicines to patients following the FDA approval.
Before I close, I'd like to express my thanks to our Amgen customer-facing teams across the world for their unwavering focus on delivering value to patients and shareholders alike.
Let me now pass you to Sean."

And I'd like to begin, from an R&D perspective, with Repatha, which was the first approved PCSK9 inhibitor in the world based on our recent approval in the EU.",1075,"Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. It continues to be, as Tony said, an exciting time at Amgen. And I'd like to begin, from an R&D perspective, with Repatha, which was the first approved PCSK9 inhibitor in the world based on our recent approval in the EU. It's important to keep in mind that, I think, it was early work by Amgen research scientists that led to significant advances in elucidating the pathway by which PCSK9 regulates LDL cholesterol and which led to the publication of the crystal structure of PCSK9 in 2007. I just want to recognize the effort within the Amgen R&D organization to advance this program from discovery research to the clinic in less than a decade. As I said before, having the in-house scientific expertise to elucidate complex biology is an often underappreciated attribute, but it's critical in establishing strong intellectual property.
In the U.S., we were quite pleased with the vote of the FDA Advisory Committee and are working with the agency to get Repatha to patients as soon as possible. The FDA's target action date is August 27.
We continue to be inspired by the potential for Repatha to help drive a revolution in the global fight against cardiovascular disease, the world's greatest killer, and are looking forward to the results in 2016 from our intravascular ultrasound imaging study that we're conducting in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic as well as our 27,500 patient outcomes trial, which has completed enrollment and for which we expect results no later than 2017. This is an event-driven study. And as we stated before at the FDA Advisory Committee meeting, there's a possibility we could see the data in 2016.
Turning to oncology. We were very pleased to receive approval from FDA for our Kyprolis submission for relapsed multiple myeloma based on the ASPIRE data. Recall that the addition of Kyprolis to Revlimid and dexamethasone resulted in the longest progression-free survival ever reported in the relapsed multiple myeloma setting. And this regimen was considered by the expert discussion at the recent ASCO multiple myeloma session to be ""the standard of care.""
Again, in the relapsed setting, we were quite encouraged by the response of physicians at ASCO to the ENDEAVOR data, demonstrating a doubling of progression-free survival on patients randomized to Kyprolis compared head to head without Velcade in the context of much lower peripheral neuropathy risk with Kyprolis. We submitted the ENDEAVOR data in the United States, and we'll submit these data after the ASPIRE accelerated assessment approval in the EU.
We've recently completed enrollment in our Phase III CLARION study of Kyprolis versus Velcade in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients and look forward to those results some time in 2017. We have also initiated our Phase III study of once-weekly dosing for Kyprolis in the relapsed refractory setting, potentially providing patients and physicians with a more convenient dosing option.
In our continued effort to develop medicines that provide the greatest benefit to patients, we recently reported results of the studies, demonstrating that Vectibix had an overall survival benefit versus best support of care in a Phase III study of chemo refractory metastatic colorectal cancer patients with RAS wild-type tumors.
We were gratified to see the support of the FDA Advisory Committee for the use of T-VEC as a monotherapy in the metastatic melanoma setting, and we continue to work with regulators to bring this agent to patients. We see the greatest potential of T-VEC in combination with the so-called checkpoint inhibitors, and we continue to advance our collaborations with the Merck anti-PD-1 and Roche anti-PDL1 antibodies that we've recently announced.
We also very recently announced the positive Phase II study of BLINCYTO in Philadelphia chromosome positive relapsed refractory ALL, which demonstrated similar efficacy and safety to our U.S.-approved indication in Philadelphia chromosome negative ALL. Approximately 1/4 of adults with ALL are Philadelphia chromosome positive. And our study included relapsed patients that were refractory to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies who have very poor prognosis. We look forward to discussing the results with regulators to determine next steps.
At ASCO, we presented data that demonstrated Prolia significantly reduced bone fractures in breast cancer patients receiving aromatase inhibitors, suggesting a potential benefit of initiating Prolia with aromatase inhibitor therapy to decrease the risk of fracture. Also in our bone programs, we're getting closer to seeing the fracture data from romosozumab with the first placebo controlled in postmenopausal osteoporosis study expected to read out in the first half of 2016. Recall that romosozumab is our anti-sclerosing antibody we're developing with UCB. Due to the extent that romosozumab is able to increase bone formation, the high quality of that bone, coupled with strong human genetic validation for the pathway, all of this leads us to believe we will see a significant reduction in fractures, and romosozumab will become an important addition to the treatment of osteoporosis.
One final regulatory update is we anticipate initiating global regulatory submissions in the third quarter for our innovative calcimimetic peptide AMG 416 in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.
Our migraine prophylaxis program with our CGRP receptor antagonist antibody, AMG 334, is now enrolling Phase III episodic migraine studies. The 52-week data from our Phase IIb episodic migraine study were recently presented at the meeting of the American Headache Society, demonstrating durability of effect with no new safety signals. Our Phase IIb chronic migraine study continues to enroll patients, and we look forward to seeing those data next year. We continue to view AMG 334 as a very exciting opportunity to help patients suffering from this debilitating condition.
In our earlier-stage pipeline, we're looking forward to data from our Phase II study of the oral formulation of omecamtiv mecarbil, the niacin activator we're developing with Cytokinetics in the heart failure setting in the fourth quarter of this year. We also continue to make progress on our BiTE platform with our next molecule, AMG 330, close to initiating Phase I in the acute myeloid leukemia setting, an area of profound unmet need. We're also advancing new molecules in the clinic in neuroscience and immuno-oncology areas, and I look forward to speaking with you about these programs in the future.
Finally, I'd like to thank the Amgen R&D team for their continued focus on innovation and execution of our key programs. In particular, I was very proud of our command of the science and the data at our recent FDA Advisory Committee meetings.

And that's exactly what we're seeing in humans as well as, particularly, you can measure that in the doses that are required to suppress the skin reactions in the capsaicin PD assays that were used by many of the companies in the early phase development. I think, really, what it comes down to and what I've always referred to is that this will be -- this is an ambulatory, otherwise well, patient population that are going to want the easiest potential dosing format, once a month, let's say, small volume, low-pain injection in a disposable auto injector. The question is whether the -- all of these products can achieve that kind of profile. It's going to be easier for us to do that, we believe, because we have a more potent agent. And so there's only so much antibody that can be packed into a milliliter. And so it remains to be seen whether the ligand antibodies can thread that needle and get to a single injection monthly; some may and some may not. We're quite confident about being able to do that. So I think it's bearing out scientifically, but we'll have to see whether it translates into a real clinical differentiator in the marketplace, and time will tell."

Thank you, Arvind, and let me welcome all of you who've dialed in for our second quarter earnings call.
The strategy we laid out in our 2014 Investor Day continues to deliver strong results, and our Q2 financial and operational performance is a good indication that we're on track to deliver our long-term objectives. This is an exciting time at Amgen. Not only are we delivering strong financial results, but our new product story continues to take shape as well. It was a successful second quarter on this front, both with recent launches and preparations for upcoming launches well underway.
We entered the year excited about 6 new product launches, and at the halfway point, we're already reporting progress on 5 of them. With its European approval, Repatha was the first PCSK9 inhibitor approved globally. We were pleased with the FDA Advisory Committee recommendation for approval in the United States and look forward to an approval on or before our PDUFA date the next month.
When we acquired Onyx, we believed that Kyprolis would become part of the backbone of multiple myeloma therapy by demonstrating superiority over the current standard of care and moving into earlier lines of therapy. The results of ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR exceeded our expectations, and we clearly have an attractive opportunity now with Kyprolis in our expanded indication in relapsed multiple myeloma.
The response to BLINCYTO has been positive with physicians and is making a difference in certain leukemia patients who've exhausted all other treatment options. The Neulasta on-body injector, our innovative delivery system that provides differentiation in the filgrastim marketplace, is performing well in the few short months since its launch.
We're making progress with Corlanor as well by communicating the value proposition to physicians and payers, while paving the way for Repatha in the U.S. cardiology community.
It's very rewarding to see the difference that these innovative products we're making for patients.
Beyond these products, our pipeline continued to deliver results, and Sean will provide additional details on our progress in a moment. In addition to what was accomplished in the second quarter, we have other pipeline milestones in the near term, including global regulatory submissions for AMG 416, our innovative calcimimetic, an upcoming data from omecamtiv mecarbil and heart failure romosozumab in osteoporosis and, of course, our biosimilar bevacizumab as well.
All of what I just talked about gives us confidence in the long-term growth of our business. And for this year, we're raising guidance again, and David Meline will share details of that with you momentarily.
In summary, I'm very pleased with our continuing strong execution against our priorities for the year, and this includes our progress on the 5 newly launched products, the strong growth in our key products, like ENBREL, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate, and our ongoing transformation efforts.
Before turning over to David, let me just thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their commitment to deliver for patients and for our shareholders.

Turning to the second quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenue at $5.4 billion grew 4% year-over-year with product sales growth driven at 6%, driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenue decreased $86 mil",885,"Okay. Thanks, Bob. Turning to the second quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenue at $5.4 billion grew 4% year-over-year with product sales growth driven at 6%, driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenue decreased $86 million year-over-year due primarily to milestones recognized in the second quarter of last year. Total revenue and product sales were negatively impacted by approximately 2.5% due to foreign exchange headwinds.
Adjusted operating income at $2.6 billion grew 10% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 2 points to 49% for the quarter, reflecting our continued growth and the benefits from our transformation initiatives.
On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 15.1% improved 0.8 points driven by lower royalties and higher average net sales price.
Research and development expenses at $918 million were down 6% versus the prior year. R&D spend was favorably impacted by the transformation and process improvements across the area partially offset by increased support for later-stage clinical programs.
SG&A expenses were up 2% on a year-over-year basis. Increased commercial investments in new product launches were partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
Total operating expenses declined 1% year-on-year and increased 9% sequentially. For the quarter, operating expenses benefited by 3 percentage points from foreign exchange year-over-year. We also saw an increase of spending in Q2 versus the prior quarter, which is a typical pattern for the business.
In the second half of the year, we expect quarterly expenses to increase in line to modestly above historical experience, reflecting increasing launch and R&D investments through the balance of 2015.
Other income and expenses declined by $65 million or 45% on a year-over-year basis to a net expense of $79 million in the quarter. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by gains in our strategic invest -- and venture investments. I would note that Q1 is a better indicator of the underlying run rate for other income and expenses in light of the investment gains in Q2.
The adjusted tax rate was 20% for the quarter, a 3.8 point increase versus Q2 2014. This increase was primarily due to unfavorable tax impact of changes in our geographic mix of earnings. Our tax rate for the first half of the year was 18.6%, consistent with our guidance for the year. As a result, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 8% on a year-over-year basis.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 6. For the second quarter, we generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $0.6 billion over the prior year. This increase was driven by improved working capital and higher operating income as well as cash gains realized from a portion of our foreign exchange forward contracts.
Total debt outstanding ended Q2 at $32 billion, and cash and investments totaled $30 billion. Additionally, our second quarter 2015 dividend was $0.79 per share, an increase of 30% versus the prior year.
Finally, in the second quarter of 2015, we increased our share repurchase activity versus the prior year with $500 million of cash deployed to share repurchases or approximately 3.3 million shares in the period. We continue to execute on the commitment to repurchase $2 billion of shares by year-end 2015. And as of now, we have repurchased a total of $1.3 billion worth of shares at an average price of $157 since our business review last October.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2015 on Page 7. We remain on track with our plans to grow the business and invest for the future while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. In 2015, we remain on track to deliver over $400 million of the efficiency savings from the transformation, most of which will be reinvested in the business.
With regard to our updated outlook for 2015 revenue, we're increasing our guidance to $21.1 billion to $21.4 billion from our prior range of $20.9 billion to $21.3 billion, reflecting continued solid revenue performance. Versus 2014 results, we expect an unfavorable revenue impact of almost $400 million or 2% in 2015, assuming current foreign exchange rates prevail through year end. Our revenue guidance also reflects progress on our product launch activities as well as our latest view of evolving competitive dynamics.
We are also increasing our 2015 adjusted earnings per share outlook to $9.55 to $9.80 a share from the previous $9.35 to $9.65 forecast. The revised earnings outlook reflects continued conviction in our strategy and strong performance, including lower expenses due to cost discipline. Versus 2014 results, we expect an approximate $0.11 adjusted EPS impact in 2015 at current foreign exchange rates.
Turning to the tax rate. For the full year, we expect to have an adjusted rate within the range of 18% to 19%. As a reminder, this excludes the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in 2015.
We now expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year, which is $100 million lower than our previous guidance.
As our results through the first half of the year highlight, our transformation efforts are now well established, and we are encouraged to see cost improvements across the business.
This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Tony."

You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the second quarter on Slide #9. Once again, we delivered a strong sales quarter. We saw excellent execution across all aspects of our commercial strategy,",1499,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, folks. You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the second quarter on Slide #9. Once again, we delivered a strong sales quarter. We saw excellent execution across all aspects of our commercial strategy, growing our newer products, defending filgrastim and EPOGEN and launching important new medicines.
Globally, product sales grew 6% year-on-year, and our U.S. business delivered 9% year-over-year growth with our international business growing 5% year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange.
Let me now turn to the products, beginning with ENBREL. On Slide #11, you'll see that ENBREL delivered strong growth of 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by net selling price. Segment growth remains strong in rheumatology and dermatology, growing 23% and 28%, respectively. Quarter-on-quarter, we held our share in rheumatology at 29%, while share in dermatology declined 1 percentage point to 26%. New dermatology entrants are not simply taking share from the incumbents but also growing the market. Quarter-on-quarter, ENBREL sales increased 21%. You will recall that in April, I described how the first quarter was negatively impacted by lower wholesale inventories and end-customer industry
burn-off. In the second quarter, inventories returned to normal levels.
ENBREL has delivered significant growth for us. With exclusivity in the U.S. until 2029, we will continue to invest in ENBREL and believe it is well on its way to becoming a $5 billion brand.
Sensipar grew 15% year-over-year driven by strong unit growth in both the U.S. and Europe.
I'll now move to Prolia. Prolia delivered 29% growth year-on-year driven by volume increases in both the U.S. and in Europe. The graph on Slide 13 will remind you of the historical path of the Prolia sales, in which the second and the fourth quarters are our strongest. Our focus on direct-to-consumer marketing and simplifying patient access in the U.S. continued to drive higher new patient starts and improve patient adherence once on Prolia. This has led to unit share gains of about 4% in the U.S. and about 3 percentage points in Europe.
XGEVA grew 11% year-over-year, giving a share increase of about 4 percentage points in the U.S. and about 6 percentage points in Europe. The quarter-over-quarter decline in the U.S. was driven by a Q1 customer buy-in. Absent the buy-in, the U.S. sequential unit growth was 6%. Our brand strategy continues to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition. We've also recently successfully negotiated expanded XGEVA access for patients in France, one of our largest markets outside the United States.
The expansion of Vectibix into earlier lines of therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer in both the U.S. and Europe continued to deliver growth. We continue to see unit growth in the U.S. of close to 40% and in Europe of 9%, 10%. The second quarter was also positively impacted by timing of shipments to our Japanese partner.
Nplate grew 6% year-over-year driven by a 7% unit growth.
Now to Kyprolis, which delivered a year-over-year growth of 53% and a quarter-over-quarter growth of 10%. We are very excited about the recent U.S. approval in relapsed or second-line multiple myeloma. The ASPIRE data clearly demonstrated the longest period of progression-free survival in any Phase III trial to date. This is an important treatment regimen that will now become available to a greater number of relapsed patients as shown on Slide #8. The U.S. team launched this new indication on Monday this week. The ASPIRE data, coupled with our compelling ENDEAVOR data, which we just submitted to the FDA, demonstrates superiority over Velcade in relapsed multiple myeloma, strengthens Kyprolis' position as the best-in-class proteasome inhibitor. We anticipate further approval for Kyprolis outside the United States by the end of this year, including Europe, Canada and South America.
Let me now turn to our mature brands starting with the filgrastim franchise. Neulasta delivered a year-over-year growth of 2% driven mainly by net selling price. The launch of the on-body injector for Neulasta is growing exceptionally well. As a reminder, the on-body injector means that patients no longer have to return to the hospital or clinic 24 hours after chemo. The on-body injector, simply delivers Neulasta at home at the appropriate time.
I'm pleased to report that the Neulasta on-body injector has already achieved 8% market share of the Neulasta business in its first full quarter on the market. And we continue to grow both the depth and the breadth of prescribing. Over 50% of our Neulasta accounts have purchased the on-body injector.
NEUPOGEN declined 14% year-over-year in the second quarter. This was primarily due to branded short-acting competition in the U.S., which gained about 2 share points versus the first quarter. We continue to compete account by account and reinforce NEUPOGEN's long track record of clinical efficacy and safety as well as our ability to supply patients reliably.
Turning now to our ESA products. EPOGEN declined 4% year-over-year, including an 11% decline. About 1/3 of this unit decline was due to competition. The remaining unit decline was a shift in purchases to Aranesp in some of our U.S. dialysis accounts. With select U.S. dialysis customers having an increase in interest in a long-acting ESA, we're actively promoting Aranesp to them and are seeing some early success.
Global Aranesp sales declined 7% over -- year-over-year. There are some important underlying dynamics, however, as the U.S. saw an 8% unit growth for the year driven by the shift in some dialysis business from EPOGEN to Aranesp that I just mentioned, while international sales declined year-over-year because of foreign exchange rates.
Although Aranesp has prolonged exclusivity in the U.S. extending to 2024, we know that biosimilars to EPOGEN, NEUPOGEN and Neulasta are making plans to launch in the U.S. market. Sandoz announced its intention to launch a short-acting filgrastim biosimilar in the U.S. sometime after September 3 this year, and we expect other biosimilars may come in 2016.
Although Sandoz's biosimilar against NEUPOGEN will serve as the first true biosimilar entrant into the U.S. market, Teva's Granix has served somewhat of a proxy, having captured about 17% share of the short-acting filgrastim market after about 18 months on the market.
We are planning for the arrival of new competition and are prepared to compete. We will leverage the success that we've had in the U.S. versus branded competition as well as our considerable experience competing against ESA and NEUPOGEN biosimilars in Europe. We expect our products to continue to generate substantial cash flows for years to come even after competitors enter the market.
Let me now update you on our new product launches. As you know, our cholesterol-lowering medication, Repatha, was approved in Europe earlier this month. We are very excited to be making this new cholesterol-lowering medication available for patients and are actively engaged in obtaining reimbursement across Europe. We anticipate the first European launches to begin during the third quarter of this year. In the U.S., we look forward to upcoming FDA approval. Remember, our PDUFA date is August 27.
Our cardiovascular sales force is already in the field with the recent launch of Corlanor, which I'll discuss in a moment. And we're hearing a lot of excitement from our customers about the imminent launch of Repatha.
We've already achieved 60%-plus penetration of eligible patients in the U.S. for BLINCYTO, our innovative antibody for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. With an approval based on Phase II data, we continue to expand awareness of the significant benefits of BLINCYTO across the physician base that treats these seriously ill patients. We look forward to expanding BLINCYTO's label and our black [ph] platform into other cancer types.
Corlanor was approved in the second quarter as an add-on to CHF standard of care, and the team is making great progress with penetration and access. With Corlanor, we're also paving the way for our Repatha launch. Our CB sales force have already called on the majority of our targeted cardiologists.
As I look ahead, this is a very exciting time for Amgen. I'm pleased with the strong performance in the first half of this year led by our growth products: ENBREL, Sensipar, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate and, of course, Kyprolis. This will give us an excellent momentum into the second half of the year.
We've also made tremendous progress with 4 of our 6 innovative new launches this year. BLINCYTO, Corlanor and the Neulasta on-body injector are all off to great starts. And on Monday, we launched Kyprolis into the expanded indication of relapsed multiple myeloma.
We're anticipating the approval in the U.S. for T-VEC, our novel oncolytic for metastatic melanoma later this year, and Repatha in the U.S. imminently.
Our teams are laser-focused, poised and ready for launch. We look forward to bringing these new innovative medicines to patients following the FDA approval.
Before I close, I'd like to express my thanks to our Amgen customer-facing teams across the world for their unwavering focus on delivering value to patients and shareholders alike.
Let me now pass you to Sean."

And I'd like to begin, from an R&D perspective, with Repatha, which was the first approved PCSK9 inhibitor in the world based on our recent approval in the EU.",1075,"Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. It continues to be, as Tony said, an exciting time at Amgen. And I'd like to begin, from an R&D perspective, with Repatha, which was the first approved PCSK9 inhibitor in the world based on our recent approval in the EU. It's important to keep in mind that, I think, it was early work by Amgen research scientists that led to significant advances in elucidating the pathway by which PCSK9 regulates LDL cholesterol and which led to the publication of the crystal structure of PCSK9 in 2007. I just want to recognize the effort within the Amgen R&D organization to advance this program from discovery research to the clinic in less than a decade. As I said before, having the in-house scientific expertise to elucidate complex biology is an often underappreciated attribute, but it's critical in establishing strong intellectual property.
In the U.S., we were quite pleased with the vote of the FDA Advisory Committee and are working with the agency to get Repatha to patients as soon as possible. The FDA's target action date is August 27.
We continue to be inspired by the potential for Repatha to help drive a revolution in the global fight against cardiovascular disease, the world's greatest killer, and are looking forward to the results in 2016 from our intravascular ultrasound imaging study that we're conducting in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic as well as our 27,500 patient outcomes trial, which has completed enrollment and for which we expect results no later than 2017. This is an event-driven study. And as we stated before at the FDA Advisory Committee meeting, there's a possibility we could see the data in 2016.
Turning to oncology. We were very pleased to receive approval from FDA for our Kyprolis submission for relapsed multiple myeloma based on the ASPIRE data. Recall that the addition of Kyprolis to Revlimid and dexamethasone resulted in the longest progression-free survival ever reported in the relapsed multiple myeloma setting. And this regimen was considered by the expert discussion at the recent ASCO multiple myeloma session to be ""the standard of care.""
Again, in the relapsed setting, we were quite encouraged by the response of physicians at ASCO to the ENDEAVOR data, demonstrating a doubling of progression-free survival on patients randomized to Kyprolis compared head to head without Velcade in the context of much lower peripheral neuropathy risk with Kyprolis. We submitted the ENDEAVOR data in the United States, and we'll submit these data after the ASPIRE accelerated assessment approval in the EU.
We've recently completed enrollment in our Phase III CLARION study of Kyprolis versus Velcade in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients and look forward to those results some time in 2017. We have also initiated our Phase III study of once-weekly dosing for Kyprolis in the relapsed refractory setting, potentially providing patients and physicians with a more convenient dosing option.
In our continued effort to develop medicines that provide the greatest benefit to patients, we recently reported results of the studies, demonstrating that Vectibix had an overall survival benefit versus best support of care in a Phase III study of chemo refractory metastatic colorectal cancer patients with RAS wild-type tumors.
We were gratified to see the support of the FDA Advisory Committee for the use of T-VEC as a monotherapy in the metastatic melanoma setting, and we continue to work with regulators to bring this agent to patients. We see the greatest potential of T-VEC in combination with the so-called checkpoint inhibitors, and we continue to advance our collaborations with the Merck anti-PD-1 and Roche anti-PDL1 antibodies that we've recently announced.
We also very recently announced the positive Phase II study of BLINCYTO in Philadelphia chromosome positive relapsed refractory ALL, which demonstrated similar efficacy and safety to our U.S.-approved indication in Philadelphia chromosome negative ALL. Approximately 1/4 of adults with ALL are Philadelphia chromosome positive. And our study included relapsed patients that were refractory to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies who have very poor prognosis. We look forward to discussing the results with regulators to determine next steps.
At ASCO, we presented data that demonstrated Prolia significantly reduced bone fractures in breast cancer patients receiving aromatase inhibitors, suggesting a potential benefit of initiating Prolia with aromatase inhibitor therapy to decrease the risk of fracture. Also in our bone programs, we're getting closer to seeing the fracture data from romosozumab with the first placebo controlled in postmenopausal osteoporosis study expected to read out in the first half of 2016. Recall that romosozumab is our anti-sclerosing antibody we're developing with UCB. Due to the extent that romosozumab is able to increase bone formation, the high quality of that bone, coupled with strong human genetic validation for the pathway, all of this leads us to believe we will see a significant reduction in fractures, and romosozumab will become an important addition to the treatment of osteoporosis.
One final regulatory update is we anticipate initiating global regulatory submissions in the third quarter for our innovative calcimimetic peptide AMG 416 in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.
Our migraine prophylaxis program with our CGRP receptor antagonist antibody, AMG 334, is now enrolling Phase III episodic migraine studies. The 52-week data from our Phase IIb episodic migraine study were recently presented at the meeting of the American Headache Society, demonstrating durability of effect with no new safety signals. Our Phase IIb chronic migraine study continues to enroll patients, and we look forward to seeing those data next year. We continue to view AMG 334 as a very exciting opportunity to help patients suffering from this debilitating condition.
In our earlier-stage pipeline, we're looking forward to data from our Phase II study of the oral formulation of omecamtiv mecarbil, the niacin activator we're developing with Cytokinetics in the heart failure setting in the fourth quarter of this year. We also continue to make progress on our BiTE platform with our next molecule, AMG 330, close to initiating Phase I in the acute myeloid leukemia setting, an area of profound unmet need. We're also advancing new molecules in the clinic in neuroscience and immuno-oncology areas, and I look forward to speaking with you about these programs in the future.
Finally, I'd like to thank the Amgen R&D team for their continued focus on innovation and execution of our key programs. In particular, I was very proud of our command of the science and the data at our recent FDA Advisory Committee meetings.

The question is whether the -- all of these products can achieve that kind of profile. It's going to be easier for us to do that, we believe, because we have a more potent agent. And so there's only so much antibody that can be packed into a milliliter. And so it remains to be seen whether the ligand antibodies can thread that needle and get to a single injection monthly; some may and some may not. We're quite confident about being able to do that. So I think it's bearing out scientifically, but we'll have to see whether it translates into a real clinical differentiator in the marketplace, and time will tell."

This is an exciting time at Amgen. And once again this quarter, it seems we have a healthy dose of information to share with you. So perhaps before jumping in, I should provide some",789,"Good. Thank you, Arvind, and let me welcome our listeners to the call. 
This is an exciting time at Amgen. And once again this quarter, it seems we have a healthy dose of information to share with you. So perhaps before jumping in, I should provide some context. 
Recall that we met with analysts and investors 1 year ago in New York to lay out out our long-term strategy for growth and our objectives for the next few years. Since then, I'm pleased to report we made steady progress towards achieving all of those objectives, as you'll hear hair on this call.
Our strategy for long-term growth starts with innovation. We set an objective that we would launch 6 new products this year. And with the approval this week of IMLYGIC, our drug for melanoma, we're now delivering on the promise of those 6 opportunities. And of course, we believe that 2 of these new products, Repatha for cardiovascular disease and Kyprolis for multiple myeloma, represent particularly significant opportunities for patients and shareholders.
Sticking with innovation, I'd like to point out that behind our 6 new launches, our innovative pipeline continues to advance with rapid Phase III progress in our migraine program, strong new data for mab and a successful Phase III program for in kidney disease.
In addition as we reported earlier this week, our innovative heart failure program, omecamtiv mecarbil, delivered promising results in Phase IIb testing, opening the prospect of another exciting opportunity for us in the field of cardiovascular disease.
Similarly, our biosimilar pipeline has advanced considerably over the past year with positive Phase III data for 2 of our 9 programs, specifically our HUMIRA and Avastin biosimilars, and Sean will provide more detail in all of these progress shortly. 
In addition to delivering on the promise of innovation with our newly launched products, we're also delivering strong financial performance across the board and making steady progress against our longer-term financial growth and performance objectives.  You can see this in our third quarter results today and in our year-to-date performance.
During the quarter, we delivered 14% revenue growth and 18% adjusted earnings per share growth. Our key revenue growth drivers, Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar and Nplate all performed well in the period, as Tony will convey in his remarks.  Adjusted earnings per share grew faster than revenues reflecting improved expense discipline and operating leverage even as we invested in our new product launch cycle.
On a year-to-date basis, revenues are up 9% and adjusted earnings per share are up 19%. Consistent with our long-term financial objectives, our operating performance continues to improve as the benefits of the transformation are reflected across the business. Our 49% adjusted operating margin through the first 9 months of the year reflects a meaningful progress against our longer-term operating margin targets. And based on our ongoing strong performance, we're once again raising our 2015 guidance, as David will explain shortly.
With respect to capital allocation, here too, our actions are solidly in line with our commitments. Consistent with our results to return on average of 60% of adjusted net income to shareholders through 2018 with a growing dividend and share buybacks, we expect to increase our quarterly dividend to $1 per share for 2016, an increase of 27%. This comes on the back of a 30% increase for 2015.  Also reflecting on our confidence in the outlook for our business, we recently increase our share repurchase authorization to $5 billion.
As we look towards 2016, we're focused on delivering continued strong performance while advancing our new flow of products. Obviously, we expect to face increased competition for our legacy products, but we've anticipated these changes and put ourselves in position to defend our legacy products while growing our newer franchises. Given the many variables at play in our business and to help you in your planning, we're providing preliminary guidance for 2016, which we'll update when we report our full year results of at end of January 2016.
Finally, let me remind you that last October, we laid out our financial objectives through 2018. A year later, we feel confident we're on track to meet or exceed these objectives. These included $1.5 billion of savings from our transformation, double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth on average through 2018, and adjusted operating margin improvement from 38% in 2013 to in the range of 52% to 54% by 2018.
Before turning over to David, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their unwavering commitment to deliver for patients and shareholders as we launch new products, expand internationally and continue from a position of strength to transform our company for a great future. David?"

Turning to the third quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenues of $5.7 billion grew 14% year-over-year, with 14% product sales growth driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenues increased $24 million",1344,"Okay. Thanks, Bob. 
Turning to the third quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenues of $5.7 billion grew 14% year-over-year, with 14% product sales growth driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenues increased $24 million year-over-year, due primarily to a milestone received for the filing of Kyprolis in Japan.  Total revenue and product sales were negatively impacted by approximately 2 percentage points year-over-year due to foreign exchange headwinds. 
Adjusted operating income at $2.7 billion grew 19% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved two points to 49% for the quarter, reflecting our continued growth and the benefits from our transformation program along with significant investment in our launch activities.
On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 13.5% improved by 2.2 points, driven by net selling prices, lower royalties and manufacturing efficiencies.
Research and development expenses at $1.1 billion were up 11% versus the prior year. This increase was driven by upfront payments for deal activity in the quarter and increased investments in support of new product launches. This increase was partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
SG&A expenses were up 17% on a year-over-year basis, driven by commercial investments in new product launches and Enbrel-related payments, partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
Total operating expenses increased 10% year-over-year and increased 8% sequentially. For the quarter, operating expenses benefited by approximately 3 percentage points from foreign exchange year-over-year.  We saw an increase of spending in Q3 versus the prior quarter. This reflects the typical pattern for the business plus our launch investments of this year.
Other income and expenses declined by $18 million or 14% on a year-over-year basis to a net expense of $147 million in the quarter.
The adjusted tax rate was 18% for the quarter, a 0.9 point increase versus Q3 of 2014. This increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings. As a result, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 18% on a year-over-year basis.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 6. For the third quarter, we generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $0.2 billion over the prior year. This increase was driven by higher operating income.  
Total debt outstanding ended Q3 at $31.8 billion, and cash and investments totaled $31.1 billion.  Additionally, our third quarter 2015 dividend was $0.79 per share, an increase of 30% versus the prior year.
In the third quarter of 2015, we increased our share repurchase activity versus the prior year with $700 million of cash deployed to share repurchases for approximately 4.6 million shares in the period.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2015 on Page 7. We remain on track with our plans to grow the business and invest for the future while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model, including delivering over $400 million of efficiency savings from the transformation, which is being reinvested this year in the business to fund our significant new product launches.
With regard to our updated outlook for 2015 revenue, we are increasing our guidance to $21.4 billion to $21.6 billion from our prior range of $21.1 billion to $21.4 billion reflecting solid revenue performance.  Reported growth will moderate as we complete the year, reflecting the expected normalization of relatively high customer inventories as well as the effects of competition on our legacy products.
We are also increasing our 2015 adjusted earnings per share outlook to $9.95 to $10.10 a share from the previous $9.55 to $9.80 forecast. The revised earnings outlook reflects our strong year-to-date performance including revenue growth and lower expenses due to cost discipline.
For the fourth quarter, we expect operating expenses to increase by around $0.2 billion sequentially, reflecting normal spending patterns as well as continued launch investments.
In terms of the adjusted tax rate, our guidance range of 18% to 19% is unchanged and is consistent with our year-to-date adjusted tax rate of 18.4%. As a reminder, this guidance continues to exclude the possible benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in 2015.
We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year, in line with our previous guidance.
As we approach the end of 2015, we are pleased with our progress again this year. We expect to meet or exceed the commitments provided for the 2014 to '18 period, including double-digit adjusted EPS growth on average, $1.5 billion of transformation savings, improving our adjusted operating margin from 38% to 52% to 54% and returning at least 60% of adjusted net income on average to shareholders.
Turning to Page 8. 2016 will be an important year as we continue to progress towards our long-term goals. Given the number of moving pieces including new product launches, currency movements and U.S. biosimilar competition as well as the continued evolution of our transformation program, we want to provide a preliminary planning framework for 2016. As you will note, the framework is generally in line with expectations while individual components may differ.
In 2016, revenue is expected to range from $21.7 billion to $22.3 billion. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to range from $10.35 to $10.75 per share. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to range from 20.5% to 21.5%, and capital expenditures will be approximately $700 million.
I want to take a moment to highlight several key assumptions embedded in our outlook for next year. First, our revenue guidance range for 2016 includes continued momentum from our growth brands as well as a meaningful contribution from our product launches. We also assume our legacy products to phase new biosimilar competition in the U.S., which Tony will address in more detail.
Next, we expect an approximate 1 percentage point unfavorable impact to revenue and adjusted EPS growth, or $0.12 per share, due to foreign exchange headwinds in 2016 versus 2015, assuming that current foreign exchange rates prevail through the end of 2016.  This represents an approximate 4 percentage point negative impact on our international sales.
In terms of our transformation program, we expect continued progress in 2016 with an additional $400 million of savings. Savings will be partially reinvested in the business and will also help drive a year-over-year reduction in total adjusted operating expenses.
Finally, our 2016 adjusted tax rate guidance reflects an increase versus 2015 and excludes the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit.  This increase is primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings, as some of our newer products in Enbrel have a higher tax rate than our legacy products. Also, U.S. R&D spend is decreasing due to transformation program savings, which has a negative impact on the tax rate. We now expect the tax rate through 2018 to be in the low 20% range.
Regarding our capital allocation plan for 2016, we'll continue to execute on the commitment to repurchase 2 billion of shares by year-end 2015. And as of now, we have deployed a total of 1.9 billion to repurchase shares. With an increased Board of Directors authorization of $5 billion in total, we expect to repurchase an additional 2 billion to 3 billion of shares by the end of 2016.  On a cumulative basis, our repurchases will total 4 billion to 5 billion of shares by the end of 2016 since a year ago.  We also plan to increase the dividend to $1 per share in the first quarter of 2016, reflecting another 27% increase from current levels. With these actions, we are solidly on the path to meet our commitment to return 60% of adjusted net income to shareholders on average for the period 2014 to '18, while continuing to invest in the long-term growth of the business.
In summary, we are pleased with our performance thus far in 2015, and we look forward to delivering results in the remainder of this year as well as in 2016 and beyond.
I will now turn the call over to Tony."

You will find a summary of our global sales performance for the third quarter in Slide #10. 
This was an exciting quarter at Amgen as we launched Repatha and continued to deliver strong performance with our growth products. Globally, product sales grew 14% year-over-year, and our U.S. business delivered 20% year-over-year growth. Our international business grew 3% year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange and the 7% unit growth in Europe.
Let me start with an update on Repatha. The European approval of Repatha in July marked the first PCSK9 inhibitor approval in the world. We are now also approved in the U.S. and Canada. Along with our Japanese partners, Astellas, we expect Japanese approval in the first half of next year. 
We designed Repatha's clinical program to demonstrate that a simple, single dose achieving maximum PCSK9 inhibition provides intensive and predictable cholesterol lowering. This profile is resonating well with physicians.  In the U.S., the launch is off to good start. We bulked our sales force with experienced cardiovascular professionals. And we established our presence in the field with our Corlanor launch in the first quarter this year.  Upon approval, our field sales forces trained and quickly in the field meeting with our prioritized Repatha customer targets. 
Anticipating a period of negotiation with payers postapproval, we launched the RepathaReady program. This program provides Repatha to appropriate patients, if they wish, during the insurance certification process while plans finalized through and performance pathways. The response to our launch is extremely encouraging as the volume request to date is a clear indicator of the unmet need and physicians' belief in the benefits of Repatha.
With their recent formulary decision, Express Scripts recognized the value of Repatha, and we continue to negotiate with other payers to expand access in the United States. However, we expect payers' utilization management criteria, or UM, to remain fairly narrow pending the outcomes data. 
In the European Union, we continue to negotiate reimbursement with individual countries. We already have patients under Repatha in Germany, the U.K. and some Scandinavian countries.
The cardiovascular outcomes data and the intravascular ultrasound data in 2016 will continue to expand Repatha's exciting profile. Repatha also has dosing frequency flexibility, either 2 weeks or monthly. And we have submitted our single injection monthly dosing option to regulators.
The launch of Repatha, our continued progress with Corlanor and the recently announced positive Phase II results on Omecamtiv mecarbil, we're building a strong foundation for Amgen's cardiovascular franchise.
Turning now to Kyprolis, where sales grew 46% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. The new indication for relapse or second line multiple myeloma was launched in the U.S. in July. We're off to good start. And have already seen the doubling of the RD regimen, which is the regimens in ASPIRE in new to treatment second line patients. Every month, there are about 1,000 new patients who require second line treatment. We expect sales to grow as we increase shares in these new second line patients and see a corresponding increase in the generation of Kyprolis therapy.
We also received priority review for the submission of the ENDEAVOR data, which demonstrated a doubling of progression-free survival compared to patients. We expect this to drive additional momentum next year and further strengthen Kyprolis as the best-in-class proteasome inhibitor. We anticipate further approval for Kyprolis outside of the U.S. by the year-end including Canada, Europe, parts of South America and Asia.
Let me now turn to Enbrel. On Slide 15, you'll see Enbrel delivered 30% growth year-over-year, primarily driven by net selling price. Just to clarify, net selling price includes the impact of exchanges as well as contracting and access change that have occurred over the past 12 months. Inventory growth was 11%, which was driven by favorable year-over-year comparison as the inventory levels were abnormally low in the third quarter of 2014.  
Segment growth remains strong in rheumatology and dermatology, growing 25% and 38% respectively year-over-year on a value basis. Quarter-on-quarter, our rheumatology share was relatively stable at about 28%, while our share in dermatology declined 2% to 24% due to intensive buying competition from new therapies.  I would remind you that rheumatology accounts for about 80% of Enbrel sales.
Sensipar grew 29% year-over-year, driven by inventory, net selling price and unit growth in both the U.S. and Europe. Similar to Enbrel, inventory growth was driven by unusually low inventory levels in quarter 3 last year.
I'll now move to Prolia. Prolia followed its normal seasonal pattern with a sequential decline in quarter 3, but on a year-over-year basis, the 25% growth with unit growth exceeding 20% both in the U.S. and Europe. Growth is driven by continued share gains of about 3 percentage points in both the U.S. and Europe.
XGEVA grew 19% year-over-year. Unit share increased about 4 percentage points over the last year in the U.S. and about 5 percentage points in Europe. There were some abnormally large purchases by some end customers in the U.S. this quarter, adding to the volume growth. We continue to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition.
Vectibix is showing flat volume, but this is solely due to the timing of shipments to our Japanese partner, , who holds the license in Japan. The U.S. delivered year-over-year growth of 16% and Europe 12%, both driven by the expansion of Vectibix into earlier lines of therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer.
Nplate continued to deliver solid growth of 13% year-over-year driven by 17% unit growth.
Now I'll turn to our mature brands, starting with the filgrastim franchise. Neulasta delivered year-over-year growth of 6%, driven by net selling price and inventory. Similar to XGEVA, we saw signs of abnormally high purchases by some larger end customers in quarter 3, which we expect to burn off in quarter 4. Meanwhile, the on-body injector for Neulasta, which we now branded as part of the Neulasta kit, continued to gain adoption in the marketplace. Over 60% of our Neulasta accounts have now purchased the Onpro at least once, and Onpro achieved 19% share of Neulasta units in quarter 3.
NEUPOGEN declined 5% year-over-year, driven by branded short-acting competition in the U.S. Sequentially quarter-over-quarter, we held share against branded competition and saw minimal impact from the new biosimilar competition, given its launch late in the quarter. Using our 7 years of biosimilar defense experience in Europe, we will be competitive in the marketplace, but expect share erosion in the near term due to the new competition.
Turning to our ESA products. EPOGEN declined 6% year-over-year including a 15% unit decline as dynamics continue to evolve in the U.S. diabetes centers. That 15% unit decline would have been deeper, if not for abnormally high purchases by a large end customer in quarter 3. has now moved more than half of patients from EPOGEN to , and we expect the trend to continue.  Please recall that we have a contract with through 2018, which they will purchase at least 90% of the ESAs from Amgen. 
We're also seeing strong Aranesp adoption with medium-sized and independent dialysis centers. Of the over 400,000 dialysis patients in the U.S., about 50,000 patients have now transitioned to Aranesp, including about 20,000 in . EPOGEN sales in future quarters will be impacted by utilization of , potential switching to the Aranesp and potential biosimilar competition.  Aranesp sales increased 4% year-over-year with a 32% growth in the U.S., driven by the shift in dialysis business from EPOGEN to Aranesp that I was just talking about.  International sales were impacted by foreign exchange rates. 
While we continue to see a decline in oncology ESA, we are pleased with the response to Aranesp in the U.S. dialysis analysis business. We are making good progress with the launch of BLINCYTO. BLINCYTO is taken by most severe patients. And as the AML patients cycle to different therapies, we will continue to grow patient penetration.
In summary, quarter 3 was an exciting quarter. Our Repatha and Kyprolis launches began in earnest. And we delivered strong results for our growth products and continued to defend our mature products in the marketplace.  Please keep in mind the additional inventory in the third quarter for Neulasta, EPOGEN and XGEVA as some of the larger end customers exceed about $100 million, and we expect this to reverse in quarter 4.
Looking ahead to 2016, our growth products including Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate are continuing to -- are expected to continue deliver solid growth, as sales of these products have grown in double digits this year and in some cases, in excess of 20% on a base of over $9 billion.
We also momentum with our launch products including Repatha and Kyprolis, and we expect will deliver more meaningfully to top line in 2016. We will defend against increasing competition through our mature franchises with an assumption of no additional biosimilar competition before the second half of 2016.
Before I close, I'd like to thank our teams across the world who continue to work tirelessly, ensuring access for patients to drugs. Let me pass it to Sean."

Amgen's R&D efforts are rolling along nicely, with 6 major regulatory approvals and innovative products for serious diseases over the last year. This is the core of what we do: invest in true innovation in order to change the practice of medicine.  Today, I'll begin with some comments on our cardiovascular programs. 
We recently submitted a supplemental ELA to offer patients a single-dose option for the 420-milligram monthly dose of Repatha, utilizing an automated device as part of our previously announced collaboration with the West Pharmaceutical Services. And the FDA has communicated the July 2016 PDUFA date. As we previously announced, based on our current modeling of our event-driven cardiovascular outcomes study, we anticipate the number of events required for final analysis to by about the middle of 2016, with the top line data expected to follow in the second half of the year. 
We also anticipate the results of our coronary ultrasound study in the second half of 2016. We believe that demonstrating a disease-modifying effect on , would be a compelling result, complement to our outcomes data.
In addition, we were very pleased with our Phase II oral dosing study of AMG 453 or Omecamtiv mecarbil. We are developing with cytogenetics in the study of heart failure met all of its objectives. We already began reviewing this did with our partners, key opinion leaders and soon with regulators to better understand the potential role of Omecamtiv mecarbil in the treatment of chronic heart failure patients.
Regarding our inhibitor, we have flexibility to gauge R&D investment going forward after a careful review of outcomes data when they become available.
Turning to oncology. Following on the U.S. label expansion, Kyprolis has received a positive opinion by the EU CHMP for the ASPIRE submission. And we'll submit the ENDEAVOR file once the ASPIRE approval occurs. In the U.S., the ENDEAVOR file is under priority review with an action date in January of 2016.
Finally, Phase III study of a weekly dosing regimen for Kyprolis in the relapsed refractory setting is actively enrolling.
Turning to immunooncology and enrollment by specific T cell engagors, we received a positive opinion in the EU from the CHMP for BLINCYTO in the setting of Philadelphia negative relapsed refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our next molecule-based platform AMG 330 directed at 33 is in testing with patients with acute myeloid leukemia, an area of profound unmet medical need. The treatment paradigm for this disease, which is approximately 4x as common as adult ALL, has not changed meaningfully in 20 years, and the prognosis for these patients remains bleak.
Finally, we're excited to have licensed in specific antibody platform for 6 targets including particularly anti-ct 38 T-cell engaging molecule on the preclinical stage, given our focus on multiple myeloma. 
As we announced yesterday, the FDA approved IMLYGIC for the local treatment of unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous and no dilution in patients with melanoma recurrence after initial surgery. Despite the concept being around for more than a century, IMLYGIC is the first viral therapy to be approved and represents an important new treatment option for melanoma patients. IMLYGIC also received the CHMP positive opinion for the treatment of adults with metastatic melanoma in the EU. While this initial indication is for a relatively small population in melanoma patients, we believe the real promise in IMLYGIC is and the combination with other immunotherapies, so we continue to advance the combination studies with the anti-CTELA 4, anti-PD1 antibodies that the previously announced.
The safety data from the Phase Ib portion of the IMLYGIC combination melanoma study appeared quite favorable and were recently presented in the European Cancer Congress. We forward to seeing the efficacy data from the study and continue to explore other possible combinations.
Leaving oncology, we complete our U.S. and EU submissions for our novel intravenous , Etelcalcetide or 416 in patients with secondary hyperthyroidism.
Turning to our franchise, we've recently seen 2 data sets for evolocumab, our monoclonal antibody in development with the ECB for postmenopausal osteoporosis. First, we observed is superiority to in and an open label Phase III study at the level of bone marrow density in patients heavily pretreated with phosphates. 
Second, at the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research, we presented data from an exploratory substudy of a Phase II trial demonstrating superior calculated bone strength versus in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. And of course, we look forward to seeing the first of our 2 outcome studies in the first half of next year. Recall, this is a 2-year study with patients receiving either evolocumab or placebo treatment in the year 1 followed by Prolia treatment in year 2.
Our migraine prophylaxis program with our CGRP receptor antagonist AMG 334 is actively enrolling to Phase III episodic migraine studies. The enrollment suggests to me a very strong clinical need for an effective well tolerated migraine prophylactic agent. Our Phase IIb study in the chronic migraine setting is enrolling nicely as well, and we'll see that data -- those data next year.
Behind AMG 334, our migraine pipeline, our anti PAK1 receptor antibody, AMG 301, is progressing through Phase I. We're pleased about our partnership of this emerging franchise with Novartis. 
Of course, the other exciting aspects of our collaboration with Novartis is the base program for Alzheimer's disease. And with scientists at Amgen first cloned the base gene, and deCODE provided compelling genetic validation as target. Here, we're taking a differentiated approach based on the concept that bit may prove difficult to demonstrate a convincing disease modifying effect of these inhibition when intervening in patients who have clinically detectable cognizant impairment. By sending chronically normal patients, genetically predisposed to latent Alzhemeir's virtue of their genotype, essentially intervening earlier in the disease course, we may be able to more effectively demonstrate the disease modifying effect. This study's being conducted with Banner Institute, which has identified a large number of these patients and is coupled with our human genetics platform provides a unique opportunity to pursue this novel approach.
Finally, our biosimilar programs continue to advance. The team is preparing for submissions for our biosimilars HUMIRA by year-end and our biosimilar Avastin Phase III study in nonsmall cell lung cancer successfully completed. Our biosimilar Herceptin study in breast cancer recently completed enrollment, and we expect to see the data sometime in the second half of next year. 
In closing, I'd like to thank the Amgen R&D team for their dedication to patients during this remarkably busy and exciting time. Bob?"

I guess the important thing from our perspective is to reflect on what our business model is, which is to develop innovative medicines directed against serious diseases. And we try to advance medicines that have a big effect for patients and with that, big effects for society. So if you look at the 6 medicines we're launching, that's exactly what the medicines represent. And we think they're medicines that have a big effect size for patients, medicines that create value. And so we've anticipated this moment to develop the work that we've been doing, anticipated it in our strategy and in the molecules that we've chosen to advance. So again, it doesn't come as a surprise to us, but there are questions about the value of the medicines and the price. And we think the more we can do to help focus on the economic burden of diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer to generative disease and significant prospect for opportunity that our unmet medicines represent against those the more appropriate framing by the discussion. So I wouldn't say there's anything particularly precipitous changing for those of us that are at the innovative biopharmaceutical, other than the fact that we're in incredibly exciting window of time here with lots of important new innovative medicines against again some of the most vaccine-tough diseases that we all phase."

And I think in the case of PCSK9, there was this certain value placed on the science that underlines that mechanism and the fact that thus far, we've not had a situation for example where the mechanism has been tested and failed in large outcomes trials. So it's going to be a case-by-case determination by regulators based on the mechanism and the evidence base that exists and whether or not there's safety overlying and that sort of things. So it's not a simple question to answer, I think, but I think that the parameters that will be weighed are fairly clear."

Based on our strong results in Q3, I think you'll agree that our business is performing well, and we are on target to deliver against our long-term objectives and commitment. I think what's really exciting for us right now is that we are on the verge of a whole new product cycle that is beginning to unfold.
To discuss all these topics and more in much greater detail, our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will lead the call today. Bob will provide an overview of our strategic and operational progress, followed by David Meline, our CFO, who will review our Q2 results and address guidance-related issues. Following David, our Head of Global Commercial operations, Tony Hooper will discuss our product performance during the quarter, followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide an update on recent approvals in our pipeline.

These slides have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by email. Our comments today will be governed by our safe harbor statement, which in summary says that through the course of our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements, and actual results could vary materially.

Thank you, Arvind, and let me welcome our listeners to the call. This is an exciting time at Amgen. And once again this quarter, it seems we have a healthy dose of information to share with you. So perhaps before jumping in, I should provide some context.
Recall that we met with analysts and investors 1 year ago in New York to lay out our long-term strategy for growth and our objectives for the next few years. Since then, I'm pleased to report we made steady progress towards achieving all of those objectives, as you'll hear on this call.
Our strategy for long-term growth starts with innovation. We set as an objective that we would launch 6 new products this year. And with the approval this week of IMLYGIC, our drug for melanoma, we're now delivering on the promise of those 6 opportunities. And of course, we believe that 2 of these new products, Repatha for cardiovascular disease and Kyprolis for multiple myeloma, represent particularly significant opportunities for patients and shareholders.
Sticking with innovation, I'd like to point out that behind our 6 new launches, our innovative pipeline continues to advance with rapid Phase III progress in our migraine program, strong new data for romosozumab and a successful Phase III program for etelcalcetide in kidney disease.
In addition as we reported earlier this week, our innovative heart failure program, Omecamtiv mecarbil, delivered promising results in Phase IIb testing, opening the prospect of another exciting opportunity for us in the field of cardiovascular disease.
Similarly, our biosimilar pipeline has advanced considerably over the past year with positive Phase III data for 2 of our 9 programs, specifically our HUMIRA and Avastin biosimilars. And Sean will provide more details on all of these progress shortly.
In addition to delivering on the promise of innovation with our newly launched products, we're also delivering strong financial performance across the board and making steady progress against our longer-term financial growth and performance objectives. You can see this in our third quarter results today and in our year-to-date performance.
During the quarter, we delivered 14% revenue growth and 18% adjusted earnings per share growth. Our key revenue growth drivers, Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar and Nplate, all performed well in the period, as Tony will convey in his remarks. Adjusted earnings per share grew faster than revenues, reflecting improved expense discipline and operating leverage even as we invested in our new product launch cycle.
On a year-to-date basis, revenues are up 9% and adjusted earnings per share are up 19%. Consistent with our long-term financial objectives, our operating performance continues to improve as the benefits of the transformation are reflected across our business. Our 49% adjusted operating margin through the first 9 months of the year reflects meaningful progress against our longer-term operating margin targets. And based on our ongoing strong performance, we're once again raising our 2015 guidance, as David will explain shortly.
With respect to capital allocation, here too, our actions are solidly in line with our commitments. Consistent with our resolve to return on average of 60% of adjusted net income to shareholders through 2018 with a growing dividend and share buybacks, we expect to increase our quarterly dividend to $1 per share for 2016, an increase of 27%. This comes on the back of a 30% increase for 2015. Also reflecting on our confidence in the outlook for our business, we recently increased our share repurchase authorization to $5 billion.
As we look towards 2016, we're focused on delivering continued strong performance while advancing our new flow of products. Obviously, we expect to face increased competition for our legacy products, but we've anticipated these changes and put ourselves in position to defend our legacy products while growing our newer franchises. Given the many variables at play in our business and to help you in your planning, we're providing preliminary guidance for 2016, which we'll update when we report our full year results at end of January 2016.
Finally, let me remind you that last October, we laid out our financial objectives through 2018. A year later, we feel confident we're on track to meet or exceed these objectives. These include $1.5 billion in savings from our transformation, double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth on average through 2018 and adjusted operating margin improvement from 38% in 2013 to in the range of 52% to 54% by 2018.
Before turning over to David, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their unwavering commitment to deliver for patients and shareholders as we launch new products, expand internationally and continue from a position of strength to transform our company for a great future. David?"

Thanks, Bob.Turning to the third quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenues at $5.7 billion grew 14% year-over-year, with 14% product sales growth, driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenues increased $24 million",1341,"Okay. Thanks, Bob.
Turning to the third quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenues at $5.7 billion grew 14% year-over-year, with 14% product sales growth, driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenues increased $24 million year-over-year, due primarily to a milestone received for the filing of Kyprolis in Japan. Total revenue and product sales were negatively impacted by approximately 2 percentage points year-over-year due to foreign exchange headwinds.
Adjusted operating income at $2.7 billion grew 19% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved two points to 49% for the quarter, reflecting our continued growth and the benefits from our transformation program along with significant investment in our launch activities. On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 13.5% improved by 2.2 points, driven by net selling prices, lower royalties and manufacturing efficiencies.
Research and development expenses at $1.1 billion were up 11% versus the prior year. This increase was driven by upfront payments for deal activity in the quarter and increased investments in support of new product launches. This increase was partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
SG&A expenses were up 17% on a year-over-year basis, driven by commercial investments in new product launches and ENBREL-related payments, partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
Total operating expenses increased 10% year-over-year and increased 8% sequentially. For the quarter, operating expenses benefited by approximately 3 percentage points from foreign exchange year-over-year. We saw an increase of spending in Q3 versus the prior quarter. This reflects the typical pattern for the business plus our launch investments this year.
Other income and expenses declined by $18 million or 14% on a year-over-year basis to a net expense of $147 million in the quarter.
The adjusted tax rate was 18% for the quarter, a 0.9 point increase versus Q3 of 2014. This increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings. As a result, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 18% on a year-over-year basis.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 6. For the third quarter, we generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $0.2 billion over the prior year. This increase was driven by higher operating income.
Total debt outstanding ended Q3 at $31.8 billion, and cash and investments totaled $31.1 billion.  Additionally, our third quarter 2015 dividend was $0.79 per share, an increase of 30% versus the prior year.
In the third quarter of 2015, we increased our share repurchase activity versus the prior year with $700 million of cash deployed to share repurchases for approximately 4.6 million shares in the period.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2015 on Page 7. We remain on track with our plans to grow the business and invest for the future while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model, including delivering over $400 million of efficiency savings from the transformation, which is being reinvested this year in the business to fund our significant new product launches.
With regard to our updated outlook for 2015 revenue, we are increasing our guidance to $21.4 billion to $21.6 billion from our prior range of $21.1 billion to $21.4 billion, reflecting solid revenue performance.  Reported growth will moderate as we complete the year, reflecting the expected normalization of relatively high customer inventories as well as the effects of competition on our legacy products.
We are also increasing our 2015 adjusted earnings per share outlook to $9.95 to $10.10 a share from the previous $9.55 to $9.80 forecast. The revised earnings outlook reflects our strong year-to-date performance, including revenue growth and lower expenses due to cost discipline.
For the fourth quarter, we expect operating expenses to increase by around $0.2 billion sequentially, reflecting normal spending patterns as well as continued launch investments.
In terms of the adjusted tax rate, our guidance range of 18% to 19% is unchanged and is consistent with our year-to-date adjusted tax rate of 18.4%. As a reminder, this guidance continues to exclude the possible benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in 2015.
We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year, in line with our previous guidance.
As we approach the end of 2015, we are pleased with our progress again this year. We expect to meet or exceed the commitments provided for the 2014 to '18 period, including double-digit adjusted EPS growth on average, $1.5 billion of transformation savings, improving our adjusted operating margin from 38% to 52% to 54% and returning at least 60% of adjusted net income on average to shareholders.
Turning to Page 8. 2016 will be an important year as we continue progress towards our long-term goals. Given the number of moving pieces, including new product launches, currency movements and U.S. biosimilar competition, as well as the continued evolution of our transformation program, we want to provide a preliminary planning framework for 2016. As you'll note, the framework is generally in line with expectations while individual components may differ.
In 2016, revenue is expected to range from $21.7 billion to $22.3 billion. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to range from $10.35 to $10.75 per share. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to range from 20.5% to 21.5% and capital expenditures will be approximately $700 million.
I want to take a moment to highlight several key assumptions embedded in our outlook for next year. First, our revenue guidance range for 2016 includes continued momentum from our growth brands as well as a meaningful contribution from our product launches. We also assume our legacy products face new biosimilar competition in the U.S., which Tony will address in more detail.
Next, we expect an approximate 1 percentage point unfavorable impact to revenue and adjusted EPS growth, or $0.12 per share, due to foreign exchange headwinds in 2016 versus 2015, assuming that current foreign exchange rates prevail through the end of 2016. This represents an approximate 4 percentage point negative impact on our international sales.
In terms of our transformation program, we expect continued progress in 2016 with an additional $400 million of savings. These savings will be partially reinvested in the business and will also help drive a year-over-year reduction in total adjusted operating expenses.
Finally, our 2016 adjusted tax rate guidance reflects an increase versus 2015 and excludes the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit. This increase is primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings, as some of our newer products and Enbrel have a higher tax rate than our legacy products. Also, U.S. R&D spend is decreasing due to transformation program savings, which has a negative impact on the tax rate. We now expect the tax rate through 2018 to be in the low 20% range.
Regarding our capital allocation plan for 2016, we'll continue to execute on the commitment to repurchase $2 billion of shares by year-end 2015. And as of now, we have deployed a total of $1.9 billion to repurchase shares. With an increased Board of Directors authorization of $5 billion in total, we expect to repurchase an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of shares by the end of 2016. On a cumulative basis, our repurchases will total $4 billion to $5 billion of shares by the end of 2016 since a year ago.
We also plan to increase the dividend to $1 per share in the first quarter of 2016, reflecting another 27% increase from current levels.
With these actions, we are solidly on the path to meet our commitment to return 60% of adjusted net income to shareholders on average for the period 2014 to '18, while continuing to invest in the long-term growth of the business.
In summary, we are pleased with our performance thus far in 2015, and we look forward to delivering results in the remainder of this year as well as in 2016 and beyond.
I will now turn the call over to Tony."

You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the third quarter in Slide #10.This was an exciting quarter for Amgen as we launched Repatha and continued to deliver strong performance with our growth",1549,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, folks. You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the third quarter in Slide #10.
This was an exciting quarter for Amgen as we launched Repatha and continued to deliver strong performance with our growth products. Globally, product sales grew 14% year-over-year, and our U.S. business delivered 20% year-over-year growth. Our international business grew 3% year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, with a 7% unit growth in Europe.
Let me start with an update on Repatha. The European approval of Repatha in July marked the first PCSK9 inhibitor approval in the world. We are now also approved in the U.S. and Canada. Along with our Japanese partner, Astellas, we expect Japanese approval in the first half of next year.
We've designed Repatha's clinical program to demonstrate that a simple -- single dose, achieving maximum PCSK9 inhibition, provides intensive and predictable cholesterol lowering. This profile is resonating well with physicians. In the U.S., the launch is off to a good start. We built our sales force with experienced cardiovascular professionals, and we established our presence in the field with our Corlanor launch in the first quarter this year. Upon approval, our field sales force was trained and quickly in the field meeting with our prioritized Repatha customer targets.
Anticipating a period of negotiation with payers post-approval, we launched the RepathaReady program. This program provides Repatha to appropriate patients, if they wish, during the insurance verification process while plans finalized their formularies and performance pathways. The response to our launch is extremely encouraging as the volume of request to date is a clear indicator of the unmet need, and physicians' belief in the benefits of Repatha.
With their recent formulary decision, Express Scripts recognized the value of Repatha, and we continue to negotiate with other payers to expand access in the United States. However, we expect payers' utilization management criteria, or UM, to remain fairly narrow pending the outcomes data.
In the European Union, we continue to negotiate reimbursement with individual countries. We already have patients on Repatha in Germany, in the U.K. and some Scandinavian countries.
The cardiovascular outcomes data and the intravascular ultrasound data in 2016 will continue to expand Repatha's exciting profile. Repatha also has dosing frequency flexibility, either every 2 weeks or monthly. And we have submitted our single-injection monthly dosing option to regulators.
For the launch of Repatha, our continued progress with Corlanor and the recently announced positive Phase II result on omecamtiv mecarbil, we're building a strong foundation for Amgen's cardiovascular franchise.
Turning now to Kyprolis, where sales grew 46% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. The new indication for relapsed or second-line multiple myeloma was launched in the U.S. in July. We're off to a good start. And from our chart audit have already seen a doubling of the KRd regimen, which is the regimens in ASPIRE in new-to-treatment second-line patients. Every month, there are about 1,000 new patients who require second-line treatment. We expect sales to grow as we increase shares in these new second-line patients and see a corresponding increase in the duration of Kyprolis therapy.
We also received priority review for the submission of the ENDEAVOR data, which demonstrated a doubling of progression-free survival compared to Velcade-treated patients. We expect this to drive additional momentum next year and further strengthen Kyprolis as the best-in-class proteasome inhibitor. We anticipate further approval for Kyprolis outside the U.S. by the year-end, including Canada, Europe, parts of South America and Asia.
Let me now turn to Enbrel. On Slide 15, you'll see that Enbrel delivered 30% growth year-over-year, primarily driven by net selling price. Just to clarify, net selling price includes the impact from list price changes, as well as contracting and access change that have occurred over the past 12 months. Inventory growth was 11%, which was driven by a favorable year-over-year comparison as the inventory levels were abnormally low in the third quarter of 2014.
Segment growth remains strong in rheumatology and dermatology, growing 25% and 38%, respectively, year-over-year on a value basis. Quarter-on-quarter, our rheumatology share was relatively stable at about 28%, while our share in dermatology declined 2%, to 24%, due to intensive buying competition from new therapies. I would remind you that rheumatology accounts for about 80% of Enbrel sales.
Sensipar grew 29% year-over-year, driven by inventory, net selling price and unit growth in both the U.S. and Europe. Similar to Enbrel, the inventory growth was driven by unusually low inventory levels in quarter 3 last year.
I'll now move to Prolia. Prolia followed its normal seasonal pattern with a sequential decline in quarter 3, but on a year-over-year basis, delivered 25% growth, with unit growth exceeding 20% in both the U.S. and Europe. Growth is driven by continued share gains of about 3 percentage points in both the U.S. and Europe.
XGEVA grew 19% year-over-year. Unit share increased about 4 percentage points over the last year in the U.S. and about 5 percentage points in Europe. There were, however, some abnormally large purchases by some end customers in the U.S. this quarter, adding to the volume growth. We continue to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition.
Vectibix is showing flat volume, but this is solely due to the timing of shipments to our Japanese partner, Takeda, who holds the license in Japan. The U.S. delivered year-over-year growth of 16% and Europe 12%, both driven by the expansion of Vectibix into the earlier lines of therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer.
Nplate continued to deliver solid growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 17% unit growth.
Now, I'll turn to our mature brands, starting with the filgrastim franchise. Neulasta delivered year-over-year growth of 6%, driven by net selling price and the inventory. Similar to XGEVA, we saw signs of abnormally high purchases by some larger end customers in quarter 3, which we would expect to burn off in quarter 4. Meanwhile, the on-body injector for Neulasta, which we now branded as part of the Neulasta Onpro kit, continues to gain adoption in the marketplace. Over 60% of our Neulasta accounts have now purchased the Onpro at least once, and Onpro achieved 19% share of Neulasta units in quarter 3.
NEUPOGEN declined 5% year-over-year, driven by branded short-acting competition in the U.S. Sequentially quarter-over-quarter, we held share against branded competition and saw minimal impact from the new biosimilar competition, given it launched late in the quarter. Using our 7 years of biosimilar defense experience in Europe, we will be competitive in the marketplace, but expect share erosion in the near term due to the new competition.
Turning to our ESA products. EPOGEN declined 6% year-over-year, including a 15% unit decline as dynamics continued to evolve in the U.S. dialysis centers. That 15% unit decline would have been deeper if not for abnormally high purchases by a large end customer in quarter 3. Fresenius has now moved more than half of the patients from EPOGEN to MIRCERA, and we expect the trend to continue. Please recall that we have a contract with DaVita through 2018, in which they will purchase at least 90% of the ESAs from Amgen.
We're also seeing strong Aranesp adoption with medium-sized and independent dialysis centers. Of the over 400,000 dialysis patients in the U.S., about 50,000 patients have now transitioned to Aranesp, including about 20,000 in Fresenius. EPOGEN sales in future quarters will be impacted by utilization at Fresenius, potential switching to Aranesp and potential biosimilar competition. Aranesp sales increased 4% year-over-year with a 32% growth in the U.S., driven by the shift in dialysis business from EPOGEN to Aranesp that I was just talking about.  International sales were impacted by foreign exchange rates.
While we continue to see a decline in oncology ESA use, we are pleased with the response to Aranesp in the U.S. dialysis business. We are making good progress with our launch of BLINCYTO. BLINCYTO or Repatha, taken the most severe ALL patients. And as the ALL patients cycle through different therapies, we'll continue to grow patient penetration.
In summary, quarter 3 was an exciting quarter. Our Repatha and Kyprolis launches began in earnest. And we delivered strong a result for our growth products and continued to defend our mature products in the marketplace. Please keep in mind the additional inventory in the third quarter for Neulasta, EPOGEN and XGEVA, as some of the larger end customers exceeded above $100 million, and we expect this to reverse in quarter 4.
Looking ahead to 2016, our growth products, including Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate are continuing to -- are expected to continue to deliver solid growth, as sales of these products are growing in double digits this year and in some cases, in excess of 20% on a base of over $9 billion.
We're also building momentum with our launch products, including Repatha and Kyprolis, and we expect they will deliver more meaningfully to top line in 2016. We will defend against increasing competition to our mature franchises with an assumption of no additional biosimilar competition before the second half of 2016.
Before I close, I'd like to thank our teams across the world who continue to work tirelessly, ensuring access for patients to our innovative drugs. Let me now pass it to Sean."

Amgen's R&D efforts are rolling along nicely with 6 major regulatory approvals of innovative products for serious diseases over the last year. This is the core of what we do: invest in true innovation in order to change the practice of medicine. Today, I'll begin with some comments on our cardiovascular programs.
We recently submitted a supplemental BLA to offer patients a single-dose option for the 420-milligram monthly dose of Repatha, utilizing an automated device as part of our previously announced collaboration with West Pharmaceutical Services. And the FDA has communicated the July 2016 PDUFA date. As we previously announced, based on our current modeling of our event-driven cardiovascular outcomes study, we anticipate the number of events required for final analysis to accrue by about the middle of 2016, with the top line data expected to follow in the second half of the year.
We also anticipate the results of our coronary artery intravascular ultrasound study in the second half of 2016. We believe that demonstrating a disease-modifying effect on atherosclerotic plaque burden would be a compelling result complementary to our outcomes data.
In addition, we were very pleased with our Phase II oral dosing study of AMG 423 or omecamtiv mecarbil, that minus an activator we are developing with Cytokinetics in the study of heart failure, met all of its objectives. We've already begun reviewing these data with our partners, key opinion leaders and soon, with regulators, to better understand the potential role of omecamtiv in the treatment of chronic heart failure patients.
Regarding our CETP inhibitor, we have flexibility to gate our R&D investment going forward after a careful review of Lilly's CETP outcomes data when they become available.
Turning to oncology. Following on the U.S. label expansion, Kyprolis has received a positive opinion by the EU CHMP for the ASPIRE submission. And we'll submit the ENDEAVOR file once the ASPIRE approval occurs. In the U.S., the ENDEAVOR file is under priority review with an action date of January of 2016. Finally, our Phase III study of a weekly dosing regimen for Kyprolis in the relapsed refractory setting is actively enrolling.
Turning to immunooncology in the realm of Bispecific T cell Engagers, we received a positive opinion in the EU from the CHMP for BLINCYTO in the setting of Philadelphia negative relapsed refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our next molecule based on the BiTE platform, AMG 330, directed at CD33 has entered testing in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, an area of profound unmet medical need. The treatment paradigm for this disease, which is approximately 4x as common as adult ALL, has not changed meaningfully in 20 years, and the prognosis for these patients remains bleak.
Finally, we're excited to have licensed-in Xencor's bispecific antibody platform for 6 targets, including particularly an anti-CD38 T cell engaging molecule on the preclinical stage, given our focus in multiple myeloma.
As we announced yesterday, the FDA approved IMLYGIC for the local treatment of unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous and nodal lesions in patients with melanoma recurrent after initial surgery. Despite the concept being around for more than a century, IMLYGIC is the first oncolytic viral therapy to be approved and represents an important new treatment option for melanoma patients. IMLYGIC also received a CHMP positive opinion for the treatment of adults with unresectable metastatic melanoma in the EU. While this initial indication is for a relatively small population in melanoma patients, we believe the real promise of IMLYGIC is in the combination with other immunotherapies, so we continue to advance the combination studies with the anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1 and anti-PDL1 antibodies that we've previously announced.
The safety data from the Phase Ib portion of the IMLYGIC-KEYTRUDA combination melanoma study appeared quite favorable and were recently presented at the European Cancer Congress. We look forward to seeing the efficacy data from the study and continue to explore other possible combinations.
Leaving oncology, we've completed our U.S. and EU submissions for our novel intravenous calcimimetic, etelcalcetide, or AMG 416 in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.
Turning to our bone franchise, we've recently seen 2 data sets for romosozumab, our anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibody in development with UCB for postmenopausal osteoporosis. First, we observed superiority to teriparatide in an open-label Phase III study at the level of bone mineral density in patients heavily pretreated with bisphosphonates.
Second, at the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research, we presented data from an exploratory sub-study of a Phase II trial demonstrating superior calculated bone strength versus teriparatide in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. And of course, we look forward to seeing the first of our 2 fracture outcome studies in the first half of next year. Recall, this is a 2-year study with patients receiving either romosozumab or placebo treatment in year 1 followed by Prolia treatment in year 2.
Our migraine prophylaxis program with our CGRP receptor antagonist antibody, AMG 334, is actively enrolling 2 Phase III episodic migraine studies. The enrollment rate suggests to me a very strong clinical need for an effective well-tolerated migraine prophylactic agent. Our Phase IIb study in the chronic migraine setting is enrolling nicely as well, and we'll see that data -- those data next year.
Behind AMG 334 in our migraine pipeline, our anti-PAC-1 receptor antibody, AMG 301, is progressing through Phase I. We're pleased about our partnership of this emerging franchise with Novartis.
Of course, the other exciting aspects of our collaboration with Novartis is the base program for Alzheimer's disease. It was a scientist at Amgen who first cloned the base gene, and deCODE has provided compelling genetic validation of this target. Here, we're taking a differentiated approach based on the concept that it may prove difficult to demonstrate a convincing disease-modifying effect of base inhibition when intervening in patients who have clinically detectable cognitive impairment. By studying cognitively normal patients genetically predisposed to late-onset Alzhemeir's by virtue of their APOE4 genotype, essentially intervening earlier in the disease course, we may be able to more effectively demonstrate the disease modifying effect. This study is being conducted with the Banner Institute, which has identified a large number of these patients and this, coupled with our human genetics platform, provides a unique opportunity to pursue this novel approach.
Finally, our biosimilar programs continue to advance. The team is preparing for submissions for our biosimilar HUMIRA by year-end, and our biosimilar Avastin Phase III study in non-small cell lung cancer successfully completed. Our biosimilar Herceptin study in breast cancer recently completed enrollment, and we expect to see the data sometime in the second half of next year.
In closing, I'd like to thank the Amgen R&D team for their dedication to patients during this remarkably busy and exciting time. Bob?"

And so we've anticipated this moment in the develop work that we've been doing, anticipated it in our strategy and in the molecules that we've chosen to advance. So again, this doesn't come as a surprise to us that there are questions about the value of the medicines and the price.

So in my mind, the understanding of the demand is there and the need is there. The slow march we are taking with payers in the U.S., of course, is reducing the opportunity for patients to get access to these drugs early, with the likelihood Express Scripts having  made this decision and we work actively with other guys to get the product up and running. The utilization criteria at the moment they've set in place is fairly tight to ensure that patients step through a number of situations.

That's going to be predicated very much on the mechanism. And I think in the case of PCSK9, there was this certain value placed on the science that underlies that mechanism and the fact that, thus far, we've not had a situation for example where the mechanism had been tested and failed in large outcomes trials. So it's going to be a case-by-case determination by regulators based on the mechanism and the evidence base that exists and whether or not there are safety overlie and that sort of things.

Thank you, Arvind, and let me welcome our listeners to the call. This is an exciting time at Amgen. And once again this quarter, it seems we have a healthy dose of information to share with you. So perhaps before jumping in, I should provide some context.
Recall that we met with analysts and investors 1 year ago in New York to lay out our long-term strategy for growth and our objectives for the next few years. Since then, I'm pleased to report we've made steady progress towards achieving all of those objectives, as you'll hear on this call.
Our strategy for long-term growth starts with innovation. We set as an objective that we would launch 6 new products this year. And with the approval this week of IMLYGIC, our drug for melanoma, we're now delivering on the promise of those 6 opportunities. And of course, we believe that 2 of these new products, Repatha for cardiovascular disease and Kyprolis for multiple myeloma, represent particularly significant opportunities for patients and shareholders.
Sticking with innovation, I'd like to point out that behind our 6 new launches, our innovative pipeline continues to advance with rapid Phase III progress in our migraine program, strong new data for romosozumab and a successful Phase III program for etelcalcetide in kidney disease.
In addition as we reported earlier this week, our innovative heart failure program, omecamtiv mecarbil, delivered promising results in Phase IIb testing, opening the prospect of another exciting opportunity for us in the field of cardiovascular disease.
Similarly, our biosimilar pipeline has advanced considerably over the past year with positive Phase III data for 2 of our 9 programs, specifically our HUMIRA and Avastin biosimilars. And Sean will provide more details on all of this progress shortly.
In addition to delivering on the promise of innovation with our newly launched products, we're also delivering strong financial performance across the board and making steady progress against our longer-term financial growth and performance objectives. You can see this in our third quarter results today and in our year-to-date performance.
During the quarter, we delivered 14% revenue growth and 18% adjusted earnings per share growth. Our key revenue growth drivers, Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar and Nplate, all performed well in the period, as Tony will convey in his remarks. Adjusted earnings per share grew faster than revenues, reflecting improved expense discipline and operating leverage even as we invested in our new product launch cycle.
On a year-to-date basis, revenues are up 9% and adjusted earnings per share are up 19%. Consistent with our long-term financial objectives, our operating performance continues to improve as the benefits of our transformation are reflected across our business. Our 49% adjusted operating margin through the first 9 months of the year reflects meaningful progress against our longer-term operating margin targets. And based on our ongoing strong performance, we're once again raising our 2015 guidance, as David will explain shortly.
With respect to capital allocation, here too, our actions are solidly in line with our commitments. Consistent with our resolve to return an average of 60% of adjusted net income to shareholders through 2018, with a growing dividend and share buybacks, we expect to increase our quarterly dividend to $1 per share for 2016, an increase of 27%. This comes on the back of a 30% increase for 2015. Also, reflecting on our confidence in the outlook for our business, we recently increased our share repurchase authorization to $5 billion.
As we look towards 2016, we're focused on delivering continued strong performance while advancing our new flow of products. Obviously, we expect to face increased competition for our legacy products, but we've anticipated these changes and put ourselves in position to defend our legacy products while growing our newer franchises. Given the many variables at play in our business and to help you in your planning, we're providing preliminary guidance for 2016, which we'll update when we report our full year results at the end of January 2016.
Finally, let me remind you that last October, we laid out our financial objectives through 2018. A year later, we feel confident we're on track to meet or exceed these objectives. These include: $1.5 billion in savings from our transformation; double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth on average through 2018; and adjusted operating margin improvement from 38% in 2013 to in the range of 52% to 54% by 2018.
Before turning over to David, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their unwavering commitment to deliver for patients and shareholders as we launch new products, expand internationally and continue from a position of strength to transform our company for a great future. David?"

Revenues at $5.7 billion grew 14% year-over-year, with 14% product sales growth, driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenues increased $24 million year-over-year, due primarily to a milestone received for the filing of Kyprolis in Japan. Total revenue and product sales were negatively impacted by approximately 2 percentage points year-over-year due to foreign exchange headwinds.
Adjusted operating income at $2.7 billion grew 19% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved two points to 49% for the quarter, reflecting our continued growth and the benefits from our transformation program, along with significant investment in our launch activities. On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 13.5% improved by 2.2 points, driven by net selling prices, lower royalties and manufacturing efficiencies.
Research and development expenses at $1.1 billion were up 11% versus the prior year. This increase was driven by upfront payments for deal activity in the quarter and increased investments in support of new product launches. This increase was partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
SG&A expenses were up 17% on a year-over-year basis, driven by commercial investments in new product launches and Enbrel-related payments, partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
Total operating expenses increased 10% year-over-year and increased 8% sequentially. For the quarter, operating expenses benefited by approximately 3 percentage points from foreign exchange year-over-year. We saw an increase of spending in Q3 versus the prior quarter. This reflects the typical pattern for the business plus our launch investments this year.
Other income and expenses declined by $18 million or 14% on a year-over-year basis to a net expense of $147 million in the quarter.
The adjusted tax rate was 18% for the quarter, a 0.9 point increase versus Q3 of 2014. This increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings. As a result, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 18% on a year-over-year basis.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 6. For the third quarter, we generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $0.2 billion over the prior year. This increase was driven by higher operating income.
Total debt outstanding ended Q3 at $31.8 billion, and cash and investments totaled $31.1 billion.  Additionally, our third quarter 2015 dividend was $0.79 per share, an increase of 30% versus the prior year.
In the third quarter of 2015, we increased our share repurchase activity versus the prior year, with $700 million of cash deployed to share repurchases for approximately 4.6 million shares in the period.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2015 on Page 7. We remain on track with our plans to grow the business and invest for the future while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model, including delivering over $400 million of efficiency savings from the transformation, which is being reinvested this year in the business to fund our significant new product launches.
With regard to our updated outlook for 2015 revenue, we are increasing our guidance to $21.4 billion to $21.6 billion from our prior range of $21.1 billion to $21.4 billion, reflecting solid revenue performance.  Reported growth will moderate as we complete the year, reflecting the expected normalization of relatively high customer inventories, as well as the effects of competition on our legacy products.
We are also increasing our 2015 adjusted earnings per share outlook to $9.95 to $10.10 a share from the previous $9.55 to $9.80 forecast. The revised earnings outlook reflects our strong year-to-date performance, including revenue growth and lower expenses due to cost discipline.
For the fourth quarter, we expect operating expenses to increase by around $0.2 billion sequentially, reflecting normal spending patterns as well as continued launch investments.
In terms of the adjusted tax rate, our guidance range of 18% to 19% is unchanged and is consistent with our year-to-date adjusted tax rate of 18.4%. As a reminder, this guidance continues to exclude the possible benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in 2015.
We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year, in line with our previous guidance.
As we approach the end of 2015, we are pleased with our progress again this year. We expect to meet or exceed the commitments provided for the 2014 to '18 period, including double-digit adjusted EPS growth on average, $1.5 billion of transformation savings, improving our adjusted operating margin from 38% to 52% to 54% and returning at least 60% of adjusted net income on average to shareholders.
Turning to Page 8. 2016 will be an important year as we continue progress towards our long-term goals. Given the number of moving pieces, including new product launches, currency movements and U.S. biosimilar competition, as well as the continued evolution of our transformation program, we want to provide a preliminary planning framework for 2016. As you'll note, the framework is generally in line with expectations, while individual components may differ.
In 2016, revenue is expected to range from $21.7 billion to $22.3 billion. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to range from $10.35 to $10.75 per share. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to range from 20.5% to 21.5% and capital expenditures will be approximately $700 million.
I want to take a moment to highlight several key assumptions embedded in our outlook for next year. First, our revenue guidance range for 2016 includes continued momentum from our growth brands, as well as a meaningful contribution from our product launches. We also assume our legacy products face new biosimilar competition in the U.S., which Tony will address in more detail.
Next, we expect an approximate 1 percentage point unfavorable impact to revenue and adjusted EPS growth, or $0.12 per share, due to foreign exchange headwinds in 2016 versus 2015, assuming that current foreign exchange rates prevail through the end of 2016. This represents an approximate 4 percentage point negative impact on our international sales.
In terms of our transformation program, we expect continued progress in 2016 with an additional $400 million of savings. These savings will be partially reinvested in the business and will also help drive a year-over-year reduction in total adjusted operating expenses.
Finally, our 2016 adjusted tax rate guidance reflects an increase versus 2015 and excludes the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit. This increase is primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings, as some of our newer products and Enbrel have a higher tax rate than our legacy products. Also, U.S. R&D spend is decreasing due to transformation program savings, which has a negative impact on the tax rate. We now expect the tax rate through 2018 to be in the low 20% range.
Regarding our capital allocation plan for 2016, we have continued to execute on the commitment to repurchase $2 billion of shares by year-end 2015. And as of now, we have deployed a total of $1.9 billion to repurchase shares. With an increased Board of Directors' authorization of $5 billion in total, we expect to repurchase an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of shares by the end of 2016. On a cumulative basis, our repurchases will total $4 billion to $5 billion of shares by the end of 2016 since a year ago.
We also plan to increase the dividend to $1 per share in the first quarter of 2016, reflecting another 27% increase from current levels.
With these actions, we are solidly on the path to meet our commitment to return 60% of adjusted net income to shareholders on average for the period 2014 to '18, while continuing to invest in the long-term growth of the business.
In summary, we are pleased with our performance thus far in 2015, and we look forward to delivering results in the remainder of this year, as well as in 2016 and beyond.
I will now turn the call over to Tony."
24816,312558733,884858,"Amgen Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, folks. You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the third quarter on Slide #10.This was an exciting quarter for Amgen as we launched Repatha and continued to deliver strong performance with our growth",1549,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, folks. You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the third quarter on Slide #10.
This was an exciting quarter for Amgen as we launched Repatha and continued to deliver strong performance with our growth products. Globally, product sales grew 14% year-over-year, and our U.S. business delivered 20% year-over-year growth. Our international business grew 3% year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, with a 7% unit growth in Europe.
Let me start with an update on Repatha. The European approval of Repatha in July marked the first PCSK9 inhibitor approval in the world. We are now also approved in the U.S. and Canada. Along with our Japanese partner, Astellas, we expect Japanese approval in the first half of next year.
We've designed Repatha's clinical program to demonstrate that a simple -- single dose, achieving maximal PCSK9 inhibition, provides intensive and predictable cholesterol lowering. This profile is resonating well with physicians. In the U.S., the launch is off to a good start. We've built our sales force with experienced cardiovascular professionals, and we established our presence in the field with our Corlanor launch in the first quarter this year. Upon approval, our field sales force was trained and quickly in the field meeting with our prioritized Repatha customer targets.
Anticipating a period of negotiation with payers post-approval, we launched the RepathaReady program. This program provides Repatha to appropriate patients, if they wish, during the insurance verification process while plans finalize their formularies and performance pathways. The response to our launch is extremely encouraging as the volume of requests to date is a clear indicator of the unmet need and physicians' belief in the benefits of Repatha.
With their recent formulary decision, Express Scripts recognized the value of Repatha, and we continue to negotiate with other payers to expand access in the United States. However, we expect payers' utilization management criteria, or UM, to remain fairly narrow pending the outcomes data.
In the European Union, we continue to negotiate reimbursement with individual countries. We already have patients on Repatha in Germany, in the U.K. and some Scandinavian countries.
The cardiovascular outcomes data and the intravascular ultrasound data in 2016 will continue to expand Repatha's exciting profile. Repatha also has dosing frequency flexibility, either every 2 weeks or monthly. And we have submitted our single-injection monthly dosing option to regulators.
With the launch of Repatha, our continued progress with Corlanor and the recently announced positive Phase II result on omecamtiv mecarbil, we're building a strong foundation for Amgen's cardiovascular franchise.
Turning now to Kyprolis, where sales grew 46% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. The new indication for relapsed or second-line multiple myeloma was launched in the U.S. in July. We're off to a good start. And from our chart audits have already seen a doubling of the KRd regimen, which is the regimen in ASPIRE in new-to-treatment and second-line patients. Every month, there are about 1,000 new patients who require second-line treatment. We expect sales to grow as we increase shares in these new second-line patients and see a corresponding increase in the duration of Kyprolis therapy.
We also received priority review for the submission of the ENDEAVOR data, which demonstrated a doubling of progression-free survival compared to Velcade-treated patients. We expect this to drive additional momentum next year and further strengthen Kyprolis as the best-in-class proteasome inhibitor. We anticipate further approval for Kyprolis outside the U.S. by the year-end, including Canada, Europe and parts of South America and Asia.
Let me now turn to Enbrel. On Slide 15, you'll see that Enbrel delivered 30% growth year-over-year, primarily driven by net selling price. Just to clarify, net selling price includes the impact from list price changes, as well as contracting and access changes that have occurred over the past 12 months. Inventory growth was 11%, which was driven by a favorable year-over-year comparison as inventory levels were abnormally low in the third quarter 2014.
Segment growth remains strong in rheumatology and dermatology, growing 25% and 38%, respectively, year-over-year on a value basis. Quarter-on-quarter, our rheumatology share was relatively stable at about 28%, while our share in dermatology declined 2%, to 24%, due to intensive buying competition from new therapies. I would remind you that rheumatology accounts for about 80% of Enbrel sales.
Sensipar grew 29% year-over-year, driven by inventory, net selling price and unit growth in both the U.S. and Europe. Similar to Enbrel, the inventory growth was driven by unusually low inventory levels in quarter 3 last year.
I'll now move to Prolia. Prolia followed its normal seasonal pattern with a sequential decline in quarter 3, but on a year-over-year basis, delivered 25% growth, with unit growth exceeding 20% in both the U.S. and Europe. Growth was driven by continued share gains of about 3 percentage points in both the U.S. and Europe.
XGEVA grew 19% year-over-year. Unit share increased about 4 percentage points over the last year in the U.S. and about 5 percentage points in Europe. There were, however, some abnormally large purchases by some end customers in the U.S. this quarter, adding to the volume growth. We continue to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition.
Vectibix is showing flat volume, but this is solely due to the timing of shipments to our Japanese partner, Takeda, who holds the license in Japan. The U.S. delivered year-over-year growth of 16% and Europe 12%, both driven by the expansion of Vectibix into the earlier lines of therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer.
Nplate continued to deliver solid growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 17% unit growth.
Now, I'll turn to our mature brands, starting with the filgrastim franchise. Neulasta delivered year-over-year growth of 6%, driven by net selling price and inventory. Similar to XGEVA, we saw signs of abnormally high purchases by some larger end customers in quarter 3, which we would expect to burn off in quarter 4. Meanwhile, the on-body injector for Neulasta, which we have now branded as part of the Neulasta Onpro kit, continues to gain adoption in the marketplace. Over 60% of our Neulasta accounts have now purchased the Onpro at least once, and Onpro achieved 19% share of Neulasta units in quarter 3.
NEUPOGEN declined 5% year-over-year, driven by branded short-acting competition in the U.S. Sequentially quarter-over-quarter, we held share against branded competition and saw minimal impact from the new biosimilar competition, given it launched late in the quarter. Using our 7 years of biosimilar defense experience in Europe, we will be competitive in the marketplace, but expect share erosion in the near term due to the new competition.
Turning to our ESA products. EPOGEN declined 6% year-over-year, including a 15% unit decline as dynamics continued to evolve in the U.S. dialysis centers. That 15% unit decline would have been deeper if not for abnormally high purchases by a large end customer in quarter 3. Fresenius has now moved more than half its patients from EPOGEN to MIRCERA, and we expect the trend to continue. Please recall that we have a contract with DaVita through 2018, in which they will purchase at least 90% of the ESAs from Amgen.
We're also seeing strong Aranesp adoption with medium-sized and independent dialysis centers. Of the over 400,000 dialysis patients in the U.S., about 50,000 patients have now transitioned to Aranesp, including about 20,000 in Fresenius. EPOGEN sales in future quarters will be impacted by utilization at Fresenius, potential switching to Aranesp and potential biosimilar competition. Aranesp sales increased 4% year-over-year with a 32% growth in the U.S., driven by the shift in dialysis business from EPOGEN to Aranesp that I was just talking about.  International sales were impacted by foreign exchange rates.
While we continue to see a decline in oncology ESA use, we are pleased with the response to Aranesp in the U.S. dialysis business. We are making good progress with our launch of BLINCYTO. BLINCYTO or Repatha, take on the most severe ALL patients. And as the ALL patients cycle through different therapies, we'll continue to grow patient penetration.
In summary, quarter 3 was an exciting quarter. Our Repatha and Kyprolis launches began in earnest. And we delivered strong results for our growth products and continued to defend our mature products in the marketplace. Please keep in mind the additional inventory in the third quarter for Neulasta, EPOGEN and XGEVA, as some of our larger end customers exceeded about $100 million, and we expect this to reverse in quarter 4.
Looking ahead to 2016, our growth products, including Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate are continuing to -- are expected to continue to deliver solid growth, as sales for these products have grown in double digits this year and, in some cases, in excess of 20% on a base of over $9 billion.
We're also building momentum with our launch products, including Repatha and Kyprolis, and we expect they will deliver more meaningfully to the top line in 2016. We will defend against increasing competition to our mature franchises with an assumption of no additional biosimilar competition before the second half of 2016.
Before I close, I'd like to thank our teams across the world who continue to work tirelessly, ensuring access for patients to our innovative drugs. 
Let me now pass you to Sean."

Amgen's R&D efforts are rolling along nicely with 6 major regulatory approvals of innovative products for serious diseases over the last year. This is the core of what we do: invest in true innovation in order to change the practice of medicine. Today, I'll begin with some comments on our cardiovascular programs.
We recently submitted a supplemental BLA to offer patients a single-dose option for the 420-milligram monthly dose of Repatha, utilizing an automated device as part of our previously announced collaboration with West Pharmaceutical Services. And the FDA has communicated the July 2016 PDUFA date. As we previously announced, based on our current modeling of our event-driven cardiovascular outcomes study, we anticipate the number of events required for final analysis to accrue by about the middle of 2016, with the top line data expected to follow in the second half of the year.
We also anticipate the results of our coronary artery intravascular ultrasound study in the second half of 2016. We believe that demonstrating a disease-modifying effect on atherosclerotic plaque burden would be a compelling result complementary to our outcomes data.
In addition, we were very pleased that our Phase II oral dosing study of AMG 423 or omecamtiv mecarbil, a myosin activator we are developing with Cytokinetics in the study of chronic heart failure, met all of its objectives. We've already begun reviewing these data with our partners, key opinion leaders and soon, with regulators, to better understand the potential role of omecamtiv in the treatment of chronic heart failure patients.
Regarding our CETP inhibitor, we have flexibility to gate our R&D investment going forward after a careful review of Lilly's CETP outcomes data when they become available.
Turning to oncology. Following on the U.S. label expansion, Kyprolis received a positive opinion by the EU CHMP for the ASPIRE submission. And we'll submit the ENDEAVOR file once the ASPIRE approval occurs. In the U.S., the ENDEAVOR file is under priority review with an action date of January of 2016. Finally, our Phase III study of a weekly dosing regimen for Kyprolis in the relapsed refractory setting is actively enrolling.
Turning to immunooncology in the realm of Bispecific T cell Engagers, we received a positive opinion in the EU from the CHMP for BLINCYTO in the setting of Philadelphia negative relapsed refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our next molecule based on the BiTE platform, AMG 330, directed at CD33 has entered testing in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, an area of profound unmet medical need. The treatment paradigm for this disease, which is approximately 4x as common as adult ALL, has not changed meaningfully in 20 years, and the prognosis for these patients remains bleak.
Finally, we're excited to have licensed-in Xencor's bispecific antibody platform for 6 targets, including particularly an anti-CD38 T cell engaging molecule in the preclinical stage, given our focus in multiple myeloma.
As we announced yesterday, the FDA approved IMLYGIC for the local treatment of unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous and nodal lesions in patients with melanoma recurrent after initial surgery. Despite the concept being around for more than a century, IMLYGIC is the first oncolytic viral therapy to be approved and represents an important new treatment option for melanoma patients. IMLYGIC also received a CHMP positive opinion for the treatment of adults with unresectable metastatic melanoma in the EU. While this initial indication is for a relatively small population in melanoma patients, we believe the real promise of IMLYGIC is in the combination with other immunotherapies, so we continue to advance the combination studies with the anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1 and anti-PDL1 antibodies that we've previously announced.
The safety data from the Phase Ib portion of the IMLYGIC-KEYTRUDA combination melanoma study appeared quite favorable and were recently presented at the European Cancer Congress. We look forward to seeing the efficacy data from this study and continue to explore other possible combinations.
Leaving oncology, we've completed our U.S. and EU submissions for our novel intravenous calcimimetic, etelcalcetide, or AMG 416 in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.
Turning to our bone franchise, we've recently seen 2 data sets for romosozumab, our anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibody in development with UCB for postmenopausal osteoporosis. First, we observed superiority to teriparatide in an open-label Phase III study at the level of bone mineral density in patients heavily pretreated with bisphosphonates.
Second, at the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research, we presented data from an exploratory sub-study of a Phase II trial demonstrating superior calculated bone strength versus teriparatide in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. And of course, we look forward to seeing the first of our 2 fracture outcome studies in the first half of next year. Recall, this is a 2-year study, with patients receiving either romosozumab or placebo treatment in year 1 followed by Prolia treatment in year 2.
Our migraine prophylaxis program with our CGRP receptor antagonist antibody, AMG 334, is actively enrolling 2 Phase III episodic migraine studies. The enrollment rate suggests to me a very strong clinical need for an effective well-tolerated migraine prophylactic agent. Our Phase IIb study in the chronic migraine setting is enrolling nicely as well, and we'll see that data -- those data next year.
Behind AMG 334 in our migraine pipeline, our anti-PAC-1 receptor antibody, AMG 301, is progressing through Phase I. We're pleased about our partnership of this emerging franchise with Novartis.
Of course, the other exciting aspects of our collaboration with Novartis is the base program for Alzheimer's disease. It was scientists at Amgen who first cloned the base gene, and deCODE has provided compelling genetic validation of this target. Here, we're taking a differentiated approach based on the concept that it may prove difficult to demonstrate a convincing disease-modifying effect of base inhibition when intervening in patients who have clinically detectable cognitive impairment. By studying cognitively normal patients genetically predisposed to late-onset Alzheimer's by virtue of their APOE4 genotype, essentially intervening earlier in the disease course, we may be able to more effectively demonstrate the disease modifying effect. This study is being conducted with the Banner Institute, which has identified a large number of these patients and this, coupled with our human genetics platform, provides a unique opportunity to pursue this novel approach.
Finally, our biosimilar programs continue to advance. The team is preparing for submissions for our biosimilar HUMIRA by year-end, and our biosimilar Avastin Phase III study in non-small cell lung cancer successfully completed. Our biosimilar Herceptin study in breast cancer recently completed enrollment, and we expect to see the data sometime in the second half of next year.
In closing, I'd like to thank the Amgen R&D team for their dedication to patients during this remarkably busy and exciting time. Bob?"

I guess the important thing from our perspective is to reflect on what our business model is, which is to develop innovative medicines directed against serious diseases. And we try to advance medicines that have a big effect for patients, and with that, big effects for society. So if you look at the 6 medicines we're launching, that's exactly what the medicines represent and we think medicines that have a big effect size for patients are medicines that create value. And so we've anticipated this moment in the develop work that we've been doing, anticipated it in our strategy and in the molecules that we've chosen to advance. So again, this doesn't come as a surprise to us that there are questions about the value of the medicines and the price. And we think the more we can do to help focus on the economic burden of diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease and the significant prospect or opportunity that our medicines represent against those, the more appropriate framing for the discussion. So I wouldn't say there's anything particularly precipitous changing for those of us that are at the innovative biopharmaceutical end, other than the fact that we're in an incredibly exciting window of time here with lots of important new innovative medicines against, again, some of the most vexing tough diseases that we all face."

I mean, the level of discussion we're getting amongst cardiologists and high-prescribing primary care physicians is more than what I would have expected. They really understand the value of lowering LDL and understand what the statins have delivered in terms of the outcomes data. So in my mind, the understanding is there, the demand is there and the need is there. The slow march we are taking with payers in the U.S., of course, is reducing the opportunity for patients to get access to these drugs early, with the likelihood Express Scripts having made this decision and we work actively with other guys to get product up and running. The utilization criteria at the moment they've set in place is fairly tight to ensure that patients step through a number of situations. But I continue to believe that what we have seen in terms of patients being referred to the hub for insurance verification, I feel pretty confident about that. In Europe, of course, the label is slightly broader, but we do take longer to negotiate with the various countries, country by country in Europe."

That's going to be predicated very much on the mechanism. And I think in the case of PCSK9, there was a certain value placed on the science that underlies that mechanism and the fact that, thus far, we've not had a situation for example where the mechanism had been tested and failed in large outcome trials. So it's going to be a case-by-case determination by regulators based on the mechanism and the evidence base that exists and whether or not there's safety overlie and that sort of thing. So it's not a simple question to answer, I think, but I think that the parameters that will be weighed are fairly clear."

Thank you, Arvind, and let me welcome our listeners to the call. This is an exciting time at Amgen. And once again this quarter, it seems we have a healthy dose of information to share with you. So perhaps before jumping in, I should provide some context.
Recall that we met with analysts and investors 1 year ago in New York to lay out our long-term strategy for growth and our objectives for the next few years. Since then, I'm pleased to report we've made steady progress towards achieving all of those objectives, as you'll hear on this call.
Our strategy for long-term growth starts with innovation. We set as an objective that we would launch 6 new products this year. And with the approval this week of IMLYGIC, our drug for melanoma, we're now delivering on the promise of those 6 opportunities. And of course, we believe that 2 of these new products, Repatha for cardiovascular disease and Kyprolis for multiple myeloma, represent particularly significant opportunities for patients and shareholders.
Sticking with innovation, I'd like to point out that behind our 6 new launches, our innovative pipeline continues to advance with rapid Phase III progress in our migraine program, strong new data for romosozumab and a successful Phase III program for etelcalcetide in kidney disease.
In addition as we reported earlier this week, our innovative heart failure program, omecamtiv mecarbil, delivered promising results in Phase IIb testing, opening the prospect of another exciting opportunity for us in the field of cardiovascular disease.
Similarly, our biosimilar pipeline has advanced considerably over the past year with positive Phase III data for 2 of our 9 programs, specifically our HUMIRA and Avastin biosimilars. And Sean will provide more details on all of this progress shortly.
In addition to delivering on the promise of innovation with our newly launched products, we're also delivering strong financial performance across the board and making steady progress against our longer-term financial growth and performance objectives. You can see this in our third quarter results today and in our year-to-date performance.
During the quarter, we delivered 14% revenue growth and 18% adjusted earnings per share growth. Our key revenue growth drivers, Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar and Nplate, all performed well in the period, as Tony will convey in his remarks. Adjusted earnings per share grew faster than revenues, reflecting improved expense discipline and operating leverage even as we invested in our new product launch cycle.
On a year-to-date basis, revenues are up 9% and adjusted earnings per share are up 19%. Consistent with our long-term financial objectives, our operating performance continues to improve as the benefits of our transformation are reflected across our business. Our 49% adjusted operating margin through the first 9 months of the year reflects meaningful progress against our longer-term operating margin targets. And based on our ongoing strong performance, we're once again raising our 2015 guidance, as David will explain shortly.
With respect to capital allocation, here too, our actions are solidly in line with our commitments. Consistent with our resolve to return an average of 60% of adjusted net income to shareholders through 2018, with a growing dividend and share buybacks, we expect to increase our quarterly dividend to $1 per share for 2016, an increase of 27%. This comes on the back of a 30% increase for 2015. Also, reflecting on our confidence in the outlook for our business, we recently increased our share repurchase authorization to $5 billion.
As we look towards 2016, we're focused on delivering continued strong performance while advancing our new flow of products. Obviously, we expect to face increased competition for our legacy products, but we've anticipated these changes and put ourselves in position to defend our legacy products while growing our newer franchises. Given the many variables at play in our business and to help you in your planning, we're providing preliminary guidance for 2016, which we'll update when we report our full year results at the end of January 2016.
Finally, let me remind you that last October, we laid out our financial objectives through 2018. A year later, we feel confident we're on track to meet or exceed these objectives. These include: $1.5 billion in savings from our transformation; double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth on average through 2018; and adjusted operating margin improvement from 38% in 2013 to in the range of 52% to 54% by 2018.
Before turning over to David, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their unwavering commitment to deliver for patients and shareholders as we launch new products, expand internationally and continue from a position of strength to transform our company for a great future. David?"

Other revenues increased $24 million y",1342,"Okay. Thanks, Bob. Turning to the third quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck. Revenues at $5.7 billion grew 14% year-over-year, with 14% product sales growth, driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenues increased $24 million year-over-year, due primarily to a milestone received for the filing of Kyprolis in Japan. Total revenue and product sales were negatively impacted by approximately 2 percentage points year-over-year due to foreign exchange headwinds.
Adjusted operating income at $2.7 billion grew 19% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved two points to 49% for the quarter, reflecting our continued growth and the benefits from our transformation program, along with significant investment in our launch activities. On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 13.5% improved by 2.2 points, driven by net selling prices, lower royalties and manufacturing efficiencies.
Research and development expenses at $1.1 billion were up 11% versus the prior year. This increase was driven by upfront payments for deal activity in the quarter and increased investments in support of new product launches. This increase was partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
SG&A expenses were up 17% on a year-over-year basis, driven by commercial investments in new product launches and Enbrel-related payments, partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.
Total operating expenses increased 10% year-over-year and increased 8% sequentially. For the quarter, operating expenses benefited by approximately 3 percentage points from foreign exchange year-over-year. We saw an increase of spending in Q3 versus the prior quarter. This reflects the typical pattern for the business plus our launch investments this year.
Other income and expenses declined by $18 million or 14% on a year-over-year basis to a net expense of $147 million in the quarter.
The adjusted tax rate was 18% for the quarter, a 0.9 point increase versus Q3 of 2014. This increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings. As a result, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 18% on a year-over-year basis.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 6. For the third quarter, we generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $0.2 billion over the prior year. This increase was driven by higher operating income.
Total debt outstanding ended Q3 at $31.8 billion, and cash and investments totaled $31.1 billion.  Additionally, our third quarter 2015 dividend was $0.79 per share, an increase of 30% versus the prior year.
In the third quarter of 2015, we increased our share repurchase activity versus the prior year, with $700 million of cash deployed to share repurchases for approximately 4.6 million shares in the period.
Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2015 on Page 7. We remain on track with our plans to grow the business and invest for the future while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model, including delivering over $400 million of efficiency savings from the transformation, which is being reinvested this year in the business to fund our significant new product launches.
With regard to our updated outlook for 2015 revenue, we are increasing our guidance to $21.4 billion to $21.6 billion from our prior range of $21.1 billion to $21.4 billion, reflecting solid revenue performance.  Reported growth will moderate as we complete the year, reflecting the expected normalization of relatively high customer inventories, as well as the effects of competition on our legacy products.
We are also increasing our 2015 adjusted earnings per share outlook to $9.95 to $10.10 a share from the previous $9.55 to $9.80 forecast. The revised earnings outlook reflects our strong year-to-date performance, including revenue growth and lower expenses due to cost discipline.
For the fourth quarter, we expect operating expenses to increase by around $0.2 billion sequentially, reflecting normal spending patterns as well as continued launch investments.
In terms of the adjusted tax rate, our guidance range of 18% to 19% is unchanged and is consistent with our year-to-date adjusted tax rate of 18.4%. As a reminder, this guidance continues to exclude the possible benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in 2015.
We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year, in line with our previous guidance.
As we approach the end of 2015, we are pleased with our progress again this year. We expect to meet or exceed the commitments provided for the 2014 to '18 period, including double-digit adjusted EPS growth on average, $1.5 billion of transformation savings, improving our adjusted operating margin from 38% to 52% to 54% and returning at least 60% of adjusted net income on average to shareholders.
Turning to Page 8. 2016 will be an important year as we continue progress towards our long-term goals. Given the number of moving pieces, including new product launches, currency movements and U.S. biosimilar competition, as well as the continued evolution of our transformation program, we want to provide a preliminary planning framework for 2016. As you'll note, the framework is generally in line with expectations, while individual components may differ.
In 2016, revenue is expected to range from $21.7 billion to $22.3 billion. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to range from $10.35 to $10.75 per share. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to range from 20.5% to 21.5% and capital expenditures will be approximately $700 million.
I want to take a moment to highlight several key assumptions embedded in our outlook for next year. First, our revenue guidance range for 2016 includes continued momentum from our growth brands, as well as a meaningful contribution from our product launches. We also assume our legacy products face new biosimilar competition in the U.S., which Tony will address in more detail.
Next, we expect an approximate 1 percentage point unfavorable impact to revenue and adjusted EPS growth, or $0.12 per share, due to foreign exchange headwinds in 2016 versus 2015, assuming that current foreign exchange rates prevail through the end of 2016. This represents an approximate 4 percentage point negative impact on our international sales.
In terms of our transformation program, we expect continued progress in 2016 with an additional $400 million of savings. These savings will be partially reinvested in the business and will also help drive a year-over-year reduction in total adjusted operating expenses.
Finally, our 2016 adjusted tax rate guidance reflects an increase versus 2015 and excludes the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit. This increase is primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings, as some of our newer products and Enbrel have a higher tax rate than our legacy products. Also, U.S. R&D spend is decreasing due to transformation program savings, which has a negative impact on the tax rate. We now expect the tax rate through 2018 to be in the low 20% range.
Regarding our capital allocation plan for 2016, we have continued to execute on the commitment to repurchase $2 billion of shares by year-end 2015. And as of now, we have deployed a total of $1.9 billion to repurchase shares. With an increased Board of Directors' authorization of $5 billion in total, we expect to repurchase an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of shares by the end of 2016. On a cumulative basis, our repurchases will total $4 billion to $5 billion of shares by the end of 2016 since a year ago.
We also plan to increase the dividend to $1 per share in the first quarter of 2016, reflecting another 27% increase from current levels.
With these actions, we are solidly on the path to meet our commitment to return 60% of adjusted net income to shareholders on average for the period 2014 to '18, while continuing to invest in the long-term growth of the business.
In summary, we are pleased with our performance thus far in 2015, and we look forward to delivering results in the remainder of this year, as well as in 2016 and beyond.
I will now turn the call over to Tony."

You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the third quarter on Slide #10.This was an exciting quarter for Amgen as we launched Repatha and continued to deliver strong performance with our growth",1549,"Thanks, David, and good afternoon, folks. You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the third quarter on Slide #10.
This was an exciting quarter for Amgen as we launched Repatha and continued to deliver strong performance with our growth products. Globally, product sales grew 14% year-over-year, and our U.S. business delivered 20% year-over-year growth. Our international business grew 3% year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, with a 7% unit growth in Europe.
Let me start with an update on Repatha. The European approval of Repatha in July marked the first PCSK9 inhibitor approval in the world. We are now also approved in the U.S. and Canada. Along with our Japanese partner, Astellas, we expect Japanese approval in the first half of next year.
We've designed Repatha's clinical program to demonstrate that a simple -- single dose, achieving maximal PCSK9 inhibition, provides intensive and predictable cholesterol lowering. This profile is resonating well with physicians. In the U.S., the launch is off to a good start. We've built our sales force with experienced cardiovascular professionals, and we established our presence in the field with our Corlanor launch in the first quarter this year. Upon approval, our field sales force was trained and quickly in the field meeting with our prioritized Repatha customer targets.
Anticipating a period of negotiation with payers post-approval, we launched the RepathaReady program. This program provides Repatha to appropriate patients, if they wish, during the insurance verification process while plans finalize their formularies and performance pathways. The response to our launch is extremely encouraging as the volume of requests to date is a clear indicator of the unmet need and physicians' belief in the benefits of Repatha.
With their recent formulary decision, Express Scripts recognized the value of Repatha, and we continue to negotiate with other payers to expand access in the United States. However, we expect payers' utilization management criteria, or UM, to remain fairly narrow pending the outcomes data.
In the European Union, we continue to negotiate reimbursement with individual countries. We already have patients on Repatha in Germany, in the U.K. and some Scandinavian countries.
The cardiovascular outcomes data and the intravascular ultrasound data in 2016 will continue to expand Repatha's exciting profile. Repatha also has dosing frequency flexibility, either every 2 weeks or monthly. And we have submitted our single-injection monthly dosing option to regulators.
With the launch of Repatha, our continued progress with Corlanor and the recently announced positive Phase II result on omecamtiv mecarbil, we're building a strong foundation for Amgen's cardiovascular franchise.
Turning now to Kyprolis, where sales grew 46% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. The new indication for relapsed or second-line multiple myeloma was launched in the U.S. in July. We're off to a good start. And from our chart audits have already seen a doubling of the KRd regimen, which is the regimen in ASPIRE in new-to-treatment and second-line patients. Every month, there are about 1,000 new patients who require second-line treatment. We expect sales to grow as we increase shares in these new second-line patients and see a corresponding increase in the duration of Kyprolis therapy.
We also received priority review for the submission of the ENDEAVOR data, which demonstrated a doubling of progression-free survival compared to Velcade-treated patients. We expect this to drive additional momentum next year and further strengthen Kyprolis as the best-in-class proteasome inhibitor. We anticipate further approval for Kyprolis outside the U.S. by the year-end, including Canada, Europe and parts of South America and Asia.
Let me now turn to Enbrel. On Slide 15, you'll see that Enbrel delivered 30% growth year-over-year, primarily driven by net selling price. Just to clarify, net selling price includes the impact from list price changes, as well as contracting and access changes that have occurred over the past 12 months. Inventory growth was 11%, which was driven by a favorable year-over-year comparison as inventory levels were abnormally low in the third quarter 2014.
Segment growth remains strong in rheumatology and dermatology, growing 25% and 38%, respectively, year-over-year on a value basis. Quarter-on-quarter, our rheumatology share was relatively stable at about 28%, while our share in dermatology declined 2%, to 24%, due to intensive buying competition from new therapies. I would remind you that rheumatology accounts for about 80% of Enbrel sales.
Sensipar grew 29% year-over-year, driven by inventory, net selling price and unit growth in both the U.S. and Europe. Similar to Enbrel, the inventory growth was driven by unusually low inventory levels in quarter 3 last year.
I'll now move to Prolia. Prolia followed its normal seasonal pattern with a sequential decline in quarter 3, but on a year-over-year basis, delivered 25% growth, with unit growth exceeding 20% in both the U.S. and Europe. Growth was driven by continued share gains of about 3 percentage points in both the U.S. and Europe.
XGEVA grew 19% year-over-year. Unit share increased about 4 percentage points over the last year in the U.S. and about 5 percentage points in Europe. There were, however, some abnormally large purchases by some end customers in the U.S. this quarter, adding to the volume growth. We continue to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition.
Vectibix is showing flat volume, but this is solely due to the timing of shipments to our Japanese partner, Takeda, who holds the license in Japan. The U.S. delivered year-over-year growth of 16% and Europe 12%, both driven by the expansion of Vectibix into the earlier lines of therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer.
Nplate continued to deliver solid growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 17% unit growth.
Now, I'll turn to our mature brands, starting with the filgrastim franchise. Neulasta delivered year-over-year growth of 6%, driven by net selling price and inventory. Similar to XGEVA, we saw signs of abnormally high purchases by some larger end customers in quarter 3, which we would expect to burn off in quarter 4. Meanwhile, the on-body injector for Neulasta, which we have now branded as part of the Neulasta Onpro kit, continues to gain adoption in the marketplace. Over 60% of our Neulasta accounts have now purchased the Onpro at least once, and Onpro achieved 19% share of Neulasta units in quarter 3.
NEUPOGEN declined 5% year-over-year, driven by branded short-acting competition in the U.S. Sequentially quarter-over-quarter, we held share against branded competition and saw minimal impact from the new biosimilar competition, given it launched late in the quarter. Using our 7 years of biosimilar defense experience in Europe, we will be competitive in the marketplace, but expect share erosion in the near term due to the new competition.
Turning to our ESA products. EPOGEN declined 6% year-over-year, including a 15% unit decline as dynamics continued to evolve in the U.S. dialysis centers. That 15% unit decline would have been deeper if not for abnormally high purchases by a large end customer in quarter 3. Fresenius has now moved more than half its patients from EPOGEN to MIRCERA, and we expect the trend to continue. Please recall that we have a contract with DaVita through 2018, in which they will purchase at least 90% of the ESAs from Amgen.
We're also seeing strong Aranesp adoption with medium-sized and independent dialysis centers. Of the over 400,000 dialysis patients in the U.S., about 50,000 patients have now transitioned to Aranesp, including about 20,000 in Fresenius. EPOGEN sales in future quarters will be impacted by utilization at Fresenius, potential switching to Aranesp and potential biosimilar competition. Aranesp sales increased 4% year-over-year with a 32% growth in the U.S., driven by the shift in dialysis business from EPOGEN to Aranesp that I was just talking about.  International sales were impacted by foreign exchange rates.
While we continue to see a decline in oncology ESA use, we are pleased with the response to Aranesp in the U.S. dialysis business. We are making good progress with our launch of BLINCYTO. BLINCYTO or Repatha, take on the most severe ALL patients. And as the ALL patients cycle through different therapies, we'll continue to grow patient penetration.
In summary, quarter 3 was an exciting quarter. Our Repatha and Kyprolis launches began in earnest. And we delivered strong results for our growth products and continued to defend our mature products in the marketplace. Please keep in mind the additional inventory in the third quarter for Neulasta, EPOGEN and XGEVA, as some of our larger end customers exceeded about $100 million, and we expect this to reverse in quarter 4.
Looking ahead to 2016, our growth products, including Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix and Nplate are continuing to -- are expected to continue to deliver solid growth, as sales for these products have grown in double digits this year and, in some cases, in excess of 20% on a base of over $9 billion.
We're also building momentum with our launch products, including Repatha and Kyprolis, and we expect they will deliver more meaningfully to the top line in 2016. We will defend against increasing competition to our mature franchises with an assumption of no additional biosimilar competition before the second half of 2016.
Before I close, I'd like to thank our teams across the world who continue to work tirelessly, ensuring access for patients to our innovative drugs. 
Let me now pass you to Sean."

Amgen's R&D efforts are rolling along nicely with 6 major regulatory approvals of innovative products for serious diseases over the last year. This is the core of what we do: invest in true innovation in order to change the practice of medicine. Today, I'll begin with some comments on our cardiovascular programs.
We recently submitted a supplemental BLA to offer patients a single-dose option for the 420-milligram monthly dose of Repatha, utilizing an automated device as part of our previously announced collaboration with West Pharmaceutical Services. And the FDA has communicated the July 2016 PDUFA date. As we previously announced, based on our current modeling of our event-driven cardiovascular outcomes study, we anticipate the number of events required for final analysis to accrue by about the middle of 2016, with the top line data expected to follow in the second half of the year.
We also anticipate the results of our coronary artery intravascular ultrasound study in the second half of 2016. We believe that demonstrating a disease-modifying effect on atherosclerotic plaque burden would be a compelling result complementary to our outcomes data.
In addition, we were very pleased that our Phase II oral dosing study of AMG 423 or omecamtiv mecarbil, a myosin activator we are developing with Cytokinetics in the study of chronic heart failure, met all of its objectives. We've already begun reviewing these data with our partners, key opinion leaders and soon, with regulators, to better understand the potential role of omecamtiv in the treatment of chronic heart failure patients.
Regarding our CETP inhibitor, we have flexibility to gate our R&D investment going forward after a careful review of Lilly's CETP outcomes data when they become available.
Turning to oncology. Following on the U.S. label expansion, Kyprolis received a positive opinion by the EU CHMP for the ASPIRE submission. And we'll submit the ENDEAVOR file once the ASPIRE approval occurs. In the U.S., the ENDEAVOR file is under priority review with an action date of January of 2016. Finally, our Phase III study of a weekly dosing regimen for Kyprolis in the relapsed refractory setting is actively enrolling.
Turning to immunooncology in the realm of Bispecific T cell Engagers, we received a positive opinion in the EU from the CHMP for BLINCYTO in the setting of Philadelphia negative relapsed refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our next molecule based on the BiTE platform, AMG 330, directed at CD33 has entered testing in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, an area of profound unmet medical need. The treatment paradigm for this disease, which is approximately 4x as common as adult ALL, has not changed meaningfully in 20 years, and the prognosis for these patients remains bleak.
Finally, we're excited to have licensed-in Xencor's bispecific antibody platform for 6 targets, including particularly an anti-CD38 T cell engaging molecule in the preclinical stage, given our focus in multiple myeloma.
As we announced yesterday, the FDA approved IMLYGIC for the local treatment of unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous and nodal lesions in patients with melanoma recurrent after initial surgery. Despite the concept being around for more than a century, IMLYGIC is the first oncolytic viral therapy to be approved and represents an important new treatment option for melanoma patients. IMLYGIC also received a CHMP positive opinion for the treatment of adults with unresectable metastatic melanoma in the EU. While this initial indication is for a relatively small population in melanoma patients, we believe the real promise of IMLYGIC is in the combination with other immunotherapies, so we continue to advance the combination studies with the anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1 and anti-PDL1 antibodies that we've previously announced.
The safety data from the Phase Ib portion of the IMLYGIC-KEYTRUDA combination melanoma study appeared quite favorable and were recently presented at the European Cancer Congress. We look forward to seeing the efficacy data from this study and continue to explore other possible combinations.
Leaving oncology, we've completed our U.S. and EU submissions for our novel intravenous calcimimetic, etelcalcetide, or AMG 416 in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.
Turning to our bone franchise, we've recently seen 2 data sets for romosozumab, our anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibody in development with UCB for postmenopausal osteoporosis. First, we observed superiority to teriparatide in an open-label Phase III study at the level of bone mineral density in patients heavily pretreated with bisphosphonates.
Second, at the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research, we presented data from an exploratory sub-study of a Phase II trial demonstrating superior calculated bone strength versus teriparatide in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. And of course, we look forward to seeing the first of our 2 fracture outcome studies in the first half of next year. Recall, this is a 2-year study, with patients receiving either romosozumab or placebo treatment in year 1 followed by Prolia treatment in year 2.
Our migraine prophylaxis program with our CGRP receptor antagonist antibody, AMG 334, is actively enrolling 2 Phase III episodic migraine studies. The enrollment rate suggests to me a very strong clinical need for an effective well-tolerated migraine prophylactic agent. Our Phase IIb study in the chronic migraine setting is enrolling nicely as well, and we'll see that data -- those data next year.
Behind AMG 334 in our migraine pipeline, our anti-PAC-1 receptor antibody, AMG 301, is progressing through Phase I. We're pleased about our partnership of this emerging franchise with Novartis.
Of course, the other exciting aspects of our collaboration with Novartis is the base program for Alzheimer's disease. It was scientists at Amgen who first cloned the base gene, and deCODE has provided compelling genetic validation of this target. Here, we're taking a differentiated approach based on the concept that it may prove difficult to demonstrate a convincing disease-modifying effect of base inhibition when intervening in patients who have clinically detectable cognitive impairment. By studying cognitively normal patients genetically predisposed to late-onset Alzheimer's by virtue of their APOE4 genotype, essentially intervening earlier in the disease course, we may be able to more effectively demonstrate the disease modifying effect. This study is being conducted with the Banner Institute, which has identified a large number of these patients and this, coupled with our human genetics platform, provides a unique opportunity to pursue this novel approach.
Finally, our biosimilar programs continue to advance. The team is preparing for submissions for our biosimilar HUMIRA by year-end, and our biosimilar Avastin Phase III study in non-small cell lung cancer successfully completed. Our biosimilar Herceptin study in breast cancer recently completed enrollment, and we expect to see the data sometime in the second half of next year.
In closing, I'd like to thank the Amgen R&D team for their dedication to patients during this remarkably busy and exciting time. Bob?"

I guess the important thing from our perspective is to reflect on what our business model is, which is to develop innovative medicines directed against serious diseases.

So if you look at the 6 medicines we're launching, that's exactly what the medicines represent and we think medicines that have a big effect size for patients are medicines that create value. And so we've anticipated this moment in the develop work that we've been doing, anticipated it in our strategy and in the molecules that we've chosen to advance. So again, this doesn't come as a surprise to us that there are questions about the value of the medicines and the price. And we think the more we can do to help focus on the economic burden of diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease and the significant prospect or opportunity that our medicines represent against those, the more appropriate framing for the discussion. So I wouldn't say there's anything particularly precipitous changing for those of us that are at the innovative biopharmaceutical end, other than the fact that we're in an incredibly exciting window of time here with lots of important new innovative medicines against, again, some of the most vexing tough diseases that we all face."

Because Rick Gonzalez at AbbVie, your counterpart, absolutely insists, like table pounding, heavy breathing that there's no way that's going to happen before like 2019 or so. So I'd just like to get your updated thoughts on that. And then finally, can you give us any indication whatsoever, any, about what our expectations should be for gross to net discounting for the PCSK9 class, either right now, early days, or a more steady state level? Because that's what we need obviously in our models."

So we'll continue to work with them as we go forward. On Enbrel, the net price always depends on a combination of price increases on list versus large amounts of contracting. Enbrel competes in a highly competitive environment where payers make decisions around where products are on their formularies in terms of a preferred tier or a nonpreferred tier based on the rebates. And when you're on a preferred tier, you pay a rebate. If you're not a preferred tier, you don't pay a rebate. So there's a huge amount of dramatic changes inside hundreds of different plans."

So in my mind, the understanding is there, the demand is there and the need is there. The slow march we are taking with payers in the U.S., of course, is reducing the opportunity for patients to get access to these drugs early, with the likelihood Express Scripts having made this decision and we work actively with other guys to get product up and running. The utilization criteria at the moment they've set in place is fairly tight to ensure that patients step through a number of situations.

That's going to be predicated very much on the mechanism. And I think in the case of PCSK9, there was a certain value placed on the science that underlies that mechanism and the fact that, thus far, we've not had a situation for example where the mechanism had been tested and failed in large outcome trials.
