We'll share industry trends and also we'll review our progress that we're making, executing on our 5-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.
We continue to make progress on our path forward, delivering solid revenue and EPS growth in the fourth quarter and the full year. In the quarter, revenues grew 7% to $1.9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 5% to $1.08 and cash from operations was strong at $303 million. For the full year 2014, revenues grew 4% to $7.4 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 2.5% to $4.10 a share and we generated $938 million in cash. Our performance reflects improved execution and a stable business environment. That, combined with our ability to generate substantial and predictable cash flow has enabled us to raise our quarterly dividend 15% to $0.38 a share. This is the fourth time we've raised the dividend since 2011. Before I get into our performance, I would like to talk about industry dynamics, specifically utilization, reimbursement and regulation. To start with, in utilization, we've continued to see signs of modest increase in utilization. We're encouraged by the progress on exchange home as a result of the Affordable Care Act. 
During the fourth quarter, we continued to see stability in test volumes on what we're calling a same-provider basis. On reimbursement, we will see less government pressure on the clinical schedule in 2015 than we've seen in the previous 2 years. At this time, our industry is focused on effectively implementing the doc fix legislation, also known as Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, which calls for an orderly review of the clinical fee schedule. Our industry trade association, the American Clinical Lab Association, ACLA, continues to work closely with the centers for Medicaid and MediCare services on the rule-making process. We are hopeful the rule-making process will be defined in 2015. It will establish an approach to building a representative view of the market. 
The market view that will be used to update the fee schedule should include participants from the entire market, including large and small independent commercial labs, and peak labs as well as hospitals. The current timetable calls for data to be collected from the market participants in 2016 and any revisions to the fee schedule will therefore go in place no sooner than 2017. We'll continue to update you on the progress as we know more in the coming year. 
Another important issue facing the industry is the FDA's proposal to extend regulatory oversight to laboratory developed test. The American clinical lab Association is actually opposing the FDA's proposal and has engaged 2 highly respected experts in constitutional law in administrative procedure. Lauren Strive from Harvard Law School and Paul Clement, the former solicitor general of the United States. The FDA's proposal is regulatory, overreached at its worst. And it's bad for patients and the health care industry. For that reason, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and other leading health care providers have urged the FDA to withdraw its proposal. 
Now for an update on our performance. We continue to improve on our ability to execute the company's 5-point strategy. As a reminder, our strategy is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on the core diagnostic information services business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. Let's start with our highest priority in reviewing our progress. 
While in 2014, we executed our strategy and restored growth. First, we improved our sales effectiveness and how we call on the market. As you've heard me say before, our go-to-market team is better led, better managed, better staffed, better trained, better equipped, better motivated, compared to 2 years ago. We are seeing continued improvement on our underlying revenue trends this year. 
In the fourth quarter, organic revenues grew 60 basis points versus last year. This is the first quarter of organic revenue growth since I joined the company in May of 2012. Second, our professional lab services business has announced and implemented 6 new relationships in 2014, which are on track to deliver $40 million in annualized revenues. The most recent contract was finalized in the fourth quarter. Third, part of our improving performance is the result of our strategy to focus on esoteric testing, through our clinical franchises. We saw a sequential improvement in gene-based and esoteric testing for the third consecutive quarter. Some specific tests that are going faster are our BRCAvantage breast cancer testing, noninvasive prenatal testing and hepatitis C. I'm also proud of a growing list of strategic partnerships with health care leaders that include Memorial Sloan-Kettering and the University of California and San Francisco. In addition, we continue to see notable growth in the quarter in Prescription Drug Monitoring, wellness and infectious disease franchises. We're also making progress in some of the longer term goals. We realized the promise of precision medicine and the value of our information assets. 
During Investor Day, we spoke about our new capabilities we're developing that leveraged our connectivity, solutions, and build on Quest's strong history of health care IT innovation. We're developing tools that focus on population health, as well as improving provider and patient engagement. I'd like to say a few words about each of these. First in regards to population health, our Quest analytical tools will help health plans, ACOs, health systems and care coordinators identify clinical risk, target and close gaps in care, review performance from our clinical performance scorecard tools, monitor quality metrics in query patient test information using a new self-service capability and provide on-demand access to their patient data. We've actually seen strong interest in these tools from our customers and you will hear more about them over the course of 2015.
In addition to population health tools, we're making progress delivering what we call interactive insights to providers and patients. Our interactive insights for providers deliver trending data, interactive feature such as customizable reports, and additional content, such as videos and articles specific to specific conditions and diseases. 
In the back half of 2014, we launched pilots with providers in women's health and prescription drug monitoring. And then finally, about 1.3 million patients have engaged with our new MyQuest patient application with lets them access and control their own health information. 
The value of our information assets reaches well beyond our providers and patients. A good example of this is the recent commercial expansion of our relationship with the Centers for Disease Control to improve the surveillance of Hepatitis C. This demonstrates the value of not just our data, but also our diagnostic insights in helping to manage significant public health issues. The CDC relationship builds on the mission we established just 2 years ago that speaks to the impact we can have on people's lives. Our mission is to empower better health with diagnostic insights. Our vision is an essential art of becoming more external and customer-focused and over the past 2 years, we've made tremendous progress bringing that vision to life. For more than a lab, we're a diagnostic information services company and a trusted partner.
Finally, our strategy calls for 1% to 2% growth through acquisitions. During the past year, we closed 3 acquisitions, Solstas, Steward and Summit. 
Next is our strategy for driving operational excellence. Invigorate program, delivered significant cost savings. Our original 2011 savings target was $500 million, we raised it to $600 million at our 2012 Investor Day. And I'm pleased to say we finished 2014 at more than $700 million of run rate savings. We are well underway with the plan to go to the next phase of Invigorate, which will extend our cost savings to $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. As in the past, we'll continue to update you on our progress. 
While beyond cost excellence, our efforts to drive operational excellence is always focused on quality, and building a superior costumer experience. This is a fundamental principle of quality improvement. We track actually 150 medical quality and service metrics. We continue to make progress broadly on many of those metrics. In particular, we delivered 6 Sigma quality on our specimen delivery metric. We've achieved record availability for our order entry results and reporting application called Care 360, which puts us at world class service levels. And we reduced the time it takes us to install DMR interfaces. 
We are improving service levels while also building a more efficient operation. Our progress on service levels are actually a testament to the commitment of 45,000 employees who help us deliver excellent service each and every day. They really are the Quest difference. 
As you can see, we've made strong progress restoring growth and driving operational excellence. A key driver of this has been our third strategy, building a stronger organization to improve our performance. We now have a stronger team and a more simplified organization than last year. 
The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on the core business and continue to review our portfolio and look at options for non-core assets. And we're always striving to build value for our shareholders. And finally, we remain focused on the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. We returned the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders in 2014. We just raised our dividend 15%, this is the fourth increase in 3 years, and the quarter -- in the quarter, we paid down debt and repurchased shares consistent with our commitment earlier this year. 
Now, Mark will provide you an overview of our fourth quarter financial performance and walk you through the details of our 2015 outlook, which is based upon our strengthening operational performance and improving business and betterment. Mark?"
361335,280125679,750745,"Quest Diagnostics Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Quest Diagnostics Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.9 billion increased by 7.2% compared to the prior year. On a consolidated basis, organic revenues grew by 60 basis points compared to the prior year. Our Diagnostic Information Services re",1469,"Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.9 billion increased by 7.2% compared to the prior year. On a consolidated basis, organic revenues grew by 60 basis points compared to the prior year. Our Diagnostic Information Services revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, grew by 7.1% compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 8.8% versus the prior year, while revenue per requisition was lower than the prior year at 15%. The Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, acquisitions contributed more than 7% to revenues. Acquisitions added nearly 9% to volume and reduced revenue per requisition by approximately 1.5%. Excluding acquisitions, DIS revenues, volumes and revenue per requisition fall essentially flat for the quarter. 
I would like to share some additional context on these underlying volume and revenue per requisition metrics. First, as you know, earlier this year, we took some actions and trimmed portions of our customer portfolio. Adjusting for these actions, underlying organic volume performance would've improved by approximately 1.5%. Second, related to underlying revenue per requisition, reimbursement pressure in the quarter less than 50 basis points is offset by favorable tests and business mix. 
Moving to our Diagnostic Solutions business, which includes risk assessment, clinical trials testing, health care IT and our remaining products businesses, revenues grew by 8.1% compared to the prior year with our clinical trials and risk assessment businesses driving the growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $283 million or 15% of revenues, compared to $282 million or 16.1% a year ago. The decline as a percentage of revenues can be attributed to lower initial margins from recent acquisitions and the impact of our management incentive compensation. 
As Steve mentioned, we continued to make very good progress on our Invigorate initiative and delivered more than $200 million in realized savings during 2014, achieving our goal of approximately $700 million in run rate savings as we exit the year. 
As we look forward, we have established the goal of $1.3 billion in run rate savings as we exit 2017, an additional $600 million over the $700 million we exited with in 2014. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 was 5% better than a year ago. The company adjusted out a net benefit of $27 million in the quarter. Net benefit related to a favorable resolution, tax contingencies, which was partially offset by charges primarily related to restructuring and integration costs and ongoing efforts to drive operational excellence. Net benefit contributes $0.18 per diluted share to our reported earnings of $1.26 for the fourth quarter. 
On a reported basis, operating income as a percentage of revenues is 13.7%. Last year's fourth quarter reported operating income from continuing operations was reduced by $12 million related to restructuring and integration costs. These items resulted in a reduction in reported operating income as a percentage of revenues at 0.8%, and reported EPS at $0.06. Net debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.8%, 20 basis points better than Q3 2014 and 10 basis points higher than a year ago. The DSOs were 48 days, 2 days higher than last quarter. The increase, partially attributed to the mix of business for our employee solutions, wellness and health care IT businesses, which tend to have longer payment terms. 
In the quarter, as previously mentioned, a favorable resolution of tax contingencies, along with certain R&D tax credits contributed to our lower tax rate for the year. Looking ahead to 2015, we would expect our tax rate to be more similar to the 2013 rate. Cash from operations was $303 million in the quarter compared to $210 million a year ago. In the fourth quarter of 2013, cash from operations was negatively impacted by the tax payment related to the gain on the sale of ibrutinib. Capital expenditures were $89 million in the quarter compared to $76 million a year ago. Increase in capital spending in the quarter reflects investments to support our Invigorate program, the opening of a new laboratory in Marlborough and continued investments to integrate our recent acquisitions. 
For the year, capital expenditures were $308 million, in line with our guidance of approximately $300 million. During the quarter, we continued to return value to shareholders through our dividend and our repurchase of $50 million worth of our common shares at an average price of $64.44. We also made progress on our debt repayment commitments by reducing our debt by more than $116 million in the quarter. I would now like to review a few of the considerations underpinning our 2015 guidance. Starting with revenues, we have a share that reimbursement pressure should be moderate between 2015 and 2017, based on our assumptions. We expect our reimbursement experience to be more like what we experienced in 2014 and what we saw in 2013. 
Our most recent acquisitions, Solstas, Summit and Steward, has contributed more than 7% of DIS revenues in the fourth quarter of 2014, by anniversary during the first quarter or early second quarter of 2015. 
At this point, we have not included the benefit of additional acquisitions in our guidance for 2015. If you consider expenses, we have established a goal of $600 million in additional run rate savings as we exit 2017 and we are modeling approximately $175 million in realized savings in 2015 related to Invigorate. We are estimating that onetime charges this year related to Invigorate will be in the range of approximately $95 million to $115 million. We have provided additional detail on the breakdown of these charges in our 8-K filed earlier this morning. 
We estimate up to $300 million in investments over the next 3 years. We will further develop our course of action for the program in 2016 and 2017. We will provide more detail. With respect to cycling your models, first off, while weather may be a benefit in Q1 compared to a year ago, snow in the Northeast over the past few days has negatively impacted our business. Therefore, we do not expect to see a complete rebound from last year's harsh winter. Additionally, we expect the benefit of Invigorate and acquisition synergies to build and contribute more to the bottom line as we progress through the year. As a result of these considerations, we expect to see a relatively steady growth rate quarter-by-quarter with only a slightly higher rate in EPS growth in Q1 than what you would see in Q2 through Q4. 
Lastly, as we shared at our Investor Day in November, we are moving guidance to cash EPS for adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding amortization. As described in our Investor Day, we are making this change based on feedback and interest from many investors and provide a comparable reporting presentation to many health care companies. And importantly, these changes in no way impacts the criteria we utilized to analyze potential acquisitions. That backdrop, when we frame our thought process on sending our guidance in this year of transition. Started with 2014 full year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.10. We built our guidance with a framework that would deliver approximately a 6% to 10% improvement in performance at our 2014 adjusted earnings per share figure. We then added in the anticipated impact of amortization based on our current amortization schedules. Amortization for 2015 is estimated to be slightly lower than what it was in 2014. 
Based on that math and our view of the business, we are now sharing a guidance range for adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding amortization of $4.70 to $4.85. During our strategy to acquire 1% to 2% of growth each year and a continued need to pay down some debt, you should not anticipate share buybacks beyond the level to meet our majority of our free cash flow commitment and the need to provide any dilution. We also continue to evaluate our portfolio. So should we monetize any significant assets, this could change. 
Finally, on cash from operations, please note the forecasted reduction versus 2014, despite an anticipated increase in operating income, was driven primarily by 2 factors: First, given the calendar -- the way the calendar falls out, we have an extra pay roll cycle in 2015. This additional pay roll cycle is not material to our cash liquidity. The second driver is the payout of accrued management compensation, which was depressed in 2014. Based on these considerations, we expect full year 2015 results from continuing operations before special items as follows: Revenues to increase between 2% to 3% compared to 2014; adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding amortization expense to be between $4.70 and $4.85; cash by provided operations to approximate $850 million; and capital expenditures to approximate $300 million. Now, let me turn it back to Steve."

The second one is our annual w",322,"Sure. So a couple of things, Bill. In 2014, we talked about the fact that we had 3 things that really were impacting our ability to leverage Invigorate. One was price, which was less severe than 2013, but it was still there. The second one is our annual wage inflation, and then the third piece was this management comp issue, which was hopefully a onetime year-over-year bad guy compare because of the underperformance in 2013. So when you add all those pieces up, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, they certainly were a headwind to leveraging the P&L. The other thing is we're still early in some of the acquisitions, while we've made progress. And certainly they're more profitable than when we acquired those businesses. We're not fully synergized, we still have some of that in front of us. So you're adding a fairly significant book of revenue that is not at our going operating margins and therefore, based on math, it shows some deleverage. As we laid out the plan in the Investor Day, tried to make clear that going forward, we expect that leverage. So we're doing a view that certainly, we're going to grow income faster than the top line. And that's really going to come from 3 things: one is to complete those synergies, the second thing is we return to growth. And I think you've seen we're making continued progress. And we said it's going to grow in strength over the 3 years of that horizon. So we expect more organic growth in getting up to market growth, toward the latter part and not immediately in 2015. That dropthrough will help us to leverage. And then the third piece, maybe most importantly is that Invigorate will be large enough that it will offset any pricing and wage inflation headwinds and contribute to the bottom line, which we would not be able to do in prior years."

Certainly 2012, when we look at 2012, the EPS was again, really higher than 2013, 2014. We're starting to get back to that relative level. We do have some, as I said, some headwinds this year. And again, back to that payroll cycle, again, it's the same amount of expense flowing in to the P&L, it just happens that if you cut the checks on December 31 instead of January 1, it happens to hit your operating cash flow in one year versus the next year. So that's really the anomaly that I think the story in our cash flow, both operating and free cash flow in 2015, relative to really the performance trend. So we're very focused on cash, hopefully, I think you see that. We have said that we expect cash to grow commensurate with earnings. So you know, as we move forward and get the high-single digits to potentially 10% compound earnings growth over the next several years, you should expect cash to be in that ballpark."

We'll share industry trends, and also we'll review our progress that we're making, executing on our 5-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.
We continue to make progress on our path forward, delivering solid revenue and EPS growth in the fourth quarter and the full year. In the quarter, revenues grew 7% to $1.9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 5% to $1.08 and cash from operations was strong at $303 million. For the full year 2014, revenues grew 4% to $7.4 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 2.5% to $4.10 a share, and we generated $938 million in cash. 
Our performance reflects improved execution and a stable business environment. That, combined with our ability to generate substantial and predictable cash flow has enabled us to raise our quarterly dividend, 15% to $0.38 a share. This is the fourth time we've raised the dividend since 2011. 
Before I get into our performance, I would like to talk about industry dynamics, specifically utilization, reimbursement and regulation. To start with, in utilization, we've continued to see signs of modest increase in utilization. We're encouraged by the progress on exchange enrollment as a result of the Affordable Care Act. 
During the fourth quarter, we continued to see stability in test volumes on what we're calling a same-provider basis. On reimbursement, we will see less government pressure on the clinical lab fee schedule in 2015 than we've seen in the previous 2 years. At this time, our industry is focused on effectively implementing the Doc Fix legislation, also known as Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 or PAMA, which calls for an orderly review of the clinical lab fee schedule. 
Our industry trade association, the American Clinical Lab Association, ACLA, continues to work closely with the centers for MediCare and Medicaid services on the rule-making process. We are hopeful the rule-making process will be defined in 2015. It will establish an approach to building a representative view of the market. The market view that will be used to update the fee schedule should include participants from the entire market, including large and small independent commercial labs, boutique labs as well as hospitals. The current timetable calls for data to be collected from the market participants in 2016, and any revisions to the fee schedule would therefore go in place no sooner than 2017. We'll continue to update you on the progress as we know more in the coming year. 
Another important issue facing the industry is the FDA's proposal to extend regulatory oversight to laboratory developed test. The American Clinical Lab Association is actually opposing the FDA's proposal and has engaged 2 highly respected experts in constitutional law in administrative procedure, laurence Tribe from Harvard Law School and Paul Clement, the former solicitor general of the United States. The FDA's proposal is regulatory, overreached at its worst. And it's bad for patients and the health care industry. For that reason, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and other leading health care providers have urged the FDA to withdraw its proposal. 
Now for an update on our performance. We continue to improve on our ability to execute the company's 5-point strategy. As a reminder, our strategy is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on the core Diagnostic Information Services business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. 
Let's start with our highest priority, growth, and reviewing our progress. While in 2014, we executed our strategy and restored growth. First, we improved our sales effectiveness and how we call on the market. As you've heard me say before, our go-to-market team is better led, better managed, better staffed, better trained, better equipped, better motivated, compared to 2 years ago. We are seeing continued improvement on our underlying revenue trends this year.  In the fourth quarter, organic revenues grew 60 basis points versus last year. This is the first quarter of organic revenue growth since I've joined the company in May of 2012. 
Second, our Professional Lab Services business has announced and implemented 6 new relationships in 2014, which are on track to deliver $40 million in annualized revenues. The most recent contract was finalized in the fourth quarter. 
Third, part of our improving performance is the result of our strategy to focus on esoteric testing, through our clinical franchises. We saw a sequential improvement in gene-based and esoteric testing for the third consecutive quarter. Some specific tests that are going faster are our BRCAvantage breast cancer testing, noninvasive prenatal testing and hepatitis C. I'm also proud of a growing list of strategic partnerships with health care leaders that include Memorial Sloan-Kettering and the University of California, San Francisco. 
In addition, we continue to see notable growth in the quarter in prescription drug monitoring, wellness and infectious disease franchises. We're also making progress in some of the longer term goals. We realized the promise of precision medicine and the value of our information assets. 
During Investor Day, we spoke about our new capabilities we're developing that leveraged our connectivity, solutions, and build on Quest's strong history of health care IT innovation. We're developing tools that focus on population health as well as improving provider and patient engagement. I'd like to say a few words about each of these. 
First, in regards to population health, our Quest analytical tools will help health plans, ACOs, health systems and care coordinators identify clinical risk, target and close gaps in care, review performance from our clinical performance scorecard tools, monitor quality metrics in query patient test information using a new self-service capability and provide on-demand access to their patient data. We've actually seen strong interest in these tools from our customers, and you will hear more about them over the course of 2015.
In addition to population health tools, we're making progress delivering what we call interactive insights to providers and patients. Our interactive insights for providers deliver trending data, interactive feature such as customizable reports, and additional content such as videos and articles specific -- to specific conditions and diseases. 
In the back half of 2014, we launched pilots with providers in women's health and prescription drug monitoring. And then finally, about 1.3 million patients have engaged with our new MyQuest patient application, which lets them access and control their own health information. 
The value of our information assets reaches well beyond our providers and patients. A good example of this is the recent commercial expansion of our relationship with the Centers for Disease Control to improve the surveillance of Hepatitis C. This demonstrates the value of not just our data, but also our diagnostic insights in helping to manage significant public health issues. The CDC relationship builds on the vision we established just 2 years ago that speaks to the impact we can have on people's lives. Our vision is to empower better health with diagnostic insights. Our vision is an essential part of becoming more external and customer-focused. And over the past 2 years, we've made tremendous progress bringing that vision to life. We're more than a lab. We're a diagnostic information services company and a trusted partner.
Finally, our strategy calls for 1% to 2% growth through acquisitions. During the past year, we closed 3 acquisitions, Solstas, Steward and Summit. 
Next is our strategy for driving operational excellence. Invigorate program delivered significant cost savings. Our original 2011 savings target was $500 million. We raised it to $600 million at our 2012 Investor Day. And I'm pleased to say we finished 2014 at more than $700 million of run rate savings. We are well underway with the plan to go to the next phase of Invigorate, which will extend our cost savings to $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. As in the past, we'll continue to update you on our progress. 
Well, beyond cost excellence, our efforts to drive operational excellence is always focused on quality and building a superior costumer experience. This is a fundamental principle of quality improvement. We track actually 150 medical quality and service metrics. We continue to make progress broadly on many of those metrics. In particular, we delivered 6 Sigma quality on our specimen delivery metric. We've achieved record availability for our order entry results and reporting application called Care 360, which puts us at world class service levels. And we reduced the time it takes us to install EMR interfaces. 
We are improving service levels while also building a more efficient operation. Our progress on service levels are actually a testament to the commitment of 45,000 employees who help us deliver excellent service each and every day. They really are the Quest difference. 
As you can see, we've made strong progress restoring growth and driving operational excellence. A key driver of this has been our third strategy, building a stronger organization to improve our performance. We now have a stronger team and a more simplified organization than last year. 
The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on the core business. We continue to review our portfolio and look at options for non-core assets. And we're always striving to build value for our shareholders. 
And finally, we remain focused on the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. We returned the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders in 2014. We just raised our dividend 15%, this is the fourth increase in 3 years. And the quarter -- in the quarter, we paid down debt and repurchased shares consistent with our commitment earlier this year. 
Now Mark will provide you an overview of our fourth quarter financial performance and walk you through the details of our 2015 outlook, which is based upon our strengthening operational performance and improving business and betterment. Mark?"
361335,280125679,751205,"Quest Diagnostics Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Quest Diagnostics Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.9 billion increased by 7.2% compared to the prior year. On a consolidated basis, organic revenues grew by 60 basis points compared to the prior year. Our Diagnostic Information Services re",1470,"Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.9 billion increased by 7.2% compared to the prior year. On a consolidated basis, organic revenues grew by 60 basis points compared to the prior year. Our Diagnostic Information Services revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, grew by 7.1% compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 8.8% versus the prior year, while revenue per requisition was lower than the prior year at 1.5%. The Diagnostic Information Services or DIS for short, acquisitions contributed more than 7% to revenues. Acquisitions added nearly 9% to volume and reduced revenue per requisition by approximately 1.5%. Excluding acquisitions, DIS revenues, volumes and revenue per requisition fall essentially flat for the quarter. 
I would like to share some additional context on these underlying volume and revenue per requisition metrics. First, as you know, earlier this year, we took some actions and trimmed portions of our customer portfolio. Adjusting for these actions, underlying organic volume performance would've improved by approximately 1.5%. Second, related to underlying revenue per requisition, reimbursement pressure in the quarter less than 50 basis points is offset by favorable tests and business mix. 
Moving to our Diagnostic Solutions business, which includes risk assessment, clinical trials testing, health care IT and our remaining products businesses, revenues grew by 8.1% compared to the prior year, with our clinical trials and risk assessment businesses driving the growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $283 million or 15% of revenues compared to $282 million or 16.1% a year ago. The decline as a percentage of revenues can be attributed to lower initial margins from recent acquisitions and the impact of our management incentive compensation. 
As Steve mentioned, we continued to make very good progress on our Invigorate initiative and delivered more than $200 million in realized savings during 2014, achieving our goal of approximately $700 million in run rate savings as we exit the year. As we look forward, we have established the goal of $1.3 billion in run rate savings as we exit 2017, an additional $600 million over the $700 million we exited with in 2014. 
In the quarter, adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 was 5% better than a year ago. The company adjusted out a net benefit of $27 million in the quarter. Net benefit related to a favorable resolution, tax contingencies, which was partially offset by charges primarily related to restructuring and integration costs and ongoing efforts to drive operational excellence. Net benefit contributes $0.18 per diluted share to our reported earnings of $1.26 for the fourth quarter. 
On a reported basis, operating income as a percentage of revenues is 13.7%. Last year's fourth quarter reported operating income from continuing operations was reduced by $12 million related to restructuring and integration costs. These items resulted in a reduction in reported operating income as a percentage of revenues at 0.8% and reported EPS at $0.06. 
Net debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.8%, 20 basis points better than Q3 2014 but 10 basis points higher than a year ago. 
The DSOs were 48 days, 2 days higher than last quarter with the increase partially attributed to the mix of business for our employee solutions, wellness and health care IT businesses, which tend to have longer payment terms. 
In the quarter, as previously mentioned, a favorable resolution of tax contingencies, along with certain R&D tax credits, contributed to our lower tax rate for the year. Looking ahead to 2015, we would expect our tax rate to be more similar to the 2013 rate. 
Cash from operations was $303 million in the quarter compared to $210 million a year ago. In the fourth quarter of 2013, cash from operations was negatively impacted by the tax payment related to the gain on the sale of ibrutinib. 
Capital expenditures were $89 million in the quarter compared to $76 million a year ago. Increase in capital spending in the quarter reflects investments to support our Invigorate program, the opening of a new laboratory in Marlborough and continued investments to integrate our recent acquisitions. For the year, capital expenditures were $308 million, in line with our guidance of approximately $300 million. 
During the quarter, we continued to return value to shareholders through our dividend and our repurchase of $50 million worth of our common shares at an average price of $64.44. We also made progress on our debt repayment commitments by reducing our debt by more than $116 million in the quarter. 
I would now like to review a few of the considerations underpinning our 2015 guidance. Starting with revenues, we have shared that reimbursement pressure should be moderate between 2015 and 2017 based on our assumptions. We expect our reimbursement experience to be more like what we experienced in 2014 and what we saw in 2013. 
Our most recent acquisitions, Solstas, Summit and Steward, has contributed more than 7% of DIS revenues in the fourth quarter of 2014 by anniversary during the first quarter or early second quarter of 2015. At this point, we have not included the benefit of additional acquisitions in our guidance for 2015. 
If you consider expenses, we have established a goal of $600 million in additional run rate savings as we exit 2017, and we are modeling approximately $175 million in realized savings in 2015 related to Invigorate. We are estimating that onetime charges this year related to Invigorate will be in the range of approximately $95 million to $115 million. We have provided additional detail on the breakdown of these charges in our 8-K filed earlier this morning. 
We estimate up to $300 million in investments over the next 3 years. When we further develop our course of action for the program in 2016 and 2017, we will provide more detail. 
With respect to cycling your models, first off, while weather may be a benefit in Q1 compared to a year ago, snow in the Northeast over the past few days has negatively impacted our business. Therefore, we do not expect to see a complete rebound from last year's harsh winter. Additionally, we expect the benefit of Invigorate and acquisition synergies to build and contribute more to the bottom line as we progress through the year. As a result of these considerations, we expect to see a relatively steady growth rate quarter-by-quarter, with only a slightly higher rate in EPS growth in Q1 than what you would see in Q2 through Q4. 
Lastly, as we shared at our Investor Day in November, we are moving guidance to cash EPS for adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding amortization. As described at our Investor Day, we are making this change based on feedback and interest from many investors to provide a comparable reporting presentation to many health care companies. And importantly, these changes in no way impacts the criteria we utilized to analyze potential acquisitions. 
With that backdrop, let me frame our thought process on sending our guidance in this year of transition. Started with 2014 full year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.10, we built our guidance with a framework that would deliver approximately a 6% to 10% improvement in performance at our 2014 adjusted earnings per share figure. We then added in the anticipated impact of amortization based on our current amortization schedules. Amortization for 2015 is estimated to be slightly lower than what it was in 2014. 
Based on that math and our view of the business, we are now sharing a guidance range for adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding amortization, of $4.70 to $4.85. Given our strategy to acquire 1% to 2% in growth each year and a continued need to pay down some debt, you should not anticipate share buybacks beyond the level to meet our majority of our free cash flow commitment and the need to prevent any dilution. We also continue to evaluate our portfolio, so should we monetize any significant assets, this could change. 
Finally, on cash from operations, please note the forecasted reduction versus 2014, despite an anticipated increase in operating income, is driven primarily by 2 factors. First, given the calendar -- the way the calendar falls out, we have an extra pay roll cycle in 2015. This additional pay roll cycle is not material to our cash liquidity. The second driver is the payout of accrued management compensation, which was depressed in 2014. Based on these considerations, we expect full year 2015 results from continuing operations before special items as follows: Revenues to increase between 2% to 3% compared to 2014; adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding amortization expense, to be between $4.70 and $4.85; cash provided by operations to approximate $850 million; and capital expenditures to approximate $300 million. 
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

We've also shared in the fall that we said back 2 years ago, what we will do is show gradual improvement in our organic revenues. We needed to first stop to decline, we needed to flatten out. And what you've seen in the back half is that actually we do believe we have underlying organic growth. In this quarter, we actually did show organic revenue growth. So we are progressing where there are improvement, step-by-step. We need to next grow with the market and then finally start growing faster than the market by gaining share.

The second one is our annua",328,"Sure. So a couple of things, Bill. In 2014, we talked about the fact that we had seen things that really were impacting our ability to leverage Invigorate. One was price, which was less severe than 2013, but it was still there. The second one is our annual wage inflation. And then the third piece was this management comp issue, which was really, hopefully, a onetime year-over-year bad guy compare because of the underperformance in 2013. So when you add all those pieces up, as we -- I mentioned in the prepared remarks, those certainly were a headwind to leveraging the P&L. The other thing is that we are still early in some of the acquisitions, while we've made progress. And certainly, they're more profitable than when we acquired those businesses. We're not fully synergized, we still have some of that in front of us. So you're adding a fairly significant book of revenue that is not at our going operating margins and therefore, based on math, it shows some deleverage. As we laid out the plan in the Investor Day, we tried to make clear that going forward, we expect that leverage. So we're doing a view that certainly, we're going to grow income faster than the top line. And that's really going to come from 3 things. One is to complete those synergies. The second thing is we return the growth. And I think you've seen we're making continued progress. And we said it's going to grow in strength over the 3 years of that horizon. So we expect more organic growth in getting up to market growth toward the latter part and not immediately in 2015. That drop through will help us to leverage. And then the third piece, maybe most importantly, is that Invigorate will be large enough that it will offset any pricing and wage inflation headwinds and contribute to the bottom line, which we've not been able to do in prior years."

And so instead of $0.40, which it was in 2014, it's actually $0.36 in 2015, the amortization that we're adjusting out."

What we're doing is we're trying to work through this rule-making process with them. And if you think about gathering all the data that they need to gather to get a real thorough reflection of the market, it's very complex. So you're dealing with all the independent commercial labs, big and small. You're dealing with all the contracts we all have with our commercial payers. And then you're dealing with all the different diagnostic tests that we have. And then also you're dealing with hospitals. And so part of this is trying to understand how they're going to require they're reporting for a representative view of the market. It was always in the intention of the bill. It's in the bill that hospitals are part of the market. Therefore, they need to report. And what they're working through is how they're going to be able to accomplish what was intended by the bill from Congress. And that's what they're working through. With anything, it just takes time. We haven't seen where they are with it, we continued the dialogue. So as we said in our remarks, we're hopeful that we'll see other rules in 2015 as we should so we can collect the data in 2016. And we shouldn't see an adjustment to the clinical lab fee schedule sooner than 2017. And that's still the timetable we're working with, and we're doing everything we can to help them to make sure they do realize that they will get a market representative view, including all participants of the markets -- the market, including hospitals."

As far as is there more interest or less interest, I won't comment on that. I would just say it's consistent with what we've seen so far, but health care in general is going to consolidate.

In the specialist areas, most of the specialist and some specialist areas are already working for integrated deliveries services or integrated delivery networks like cardiologists.

We'll share industry trends, and also we'll review our progress that we're making, executing on our 5-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.
We continue to make progress on our path forward, delivering solid revenue and EPS growth in the fourth quarter and the full year. In the quarter, revenues grew 7% to $1.9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 5% to $1.08 and cash from operations was strong at $303 million. For the full year 2014, revenues grew 4% to $7.4 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 2.5% to $4.10 a share, and we generated $938 million in cash. 
Our performance reflects improved execution and a stable business environment. That, combined with our ability to generate substantial and predictable cash flow has enabled us to raise our quarterly dividend, 15% to $0.38 a share. This is the fourth time we've raised the dividend since 2011. 
Before I get into our performance, I would like to talk about industry dynamics, specifically utilization, reimbursement and regulation. To start with, in utilization, we've continued to see signs of modest increase in utilization. We're encouraged by the progress on exchange enrollment as a result of the Affordable Care Act. 
During the fourth quarter, we continued to see stability in test volumes on what we're calling a same-provider basis. On reimbursement, we will see less government pressure on the clinical lab fee schedule in 2015 than we've seen in the previous 2 years. At this time, our industry is focused on effectively implementing the Doc Fix legislation, also known as Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 or PAMA, which calls for an orderly review of the clinical lab fee schedule. 
Our industry trade association, the American Clinical Lab Association, ACLA, continues to work closely with the centers for MediCare and Medicaid services on the rule-making process. We are hopeful the rule-making process will be defined in 2015. It will establish an approach to building a representative view of the market. The market view that will be used to update the fee schedule should include participants from the entire market, including large and small independent commercial labs, boutique labs as well as hospitals. The current timetable calls for data to be collected from the market participants in 2016, and any revisions to the fee schedule would therefore go in place no sooner than 2017. We'll continue to update you on the progress as we know more in the coming year. 
Another important issue facing the industry is the FDA's proposal to extend regulatory oversight to laboratory developed test. The American Clinical Lab Association is actively opposing the FDA's proposal and has engaged 2 highly respected experts in constitutional law in administrative procedure, Laurence Tribe from Harvard Law School and Paul Clement, the former solicitor general of the United States. The FDA's proposal is regulatory, overreach at its worst. And it's bad for patients and the health care industry. For that reason, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and other leading health care providers have urged the FDA to withdraw its proposal. 
Now for an update on our performance. We continue to improve on our ability to execute the company's 5-point strategy. As a reminder, our strategy is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on the core Diagnostic Information Services business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. 
Let's start with our highest priority, growth, and reviewing our progress. While in 2014, we executed our strategy and restored growth. First, we improved our sales effectiveness and how we call on the market. As you've heard me say before, our go-to-market team is better led, better managed, better staffed, better trained, better equipped, better motivated, compared to 2 years ago. We are seeing continued improvement on our underlying revenue trends this year.  In the fourth quarter, organic revenues grew 60 basis points versus last year. This is the first quarter of organic revenue growth since I've joined the company in May of 2012. 
Second, our Professional Lab Services business has announced and implemented 6 new relationships in 2014, which are on track to deliver $40 million in annualized revenues. The most recent contract was finalized in the fourth quarter. 
Third, part of our improving performance is the result of our strategy to focus on esoteric testing, through our clinical franchises. We saw a sequential improvement in gene-based and esoteric testing for the third consecutive quarter. Some specific tests that are going faster are our BRCAvantage breast cancer testing, noninvasive prenatal testing and hepatitis C. I'm also proud of a growing list of strategic partnerships with health care leaders that include Memorial Sloan-Kettering and the University of California, San Francisco. 
In addition, we continue to see notable growth in the quarter in prescription drug monitoring, wellness and infectious disease franchises. We're also making progress in some of the longer term goals. We realized the promise of precision medicine and the value of our information assets. 
During Investor Day, we spoke about our new capabilities we're developing that leveraged our connectivity, solutions, and build on Quest's strong history of health care IT innovation. We're developing tools that focus on population health as well as improving provider and patient engagement. I'd like to say a few words about each of these. 
First, in regards to population health, our Quest analytical tools will help health plans, ACOs, health systems and care coordinators identify clinical risk, target and close gaps in care, review performance from our clinical performance scorecard tools, monitor quality metrics in query patient test information using a new self-service capability and provide on-demand access to their patient data. We've actually seen strong interest in these tools from our customers, and you will hear more about them over the course of 2015.
In addition to population health tools, we're making progress delivering what we call interactive insights to providers and patients. Our interactive insights for providers deliver trending data, interactive feature such as customizable reports, and additional content such as videos and articles specific -- to specific conditions and diseases. 
In the back half of 2014, we launched pilots with providers in women's health and prescription drug monitoring. And then finally, about 1.3 million patients have engaged with our new MyQuest patient application, which lets them access and control their own health information. 
The value of our information assets reaches well beyond our providers and patients. A good example of this is the recent commercial expansion of our relationship with the Centers for Disease Control to improve the surveillance of Hepatitis C. This demonstrates the value of not just our data, but also our diagnostic insights in helping to manage significant public health issues. The CDC relationship builds on the vision we established just 2 years ago that speaks to the impact we can have on people's lives. Our vision is to empower better health with diagnostic insights. Our vision is an essential part of becoming more external and customer-focused. And over the past 2 years, we've made tremendous progress bringing that vision to life. We're more than a lab. We're a diagnostic information services company and a trusted partner.
Finally, our strategy calls for 1% to 2% growth through acquisitions. During the past year, we closed 3 acquisitions, Solstas, Steward and Summit. 
Next is our strategy for driving operational excellence. Invigorate program delivered significant cost savings. Our original 2011 savings target was $500 million. We raised it to $600 million at our 2012 Investor Day. And I'm pleased to say we finished 2014 at more than $700 million of run rate savings. We are well underway with the planning of the next phase of Invigorate, which will extend our cost savings to $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. As in the past, we'll continue to update you on our progress. 
Well, beyond cost excellence, our efforts to drive operational excellence has always focused on quality and building a superior costumer experience. This is a fundamental principle of quality improvement. We track actually 150 medical quality and service metrics. We continue to make progress broadly on many of those metrics. In particular, we delivered 6 Sigma quality on our specimen delivery metric. We've achieved record availability for our order entry results and reporting application called Care 360, which puts us at world class service levels. And we reduced the time it takes us to install EMR interfaces. 
We are improving service levels while also building a more efficient operation. Our progress on service levels are actually a testament to the commitment of 45,000 employees who help us deliver excellent service each and every day. They really are the Quest difference. 
As you can see, we've made strong progress restoring growth and driving operational excellence. A key driver of this has been our third strategy, building a stronger organization to improve our performance. We now have a stronger team and a more simplified organization than last year. 
The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on the core business. We continue to review our portfolio and look at options for non-core assets. And we're always striving to build value for our shareholders. 
And finally, we remain focused on the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. We returned the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders in 2014. We just raised our dividend 15%, this is the fourth increase in 3 years. And the quarter -- in the quarter, we paid down debt and repurchased shares consistent with our commitment earlier this year. 
Now Mark will provide you an overview of our fourth quarter financial performance and walk you through the details of our 2015 outlook, which is based upon our strengthening operational performance and improving business and betterment. Mark?"
361335,280125679,751399,"Quest Diagnostics Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Quest Diagnostics Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.9 billion increased by 7.2% compared to the prior year. On a consolidated basis, organic revenues grew by 60 basis points compared to the prior year. Our Diagnostic Information Services re",1470,"Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.9 billion increased by 7.2% compared to the prior year. On a consolidated basis, organic revenues grew by 60 basis points compared to the prior year. Our Diagnostic Information Services revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, grew by 7.1% compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 8.8% versus the prior year, while revenue per requisition was lower than the prior year at 1.5%. The Diagnostic Information Services or DIS for short, acquisitions contributed more than 7% to revenues. Acquisitions added nearly 9% to volume and reduced revenue per requisition by approximately 1.5%. Excluding acquisitions, DIS revenues, volumes and revenue per requisition fall essentially flat for the quarter. 
I would like to share some additional context on these underlying volume and revenue per requisition metrics. First, as you know, earlier this year, we took some actions and trimmed portions of our customer portfolio. Adjusting for these actions, underlying organic volume performance would've improved by approximately 1.5%. Second, related to underlying revenue per requisition, reimbursement pressure in the quarter less than 50 basis points is offset by favorable tests and business mix. 
Moving to our Diagnostic Solutions business, which includes risk assessment, clinical trials testing, health care IT and our remaining products businesses, revenues grew by 8.1% compared to the prior year, with our clinical trials and risk assessment businesses driving the growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $283 million or 15% of revenues compared to $282 million or 16.1% a year ago. The decline as a percentage of revenues can be attributed to lower initial margins from recent acquisitions and the impact of our management incentive compensation. 
As Steve mentioned, we continued to make very good progress on our Invigorate initiative and delivered more than $200 million in realized savings during 2014, achieving our goal of approximately $700 million in run rate savings as we exit the year. As we look forward, we have established the goal of $1.3 billion in run rate savings as we exit 2017, an additional $600 million over the $700 million we exited with in 2014. 
In the quarter, adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 was 5% better than a year ago. The company adjusted out a net benefit of $27 million in the quarter. Net benefit related to a favorable resolution, tax contingencies, which was partially offset by charges primarily related to restructuring and integration costs and ongoing efforts to drive operational excellence. Net benefit contributes $0.18 per diluted share to our reported earnings of $1.26 for the fourth quarter. 
On a reported basis, operating income as a percentage of revenues is 13.7%. Last year's fourth quarter reported operating income from continuing operations was reduced by $12 million related to restructuring and integration costs. These items resulted in a reduction in reported operating income as a percentage of revenues at 0.8% and reported EPS at $0.06. 
Net debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.8%, 20 basis points better than Q3 2014 but 10 basis points higher than a year ago. 
The DSOs were 48 days, 2 days higher than last quarter with the increase partially attributed to the mix of business for our employee solutions, wellness and health care IT businesses, which tend to have longer payment terms. 
In the quarter, as previously mentioned, a favorable resolution of tax contingencies, along with certain R&D tax credits, contributed to our lower tax rate for the year. Looking ahead to 2015, we would expect our tax rate to be more similar to the 2013 rate. 
Cash from operations was $303 million in the quarter compared to $210 million a year ago. In the fourth quarter of 2013, cash from operations was negatively impacted by the tax payment related to the gain on the sale of ibrutinib. 
Capital expenditures were $89 million in the quarter compared to $76 million a year ago. Increase in capital spending in the quarter reflects investments to support our Invigorate program, the opening of a new laboratory in Marlborough and continued investments to integrate our recent acquisitions. For the year, capital expenditures were $308 million, in line with our guidance of approximately $300 million. 
During the quarter, we continued to return value to shareholders through our dividend and our repurchase of $50 million worth of our common shares at an average price of $64.44. We also made progress on our debt repayment commitments by reducing our debt by more than $116 million in the quarter. 
I would now like to review a few of the considerations underpinning our 2015 guidance. Starting with revenues, we have shared that reimbursement pressure should be moderate between 2015 and 2017 based on our assumptions. We expect our reimbursement experience to be more like what we experienced in 2014 than what we saw in 2013. 
Our most recent acquisitions, Solstas, Summit and Steward, has contributed more than 7% of DIS revenues in the fourth quarter of 2014 by anniversary during the first quarter or early second quarter of 2015. At this point, we have not included the benefit of additional acquisitions in our guidance for 2015. 
If you consider expenses, we have established a goal of $600 million in additional run rate savings as we exit 2017, and we are modeling approximately $175 million in realized savings in 2015 related to Invigorate. We are estimating that onetime charges this year related to Invigorate will be in the range of approximately $95 million to $115 million. We have provided additional detail on the breakdown of these charges in our 8-K filed earlier this morning. 
We estimate up to $300 million in investments over the next 3 years. When we further develop our course of action for the program in 2016 and 2017, we will provide more detail. 
With respect to cycling your models, first off, while weather may be a benefit in Q1 compared to a year ago, snow in the Northeast over the past few days has negatively impacted our business. Therefore, we do not expect to see a complete rebound from last year's harsh winter. Additionally, we expect the benefit of Invigorate and acquisition synergies to build and contribute more to the bottom line as we progress through the year. As a result of these considerations, we expect to see a relatively steady growth rate quarter-by-quarter, with only a slightly higher rate in EPS growth in Q1 than what you would see in Q2 through Q4. 
Lastly, as we shared at our Investor Day in November, we are moving guidance to cash EPS for adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding amortization. As described at our Investor Day, we are making this change based on feedback and interest from many investors to provide a comparable reporting presentation to many health care companies. And importantly, these changes in no way impacts the criteria we utilized to analyze potential acquisitions. 
With that backdrop, let me frame our thought process on sending our guidance in this year of transition. Started with 2014 full year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.10, we built our guidance with a framework that would deliver approximately a 6% to 10% improvement in performance at our 2014 adjusted earnings per share figure. We then added in the anticipated impact of amortization based on our current amortization schedules. Amortization for 2015 is estimated to be slightly lower than what it was in 2014. 
Based on that math and our view of the business, we are now sharing a guidance range for adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding amortization, of $4.70 to $4.85. Given our strategy to acquire 1% to 2% in growth each year and a continued need to pay down some debt, you should not anticipate share buybacks beyond the level to meet our majority of our free cash flow commitment and the need to prevent any dilution. We also continue to evaluate our portfolio, so should we monetize any significant assets, this could change. 
Finally, on cash from operations, please note the forecasted reduction versus 2014, despite an anticipated increase in operating income, is driven primarily by 2 factors. First, given the calendar -- the way the calendar falls out, we have an extra pay roll cycle in 2015. This additional pay roll cycle is not material to our cash liquidity. The second driver is the payout of accrued management compensation, which was depressed in 2014. Based on these considerations, we expect full year 2015 results from continuing operations before special items as follows: Revenues to increase between 2% to 3% compared to 2014; adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding amortization expense, to be between $4.70 and $4.85; cash provided by operations to approximate $850 million; and capital expenditures to approximate $300 million. 
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

We've also considered the advancements of what we do has also provided some growth in the marketplace. So that's where we believe our growth to be. We've also shared in the fall that we said back 2 years ago, what we will do is show gradual improvement in our organic revenues. We needed to first stop to decline, we needed to flatten out. And what you've seen in the back half is that actually we do believe we have underlying organic growth. In this quarter, we actually did show organic revenue growth. So we are progressing where there are improvement, step-by-step. We need to next grow with the market and then finally start growing faster than the market by gaining share.

The second one is our annua",328,"Sure. So a couple of things, Bill. In 2014, we talked about the fact that we had seen things that really were impacting our ability to leverage Invigorate. One was price, which was less severe than 2013, but it was still there. The second one is our annual wage inflation. And then the third piece was this management comp issue, which was really, hopefully, a onetime year-over-year bad guy compare because of the underperformance in 2013. So when you add all those pieces up, as we -- I mentioned in the prepared remarks, those certainly were a headwind to leveraging the P&L. The other thing is that we are still early in some of the acquisitions, while we've made progress. And certainly, they're more profitable than when we acquired those businesses. We're not fully synergized, we still have some of that in front of us. So you're adding a fairly significant book of revenue that is not at our going operating margins and therefore, based on math, it shows some deleverage. As we laid out the plan in the Investor Day, we tried to make clear that going forward, we expect that leverage. So we're doing a view that certainly, we're going to grow income faster than the top line. And that's really going to come from 3 things. One is to complete those synergies. The second thing is we return the growth. And I think you've seen we're making continued progress. And we said it's going to grow in strength over the 3 years of that horizon. So we expect more organic growth in getting up to market growth toward the latter part and not immediately in 2015. That drop through will help us to leverage. And then the third piece, maybe most importantly, is that Invigorate will be large enough that it will offset any pricing and wage inflation headwinds and contribute to the bottom line, which we've not been able to do in prior years."

Given the M&A we executed last year, we did take on some significant debt and we've been paying down that debt. So really, this comment is more of a short term. The guidance that we're giving, it includes a flat share count. At the Investor Day, I -- just for simplicity's sake, I gave you earnings growth without share reductions. That does not imply that going forward, there couldn't potentially be buybacks to reduce our shares outstanding, but it was really just to make it a little clearer in terms of what we were suggesting.

We'll share industry trends and also review progress we are making executing our 5-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.
Before we get into our performance, I want to highlight the joint venture we announced last month with Quintiles in medical trials testing. Together, our 2 companies will create a new business that will be one of the leading global providers of central laboratory services to support drug development through clinical trials. The creation of a joint venture allows Quest and Quintiles to bring together the complementary capabilities and scale of our 2 organizations in an agile way, with a laser-like focus on serving customers. The new company will enable biopharmaceutical customers to enhance their drug development process, support precision medicines through companion diagnostics and biomarker discovery and build value by creating more efficient, effective organization through leveraging the scale, scientific expertise and operational excellence of the parent organizations. We expect that over time, the JV will have an accelerated growth rate, achieve cost synergies and to be accretive to what our clinical trials testing business would have been on a stand-alone basis.
The JV structure addresses 3 of our 5 strategic points. First, it will help us accelerate growth in the near term for our clinical trials business and explore opportunities related to our longer-term strategies on precision medicine, companion diagnostics and creating value from our data. Second, it enables us to refocus on our core diagnostic information services business without distraction. And third, with minimal capital, it enables us to participate in expected synergies in a way that lets us deliver disciplined capital deployment. Mark will provide some more color later on this exciting partnership. Now both entities will continue to operate separately until the closing of the transaction, which is anticipated to be no later than the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to our first quarter results. We continue to make progress on our path forward, delivering solid revenue, EPS and operating income growth. Revenues grew 5.3%, $1.84 billion, on an organic basis. Consolidated revenues grew almost 1%. Adjusted cash EPS increased 13% to $1.05 and adjusted operating income increased 14%. Our performance reflects improved execution in a stable business environment. And we are able to grow despite a harsh winter, while somewhat less severe than a year ago, was particularly difficult in the northeast portion of the United States where we have a strong presence.
Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to talk about industry dynamics for utilization, reimbursement and regulation. In the first quarter, we continued to see stability in test volumes on a same-provider basis. We're encouraged by the process of adding more insured lives to the health care system as a result of the Affordable Care Act. More states have been expanding their Medicaid programs, including Pennsylvania, during the quarter. And we continue to see growth in our Medicaid volumes. Medicaid expansion will bring new people into the health care system with the goal of identifying issues earlier to improve outcomes and reduce overall cost. We actually saw this ourselves in our recent Quest Diagnostics Health Trend Study. This peer-reviewed publication in diabetes care found a significant double-digit increase in diabetes diagnosis in states that expanded Medicaid coverage and no increase in states that did not. Our reimbursement, we see less government pressure on the clinical FD schedule in 2015 than we have seen in the previous 2 years.
I'll start where the doc fix. Last week, the president signed a historic legislation titled ""The Medicare Access and Chip Reauthorization Act"" to permanently reform the Medicare physician payment methodology. We are pleased that cuts to laboratory payments under Medicare were not included as part of the package. This legislation also encourages payments based upon quality and encourage us to make the health care system smarter without denying access. This legislation was also directionally aligned with the HAS goals announced in January to tie traditional Medicare payments to quality or value through alternative payment models. Both the legislation and HAS have outlined specific, measurable goals and time lines or these value-based reimbursement models. We believe these emerging payment models will favor providers with scale that are more effective and efficient, like us.
Next, I'd like to provide a status update on the protecting access to Medicare Act of 2014 or PAMA. Let's call for an orderly review of the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. Our industry continues to work constructively with CMSN, effectively implementing PAMA legislation. Just a few weeks ago, I'd met with leaders at CMS and a delegation from our industry trade association to discuss the rulemaking process that will govern any reimbursement changes. During that meeting, we've reviewed our view of the industry and its participants. We also discussed our shared goal of delivering an accurate, complete and efficient data collection process. We remain hopeful the rulemaking process will be defined in 2015 and will establish an approach to building a representative view of the market.
As this industry continues to evolve and mature, we have the right strategy and team and are well positioned to continue to lead. We continue to execute the company's 5-point strategy. As a reminder, our strategy is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplified new organization, refocus on the core diagnostic information services business and deliver excellent capital deployment.
Now what I'd like to do is to share a few comments on each of the elements of the strategy. Well, this was the second consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth on a consolidated basis. We continue to focus on our core growth opportunities. First, we continued to focus on sales effectiveness. Second, we are getting traction on the professional laboratory services agreements we signed last year. And third, being based esoteric testing services revenue grew in the quarter at a faster rate in more than a year. We continue to grow BRCA revenues, which clearly benefited from Angelina Jolie's ongoing public advocacy. In one way, we are differentiating ourselves by advocating for open access to BRCA data for patients and clinicians. In collaboration with the French Research Consortium, Inserm, we led the creation of BRCA Share, an open data share initiative. Its goal is to accelerate research on BRCA and gene mutations, particularly variants of uncertain significance, improve the ability to predict which individuals are at risk of developing inherited breast, ovarian and other cancers. The Insert collaboration is an example of how we're using our unmatched data and information assets to deliver insights to our customers that demonstrate the value that Quest provides.
Last quarter, we told you about some new population health data analytics decision support tools we're developing. We have been piloting our population health tools with several physicians, ACOs and health plans to evaluate these states for their patient populations, monitor compliance with specific testing protocols and identify gaps in care. In this pilot, our customers are now engaging with patients and health care professionals proactively, encourage the appropriate use of screening and monitoring test to drive better health. In addition to population health tools, we're making progress to delivering on what we call Interactive Insights to providers and patients. Our Interactive Insights offer providers trend data interactive features, such as customizable reports and additional content, such as videos and articles specific to conditions and diseases. Intellicast Analytics is a web-based, secure portal that provides hospitals integrated delivery networks and physicians practices with data-driven insights about test utilization patterns so they can adhere to clinically appropriate testing norms. Care360 revenue management helps customers manage denials of billing claims with a focus on improving patient and payer collections.
In November 2012, we established a new vision that spoke to the impact we have on people's lives. Our vision is empowering better health with diagnostic insights. Our vision was on the central part of becoming more external and customer-focused. Since then, we've made tremendous progress bringing the vision to life. Well, we're not just a lab. We're more than a lab. We are a trusted partner, and we provide deep clinical insights. Our vision was the first step. Next, we've needed to turn it into a compelling customer-facing brand, a simple, consistent way to talk about Quest. Who we are, the value we bring. In short, what is the Quest difference? Our new core brand idea is a powerful one. It is action from insight. Our brand strategy is based on 3 pillars. The idea that we inspire action, the work we do, that we have answers for patients and health care providers and that we advocate better health for patients and communities. This is a powerful idea the notion that from data comes insight, from insight comes action. Action that transforms lives.
As you can tell, I'm excited about what our new corporate positioning means for Quest. It translates our vision into a concise, clear and actual brand and gives us an opportunity to reshape our place in the industry, allowing us to continue to differentiate ourselves and not compete solely on price. Brand is more than a logo or a tagline. Bringing our brand to life, we have to change the way we think and talk -- of what we do. Additionally, we're engaging all of our 45,000 people with their direct impact on delivering this brand promise. You'll start to see the new brand in action in the coming weeks and months.
X is our strategy for broad driving operational excellence. We are well underway with planning the next phase of Invigorate, which will extend our cost savings to $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. As in the past, we continue to update you on the progress as we go.
The third element of our strategy is to simplify and strengthen our organization. We've been focusing on execution and building a performance-oriented culture. We're very pleased to be included recently as one of Fortune Magazine's, World's Most Admired Companies. Over the past year, we've reduced the number of management tools as part of the Quest Management System. We're rolling out a new leadership development initiative this month. And as I visited more than a dozen of our major facilities in conjunction with the new brand rollout, I found that employees in all levels to be highly engaged and excited about the challenges ahead.
The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our core diagnostic information services business. We continued to make good progress, and the joint venture with Quintiles is the most recent example of doing this. After considering a broad range of options for our clinical trials business, we found the joint venture was the best option to enable us to focus on the core, while unlocking the value of this important business. We'll continue to review our portfolio and look at options for noncore assets, and we always strive to build value for our shareholders.
And then finally, we remain focused on the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. During April, we completed the refinancing of more than $1.2 billion of our debt that will lower interest rates for years to come. We paid our dividends at the increased rate. And as noted earlier, we think the joint venture with Quintiles will enable us to share in our future value creation without requiring significant capital outlays.
Now Mark will provide an overview on the first quarter financial performance, walk you through the details of 2015 outlook, which is based on our strength in the operational performance and the improving business environment. Mark?"

Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.84 billion increased by 5.3% versus the prior year. It grew organically by 70 basis points. Revenues for diagnostic information services, or DIS for short, [indiscernible] 4.9% compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 5.6% versus the prior year. Our revenue per requisition was lower than the prior year by 0.7%. For DIS, acquisitions contributed nearly 5% to revenues. Excluding acquisitions, DIS revenues volumes and revenue per requisition were all essentially flat for the quarter.
We'd like to share some additional context on these underlying volume and revenue per requisition metrics. First, let me touch on the impact of the harsh winter. As we have shared in the past, our analysis is based on changes in volume versus trend for geographies related to specific weather events. Additionally, we provide guidance based on historical weather patterns. The past 2 years, we've experienced unusually severe winters. However, in 2012, we had a mild winter, which resulted in upside to our expectations. This year, volumes were negatively impacted in the quarter by a harsh winter throughout much of the country, in particular the Northeast. While the impact was not as severe as a year ago, it was worse than we anticipated. We believe the impact of weather on the quarter was approximately $0.08 of EPS. As a result, we are pleased with the quarter, and we are planning -- but we were planning on better performance.
Turning to underlying revenue per requisition. We saw modest reimbursement pressure in the quarter, was in line with our expectations. That reimbursement pressure was offset by favorable tax and business mixed shifts.
Moving to our diagnostics solutions business, which includes risk assessment, clinical trials testing, health care IT and the remaining products businesses, revenues grew by 11% compared to the prior year, enjoyed strong growth during the quarter from our clinical trials products and risk assessment businesses.
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $269 million, or 14.6% of revenues, compared to $236 million or 13.5% of revenues a year ago. The comparable volumes are essentially flat. Improvement can be primarily attributed to the benefits of our business mix, Invigorate program and M&A-related impacts including synergies. These factors enabled us to improve gross margins and further leverage SG&A. As a result, our adjusted operating income and earnings grew faster than revenues. For the quarter, adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $1.05, 13% better than a year ago. Amortization was $0.09 in both 2014 and 2015. The company recorded after-tax charges totaling $80 million in the quarter, primarily associated with the debt refinanced in the first quarter. The charge also included restructuring and integration cost associated with our Invigorate program and recent acquisitions and combined to reduce reported EPS by $0.54. Last year's first quarter included after-tax charges of $18 million, primarily associated with restructuring and integration charges, which reduced reported EPS by $0.13.
Let me share a few comments on special items. As we think about special items, because of their nature, they do fluctuate from period to period. This quarter, we incurred a charge related to the first tranche of debt retire. Second tranche of debt was redeem in April, which will result in a similar charge in the second quarter. We expect to incur total pretax charges of nearly $150 million related to our debt refinancing. In addition to charges, our special items also include benefits. For example, we anticipate recognizing a gain related to the joint venture with Quintiles at the time of closing. This gain will occur when we contribute our Clinical Trials business into the joint venture, which is expected to take place no later than the third quarter. This gain is expected to be of similar magnitude to the total charges associated with the debt retirement. We will adjust this onetime gain out of our earnings.
To put this in perspective, since the beginning of 2012, the benefits adjusted out of earnings had been approximately the same amount as the charges adjusted out of earnings.
Net debt expense, as a percentage of revenues, was 4.3%, flat to a year ago. As a reminder, net debt expense is typically highest in the first quarter due to increased patient responsibility associated with coinsurance and deductible requirements. Our DSOs were 45 days, 3 days lower than last quarter and 4 days lower than a year ago. This is a testament to our operational excellence continuously demonstrated by our billing, operations and patient service centers teams that continued to effectively engage with patients and payers, ensuring that we get paid for the work we do.
Cash provided by operations was $52 million in the quarter. However, excluding the $78 million of cash charges associated with the retirement of debt, cash provided by operations would've been $130 million in the quarter versus $84 million a year ago. Capital expenditures were $56 million in the quarter compared to $68 million a year ago.
Moving to guidance. We expect full year 2015 results from continuing operations before special items as follows: Revenues to increase between 2% to 3% compared to 2014. Adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization expense, to be between $4.70 and $4.85. Adjusted cash provided by operations is approximately $850 million, and capital expenditures to approximate $300 million. We have not included in our guidance the impact of contributing our clinical trials business to the JV with Quintiles, largely because the impact will depend on the timing of the deal's closing. To help frame it, our clinical trials testing revenue was in the range of approximately 2% of our consolidated revenues in 2014. With respect to the impact on adjusted EPS, we believe the JV will eventually neutral in 2015. We will provide more details when the deal closes later this year.
And as we noted on the investor call to announce the transaction, once it closes, we will no longer report the revenues and operating income from the clinical trials business in our income statement. We will, however, reflect our share of the joint venture's earnings on the equity earnings line on our income statement. This is where we report our current share of earnings in our other 3 unconsolidated diagnostic information services joint ventures, which are with leading regional integrated delivery networks.
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

And I think it's a good indication of our business mix and our focus on those areas of growth and how it's driving some portion of our margin expansion, which we called out in the script. So you want to mention, Mark, what's going on with tax?"

We committed to targeting to ensure there is no dilution from share count, but not any significant buybacks to reduce shares. Now with that said, we have a strategy of deploying some of our cash every year to target 1% to 2% of growth through M&A. And we've also said that if there was not value-accretive M&A that we can identify, that we will do more share repurchases. So I don't want to complete rule out share repurchases. But at this point, as part of our strategy, we're continuing to look and we like to believe that we can add some businesses, tuck-in, businesses and did that in the press and with that, of the person that will probably be a priority for cash for the balance of the year.

So you look at our onco-manage product and the fact that we have a panel of actionable genes, 34 actionable genes, as we engage with the payers, I think the response as they dialogue with our medical professionals and so on, is fairly positive because of the fact that we are moving forward with a limited panel that is actually all-around action. So as Steve talked about earlier, data brings insights. Insights will drive action. And I think the payers are much more willing to pay for things where clearly is the path toward action. So again, not commenting on anybody else's offerings. It's not the same for all of us. It certainly the choices we make around our product offerings and the size of the panels and actionability of those panels also influences our ability to get paid."

And again, the positive guidance we adjust our [indiscernible] cash positive as well. So when you got all those out, normally, we don't make adjustments.

So yes, a couple of things. One is we probably went a little more strongly than we expect in the first quarter, adjusting for the weather. So if the weather, it would have been a really strong quarter. There's various reasons for that. But I'll go back and say the guidance that I gave today is something that we're very confident in.

So I know we've talked about, in the past, how opportunities for these hospitals to look to outsource your labs. We're hearing more and more about payer pressure on commercial pricing for the hospital-based labs and also narrow network strategy, specifically Anthem in Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio.

Most CEOs and CFOs have lab strategies as part of their short list. We're encouraged by all that. The dynamic you mentioned, we think is a very positive dynamic. As we've talked about, we offer great value. We have some of the best pricing for the quality we deliver in this marketplace. And therefore, in terms of value, we are one of the strongest of the choices people have. And yes, payers are now starting to look at even tightening their network further, but why variation in prices from what we have here versus also outreach are notable. And yes, from the payers. I'd also mention the other dimensions of that. Employers are spending a lot more time on their health care costs, and they're saying wide variations so they're citing questions. And most importantly, consumers, with a higher co-pay and deductibles have now started to ask questions why were their bills go up just because physicians are now working for integrated delivery system versus when those physicians used to work for independent laboratories like ourselves. So all of this is coming together in a good way. Those hospitals we've talked to realize with payment models will be waived for fee-for-service with population health and payment models that the longer this is an incentive or incented to drive volume and activity but look at how they deliver the best quality health care of the lowest possible cost. That's what we saw in the University of Massachusetts. And then second, some do see and realize that they do have a melting ice cream cone with some of the differential commercial rates that they enjoy today on their hospital outreach. And therefore, their talking to us and thinking about what their options should be. So it's coming together nicely. We actually applaud what's happening in Anthem. We think it's a positive change for the industry and a positive indication that there's a catalyst out there in the system to start to get the discussion started and get this at an accelerated pace."

We'll share industry trends and also review progress we're making executing our 5-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.
Before we get into our performance, I want to highlight the joint venture we announced last month with Quintiles in clinical trials testing. Together, our 2 companies will create a new business that will be one of the leading global providers of central laboratory services to support drug development through clinical trials. The creation of a joint venture allows Quest and Quintiles to bring together the complementary capabilities and scale of our 2 organizations in an agile way, with a laser-like focus on serving customers. 
The new company will enable biopharmaceutical customers to enhance their drug development process, support precision medicines through companion diagnostics and biomarker discovery and build value by creating more efficient, effective organization through leveraging the scale, scientific expertise and operational excellence of the parent organizations. We expect that over time, the JV will have an accelerated growth rate, achieve cost synergies and to be accretive to what our clinical trials testing business would have been on a stand-alone basis.
The JV structure addresses 3 of our 5 strategic points. First, it will help us accelerate growth in the near term for our clinical trials business and explore opportunities related to our longer-term strategies on precision medicine, companion diagnostics and creating value from our data. Second, it enables us to refocus on our core diagnostic information services business without distraction. And third, with minimal capital, it enables us to participate in expected synergies in a way that lets us deliver disciplined capital deployment. Mark will provide some more color later on this exciting partnership. For now both entities will continue to operate separately until the closing of the transaction, which is anticipated to be no later than the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to our first quarter results. We continue to make progress on our path forward, delivering solid revenue, EPS and operating income growth. Revenues grew 5.3%, $1.84 billion. On an organic basis, consolidated revenues grew almost 1%. Adjusted cash EPS increased 13% to $1.05 and adjusted operating income increased 14%. Our performance reflects improved execution in a stable business environment, and we're able to grow despite a harsh winter, that while somewhat less severe than a year ago, was particularly difficult in the northeast portion of the United States where we have a strong presence.
Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to talk about industry dynamics for utilization, reimbursement and regulation. In the first quarter, we continued to see stability in test volumes on a same-provider basis. We're encouraged by the process of adding more insured lives to the health care system as a result of the Affordable Care Act. More states have been expanding their Medicaid programs, including Pennsylvania during the quarter, and we continue to see growth in our Medicaid volumes. 
Medicaid expansion will bring new people into the health care system with the goal of identifying issues earlier to improve outcomes and reduce overall costs. We actually saw this ourselves in our recent Quest Diagnostics Health Trend study. This peer-reviewed publication in diabetes care found a significant double-digit increase in diabetes diagnosis in states that expanded Medicaid coverage and no increase in states that did not. On reimbursement, we see less government pressure on the clinical FD [ph] schedule in 2015 than we have seen in the previous 2 years.
I'll start with the doc fix. Last week, the president signed a historic legislation titled ""The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act"" to permanently reform the Medicare physician payment methodology. We are pleased that cuts to laboratory payments under Medicare were not included as part of the package. This legislation also encourages payments based upon quality and encourage us to make the health care system smarter without denying access. 
This legislation is also directionally aligned with the HHS goals announced in January to tie traditional Medicare payments to quality or value through alternative payment models. Both the legislation and the HHS have outlined specific, measurable goals and time lines for these value-based reimbursement models. We believe these emerging payment models will favor providers with scale that are more effective and efficient, like us.
Next, I'd like to provide a status update on the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 or PAMA, which calls for an orderly review of the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. Our industry continues to work constructively with CMS in effectively implementing PAMA legislation. Just a few weeks ago, I've met with leaders at CMS and a delegation from our industry trade association to discuss the rule-making process that will govern any reimbursement changes. During that meeting, we've reviewed our view of the industry and its participants. We also discussed our shared goal of delivering an accurate, complete and efficient data collection process. We remain hopeful the rule-making process will be defined in 2015 and will establish an approach to building a representative view of the market. As this industry continues to evolve and mature, we have the right strategy and team and are well positioned to continue to lead. 
We continue to execute the company's 5-point strategy. As a reminder, our strategy is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on the core diagnostic information services business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. Now what I'd like to do is to share a few comments on each of the elements of the strategy. 
Well, this was the second consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth on a consolidated basis. We continue to focus on our core growth opportunities. First, we continued to focus on sales effectiveness. Second, we are getting traction on the professional laboratory services agreements we signed last year. And third, gene-based esoteric testing revenues grew in the quarter at a faster rate in more than 1 year. 
We continue to grow BRCA revenues, which clearly benefited from Angelina Jolie's ongoing public advocacy. One way we are differentiating ourselves is by advocating for open access to BRCA data for patients and clinicians. In collaboration with the French research consortium, Inserm, we led the creation of BRCA Share, an open data sharing initiative. Its goal is to accelerate research on BRCA gene mutations, particularly variants of uncertain significance to improve the ability to predict which individuals are at risk of developing inherited breast, ovarian and other cancers. The Inserm collaboration is an example of how we're using our unmatched data and information assets to deliver insights to our customers that demonstrate the value that Quest provides.
Last quarter, we told you about some new population health data analytics decision support tools we're developing. We have been piloting our population health tools with several physicians, ACOs and health plans to evaluate disease states for their patient populations, monitor compliance with specific tested protocols and identify gaps in care. In this pilot, our customers are now engaging with patients and health care professionals proactively to encourage the appropriate use of screening and monitoring test to drive better health. 
In addition to population health tools, we're making progress at delivering on what we call Interactive Insights to providers and patients. Our Interactive Insight offer providers trending data; interactive features, such as customizable reports; and additional content, such as videos and articles specific to conditions and diseases. IntelliTest Analytics is a web-based, secure portal that provides hospitals, integrated delivery networks and physicians practices with data-driven insights about test utilization patterns so they can adhere to clinically appropriate testing norms. Care360 Revenue Cycle Management helps customers manage denials of billing claims with a focus on improving patient and payer collections.
In November 2012, we established a new vision that spoke to the impact we have on people's lives. Our vision is empowering better health with diagnostic insights. Our vision was an essential part of becoming more external and customer-focused. Since then, we've made tremendous progress bringing the vision to life. Well, we're not just a lab. We're more than a lab. We're a trusted partner and we provide deep clinical insights. 
Our vision was the first step. Next, we've needed to turn it into a compelling customer-facing brand, a simple, consistent way to talk about Quest, who we are, the value we bring. In short, what is the Quest difference? Our new core brand idea is a powerful one. It is Action from Insight. 
Our brand strategy is based on 3 pillars: the idea that we inspire action from the work we do, that we illuminate answers for patients and health care providers, and that we advocate better health for patients and communities. This is a powerful idea, the notion that from data comes insight, from insight comes action, action that transforms lives. As you can tell, I'm excited about what our new corporate positioning means for Quest. It translates our vision into a concise, clear and actual brand and gives us an opportunity to reshape our place in the industry, allowing us to continue to differentiate ourselves and not compete solely on price. 
Brand is more than a logo or a tagline. To bring our brand to life, we have to change the way we think and talk of what we do. Additionally, we're engaging all of our 45,000 people with their direct impact on delivering this brand promise. You'll start to see the new brand in action in the coming weeks and months.
Next is our strategy for broad driving operational excellence. We are well underway with planning the next phase of Invigorate, which will extend our cost savings to $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. As in the past, we continue to update you on the progress as we go.
The third element of our strategy is to simplify and strengthen our organization. We've been focusing on execution and building a performance-oriented culture. We're very pleased to be included recently as one of Fortune Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies. Over the past year, we've introduced a number of new management tools as part of the Quest Management System. We're rolling out a new leadership development initiative this month. And as I visited more than a dozen of our major facilities in conjunction with the new brand rollout, I found employees in all levels to be highly engaged and excited about the challenges ahead.
The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our core diagnostic information services business. We continue to make good progress, and the joint venture with Quintiles is the most recent example of doing this. After considering a broad range of options for our clinical trials business, we found the joint venture was the best option to enable us to focus on the core, while unlocking the value of this important business. We'll continue to review our portfolio and look at options for noncore assets, and we always strive to build value for our shareholders.
And then finally, we remain focused on the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. During April, we completed the refinancing of more than $1.2 billion of our debt that will lower interest rates for year to come. We paid our dividend at the increased rate. And as noted earlier, we think the joint venture with Quintiles will enable us to share in our future value creation without requiring significant capital outlays.
Now Mark will provide an overview on the first quarter financial performance, walk you through the details of 2015 outlook, which is based on our strength in the operational performance and an improving business environment. Mark?"

Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.84 billion increased by 5.3% versus the prior year. It grew organically by 70 basis points. Revenues for diagnostic information services, or DIS for short, grew by 4.9% compared to the pri",1068,"Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.84 billion increased by 5.3% versus the prior year. It grew organically by 70 basis points. Revenues for diagnostic information services, or DIS for short, grew by 4.9% compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 5.6% versus the prior year, while revenue per requisition was lower than the prior year by 0.7%. For DIS, acquisitions contributed nearly 5% to revenues. Excluding acquisitions, DIS revenues, volumes and revenue per requisition were all essentially flat for the quarter.
I would like to share some additional context on these underlying volume and revenue per requisition metrics. First, let me touch on the impact of the harsh winter. As we have shared in the past, our analysis is based on changes in volume versus trend for geographies related to specific weather events. Additionally, we provide guidance based on historical weather patterns. In the past 2 years, we've experienced unusually severe winters. However, in 2012, we had a mild winter, which resulted in upside to our expectations. This year, volumes were negatively impacted in the quarter by a harsh winter throughout much of the country, in particular the Northeast. While the impact was not as severe as 1 year ago, it was worse than we anticipated. We believe the impact of weather on the quarter was approximately $0.08 of EPS. As a result, we are pleased with the quarter, and we are planning -- but we were planning on better performance.
Turning to underlying revenue per requisition. We saw modest reimbursement pressure in the quarter and was in line with our expectations. That reimbursement pressure was offset by favorable test and business mix shifts.
Moving to our Diagnostics Solutions business, which includes risk assessment, clinical trials testing, health care IT and our remaining products businesses, revenues grew by 11% compared to the prior year. It enjoyed strong growth during the quarter from our clinical trials, products and risk assessment businesses.
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $269 million or 14.6% of revenues, compared to $236 million or 13.5% of revenues a year ago. With comparable volumes essentially flat, the improvement can be primarily attributed to the benefits of our business mix, Invigorate program and M&A-related impacts, including synergies. These factors enabled us to improve gross margins and further leverage SG&A. As a result, our adjusted operating income and earnings grew faster than revenues. 
For the quarter, adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $1.05, 13% better than a year ago. Amortization was $0.09 in both 2014 and 2015. The company recorded after-tax charges totaling $80 million in the quarter, primarily associated with the debt refinanced in the first quarter. The charges also included restructuring and integration costs associated with our Invigorate program and recent acquisitions and combined to reduce reported EPS by $0.54. Last year's first quarter included after-tax charges of $18 million, primarily associated with restructuring and integration charges, which reduced reported EPS by $0.13.
Let me share a few comments on special items. As you think about special items, because of their nature, they do fluctuate from period to period. This quarter, we incurred a charge related to the first tranche of debt retired. A second tranche of debt was redeemed in April, which will result in a similar charge in the second quarter. We expect to incur total pretax charges of nearly $150 million related to our debt refinancing. In addition to charges, our special items also include benefits. For example, we anticipate recognizing a gain related to the joint venture with Quintiles at the time of closing. This gain will occur when we contribute our clinical trials business into the joint venture, which is expected to take place no later than the third quarter. This gain is expected to be of similar magnitude to the total charges associated with the debt retirement. We will adjust this onetime gain out of our earnings. To put this in perspective, since the beginning of 2012, the benefits adjusted out of earnings have been approximately the same amount as the charges adjusted out of earnings.
Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenues, was 4.3%, flat to a year ago. As a reminder, bad debt expense is typically highest in the first quarter due to increased patient responsibility associated with coinsurance and deductible requirements. Our DSOs were 45 days, 3 days lower than last quarter and 4 days lower than a year ago. This is a testament to our operational excellence continuously demonstrated by our billing, operations and patient service centers teams that continued to effectively engage with patients and payers to ensure that we get paid for the work we do.
Reported cash provided by operations was $52 million in the quarter. However, excluding the $78 million of cash charges associated with the retirement of debt, cash provided by operations would have been $130 million in the quarter versus $84 million a year ago. Capital expenditures were $56 million in the quarter compared to $68 million a year ago.
Moving to guidance. We expect full year 2015 results from continuing operations before special items as follows: revenues to increase between 2% to 3% compared to 2014; adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization expense, to be between $4.70 and $4.85; adjusted cash provided by operations to approximate $850 million; and capital expenditures to approximate $300 million. 
We have not included in our guidance the impact of contributing our clinical trials business to the JV with Quintiles, largely because the impact will depend on the timing of the deal's closing. To help frame it, our clinical trials testing revenue was in the range of approximately 2% of our consolidated revenues in 2014. With respect to the impact on adjusted EPS, we believe the JV will be essentially neutral in 2015. We will provide more details when the deal closes later this year.
And as we noted on the investor call to announce the transaction, once it closes, we will no longer report the revenues and operating income from the clinical trials business in our income statement. We will, however, reflect our share of the joint venture's earnings on the equity earnings line on our income statement. This is where we report our current share of earnings in our other 3 unconsolidated diagnostic information services joint ventures, which are with leading regional integrated delivery networks.
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

We did also reference that we would annualize that at some point in the second quarter. But also to be clear, we took those actions in the second quarter, so you shouldn't be expecting the year-over-year comp to be fully positive until the -- until the end of that quarter. 
So it's similar level of volume, as we also said, although we continue to regularly look over our portfolio and ensure that all of the volume is value-creating volume. That discrete set of actions we took during the second quarter of last year was kind of a onetime event and you shouldn't expect those kind of things to happen again in any sort of regularity."

I'm sure that's why you're tying it to what are the implications for buybacks. And I think, at this point, the guidance we gave is consistent, which is you shouldn't assume significant reduction in shares outstanding based on repurchases. We committed to targeting to ensure there's no dilution from share count, but not any significant buybacks to reduce shares. 
Now with that said, we have a strategy of deploying some of our cash every year to target 1% to 2% of growth through M&A. And we've also said that if there was not value-accretive M&A that we can identify, that we will do more share repurchases. So I don't want to completely rule out share repurchases. But at this point, as part of our strategy, we're continuing to look and we'd like to believe that we can add some businesses, tuck-in, fold-in type business as we've done in the past. And that would probably be our priority for cash for the balance of the year. But should we find that there's nothing that's executable, certainly, we would use that cash from more share repurchases."

We're hopeful. From the beginning of ACA, we said we believe that the Affordable Care Act is -- should be net positive for the industry and for us. We believe the more people have insurance is a good thing. The diabetes studies that we showed shows that by having people with insurance, it can have a positive impact on population health.

So yes, a couple of things. One is we probably performed a little more strongly than we expect in the first quarter, adjusting for the weather. So had the weather not been there, it would have been a really, really strong quarter. There's various reasons for that. However, I'll go back and say the guidance that I gave today is something that we're very confident in.

So I know we've talked about, in the past, how the -- opportunity is for these hospitals to look to outsource their labs. We're hearing more and more about payer pressure on commercial pricing for the hospital-based labs and also narrow network strategy, specifically Anthem in Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio.

Most CEOs and CFOs have lab strategy as part of their short list. We're encouraged by all that. 
The dynamic you mentioned, we think is a very positive dynamic. As we've talked about, we offer great value. We have some of the best pricing for the quality we deliver in this marketplace. And therefore, in terms of value, we're one of the strongest of the choices people have. And yes, payers are now starting to look at even tightening their network further, but wide variation in prices from what we have here versus hospital outreach are notable. 
And yes, it's from the payers. I'd also mention 2 other dimensions to that. Employers are spending a lot more time on their health care costs, and they're seeing wide variations so they're starting to ask questions. And most importantly, consumers with a higher co-pay and deductibles have now started to ask questions why would their bills go up just because physicians are now working for integrated delivery system versus when those physicians used to send the work to independent laboratories like ourselves. 
So all this is coming together in a good way. Most hospitals we talked to realize with -- payment models, be it [indiscernible] for fee-for-service to population health and bundled payment models, that no longer is an incentive to -- or they're no longer incented to drive volume and activity, but look at how they deliver the best quality health care at the lowest possible cost. That's what we saw at University of Massachusetts. And then second, some do see and realize that they do have a melting ice cream cone with some of the differential commercial rates that they enjoy today on their hospital outreach. And therefore, they're talking to us and thinking about what their options should be. 
So it's coming together nicely. We actually applaud what's happened in Anthem. We think it's a positive change for the industry and a positive indication that there's a catalyst out there in the system to start to get the discussion started and move this at an accelerated pace."

So we've been improving our offering in terms of our capabilities of our sales force, capabilities of our genetic counselors, capabilities of the quality of our reporting and the look and feel of our Interactive Insights, as I've talked about in my remarks. 
But also, we're looking at how do we get the actual results to be of higher quality. And we only have so much data. We believe it would be the right thing to do to take our data, combine it with other people's data. And Inserm, being the French institute for health, has 16 labs that report their data in. But we're also happy to have LabCorp participating in this, so we're going to put in both of our data sets into Inserm. And we believe that this is just the beginning. There will be others to follow. 
And the outcome of this, we believe will be an outcome of the curation and also the analytics around that data to produce better sensitivity and specificity around the testing for BRCA. And we think that's a good thing for the industry and a good thing for us. So we think this is the next step of improving and delivering a great solution to the marketplace in a better way. We will continue to differentiate ourselves in everything I just described, how we sell it, how we support it, how we present it and how we explain it in our solution to the marketplace, which we think will allow us to continue to differentiate ourselves versus the other options that our customers have.

We'll share industry trends and also review progress we're making executing our 5-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.
Before we get into our performance, I want to highlight the joint venture we announced last month with Quintiles in clinical trials testing. Together, our 2 companies will create a new business that will be one of the leading global providers of central laboratory services to support drug development through clinical trials. The creation of a joint venture allows Quest and Quintiles to bring together the complementary capabilities and scale of our 2 organizations in an agile way, with a laser-like focus on serving customers. 
The new company will enable biopharmaceutical customers to enhance their drug development process, support precision medicines through companion diagnostics and biomarker discovery and build value by creating more efficient, effective organization through leveraging the scale, scientific expertise and operational excellence of the parent organizations. We expect that over time, the JV will have an accelerated growth rate, achieve cost synergies and to be accretive to what our clinical trials testing business would have been on a stand-alone basis.
The JV structure addresses 3 of our 5 strategic points. First, it will help us accelerate growth in the near term for our clinical trials business and explore opportunities related to our longer-term strategies on precision medicine, companion diagnostics and creating value from our data. Second, it enables us to refocus on our core diagnostic information services business without distraction. And third, with minimal capital, it enables us to participate in expected synergies in a way that lets us deliver disciplined capital deployment. Mark will provide some more color later on this exciting partnership. For now both entities will continue to operate separately until the closing of the transaction, which is anticipated to be no later than the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to our first quarter results. We continue to make progress on our path forward, delivering solid revenue, EPS and operating income growth. Revenues grew 5.3%, $1.84 billion. On an organic basis, consolidated revenues grew almost 1%. Adjusted cash EPS increased 13% to $1.05 and adjusted operating income increased 14%. Our performance reflects improved execution in a stable business environment, and we're able to grow despite a harsh winter, that while somewhat less severe than a year ago, was particularly difficult in the northeast portion of the United States where we have a strong presence.
Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to talk about industry dynamics for utilization, reimbursement and regulation. In the first quarter, we continued to see stability in test volumes on a same-provider basis. We're encouraged by the process of adding more insured lives to the health care system as a result of the Affordable Care Act. More states have been expanding their Medicaid programs, including Pennsylvania during the quarter, and we continue to see growth in our Medicaid volumes. 
Medicaid expansion will bring new people into the health care system with the goal of identifying issues earlier to improve outcomes and reduce overall costs. We actually saw this ourselves in our recent Quest Diagnostics Health Trend study. This peer-reviewed publication in diabetes care found a significant double-digit increase in diabetes diagnosis in states that expanded Medicaid coverage and no increase in states that did not. On reimbursement, we see less government pressure on the clinical FD [ph] schedule in 2015 than we have seen in the previous 2 years.
I'll start with the doc fix. Last week, the president signed a historic legislation titled ""The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act"" to permanently reform the Medicare physician payment methodology. We are pleased that cuts to laboratory payments under Medicare were not included as part of the package. This legislation also encourages payments based upon quality and encourage us to make the health care system smarter without denying access. 
This legislation is also directionally aligned with the HHS goals announced in January to tie traditional Medicare payments to quality or value through alternative payment models. Both the legislation and the HHS have outlined specific, measurable goals and time lines for these value-based reimbursement models. We believe these emerging payment models will favor providers with scale that are more effective and efficient, like us.
Next, I'd like to provide a status update on the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 or PAMA, which calls for an orderly review of the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. Our industry continues to work constructively with CMS in effectively implementing PAMA legislation. Just a few weeks ago, I've met with leaders at CMS and a delegation from our industry trade association to discuss the rule-making process that will govern any reimbursement changes. During that meeting, we've reviewed our view of the industry and its participants. We also discussed our shared goal of delivering an accurate, complete and efficient data collection process. We remain hopeful the rule-making process will be defined in 2015 and will establish an approach to building a representative view of the market. As this industry continues to evolve and mature, we have the right strategy and team and are well positioned to continue to lead. 
We continue to execute the company's 5-point strategy. As a reminder, our strategy is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on the core diagnostic information services business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. Now what I'd like to do is to share a few comments on each of the elements of the strategy. 
Well, this was the second consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth on a consolidated basis. We continue to focus on our core growth opportunities. First, we continued to focus on sales effectiveness. Second, we are getting traction on the professional laboratory services agreements we signed last year. And third, gene-based esoteric testing revenues grew in the quarter at a faster rate in more than 1 year. 
We continue to grow BRCA revenues, which clearly benefited from Angelina Jolie's ongoing public advocacy. One way we are differentiating ourselves is by advocating for open access to BRCA data for patients and clinicians. In collaboration with the French research consortium, Inserm, we led the creation of BRCA Share, an open data sharing initiative. Its goal is to accelerate research on BRCA gene mutations, particularly variants of uncertain significance to improve the ability to predict which individuals are at risk of developing inherited breast, ovarian and other cancers. The Inserm collaboration is an example of how we're using our unmatched data and information assets to deliver insights to our customers that demonstrate the value that Quest provides.
Last quarter, we told you about some new population health data analytics decision support tools we're developing. We have been piloting our population health tools with several physicians, ACOs and health plans to evaluate disease states for their patient populations, monitor compliance with specific tested protocols and identify gaps in care. In this pilot, our customers are now engaging with patients and health care professionals proactively to encourage the appropriate use of screening and monitoring test to drive better health. 
In addition to population health tools, we're making progress at delivering on what we call Interactive Insights to providers and patients. Our Interactive Insight offer providers trending data; interactive features, such as customizable reports; and additional content, such as videos and articles specific to conditions and diseases. IntelliTest Analytics is a web-based, secure portal that provides hospitals, integrated delivery networks and physicians practices with data-driven insights about test utilization patterns so they can adhere to clinically appropriate testing norms. Care360 Revenue Cycle Management helps customers manage denials of billing claims with a focus on improving patient and payer collections.
In November 2012, we established a new vision that spoke to the impact we have on people's lives. Our vision is empowering better health with diagnostic insights. Our vision was an essential part of becoming more external and customer-focused. Since then, we've made tremendous progress bringing the vision to life. Well, we're not just a lab. We're more than a lab. We're a trusted partner and we provide deep clinical insights. 
Our vision was the first step. Next, we've needed to turn it into a compelling customer-facing brand, a simple, consistent way to talk about Quest, who we are, the value we bring. In short, what is the Quest difference? Our new core brand idea is a powerful one. It is Action from Insight. 
Our brand strategy is based on 3 pillars: the idea that we inspire action from the work we do, that we illuminate answers for patients and health care providers, and that we advocate better health for patients and communities. This is a powerful idea, the notion that from data comes insight, from insight comes action, action that transforms lives. As you can tell, I'm excited about what our new corporate positioning means for Quest. It translates our vision into a concise, clear and actual brand and gives us an opportunity to reshape our place in the industry, allowing us to continue to differentiate ourselves and not compete solely on price. 
Brand is more than a logo or a tagline. To bring our brand to life, we have to change the way we think and talk of what we do. Additionally, we're engaging all of our 45,000 people with their direct impact on delivering this brand promise. You'll start to see the new brand in action in the coming weeks and months.
Next is our strategy for broad driving operational excellence. We are well underway with planning the next phase of Invigorate, which will extend our cost savings to $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. As in the past, we continue to update you on the progress as we go.
The third element of our strategy is to simplify and strengthen our organization. We've been focusing on execution and building a performance-oriented culture. We're very pleased to be included recently as one of Fortune Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies. Over the past year, we've introduced a number of new management tools as part of the Quest Management System. We're rolling out a new leadership development initiative this month. And as I visited more than a dozen of our major facilities in conjunction with the new brand rollout, I found employees in all levels to be highly engaged and excited about the challenges ahead.
The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our core diagnostic information services business. We continue to make good progress, and the joint venture with Quintiles is the most recent example of doing this. After considering a broad range of options for our clinical trials business, we found the joint venture was the best option to enable us to focus on the core, while unlocking the value of this important business. We'll continue to review our portfolio and look at options for noncore assets, and we always strive to build value for our shareholders.
And then finally, we remain focused on the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. During April, we completed the refinancing of more than $1.2 billion of our debt that will lower interest rates for year to come. We paid our dividend at the increased rate. And as noted earlier, we think the joint venture with Quintiles will enable us to share in our future value creation without requiring significant capital outlays.
Now Mark will provide an overview on the first quarter financial performance, walk you through the details of 2015 outlook, which is based on our strength in the operational performance and an improving business environment. Mark?"

Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.84 billion increased by 5.3% versus the prior year. It grew organically by 70 basis points. Revenues for diagnostic information services, or DIS for short, grew by 4.9% compared to the pri",1068,"Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.84 billion increased by 5.3% versus the prior year. It grew organically by 70 basis points. Revenues for diagnostic information services, or DIS for short, grew by 4.9% compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 5.6% versus the prior year, while revenue per requisition was lower than the prior year by 0.7%. For DIS, acquisitions contributed nearly 5% to revenues. Excluding acquisitions, DIS revenues, volumes and revenue per requisition were all essentially flat for the quarter.
I would like to share some additional context on these underlying volume and revenue per requisition metrics. First, let me touch on the impact of the harsh winter. As we have shared in the past, our analysis is based on changes in volume versus trend for geographies related to specific weather events. Additionally, we provide guidance based on historical weather patterns. In the past 2 years, we've experienced unusually severe winters. However, in 2012, we had a mild winter, which resulted in upside to our expectations. This year, volumes were negatively impacted in the quarter by a harsh winter throughout much of the country, in particular the Northeast. While the impact was not as severe as 1 year ago, it was worse than we anticipated. We believe the impact of weather on the quarter was approximately $0.08 of EPS. As a result, we are pleased with the quarter, and we are planning -- but we were planning on better performance.
Turning to underlying revenue per requisition. We saw modest reimbursement pressure in the quarter and was in line with our expectations. That reimbursement pressure was offset by favorable test and business mix shifts.
Moving to our Diagnostics Solutions business, which includes risk assessment, clinical trials testing, health care IT and our remaining products businesses, revenues grew by 11% compared to the prior year. It enjoyed strong growth during the quarter from our clinical trials, products and risk assessment businesses.
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $269 million or 14.6% of revenues, compared to $236 million or 13.5% of revenues a year ago. With comparable volumes essentially flat, the improvement can be primarily attributed to the benefits of our business mix, Invigorate program and M&A-related impacts, including synergies. These factors enabled us to improve gross margins and further leverage SG&A. As a result, our adjusted operating income and earnings grew faster than revenues. 
For the quarter, adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $1.05, 13% better than a year ago. Amortization was $0.09 in both 2014 and 2015. The company recorded after-tax charges totaling $80 million in the quarter, primarily associated with the debt refinanced in the first quarter. The charges also included restructuring and integration costs associated with our Invigorate program and recent acquisitions and combined to reduce reported EPS by $0.54. Last year's first quarter included after-tax charges of $18 million, primarily associated with restructuring and integration charges, which reduced reported EPS by $0.13.
Let me share a few comments on special items. As you think about special items, because of their nature, they do fluctuate from period to period. This quarter, we incurred a charge related to the first tranche of debt retired. A second tranche of debt was redeemed in April, which will result in a similar charge in the second quarter. We expect to incur total pretax charges of nearly $150 million related to our debt refinancing. In addition to charges, our special items also include benefits. For example, we anticipate recognizing a gain related to the joint venture with Quintiles at the time of closing. This gain will occur when we contribute our clinical trials business into the joint venture, which is expected to take place no later than the third quarter. This gain is expected to be of similar magnitude to the total charges associated with the debt retirement. We will adjust this onetime gain out of our earnings. To put this in perspective, since the beginning of 2012, the benefits adjusted out of earnings have been approximately the same amount as the charges adjusted out of earnings.
Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenues, was 4.3%, flat to a year ago. As a reminder, bad debt expense is typically highest in the first quarter due to increased patient responsibility associated with coinsurance and deductible requirements. Our DSOs were 45 days, 3 days lower than last quarter and 4 days lower than a year ago. This is a testament to our operational excellence continuously demonstrated by our billing, operations and patient service centers teams that continued to effectively engage with patients and payers to ensure that we get paid for the work we do.
Reported cash provided by operations was $52 million in the quarter. However, excluding the $78 million of cash charges associated with the retirement of debt, cash provided by operations would have been $130 million in the quarter versus $84 million a year ago. Capital expenditures were $56 million in the quarter compared to $68 million a year ago.
Moving to guidance. We expect full year 2015 results from continuing operations before special items as follows: revenues to increase between 2% to 3% compared to 2014; adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization expense, to be between $4.70 and $4.85; adjusted cash provided by operations to approximate $850 million; and capital expenditures to approximate $300 million. 
We have not included in our guidance the impact of contributing our clinical trials business to the JV with Quintiles, largely because the impact will depend on the timing of the deal's closing. To help frame it, our clinical trials testing revenue was in the range of approximately 2% of our consolidated revenues in 2014. With respect to the impact on adjusted EPS, we believe the JV will be essentially neutral in 2015. We will provide more details when the deal closes later this year.
And as we noted on the investor call to announce the transaction, once it closes, we will no longer report the revenues and operating income from the clinical trials business in our income statement. We will, however, reflect our share of the joint venture's earnings on the equity earnings line on our income statement. This is where we report our current share of earnings in our other 3 unconsolidated diagnostic information services joint ventures, which are with leading regional integrated delivery networks.
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

We did also reference that we would annualize that at some point in the second quarter. But also to be clear, we took those actions in the second quarter, so you shouldn't be expecting the year-over-year comp to be fully positive until the -- until the end of that quarter. 
So it's similar level of volume, as we also said, although we continue to regularly look over our portfolio and ensure that all of the volume is value-creating volume. That discrete set of actions we took during the second quarter of last year was kind of a onetime event and you shouldn't expect those kind of things to happen again in any sort of regularity."

I'm sure that's why you're tying it to what are the implications for buybacks. And I think, at this point, the guidance we gave is consistent, which is you shouldn't assume significant reduction in shares outstanding based on repurchases. We committed to targeting to ensure there's no dilution from share count, but not any significant buybacks to reduce shares. 
Now with that said, we have a strategy of deploying some of our cash every year to target 1% to 2% of growth through M&A. And we've also said that if there was not value-accretive M&A that we can identify, that we will do more share repurchases. So I don't want to completely rule out share repurchases. But at this point, as part of our strategy, we're continuing to look and we'd like to believe that we can add some businesses, tuck-in, fold-in type business as we've done in the past. And that would probably be our priority for cash for the balance of the year. But should we find that there's nothing that's executable, certainly, we would use that cash for more share repurchases."

We're hopeful. From the beginning of ACA, we said we believe that the Affordable Care Act is -- should be net positive for the industry and for us. We believe more people with insurance is a good thing. The diabetes studies that we showed shows that by having people with insurance, it can have a positive impact on population health.

So yes, a couple of things. One is we probably performed a little more strongly than we expected in the first quarter, adjusting for the weather. So had the weather not been there, it would have been a really, really strong quarter. There's various reasons for that. However, I'll go back and say the guidance that I gave today is something that we're very confident in.

So I know we've talked about, in the past, how the -- opportunity is for these hospitals to look to outsource their labs. We're hearing more and more about payer pressure on commercial pricing for the hospital-based labs and also narrow network strategy, specifically Anthem in Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio.

Most CEOs and CFOs have lab strategy as part of their short list. We're encouraged by all that. 
The dynamic you mentioned, we think is a very positive dynamic. As we've talked about, we offer great value. We have some of the best pricing for the quality we deliver in this marketplace. And therefore, in terms of value, we're one of the strongest of the choices people have. And yes, payers are now starting to look at even tightening their network further, but wide variation in prices from what we have here versus hospital outreach are notable. 
And yes, it's from the payers. I'd also mention 2 other dimensions to that. Employers are spending a lot more time on their health care costs, and they're seeing wide variations so they're starting to ask questions. And most importantly, consumers with a higher co-pay and deductibles have now started to ask questions why would their bills go up just because physicians are now working for integrated delivery system versus when those physicians used to send the work to independent laboratories like ourselves. 
So all this is coming together in a good way. Most hospitals we talked to realize with -- payment models, moving away from fee-for-service to population health and bundled payment models, that no longer is an incentive to -- or they're no longer incented to drive volume and activity, but look at how they deliver the best quality health care at the lowest possible cost. That's what we saw at University of Massachusetts. And then second, some do see and realize that they do have a melting ice cream cone with some of the differential commercial rates that they enjoy today on their hospital outreach. And therefore, they're talking to us and thinking about what their options should be. 
So it's coming together nicely. We actually applaud what's happened in Anthem. We think it's a positive change for the industry and a positive indication that there's a catalyst out there in the system to start to get the discussion started and move this at an accelerated pace."

So we've been improving our offering in terms of our capabilities of our sales force, capabilities of our genetic counselors, capabilities of the quality of our reporting and the look and feel of our Interactive Insights, as I've talked about in my remarks. 
But also, we're looking at how do we get the actual results to be of higher quality. And we only have so much data. We believe it would be the right thing to do to take our data, combine it with other people's data. And Inserm, being the French institute for health, has 16 labs that report their data in. But we're also happy to have LabCorp participating in this, so we're going to put in both of our data sets into Inserm. And we believe that this is just the beginning. There will be others to follow. 
And the outcome of this, we believe will be an outcome of the curation and also the analytics around that data to produce better sensitivity and specificity around the testing for BRCA. And we think that's a good thing for the industry and a good thing for us. So we think this is the next step of improving and delivering a great solution to the marketplace in a better way. We will continue to differentiate ourselves in everything I just described, how we sell it, how we support it, how we present it and how we explain it in our solution to the marketplace, which we think will allow us to continue to differentiate ourselves versus the other options that our customers have.

This morning we'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share industry trends and also review progress we are making executing our 5-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.
Well, we grew revenues, margins and earnings in the second quarter and made progress executing our strategy. Revenues grew 1% to $1.9 billion, adjusted operating income grew 9%, adjusted net income grew more than 8% and adjusted EPS increased 5% to $1.25.
This was the second consecutive quarter in which operating income grew faster than revenues. This underscores what we've been doing with executing our 5-point strategy. We are not just entrusted in growth at in any cost. We are focused on driving profitable growth. And I will speak about this more in a minute. Before we get into our strategy, I'd like to spend some time on industry dynamics.
After 2 years, some of the heaviest government reimbursement pressure this industry has faced, we are seeing a moderation of that government reimbursement pressure in 2015 and we don't see any significant headwinds for 2016. Any changes to the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule proposed as part of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, also known as PAMA, would go into effect into 2017. As you know, CMS continues to work on the rule-making process and the data collection that will help determine future reimbursement schedules. We appreciate the work done by CMS as well as the complexity of this task, and we will continue to collaborate with CMS throughout this process.
So on utilization, we continue to see stability in test volumes on the same provider basis during the quarter. 
Turning to the Affordable Care Act, we continue to believe it will be debt positive for our company and our industry. The Supreme Court removed uncertainty regarding the future of the act in [indiscernible] versus Birdwell. As we look at the impact in our business to date, as you know, there are a lot of moving parts, and we don't have perfect information. But what we can say is that we are seeing growth in our Medicaid and managed Medicaid volumes in different markets around the country as well as a decrease in our uninsured patient volumes.
These trends appear to be consistent with our expectations related to the new lives coming into the system. We expect this will improve over time as additional uninsured patients begin to access healthcare.
With greater certainty related to the Affordable Care Act, payer consolidation has dominated the headlines of recent weeks. Today, Quest serves all major national payers with an unsurpassed national network of laboratories, information services and logistics.
Healthcare in general and diagnostic testing in particular are characterized by significant disparities in price for similar services. It's not unusual for test performed by hospital lab to cause 2x to 5x as much as Quest. We offer tremendous value providing the highest quality by the competitive price. We are very well-positioned to help health plans in their networks, achieve the most efficient network design and provide members with outstanding service.
Now let me shift to the progress we are making in our 5-point strategy, which is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our core diagnostic information service businesses and deliver disciplined capital deployment. Now starting with growth. 
This is the third consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth on a consolidated basis. It was also the first quarter we recorded for revenue per requisition growth in 3 years. Now let me talk about a few of the drivers.
Our regional sales team are now better aligned with the clinical franchises and the professional lab services team. We grew revenues in the quarter for several recent clinical franchise solution launches, including BRCA, [indiscernible] UIQ, noninvasive prenatal screening and HIV first-generation testing. We also continue to see growth in Prescription Drug Monitoring. Last quarter, we shared that gene-based esoteric grew at a fastest rate in the year. We were pleased to see that the growth rate continued during the second quarter. This focus on esoteric and gene-based testing has continued to be the increase in revenue per requisition. 
We continue to grow revenues from new relationships with hospitals and integrated delivery networks by helping them approved health care outcomes and reduce costs. 
Most recently, we announced an agreement to acquire MemorialCare Health System's laboratory outreach services business. This transaction fits well within our M&A guidelines, and is a smaller tuck-in type acquisition compared to some of the more recent deals we have completed. We expect the transaction to close in August. 
Our M&A and business development pipeline is strong, and we are optimistic about the opportunistic our team are pursuing. 
We've said before, we're enhancing our diagnostic information services to help customers with population health, data analytics and decision support tools. These tools are driving growth and helping us deliver a superior customer experience. So for example, for physicians, our Interactive Insights offer provided trending data, interactive feature such as customizable reports and additional content, as videos and articles related to specific conditions and diseases. We have piloted these solutions with approximately 70 physician providers and are encouraged by the feedback. 
Now for hospitals. More than 100 customers are now using our IntelliTest Analytics solution. This easy-to-use tool provides hospitals, integrated delivery networks, physician practices with timely access to utilization insights to assist laboratory test optimization decisions and driving cost controls.
And for health plans, we've extended pilots with health plans for our Quest Analytics platform. The self-service informatics tool enables health plan customers to carry a massive database to help manage populations of patients and encourage the appropriate use of screening and monitoring test to drive better health and follow guidelines. We received very positive feedback. So we continue to build on our data and analytics tools and we will update you on our progress.
And then finally, consumerism is an emerging trend in health care, and we offer a number of compelling services in this exciting space.
We began to offer our blueprint for wellness health risk assessment directly to consumers in 2010. Now we're getting ready to offer blueprint for athletes, both athletes and their coaches and trainers as well as weakened warriors gain valuable insights until the training, recovery regimens, peak performance conditions and optimal dietary consumption. 
We also recently announced an agreement with Health Task, a digital healthcare provider. Health Task's virtual network of physicians offer an easy ordering of tests for patients from Quest Diagnostics. Doctors can see test results on Health Tasks platform and patients can access of their own results using patient portal of MyQuest applications more than 1.8 million patients have now downloaded our MyQuest application. A growing portion of those consumers are paying us a premium to gaining access to their historical lab results and maintain access to the longitudinal test results.
And lastly, we begin to offer direct access testing to consumers in Arizona, where new launches took effect, enabling people to order tests without a physician script. We are operating this through our joint partners in our Quest laboratories, which builds on the strength of our partners and our health, the leading health care provider in Arizona. Initial interest in this service is very strong. 
As a responsibility for [indiscernible] and paying for healthcare shifts rapidly to consumers, we are well-positioned to be the consumer-friendly diagnostic testing provider.
The second element of our strategy is driving operational excellence. Our Drive program is focusing on delivering a superior customer experience as well as allowing us to become more efficient.
We performed more than 3,000 different diagnostic tests in our large network of laboratories, many of which came to us through acquisitions with different laboratory information systems and building systems.
We're always looking for ways to improve the service we deliver, whether it's providing more than 90% of our results to doctors by 8:00 in the next morning or making more than 5 million phone calls a year to notify physician of critical results they can act on. 
Our Investor Day last fall, we said we would be standardizing systems and processes. Since then the portion of our legacy systems that have standardized are increased from 70% to 75%.
Our latest system conversion occurred without any disruptions to clients, which is very encouraging. We also drive and track a number of medical quality and service metrics related to a superior customer experience. Many of our service ailments such as the availability of our Care360 physician portal and our specimen tracking performance are already at Six-Sigma levels. In addition, we have saw improvements in several key areas, including wait times at patient service centers, installation of the EMR interfaces to on-board new clients.
We continue to move closer to achieving our ninvi goal of $1.3 billion, a cumulative run rate savings by the end of 2017. 
As I mentioned at the beginning of this call, this quarter's strong operating income performance demonstrates the value we are creating from our improved efficiency.
The third element of our strategy is to simplify and strengthen our organization. We have been focusing on execution and building our performance-oriented culture. Our Quest Management System is the way we run the company by using a set of standard tools and processes. Additionally, we have been trading our leaders and recently launched the leading Quest Academy to provide a rigorous form for putting our Quest Management System's tools to the test. Academy graduates are now hard at work on focus on addressing opportunities and challenges facing our business. 
The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our core diagnostic information services business. We have made substantial progress in the last 90 days. As you know, we launched our newest joint venture, Q Squared solutions with Quintiles in a capital efficient way that provides us with a path generating better growth and profitability for that business and if we had operated it as a stand-alone entity. 
We have a great partner and are excited about the opportunities for that venture. Quintiles will share more on the joint venture including expectations related to financial performance in their upcoming earnings call.
We are excited to be working with Quintiles exclusively for a period of time to combine our respective data set to help biopharma customers improve their drug discovery and development process. 
Lastly, we continue to review our portfolio, looking at options for noncore assets that can build value for our shareholders.
The fifth element of our strategy is delivering disciplined capital deployment. During April, we completed the refinancing of more than $1.2 billion of our debt that will lower interest expenses for years to come. We also deployed our cash to reinvest in the business and continue to make progress on our commitment to shareholders by returning the approximately $250 million year-to-date through a combination of share buybacks and dividends.
Mark will provide an overview on our second quarter financial performance, walk you through the details of our 2015 outlook, which is based on our strong operational performance. Mark?"

Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.93 billion increased by 1.2% versus the prior year and grew organically by 80 basis points.

Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.93 billion increased by 1.2% versus the prior year and grew organically by 80 basis points. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 0.4% compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of acquisitions, declined by 0.4% versus the prior year. However, revenue per requisition was 0.9% better than the prior year. And as Steve mentioned, it was the first increase in 3 years. 
While reimbursement pressure continued to be moderate at just under 1%, we were more than able to offset that pressure from favorable tests and business mix shifts. The favorable test mix shift reflects the strong growth in our gene-based and esoteric testing.
Moving to Diagnostic Solutions business, which includes risk assessment, clinical trials testing, health care IT and remaining products businesses, revenues grew by 11% compared to the prior year. The Diagnostic Solutions revenues will be lower on a reported basis in the second half of 2015 as a result of the contribution of our clinical trials business to the joint venture with Quintiles. To provide you with a representative view of the operational performance of the business, we will communicate our reported 2015 revenue against 2014 revenue on an equivalent basis.
Revenue for 2014 on an equivalent basis excludes Clinical Trials revenues reported in the third and fourth quarter of 2014. The 2014 revenue excluded is $41 million and $46 million in the third and fourth quarter, respectively.
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $321 million or 16.7% of revenues, compared to $296 million or 15.5% of revenues a year ago. The improvement of 120 basis points can be primarily attributable to the benefits of our tests and business mix, Invigorate program and continued integration synergies from our 2014 acquisitions. 
Lower amortization in the quarter versus a year ago negatively impacted the comparison of cash EPS in the prior year by $0.03. For the quarter, adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, grew 5% to $1.25. 
The company recorded after-tax charges totaling $52 million in the quarter, $41 million of which is associated with our recent debt refinancing. The charges also included restructuring and integration costs associated with our Invigorate program and recent acquisitions and combined to reduce reported EPS by $0.36.
Last year's second quarter included a $24 million of after-tax costs associated with restructuring and integration charges, which reduced reported EPS by $0.16.
As a reminder, we also expect to book a gain related to the valuation of the joint venture with Quintiles. We will adjust this onetime gain to our earnings.
Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.1%, 20 basis points better than last quarter, but up 20 basis points compared to a year ago. Our DSOs were 44 days,1  day lower than last quarter and 3 days lower than the year ago. 
Consistent with the first quarter, we are adjusting our operating cash in the first half of the year to exclude cash charges for the debt refinancing. Adjusted cash provided by operations was $324 million in the second quarter of 2015. Reported cash provided by operations in the second quarter of 2015 was $275 million and was negatively impacted by cash charges of $49 million associated with the early retirement of debt in connection with the company's debt refinancing. 
For the second quarter of 2014, reported cash provided by operations was $280 million. Typically, cash flow is stronger in the second half. However, this year, we have an extra payroll cycle and a tax payment associated with our previously disposed business that together account for about $100 million. Despite these headwinds in the back half, we now expect adjusted cash provided by operations to exceed $850 million for the year. 
Capital expenditures were $61 million in the quarter compared to $49 million a year ago.
Moving to guidance. We expect full-year 2015 results before special items as follows: Revenues are now expected to be between $7.49 billion and $7.57 billion, an increase of 2% to 3% versus 2014 on an equivalent basis; adjusted diluted EPS is unchanged to be between $4.70 and $4.85; adjusted cash provided by operations is expected to exceed $850 million; and capital expenditures are also unchanged to approximate $300 million.
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

First of all, what I said in my opening remarks as we do this analysis when we look at our stable accounts, and we call it the same-provider, same-store analysis. And year-on-year, what we said they were consistent with the prior years. So on an existing basis, we feel utilization is stable versus the prior year. So that's point #1.  Point #2, as I said in our direct remarks, we continue to steer our resources, our energy around the higher profit portion of the marketplace, whether that's with better solutions and we've gotten some growth. In fact you see our growth in our higher rent portion of our portfolio growing faster than our top line growth, so that focus is paying off. And then it's also paying off in better revenue per requisition, and obviously, our growth in operating income. Some portion of that is related to growing the revenue in the right way to get profitable growth. And then I'll turn it to Mark because, as you know, in the past, we've talked about some business that we have reconsidered over the last few quarters, we still have a that in Q2. We'll start to lap that in the second half, but I'll let Mark provide some insight into that. Mark?"

And I think the fact that we well grew revenue and earnings validates that walking away from some of that booked volume it was probably a good decision. And that does anniversary certainly through the second quarter. So we talked about also the back half having easier comps than the front half. The other perspective I just want to provide is we talked about the weakness of using requisitions for volume. Certainly, we're responsible for that. That's what we provide. But there's certainly some watch outs there. So the real important thing is obviously test. And I can tell you that test volumes actually grow despite the fact that requisitions volumes decline in the quarter. So we feel good about the volume, and that's what we're trying to drive in our clinical fracture strategy is to actually drive a better outcome for patients with many cases means actually filling in more richer [indiscernible] than what is has been maybe in the past. And some of the business we walked away with lower value fewer test requisitions. So again, I just want to give you the additional perspective, actually test volume did grow in the quarter."

With as I said, that trend around the consumer that's become increasingly important part of our business. We also have been offering access to our blueprint for wellness online. That's successful beyond Arizona. And as I said, we're expanding that for the blueprint for athletes offering. So as far as we're concerned, we're going to continue to evaluate where we get more aggressive in certain states where it makes sense, where we can still do it. As you know, all states are not created equal here, and Arizona was very strong in this regard. We're trying to see how Arizona goes. As I said, we are actually encouraged by the initial results from what we see in Arizona, and we do believe this is a trend we're on top with and we're very well-positioned. Yes, the question about [indiscernible], they continue to be a regional lab that's getting a lot of attention, as you know. Probably it's important for me to mention that part of the attention they have received is around Capital Blue in Pennsylvania. And I just wanted to reiterate for the people on this call that actually Capital Blue is a very strong partner of ours. And actually interesting enough, despite that news, we actually extended our long-standing relationship with Capital Blue with the new contract in January of this year. And we are their only natural laboratory and its preferred provider. And actually, we have recently spoken with the CEO there, and he did note that the arrangement that they have with [indiscernible] does not changed any aspect agreement that they have with Quest. As a matter fact, when we went on to talk about is the difficult challenges we placed face in health care and what we can do together to help with the challenges of health care costs and help with their membership. And what we offer to him great quality and great costs is an important part of the solution he sees for his marketplace. So we are very well-positioned with Capital Blue, and we're, again, one of their laboratories, but we're their only national laboratory in the preferred provider. So I just wanted to share that with you. We obviously didn't share that publicly, but to give you some color on of the fact what we have in many of our marketplaces despite the news you might hear from others."

It is in the states that have expanded Medicaid, that's your question. As you mentioned, you can read and what we've heard is those states have seen an increase, and those lives entering the systems through hospitals. So there's some growth in volumes there. And also you probably have seen in the last half, there's probably study where we looked at diagnosis of diabetes and those expanded Medicaid versus those states that did not actually saw an increase in the diagnosis of diabetes with those states that have expanded Medicaid. So the data is out there, the expansion for the low income portion of our population continues to gain momentum. For all intents and purposes, the lives increase that we have seen and for all intents and purposes, it's hard to tract. As you know, it is the reduction we see in some portion of our uninsured patient volumes. So we think the momentum is building. The momentum is building for more insured lives. And as we said back 3 years ago, we believe when people have insurance, they need what we do, we're at the core of health care, where we're 70% of the health care decision-making at 2% of cost. So it's a very important part getting a good baseline, understanding what's happening with someone's life, and therefore, as we entered the system, we're going to see those volumes.

And I'm thinking about economics of sharing data and then potential any revenue synergies that might come out of that data sharing?"

First of all, our initial reaction from customers is quite good. We continue to build volume in the business that we move over to the JV. And when I say volume, I mean revenue and profit.

We continue to build volume in the business that we move over to the JV. And when I say volume, I mean revenue and profit. And you saw that in some of our numbers. And then that's not part of the JV. So that's a strong combination with a strong business. We're doing that, as I said in my remarks, to build a stronger business when we put both resources together, and this is both in terms of addressing the market. So it's growing faster and also taking some cost out to make it more profitable, and that's why we did it. So reactions from those customers that we have [indiscernible] out and spoke about are going to act together at [indiscernible] Solutions quite good, and we're encouraged by that. The second part of your question, Amanda, has to do with the work we're going to do together now to tease out, if you will, the value we can create for drug discovery. The first part of this is we have this incredibly capability in clinical chemistry, and that our data is very strong. And so on the testing side, we believe that by working proactively with pharma, we can be ahead earlier Birdseye access to what we could do with a diagnostics and have that access to help us be well positioned as we continue diagnostic partner with some of the new drugs that are launched to the market in the years to come. That's one area that we're going to put some work into now the initial JV has closed. And the second is the data that we've talked about. We have data, they have data,  pharma has data and how we collaborate together to use that data in a smart way to improved drug discovery, and one idea that people have talked about we already have done some of this with our data ready is with better patient selection. And anything we can do to be more targeted and be more precise and help with making drug discovery more efficient is a very good thing for our pharma partners. So that's what we're going to spend some time in. As I said in my remarks, we're going to take some time now to work with demands for [indiscernible] and Quintiles to see if we can find exactly what we will do. We're proud to say we formed all of these in a very capital efficient way, and we're going to deliver good value for our shareholders."

As far as price significance are in for 2016, what we shared is we see less pressure on the government side, this is what we know about the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule Physician Fee Schedule. So that's encouraging. And then we already got a question on PAMA and what's happening in 2017 and beyond. We'll keep you abreast in what happens there. As far as visibility of pricing in the marketplace, as you know, the way patients and consumers engage with the marketplace, the question is when do they actually have the out-of-pocket cost? And yes, we have published our own prices in Arizona, and we think those prices are very competitive. When you look at our average price per requisition, if you just go through our 10-K and just make an assumption around test per requisition. You'll see a very strong value proposition from Quest Diagnostics in the marketplace. And, as you know, most people in this country have insurance. That's a growing percentage over time. So therefore, for diagnostic testing and, as you also know, there's a portion of the Affordable Care Act that was related to screening and diagnostic testing. Some portion of what we do does not have out-of-pocket cost to consumers. So how does this all pans out as far as what the consumer will actually pay and/or prices affect general visibility and transparency of pricing in the marketplace, we'll see. The last part, I just want to reiterate, if you look at prices in this industry, this wide disparity in prices, hospital outreach organization are sometimes in the neighbor of 2x to 5x more expensive than our prices. We think transparency around all that for consumers and for health plans to provide to their membership is very important, and we're right back on all that, because we think that serves us very well as our quality and our price of that quality is very unsurpassed in our marketplace.

We'd like to see more transparency.

This morning we'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share industry trends and also review progress we are making executing our 5-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.
Well, we grew revenues, margins and earnings in the second quarter and made progress executing our strategy. Revenues grew 1% to $1.9 billion, adjusted operating income grew 9%, adjusted net income grew more than 8% and adjusted EPS increased 5% to $1.25.
This was the second consecutive quarter in which operating income grew faster than revenues. This underscores what we've been doing with executing our 5-point strategy. We are not just interested in growth at any cost. We are focused on driving profitable growth. And I'll speak about this more in a minute. Before we get into our strategy, I'd like to spend some time on industry dynamics.
After 2 years of some of the heaviest government reimbursement pressure this industry has faced, we're seeing a moderation of that government reimbursement pressure in 2015 and we don't see any significant headwinds for 2016. Any changes to the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule proposed as part of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, also known as PAMA, would go into effect in 2017. As you know, CMS continues to work on the rule-making process and the data collection that will help determine future reimbursement schedules. We appreciate the work done by CMS as well as the complexity of this task, and we will continue to collaborate with CMS throughout this progress -- process.
So on utilization, we continue to see stability in test volumes on a same provider basis during the quarter. 
Turning to the Affordable Care Act, we continue to believe it will be debt [ph] positive for our company and our industry. The Supreme Court removed uncertainty regarding the future of the act in King versus Burwell. As we look at the impact on our business to-date, as you know, there are a lot of moving parts, and we don't have perfect information. But what we can say is that we are seeing growth in our Medicaid and Managed Medicaid volumes in different markets around the country as well as a decrease in our uninsured patient volumes.
These trends appear to be consistent with our expectations related to the new lives coming into the system. We expect this will improve over time as additional uninsured patients begin to access healthcare.
With greater certainty related to the Affordable Care Act, payer consolidation has dominated the headlines in recent weeks. Today, Quest serves all major national payers with an unsurpassed national network of laboratories, information services and logistics.
Healthcare in general and diagnostic testing in particular are characterized by significant disparities in price for similar services. It's not unusual for a test performed by hospital lab to cost 2x to 5x as much as Quest. We offer tremendous value, providing the highest quality by the competitive price. We are very well positioned to help health plans in their networks, achieve the most efficient network design and provide members with outstanding service.
Now let me shift to the progress we are making on our 5-point strategy, which is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our core diagnostic information service businesses and deliver disciplined capital deployment. 
Well, starting with growth. This is the third consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth on a consolidated basis. It was also the first quarter we recorded revenue per requisition growth in 3 years. Now let me talk about a few of the drivers.
Our regional sales teams that have now better aligned with the clinical franchises and the professional lab services team. We grew revenues in the quarter for several recent clinical franchise solution launches, including BRCA, Cardio IQ, noninvasive prenatal screening and HIV fourth-generation testing. We also continue to see growth in Prescription Drug Monitoring. Last quarter, we shared that gene-based and esoteric testing revenues grew at the fastest rate in a year. We were pleased to see that the growth rate continued during the second quarter. This focus on esoteric and gene-based testing has continued to be the increase in revenue per requisition. 
We continue to grow revenues from new relationships with hospitals and integrated delivery networks by helping them approve healthcare outcomes and reduce costs. 
Most recently, we announced an agreement to acquire MemorialCare Health System's laboratory outreach services business. This transaction fits well within our M&A guidelines, and is a smaller tuck-in type acquisition compared to some of the more recent deals we have completed. We expect the transaction to close in August. 
Our M&A and business development pipeline is strong, and we are optimistic about the opportunities our team are pursuing. 
We've said before, we're enhancing our diagnostic information services to help customers with population health, data analytics and decision support tools. These tools are driving growth and helping us deliver a superior customer experience. So for example, for physicians, our Interactive Insights offer provide their trending data, interactive feature such as customizable reports and additional content, as videos and articles related to specific conditions and diseases. We have piloted these solutions with approximately 70 physician providers and are encouraged by the feedback. 
Now for hospitals. More than 100 customers are now using our IntelliTest Analytics solution. This easy-to-use tool provides hospitals, integrated delivery networks, physician practices with timely access to utilization insights to assist with laboratory test optimization decisions and driving cost controls.
And for health plans, we've extended pilots with health plans for our Quest Analytics platform. This self-service informatics tool enables health plan customers to query our massive database to help manage populations of patients and encourage the appropriate use of screening and monitoring test to drive better health and follow guidelines. We've received very positive feedback. So we continue to build on our data analytics tools, and we will update you on our progress.
And then finally, consumerism is an emerging trend in health care, and we offer a number of compelling services in this exciting space.
We began to offer our Blueprint for Wellness health-risk assessment directly to consumers in 2010. Now we're getting ready to offer Blueprint for Athletes. Both athletes and their coaches and trainers as well as weekend warriors gain valuable insights on tailored training, recovery regimens, peak performance conditions and optimal dietary consumption. 
We also recently announced an agreement with HealthTap, a digital healthcare provider. HealthTap's virtual network of physicians can offer easy ordering of tests for patients from Quest Diagnostics. Doctors can see test results on HealthTap's platform and patients can access their own results using our patient portal of MyQuest application. More than 1.8 million patients have now downloaded our MyQuest application. A growing portion of those consumers are paying us a premium to gain access to their historical lab results and maintain access to the longitudinal test results.
And last week, we began to offering direct access testing to consumers in Arizona, where new launches took effect, enabling people to order tests without a physician script. We are operating this through our joint venture partners in our Quest laboratories, which builds on the strengths of our partner, Banner Health, the leading health care provider in Arizona. Initial interest in this service is very strong. 
As the responsibility for vantaging [ph] and paying for health care shifts rapidly to consumers, we are well positioned to be the consumer-friendly diagnostic-testing provider.
The second element of our strategy is driving operational excellence. Our Drive program is focusing on delivering a superior customer experience as well as allowing us to become more efficient.
We performed more than 3,000 different diagnostic tests in our large network of laboratories, many of which came to us through acquisitions with different laboratory information systems and building systems.
We're always looking for ways to improve the service we deliver, whether it's providing more than 90% of our results to doctors by 8:00 in the next morning or making more than 5 million phone calls a year to notify physicians of critical results they can act on. 
At our Investor Day last fall, we said we would be standardizing systems and processes. Since then, the portion of our legacy systems that are standardized has increased from 70% to 75%.
Our latest system conversion occurred without any disruptions to clients, which is very encouraging. We also drive and track a number of medical quality and service metrics related to a superior customer experience. Many of our service elements, such as availability of our Care360 physician portal and our specimen-tracking performance, are already at Six Sigma levels. In addition, we have -- saw improvements in several key areas, including wait times at patient service centers, installation of EMR interfaces to onboard new clients.
We continue to move closer to achieving our Invigorate goal of $1.3 billion and cumulative run rate savings by the end of 2017. 
As I mentioned at the beginning of this call, this quarter's strong operating income performance demonstrates the value we're creating from our improved efficiency.
The third element of our strategy is to simplify and strengthen our organization. We have been focusing on execution and building our performance-oriented culture. Our Quest Management System is the way we run the company by using a set of standard tools and processes. Additionally, we have been training our leaders and recently launched the leading Quest Academy to provide a rigorous form where putting our Quest Management System's tools to the test. Academy graduates are now hard at work on [indiscernible] focus of addressing opportunities and challenges facing our business. 
The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our core diagnostic information services business. We've made substantial progress in the last 90 days. As you know, we launched our newest joint venture, Q2 Solutions with Quintiles, in a capital-efficient way that provides us with a path generating better growth and profitability for that business and if we had operated it as a stand-alone entity. 
We have a great partner and are excited about the opportunities for that venture. Quintiles will share more on the joint venture, including expectations related to financial performance, in their upcoming earnings call.
We are excited to be working with Quintiles exclusively for a period of time to combine our respective data set to help biopharma customers improve their drug discovery and development process. 
Lastly, we continue to review our portfolio, looking at options for noncore assets that can build value for our shareholders.
The fifth element of our strategy is delivering disciplined capital deployment. During April, we completed the refinancing of more than $1.2 billion of our debt that will lower interest expense for years to come. We also deployed our cash to reinvest in the business and continue to make progress on our commitment to shareholders by returning approximately $250 million year-to-date through a combination of share buybacks and dividends.
Now Mark will provide an overview on our second quarter financial performance, walk you through the details of our 2015 outlook, which is based on our strong operational performance. Mark?"

Consolidated revenues of $1.93 billion increased by 1.2% versus the prior year and grew organically by 80 basis points. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 0.4% compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of acquisitions, declined by 0.4% versus the prior year. However, revenue per requisition was 0.9% better than the prior year. And as Steve mentioned, it was the first increase in 3 years. 
While reimbursement pressure continued to be moderate, at just under 1%, we were more than able to offset that pressure from favorable tests and business mix shifts. The favorable test mix shift reflects the strong growth in our gene-based and esoteric testing.
Moving to Diagnostic Solutions business, which includes risk assessment, clinical trials testing, health care IT and remaining products businesses, revenues grew by 11% compared to the prior year. The Diagnostic Solutions revenues will be lower on a reported basis in the second half of 2015 as a result of the contribution of our Clinical Trials business to the joint venture with Quintiles. To provide you with a representative view of the operational performance of the business, we will communicate our reported 2015 revenue against 2014 revenue on an equivalent basis.
Revenue for 2014, on an equivalent basis, excludes Clinical Trials revenues reported in the third and fourth quarter of 2014. The 2014 revenue, excluded, is $41 million and $46 million in the third and fourth quarter, respectively.
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $321 million or 16.7% of revenues, compared to $296 million or 15.5% of revenues a year ago. The improvement of 120 basis points can be primarily attributed to the benefits of our tests and business mix, Invigorate program and continued integration synergies from our 2014 acquisitions. 
Lower amortization in the quarter versus a year ago negatively impacted the comparison of cash EPS to the prior year by $0.03. For the quarter, adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, grew 5% to $1.25. 
The company recorded after-tax charges totaling $52 million in the quarter, $41 million of which is associated with our recent debt refinancing. The charges also included restructuring and integration costs associated with our Invigorate program and recent acquisitions and combined to reduce reported EPS by $0.36.
Last year's second quarter included $24 million of after-tax costs associated with restructuring and integration charges, which reduced reported EPS by $0.16.
As a reminder, we also expect to book a gain related to the valuation of the joint venture with Quintiles. We will adjust this one-time gain out of our earnings.
Net debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.1%, 20 basis points better than last quarter, but up 20 basis points compared to a year ago. Our DSOs were 44 days, 1 day lower than last quarter and 3 days lower than a year ago. 
Consistent with the first quarter, we are adjusting our operating cash in the first half of the year to exclude cash charges for the debt refinancing. Adjusted cash provided by operations was $324 million in the second quarter of 2015. Reported cash provided by operations in the second quarter of 2015 was $275 million and was negatively impacted by cash charges of $49 million associated with the early retirement of debt in connection with the company's debt refinancing. 
For the second quarter of 2014, reported cash provided by operations was $280 million. Typically, cash flow is stronger in the second half. However, this year, we have an extra payroll cycle and a tax payment associated with a previously disposed business that together account for about $100 million. Despite these headwinds at the back half, we now expect adjusted cash provided by operations to exceed $850 million for the year. 
Capital expenditures were $61 million in the quarter compared to $49 million a year ago.
Moving to guidance. We expect full year 2015 results before special items as follows: Revenues are now expected to be between $7.49 billion and $7.57 billion, an increase of 2% to 3% versus 2014 on an equivalent basis; adjusted diluted EPS is unchanged, to be between $4.70 and $4.85; adjusted cash provided by operations is expected to exceed $850 million; and capital expenditures are also unchanged to approximately $300 million.

And year-on-year, what we said they were consistent with the prior years. So on an existing basis, we feel utilization is stable versus the prior year. So that's point #1. Point #2, as I said in our direct remarks, we continue to steer our resources, our energy, around the higher profit portion of the marketplace, whether that's with better solutions and we've gotten some growth. Matter of fact you see our growth and our higher rent portion of our portfolio growing faster than our top line growth, so that focus is paying off. And then it's also paying off in better revenue per requisition, and obviously, our growth in operating income. Some portion of that is related to growing the revenue in the right way to get profitable growth. And then -- I'll turn it to Mark because, as you know, in the past, we've talked about some business that we have reconsidered over the last few quarters, we still have that in Q2.

And I think the fact that we -- we're able to grow revenue and earnings validates that walking away from some of that bulk volume, it was probably a good decision. And that does anniversary-ing certainly through the second quarter. So we've talked about also the back half having easier comps than the front half. The other perspective I just want to provide is we've talked about the weakness of using requisitions for volume. Certainly, we're responsible for that. That's what we provide. But there certainly are some watchouts there. So the real important thing is obviously the test. And I could tell you that test volumes actually grow, despite the fact that requisitions volumes decline in the quarter. So we feel good about the volume. That's what we're trying to drive through our clinical franchise strategy is to actually drive a better outcome for patients with -- in many cases means actually filling in more richer rack than it what it's been maybe in the past. And some of the business we've walked away were lower value, fewer test requisitions. So again, I just want to give you the additional perspective, actually test volume did grow in the quarter."

I think, some portion of all markets will access the health care systems this way, not all, and will be a growing trend with, as I said, the trend around the consumer, and that's become increasingly important part of our business. We also have been offering, A.J., access to our Blueprint for Wellness online. That's successful beyond Arizona. And as I said, we're expanding that for the Blueprint for Athletes offering. So as far as we're concerned, we're going to continue to evaluate where we get more aggressive in certain states where it makes sense, where we can still do it. As you know, all states are not created equal here, and Arizona was very strong in this regard. We're trying to see how Arizona goes. As I said that we're actually encouraged by the initial results from what we see in Arizona, and we do believe this is a trend we're on top of and we're very well positioned. Yes, you asked a question about Theranos, they continue to be a regional lab that's getting a lot of attention, as you know. Probably it's important for me to mention that part of the attention they have received is around Capital Blue in Pennsylvania. And I just wanted to reiterate for the people on this call that actually Capital Blue is a very strong partner of ours. And actually interesting enough, despite that news, we actually extended our long-standing relationship with Capital Blue with a new contract in January of this year. And we are their only natural laboratory and its preferred provider. And actually, we have recently spoken with the CEO there, and he did note that the arrangement that they have with Theranos does not change in any aspect the agreement that they have with Quest. As a matter of fact, what we went on to talk about is the difficult challenges we faced in health care and what we can do together to help with the challenges of health care costs and help with his membership. And what we offered to him were the great quality and our great cost is an important part of the solution he sees for his marketplace. So we're very well positioned with Capital Blue, and we're, again, one of their laboratories, but we're their only national laboratory in the preferred provider. So I wanted to share that with you. We obviously didn't share that publicly, but to give you some color of, in fact, what we have for our presence in many of our marketplaces despite the news you might hear from others."

It is in the states that have expanded Medicaid, that's your question. As you mentioned, you can read and what we've heard is those states have seen an increase, and those lives entering the systems through hospitals, so there's some growth in volumes there. And also, we -- you probably have seen in the last half, we published a study where we looked at diagnosis of diabetes in those states have expanded Medicaid versus those states that did not, we actually saw an increase in the diagnosis of diabetes with those states that have expanded Medicaid. So the data is out there, that expansion for the low-income portion of our population continues to gain momentum. For all intents and purposes, it's -- the lives increase that we have seen and for all intents and purposes, it's hard to track because, as you know, it is the reduction we see at some portion of our uninsured patient volumes. So we think the momentum is building. The momentum is building for more insured lives. And as we said about 3 years ago, we believe when people have insurance, they need what we do, we're at the core of health care, where we're 70% of the health care decision-making at 2% a cost. So it's a very important part, getting a good baseline, understanding what's happening with someone's life, and therefore, as we enter the system, we're going to see those volumes.

So we're certainly expecting to get our fair share. But I think, to this point, we're not there yet.

The second part of your question, Amanda, has to do with the work we're going to do together now to tease out, if you will, the value we can create for drug discovery. The first part of this is we have this incredible capability in clinical chemistry, and that our data is very strong. And so on the testing side, we believe by working proactively with pharma, we could be -- have an earlier birdseye access to what we could do with Diagnostics [indiscernible] and have that access to help us be well positioned as the companion diagnostic partner, with some of the new drugs that are launched to the market in years to come. That's one area that we're going to put some work into now, that the initial JV has closed. And the second is just the data that we've talked about. We have data, they have data, pharma has data and how do we collaborate together to use that data in a smart way to improve drug discovery, and one idea that people have talked about, we already have done some of this with our data ready, is with better patient selection. And anything they could do to be more targeted and more precise and help with making drug discovery more efficient is a very good thing for our pharma partners. So that's what we're going to spend some time in. As I said in my remarks, we're going to take some time now to work with demands for team of Quintiles to see if we can find exactly what we will do.

So you should have confidence we've got a good handle on this. As far as price significance are in for 2016, what we shared is we see less pressure on the government side, this is what we know about the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule, Physician Fee Schedule. So that's encouraging. And then we already got the question on PAMA and what's happening in 2017 and beyond. We'll keep you abreast in what happens there. As far as visibility of pricing in the marketplace, as you know, the way patients and consumers engage with the marketplace, the question is, when do they actually have the out-of-pocket cost? And yes, we have published our own prices in Arizona, and we think those prices are very competitive. When you look at our average price per requisition, if you just go through our 10-K and you just make an assumption around test per requisition. You'll see a very strong value proposition from Quest Diagnostics in the marketplace. And, as you know, most people in this country have insurance. That's a growing percentage over time. So therefore, for diagnostic testing and, as you also know, there's a portion of the Affordable Care Act that was related to screening and diagnostic testing. Some portion of what we do does not have out-of-pocket cost to consumers. So how does this all pans out as far as what the consumer will actually pay and/or prices affect general visibility and transparency of pricing in the marketplace, we'll see. The other -- the last part of this, I just want to reiterate, if you look at prices in this industry, this wide disparities prices, hospital outreach organization are sometimes in the neighbor of 2x to 5x more expensive than our prices. We think transparency around all that for consumers and for health plans to provide to their membership is very important, and we're right back on all that, because we think that serves us very well as our quality and our price of that quality is really unsurpassed in our marketplace. And so the more volume we get around that, the better for us, we believe."

And then, Steve, a follow-up question on -- just to get to your market perspective. In the past, the number of tests that are offered on a menu is being, I think, a limiting factor or a critical factor for a lab to penetrate the provider segment, whether it's ambulatory or hospital. Is that still the case? And what do you think is that critical number? Do you need to have 250 tests on your menu? Do you need 1,000 tests? Or do you need more than that?"

The hospital market, the reference to the market is more concentrated from marketplace. There's no specific number. Because in addition to the test menu, it includes consideration about quality and service and reputation in the marketplace, and yes, pricing is a consideration for that as well.

This morning we'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share industry trends and also review progress we are making executing our 5-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.
Well, we grew revenues, margins and earnings in the second quarter and made progress executing our strategy. Revenues grew 1% to $1.9 billion, adjusted operating income grew 9%, adjusted net income grew more than 8% and adjusted EPS increased 5% to $1.25.
This was the second consecutive quarter in which operating income grew faster than revenues. This underscores what we've been doing with executing our 5-point strategy. We are not just interested in growth at any cost. We are focused on driving profitable growth. And I'll speak about this more in a minute. Before we get into our strategy, I'd like to spend some time on industry dynamics.
After 2 years of some of the heaviest government reimbursement pressure this industry has faced, we're seeing a moderation of that government reimbursement pressure in 2015 and we don't see any significant headwinds for 2016. Any changes to the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule proposed as part of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, also known as PAMA, would go into effect in 2017. As you know, CMS continues to work on the rule-making process and the data collection that will help determine future reimbursement schedules. We appreciate the work done by CMS as well as the complexity of this task, and we will continue to collaborate with CMS throughout this progress -- process.
So on utilization, we continue to see stability in test volumes on a same provider basis during the quarter. 
Turning to the Affordable Care Act, we continue to believe it will be net positive for our company and our industry. The Supreme Court removed uncertainty regarding the future of the act in King versus Burwell. As we look at the impact on our business to-date, as you know, there are a lot of moving parts, and we don't have perfect information. But what we can say is that we are seeing growth in our Medicaid and Managed Medicaid volumes in different markets around the country as well as a decrease in our uninsured patient volumes.
These trends appear to be consistent with our expectations related to the new lives coming into the system. We expect this will improve over time as additional uninsured patients begin to access healthcare.
With greater certainty related to the Affordable Care Act, payer consolidation has dominated the headlines in recent weeks. Today, Quest serves all major national payers with an unsurpassed national network of laboratories, information services and logistics.
Healthcare in general and diagnostic testing in particular are characterized by significant disparities in price for similar services. It's not unusual for a test performed by a hospital lab to cost 2x to 5x as much as Quest. We offer tremendous value, providing the highest quality at a competitive price. We are very well positioned to help health plans narrow networks, achieve the most efficient network design and provide members with outstanding service.
Now let me shift to the progress we are making on our 5-point strategy, which is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our core diagnostic information service businesses and deliver disciplined capital deployment. 
Well, starting with growth. This is the third consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth on a consolidated basis. It was also the first quarter we recorded revenue per requisition growth in 3 years. Now let me talk about a few of the drivers.
Our regional sales teams that have now better aligned with the clinical franchises and the professional lab services team. We grew revenues in the quarter for several recent clinical franchise solution launches, including BRCA, Cardio IQ, noninvasive prenatal screening and HIV fourth-generation testing. We also continue to see growth in Prescription Drug Monitoring. Last quarter, we shared that gene-based and esoteric testing revenues grew at the fastest rate in a year. We were pleased to see that the growth rate continued during the second quarter. This focus on esoteric and gene-based testing has continued to be the increase in revenue per requisition. 
We continue to grow revenues from new relationships with hospitals and integrated delivery networks by helping them improve healthcare outcomes and reduce costs. 
Most recently, we announced an agreement to acquire MemorialCare Health System's laboratory outreach services business. This transaction fits well within our M&A guidelines, and is a smaller tuck-in type acquisition compared to some of the more recent deals we have completed. We expect the transaction to close in August. 
Our M&A and business development pipeline is strong, and we are optimistic about the opportunities our team are pursuing. 
We've said before, we're enhancing our diagnostic information services to help customers with population health, data analytics and decision support tools. These tools are driving growth and helping us deliver a superior customer experience. So for example, for physicians, our Interactive Insights offer provider trending data, interactive feature such as customizable reports and additional content, as videos and articles related to specific conditions and diseases. We have piloted these solutions with approximately 70 physician providers and are encouraged by the feedback. 
Now for hospitals. More than 100 customers are now using our IntelliTest Analytics solution. This easy-to-use tool provides hospitals, integrated delivery networks, physician practices with timely access to utilization insights to assist with laboratory test optimization decisions and driving cost controls.
And for health plans, we've extended pilots with health plans for our Quest Analytics platform. This self-service informatics tool enables health plan customers to query our massive database to help manage populations of patients and encourage the appropriate use of screening and monitoring tests to drive better health and follow guidelines. We've received very positive feedback. So we continue to build on our data analytics tools, and we will update you on our progress.
And then finally, consumerism is an emerging trend in health care, and we offer a number of compelling services in this exciting space.
We began to offer our Blueprint for Wellness health-risk assessment directly to consumers in 2010. Now we're getting ready to offer Blueprint for Athletes. Both athletes and their coaches and trainers as well as weekend warriors gain valuable insights on tailored training, recovery regimens, peak performance conditions and optimal dietary consumption. 
We also recently announced an agreement with HealthTap, a digital healthcare provider. HealthTap's virtual network of physicians can offer easy ordering of tests for patients from Quest Diagnostics. Doctors can see test results on HealthTap's platform and patients can access their own results using our patient portal of MyQuest application. More than 1.8 million patients have now downloaded our MyQuest application. A growing portion of those consumers are paying us a premium to gain access to their historical lab results and maintain access to the longitudinal test results.
And last week, we began to offering direct access testing to consumers in Arizona, where new launches took effect, enabling people to order tests without a physician script. We are operating this through our joint venture partners in our Quest laboratories, which builds on the strengths of our partner, Banner Health, the leading health care provider in Arizona. Initial interest in this service is very strong. 
As the responsibility for managing and paying for health care shifts rapidly to consumers, we are well positioned to be the consumer-friendly diagnostic-testing provider.
The second element of our strategy is driving operational excellence. Our Drive program is focusing on delivering a superior customer experience as well as allowing us to become more efficient.
We performed more than 3,000 different diagnostic tests in our large network of laboratories, many of which came to us through acquisitions with different laboratory information systems and building systems.
We're always looking for ways to improve the service we deliver, whether it's providing more than 90% of our results to doctors by 8:00 in the next morning or making more than 5 million phone calls a year to notify physicians of critical results they can act on. 
At our Investor Day last fall, we said we would be standardizing systems and processes. Since then, the portion of our legacy systems that are standardized has increased from 70% to 75%.
Our latest system conversion occurred without any disruptions to clients, which is very encouraging. We also drive and track a number of medical quality and service metrics related to a superior customer experience. Many of our service elements, such as availability of our Care360 physician portal and our specimen-tracking performance, are already at Six Sigma levels. In addition, we have -- saw improvements in several key areas, including wait times at patient service centers, installation of EMR interfaces to onboard new clients.
We continue to move closer to achieving our Invigorate goal of $1.3 billion and cumulative run rate savings by the end of 2017. 
As I mentioned at the beginning of this call, this quarter's strong operating income performance demonstrates the value we're creating from our improved efficiency.
The third element of our strategy is to simplify and strengthen our organization. We have been focusing on execution and building our performance-oriented culture. Our Quest Management System is the way we run the company by using a set of standard tools and processes. Additionally, we have been training our leaders and recently launched the leading Quest Academy to provide a rigorous forum for putting our Quest Management System's tools to the test. Academy graduates are now hard at work on teams focused on addressing opportunities and challenges facing our business. 
The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our core diagnostic information services business. We've made substantial progress in the last 90 days. As you know, we launched our newest joint venture, Q2 Solutions with Quintiles, in a capital-efficient way that provides us with a path to generating better growth and profitability for that business than if we had operated it as a stand-alone entity. 
We have a great partner and are excited about the opportunities for that venture. Quintiles will share more on the joint venture, including expectations related to financial performance, in their upcoming earnings call.
We are excited to be working with Quintiles exclusively for a period of time to combine our respective data set to help biopharma customers improve their drug discovery and development process. 
Lastly, we continue to review our portfolio, looking at options for noncore assets that can build value for our shareholders.
The fifth element of our strategy is delivering disciplined capital deployment. During April, we completed the refinancing of more than $1.2 billion of our debt that will lower interest expense for years to come. We also deployed our cash to reinvest in the business and continue to make progress on our commitment to shareholders by returning approximately $250 million year-to-date through a combination of share buybacks and dividends.
Now Mark will provide an overview on our second quarter financial performance, walk you through the details of our 2015 outlook, which is based on our strong operational performance. Mark?"
361335,303264907,837162,"Quest Diagnostics Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Quest Diagnostics Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues. Consolidated revenues of $1.93 billion increased by 1.2% versus the prior year and grew organically by 80 basis points.

Consolidated revenues of $1.93 billion increased by 1.2% versus the prior year and grew organically by 80 basis points. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 0.4% compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, declined by 0.4% versus the prior year. However, revenue per requisition was 0.9% better than the prior year. And as Steve mentioned, it was the first increase in 3 years. 
While reimbursement pressure continued to be moderate, at just under 1%, we were more than able to offset that pressure from favorable tests and business mix shifts. The favorable test mix shift reflects the strong growth in our gene-based and esoteric testing.
Moving to Diagnostic Solutions business, which includes risk assessment, clinical trials testing, health care IT and remaining products businesses, revenues grew by 11% compared to the prior year. The Diagnostic Solutions revenues will be lower on a reported basis in the second half of 2015 as a result of the contribution of our Clinical Trials business to the joint venture with Quintiles. To provide you with a representative view of the operational performance of the business, we will communicate our reported 2015 revenue against 2014 revenue on an equivalent basis.
Revenue for 2014, on an equivalent basis, excludes Clinical Trials revenues reported in the third and fourth quarter of 2014. The 2014 revenue, excluded, is $41 million and $46 million in the third and fourth quarter, respectively.
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $321 million or 16.7% of revenues, compared to $296 million or 15.5% of revenues a year ago. The improvement of 120 basis points can be primarily attributed to the benefits of our tests and business mix, Invigorate program and continued integration synergies from our 2014 acquisitions. 
Lower amortization in the quarter versus a year ago negatively impacted the comparison of cash EPS to the prior year by $0.03. For the quarter, adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, grew 5% to $1.25. 
The company recorded after-tax charges totaling $52 million in the quarter, $41 million of which is associated with our recent debt refinancing. The charges also included restructuring and integration costs associated with our Invigorate program and recent acquisitions and combined to reduce reported EPS by $0.36.
Last year's second quarter included $24 million of after-tax costs associated with restructuring and integration charges, which reduced reported EPS by $0.16.
As a reminder, we also expect to book a gain related to the valuation of the joint venture with Quintiles. We will adjust this one-time gain out of our earnings.
Net debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.1%, 20 basis points better than last quarter, but up 20 basis points compared to a year ago. Our DSOs were 44 days, 1 day lower than last quarter and 3 days lower than a year ago. 
Consistent with the first quarter, we are adjusting our operating cash in the first half of the year to exclude cash charges for the debt refinancing. Adjusted cash provided by operations was $324 million in the second quarter of 2015. Reported cash provided by operations in the second quarter of 2015 was $275 million and was negatively impacted by cash charges of $49 million associated with the early retirement of debt in connection with the company's debt refinancing. 
For the second quarter of 2014, reported cash provided by operations was $280 million. Typically, cash flow is stronger in the second half. However, this year, we have an extra payroll cycle and a tax payment associated with a previously disposed business that together account for about $100 million. Despite these headwinds at the back half, we now expect adjusted cash provided by operations to exceed $850 million for the year. 
Capital expenditures were $61 million in the quarter compared to $49 million a year ago.
Moving to guidance. We expect full year 2015 results before special items as follows: Revenues are now expected to be between $7.49 billion and $7.57 billion, an increase of 2% to 3% versus 2014 on an equivalent basis; adjusted diluted EPS is unchanged, to be between $4.70 and $4.85; adjusted cash provided by operations is expected to exceed $850 million; and capital expenditures are also unchanged to approximately $300 million.
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

Well, first of all, what I said in my opening remarks is we do this analysis where we look at our stable accounts. We call it the same-provider, same-store analysis. And year-on-year, what we said they were consistent with the prior years. So on an existing basis, we feel utilization is stable versus the prior year. So that's point #1. Point #2, as I said in our direct remarks, we continue to steer our resources, our energy, around the higher profit portion of the marketplace, whether that's with better solutions and we've gotten some growth. Matter of fact you see our growth in our high rent portion of our portfolio growing faster than our top line growth, so that focus is paying off. And then it's also paying off in better revenue per requisition, and obviously, our growth in operating income. Some portion of that is related to growing the revenue in the right way to get profitable growth. And then -- I'll turn it to Mark because, as you know, in the past, we've talked about some business that we have reconsidered over the last few quarters, we still have that in Q2.

Glen, you're correct that, I think, some of that certainly is driven by some of the business that we've talked about for a while and that we thought was lower value add. And I think the fact that we -- we're able to grow revenue and earnings validates that walking away from some of that bulk volume, it was probably a good decision. And that does anniversary certainly through the second quarter. So we've talked about also the back half having easier comps than the front half. The other perspective I just want to provide is we've talked about the weakness of using requisitions for volume. Certainly, we're responsible for that. That's what we provide. But there certainly are some watchouts there. So the real important thing is obviously the test. And I could tell you that test volumes actually grow, despite the fact that requisitions volumes decline in the quarter. So we feel good about the volume. That's what we're trying to drive through our clinical franchise strategy is to actually drive a better outcome for patients with -- in many cases means actually filling in more richer requisition than it what it's been maybe in the past. And some of the business we've walked away were lower value, fewer test requisitions. So again, I just want to give you the additional perspective, actually test volume did grow in the quarter."

We also have been offering, A.J., access to our Blueprint for Wellness online. That's successful beyond Arizona. And as I said, we're expanding that for the Blueprint for Athletes offering. So as far as we're concerned, we're going to continue to evaluate where we get more aggressive in certain states where it makes sense, where we can still do it. As you know, all states are not created equal here, and Arizona was very strong in this regard. We're trying to see how Arizona goes. As I said that we're actually encouraged by the initial results from what we see in Arizona, and we do believe this is a trend we're on top of and we're very well positioned. Yes, you asked a question about Theranos, they continue to be a regional lab that's getting a lot of attention, as you know. Probably it's important for me to mention that part of the attention they have received is around Capital Blue in Pennsylvania. And I just wanted to reiterate for the people on this call that actually Capital Blue is a very strong partner of ours. And actually interesting enough, despite that news, we actually extended our long-standing relationship with Capital Blue with a new contract in January of this year. And we are their only national laboratory and its preferred provider. And actually, we have recently spoken with the CEO there, and he did note that the arrangement that they have with Theranos does not change in any aspect the agreement that they have with Quest. As a matter of fact, what we went on to talk about is the difficult challenges we faced in health care and what we can do together to help with the challenges of health care costs and help with his membership. And what we offered to him were the great quality and our great cost is an important part of the solution he sees for his marketplace.

It is in the states that have expanded Medicaid, that's your question. As you mentioned, you can read and what we've heard is those states have seen an increase in those lives entering the systems through hospitals, so there's some growth in volumes there. And also, we -- you probably have seen in the last half, we published a study where we looked at diagnosis of diabetes in those states have expanded Medicaid versus those states that did not, we actually saw an increase in the diagnosis of diabetes with those states that have expanded Medicaid. So the data is out there, that expansion for the low-income portion of our population continues to gain momentum. For all intents and purposes, it's -- the lives increase that we have seen and for all intents and purposes, it's hard to track because, as you know, it is the reduction we see at some portion of our uninsured patient volumes. So we think the momentum is building. The momentum is building for more insured lives. And as we said back 3 years ago, we believe when people have insurance, they need what we do, we're at the core of health care, where we're 70% of the health care decision-making at 2% a cost. So it's a very important part, getting a good baseline, understanding what's happening with someone's life, and therefore, as they enter the system, we're going to see those volumes. So Mark, would you like to add some color to Medicaid?"

Their experience with health care is either been nothing or going to the hospital in an emergency setting for a lot of them, and they continue, I'd say, to utilize the hospital to a greater degree than they will over time. So we're certainly expecting to get our fair share. But I think, to this point, we're not there yet. And as I said, they need to figure out how to find the primary care physician, navigate the very complicated health care system and then we'll see certainly more growth down the road. And we do see a growth that's fairly aligned with the states that have expanded Medicaid certainly versus the states that have not, and we absolutely are seeing a reduction in the volume of our uninsured."

So reactions from those customers that we've gone out and spoke about how we're going to act together at Q2 Solutions has been quite good, and we're encouraged by that. The second part of your question, Amanda, has to do with the work we're going to do together now to tease out, if you will, the value we can create for drug discovery. The first part of this is we have this incredible capability in clinical chemistry, and that our data is very strong. And so on the testing side, we believe by working proactively with pharma, we could be -- have an earlier birdseye access to what we could do with Diagnostics [indiscernible] and have that access to help us be well positioned as the companion diagnostic partner, with some of the new drugs that are launched to the market in years to come. That's one area that we're going to put some work into now, that the initial JV has closed. And the second is just the data that we've talked about. We have data, they have data, pharma has data and how do we collaborate together to use that data in a smart way to improve drug discovery, and one idea that people have talked about, we already have done some of this with our data already, is with better patient selection. And anything they could do to be more targeted and more precise and help with making drug discovery more efficient is a very good thing for our pharma partners. So that's what we're going to spend some time in. As I said in my remarks, we're going to take some time now to work with demands for team of Quintiles to see if we can find exactly what we will do.

So you should have confidence we've got a good handle on this. As far as pricing is concerned for 2016, what we shared is we see less pressure on the government side, this is what we know about the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule, Physician Fee Schedule. So that's encouraging. And then we already got the question on PAMA and what's happening in 2017 and beyond. We'll keep you abreast in what happens there. As far as visibility of pricing in the marketplace, as you know, the way patients and consumers engage with the marketplace, the question is, when do they actually have the out-of-pocket cost? And yes, we have published our own prices in Arizona, and we think those prices are very competitive. When you look at our average price per requisition, if you just go through our 10-K and you just make an assumption around test per requisition. You'll see a very strong value proposition from Quest Diagnostics in the marketplace. And, as you know, most people in this country have insurance. That's a growing percentage over time. So therefore, for diagnostic testing and, as you also know, there's a portion of the Affordable Care Act that was related to screening and diagnostic testing. Some portion of what we do does not have out-of-pocket cost to consumers. So how this all pans out as far as what the consumer will actually pay and/or prices affect general visibility and transparency of pricing in the marketplace, we'll see. The other -- the last part of this, I just want to reiterate, if you look at prices in this industry, this wide disparities prices, hospital outreach organization are sometimes in the neighborhood of 2x to 5x more expensive than our prices. We think transparency around all that for consumers and for health plans to provide to their membership is very important, and we're right back on all that, because we think that serves us very well as our quality and our price of that quality is really unsurpassed in our marketplace.

We'd like to see more transparency. Our largest natural -- national provider has a tool where people who are part of their plan can go to their site and can actually shop, and we think that's a real positive thing.

So I'm just trying to get a sense of how that's changed the discussion if anything that's had any impact as well on the types of multiples that sellers want from you."

Well, I'd just say in general, it's not changing our pace of our acquisition portion of our strategy. We have always had and we'll continue to have going forward as a portion of our restore growth strategy of having about 1% to 2% top line growth from acquisitions. So our growth strategy is both organic and through acquisitions. So it's an important part of our strategy and because of that, we've been actively engaged on it. So we announced the Memorial deal already. We said that we have more in our pipeline, so you should expect that there will be something else to come. As far as the deals itself, we continue to be very disciplined with how an acquisition would fit into our strategy. It has to be strategically aligned, and we have to meet our financial thresholds. And when we look at that, we continue to be prospective on what we think might happen with payment going forward. And you did mention PAMA and what could happen with the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule, but it is an unknown for the whole industry. So I would say, in general, that's not an active consideration right now, and just what's happening to the general environment, it's not changing our pace or perspective on any of this right now."

Obviously, you start with some of the things, basic such as procurement excellence, certainly some of the lab efficiencies that we're driving through our Quest Management System. We did talk about some things that probably are going to be skewed towards the back end in terms of the full savings that Jim Davis referred to specifically. The 3 planks about enablement, certainly are getting paid more for the work that we do and the value that we provide. Those things -- some of the things are going to take a little longer. Those certainly were in the early stages. We've talked about starting to implement credit cards in our patient service centers, starting to put them in some of our inter office phlebotomy to actually get payment more upfront than having to chase it after-the-fact, more similar to what the rest of the health care industry has been doing for quite a while. So it's not as if some of these things are going to not start till the back end. But some it is just going to take longer to get to their full level of savings.

Steve and Mark both mentioned gene-based and esoteric testing had grew very nicely in the second quarter, grew in the first quarter as well.

This morning we'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share industry trends and also review progress we are making executing our 5-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.
Well, we grew revenues, margins and earnings in the second quarter and made progress executing our strategy. Revenues grew 1% to $1.9 billion, adjusted operating income grew 9%, adjusted net income grew more than 8% and adjusted EPS increased 5% to $1.25.
This was the second consecutive quarter in which operating income grew faster than revenues. This underscores what we've been doing with executing our 5-point strategy. We are not just interested in growth at any cost. We are focused on driving profitable growth. And I'll speak about this more in a minute. Before we get into our strategy, I'd like to spend some time on industry dynamics.
After 2 years of some of the heaviest government reimbursement pressure this industry has faced, we're seeing a moderation of that government reimbursement pressure in 2015 and we don't see any significant headwinds for 2016. Any changes to the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule proposed as part of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, also known as PAMA, would go into effect in 2017. As you know, CMS continues to work on the rule-making process and the data collection that will help determine future reimbursement schedules. We appreciate the work done by CMS as well as the complexity of this task, and we will continue to collaborate with CMS throughout this progress -- process.
So on utilization, we continue to see stability in test volumes on a same provider basis during the quarter. 
Turning to the Affordable Care Act, we continue to believe it will be net positive for our company and our industry. The Supreme Court removed uncertainty regarding the future of the act in King versus Burwell. As we look at the impact on our business to-date, as you know, there are a lot of moving parts, and we don't have perfect information. But what we can say is that we are seeing growth in our Medicaid and Managed Medicaid volumes in different markets around the country as well as a decrease in our uninsured patient volumes.
These trends appear to be consistent with our expectations related to the new lives coming into the system. We expect this will improve over time as additional uninsured patients begin to access healthcare.
With greater certainty related to the Affordable Care Act, payer consolidation has dominated the headlines in recent weeks. Today, Quest serves all major national payers with an unsurpassed national network of laboratories, information services and logistics.
Healthcare in general and diagnostic testing in particular are characterized by significant disparities in price for similar services. It's not unusual for a test performed by a hospital lab to cost 2x to 5x as much as Quest. We offer tremendous value, providing the highest quality at a competitive price. We are very well positioned to help health plans narrow networks, achieve the most efficient network design and provide members with outstanding service.
Now let me shift to the progress we are making on our 5-point strategy, which is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our core diagnostic information service businesses and deliver disciplined capital deployment. 
Well, starting with growth. This is the third consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth on a consolidated basis. It was also the first quarter we recorded revenue per requisition growth in 3 years. Now let me talk about a few of the drivers.
Our regional sales teams that have now better aligned with the clinical franchises and the professional lab services team. We grew revenues in the quarter for several recent clinical franchise solution launches, including BRCA, Cardio IQ, noninvasive prenatal screening and HIV fourth-generation testing. We also continue to see growth in Prescription Drug Monitoring. Last quarter, we shared that gene-based and esoteric testing revenues grew at the fastest rate in a year. We were pleased to see that the growth rate continued during the second quarter. This focus on esoteric and gene-based testing has continued to be the increase in revenue per requisition. 
We continue to grow revenues from new relationships with hospitals and integrated delivery networks by helping them improve healthcare outcomes and reduce costs. 
Most recently, we announced an agreement to acquire MemorialCare Health System's laboratory outreach services business. This transaction fits well within our M&A guidelines, and is a smaller tuck-in type acquisition compared to some of the more recent deals we have completed. We expect the transaction to close in August. 
Our M&A and business development pipeline is strong, and we are optimistic about the opportunities our team are pursuing. 
We've said before, we're enhancing our diagnostic information services to help customers with population health, data analytics and decision support tools. These tools are driving growth and helping us deliver a superior customer experience. So for example, for physicians, our Interactive Insights offer provider trending data, interactive feature such as customizable reports and additional content, as videos and articles related to specific conditions and diseases. We have piloted these solutions with approximately 70 physician providers and are encouraged by the feedback. 
Now for hospitals. More than 100 customers are now using our IntelliTest Analytics solution. This easy-to-use tool provides hospitals, integrated delivery networks, physician practices with timely access to utilization insights to assist with laboratory test optimization decisions and driving cost controls.
And for health plans, we've extended pilots with health plans for our Quest Analytics platform. This self-service informatics tool enables health plan customers to query our massive database to help manage populations of patients and encourage the appropriate use of screening and monitoring tests to drive better health and follow guidelines. We've received very positive feedback. So we continue to build on our data analytics tools, and we will update you on our progress.
And then finally, consumerism is an emerging trend in health care, and we offer a number of compelling services in this exciting space.
We began to offer our Blueprint for Wellness health-risk assessment directly to consumers in 2010. Now we're getting ready to offer Blueprint for Athletes. Both athletes and their coaches and trainers as well as weekend warriors gain valuable insights on tailored training, recovery regimens, peak performance conditions and optimal dietary consumption. 
We also recently announced an agreement with HealthTap, a digital healthcare provider. HealthTap's virtual network of physicians can offer easy ordering of tests for patients from Quest Diagnostics. Doctors can see test results on HealthTap's platform and patients can access their own results using our patient portal of MyQuest application. More than 1.8 million patients have now downloaded our MyQuest application. A growing portion of those consumers are paying us a premium to gain access to their historical lab results and maintain access to the longitudinal test results.
And last week, we began to offering direct access testing to consumers in Arizona, where new launches took effect, enabling people to order tests without a physician script. We are operating this through our joint venture partners in our Quest laboratories, which builds on the strengths of our partner, Banner Health, the leading health care provider in Arizona. Initial interest in this service is very strong. 
As the responsibility for managing and paying for health care shifts rapidly to consumers, we are well positioned to be the consumer-friendly diagnostic-testing provider.
The second element of our strategy is driving operational excellence. Our Drive program is focusing on delivering a superior customer experience as well as allowing us to become more efficient.
We performed more than 3,000 different diagnostic tests in our large network of laboratories, many of which came to us through acquisitions with different laboratory information systems and building systems.
We're always looking for ways to improve the service we deliver, whether it's providing more than 90% of our results to doctors by 8:00 in the next morning or making more than 5 million phone calls a year to notify physicians of critical results they can act on. 
At our Investor Day last fall, we said we would be standardizing systems and processes. Since then, the portion of our legacy systems that are standardized has increased from 70% to 75%.
Our latest system conversion occurred without any disruptions to clients, which is very encouraging. We also drive and track a number of medical quality and service metrics related to a superior customer experience. Many of our service elements, such as availability of our Care360 physician portal and our specimen-tracking performance, are already at Six Sigma levels. In addition, we have -- saw improvements in several key areas, including wait times at patient service centers, installation of EMR interfaces to onboard new clients.
We continue to move closer to achieving our Invigorate goal of $1.3 billion and cumulative run rate savings by the end of 2017. 
As I mentioned at the beginning of this call, this quarter's strong operating income performance demonstrates the value we're creating from our improved efficiency.
The third element of our strategy is to simplify and strengthen our organization. We have been focusing on execution and building our performance-oriented culture. Our Quest Management System is the way we run the company by using a set of standard tools and processes. Additionally, we have been training our leaders and recently launched the leading Quest Academy to provide a rigorous forum for putting our Quest Management System's tools to the test. Academy graduates are now hard at work on teams focused on addressing opportunities and challenges facing our business. 
The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our core diagnostic information services business. We've made substantial progress in the last 90 days. As you know, we launched our newest joint venture, Q2 Solutions with Quintiles, in a capital-efficient way that provides us with a path to generating better growth and profitability for that business than if we had operated it as a stand-alone entity. 
We have a great partner and are excited about the opportunities for that venture. Quintiles will share more on the joint venture, including expectations related to financial performance, in their upcoming earnings call.
We are excited to be working with Quintiles exclusively for a period of time to combine our respective data set to help biopharma customers improve their drug discovery and development process. 
Lastly, we continue to review our portfolio, looking at options for noncore assets that can build value for our shareholders.
The fifth element of our strategy is delivering disciplined capital deployment. During April, we completed the refinancing of more than $1.2 billion of our debt that will lower interest expense for years to come. We also deployed our cash to reinvest in the business and continue to make progress on our commitment to shareholders by returning approximately $250 million year-to-date through a combination of share buybacks and dividends.
Now Mark will provide an overview on our second quarter financial performance, walk you through the details of our 2015 outlook, which is based on our strong operational performance. Mark?"
361335,303264907,837972,"Quest Diagnostics Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Quest Diagnostics Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues. Consolidated revenues of $1.93 billion increased by 1.2% versus the prior year and grew organically by 80 basis points. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 0.4% compared to the pri",719,"Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues. Consolidated revenues of $1.93 billion increased by 1.2% versus the prior year and grew organically by 80 basis points. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 0.4% compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, declined by 0.4% versus the prior year. However, revenue per requisition was 0.9% better than the prior year. And as Steve mentioned, it was the first increase in 3 years. 
While reimbursement pressure continued to be moderate, at just under 1%, we were more than able to offset that pressure from favorable tests and business mix shifts. The favorable test mix shift reflects the strong growth in our gene-based and esoteric testing.
Moving to Diagnostic Solutions business, which includes risk assessment, clinical trials testing, health care IT and remaining products businesses, revenues grew by 11% compared to the prior year. The Diagnostic Solutions revenues will be lower on a reported basis in the second half of 2015 as a result of the contribution of our Clinical Trials business to the joint venture with Quintiles. To provide you with a representative view of the operational performance of the business, we will communicate our reported 2015 revenue against 2014 revenue on an equivalent basis.
Revenue for 2014, on an equivalent basis, excludes Clinical Trials revenues reported in the third and fourth quarter of 2014. The 2014 revenue, excluded, is $41 million and $46 million in the third and fourth quarter, respectively.
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $321 million or 16.7% of revenues, compared to $296 million or 15.5% of revenues a year ago. The improvement of 120 basis points can be primarily attributed to the benefits of our tests and business mix, Invigorate program and continued integration synergies from our 2014 acquisitions. 
Lower amortization in the quarter versus a year ago negatively impacted the comparison of cash EPS to the prior year by $0.03. For the quarter, adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, grew 5% to $1.25. 
The company recorded after-tax charges totaling $52 million in the quarter, $41 million of which is associated with our recent debt refinancing. The charges also included restructuring and integration costs associated with our Invigorate program and recent acquisitions and combined to reduce reported EPS by $0.36.
Last year's second quarter included $24 million of after-tax costs associated with restructuring and integration charges, which reduced reported EPS by $0.16.
As a reminder, we also expect to book a gain related to the valuation of the joint venture with Quintiles. We will adjust this one-time gain out of our earnings.
Net debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.1%, 20 basis points better than last quarter, but up 20 basis points compared to a year ago. Our DSOs were 44 days, 1 day lower than last quarter and 3 days lower than a year ago. 
Consistent with the first quarter, we are adjusting our operating cash in the first half of the year to exclude cash charges for the debt refinancing. Adjusted cash provided by operations was $324 million in the second quarter of 2015. Reported cash provided by operations in the second quarter of 2015 was $275 million and was negatively impacted by cash charges of $49 million associated with the early retirement of debt in connection with the company's debt refinancing. 
For the second quarter of 2014, reported cash provided by operations was $280 million. Typically, cash flow is stronger in the second half. However, this year, we have an extra payroll cycle and a tax payment associated with a previously disposed business that together account for about $100 million. Despite these headwinds at the back half, we now expect adjusted cash provided by operations to exceed $850 million for the year. 
Capital expenditures were $61 million in the quarter compared to $49 million a year ago.
Moving to guidance. We expect full year 2015 results before special items as follows: Revenues are now expected to be between $7.49 billion and $7.57 billion, an increase of 2% to 3% versus 2014 on an equivalent basis; adjusted diluted EPS is unchanged, to be between $4.70 and $4.85; adjusted cash provided by operations is expected to exceed $850 million; and capital expenditures are also unchanged to approximately $300 million.
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

Well, first of all, what I said in my opening remarks is we do this analysis where we look at our stable accounts. We call it the same-provider, same-store analysis. And year-on-year, what we said they were consistent with the prior years. So on an existing basis, we feel utilization is stable versus the prior year. So that's point #1. Point #2, as I said in our direct remarks, we continue to steer our resources, our energy, around the higher profit portion of the marketplace, whether that's with better solutions and we've gotten some growth. Matter of fact you see our growth in our high rent portion of our portfolio growing faster than our top line growth, so that focus is paying off. And then it's also paying off in better revenue per requisition, and obviously, our growth in operating income. Some portion of that is related to growing the revenue in the right way to get profitable growth. And then -- I'll turn it to Mark because, as you know, in the past, we've talked about some business that we have reconsidered over the last few quarters, we still have that in Q2.

Glen, you're correct that, I think, some of that certainly is driven by some of the business that we've talked about for a while and that we thought was lower value add. And I think the fact that we -- we're able to grow revenue and earnings validates that walking away from some of that bulk volume, it was probably a good decision. And that does anniversary certainly through the second quarter. So we've talked about also the back half having easier comps than the front half. The other perspective I just want to provide is we've talked about the weakness of using requisitions for volume. Certainly, we're responsible for that. That's what we provide. But there certainly are some watchouts there. So the real important thing is obviously the test. And I could tell you that test volumes actually grow, despite the fact that requisitions volumes decline in the quarter. So we feel good about the volume. That's what we're trying to drive through our clinical franchise strategy is to actually drive a better outcome for patients with -- in many cases means actually filling in more richer requisition than it what it's been maybe in the past. And some of the business we've walked away were lower value, fewer test requisitions. So again, I just want to give you the additional perspective, actually test volume did grow in the quarter."

Arizona was notable because of the new law, and we're actively participating in that. I think, some portion of all markets will access the health care systems this way, not all, and will be a growing trend with, as I said, the trend around the consumer, and that's become increasingly important part of our business. We also have been offering, A.J., access to our Blueprint for Wellness online. That's successful beyond Arizona. And as I said, we're expanding that for the Blueprint for Athletes offering. So as far as we're concerned, we're going to continue to evaluate where we get more aggressive in certain states where it makes sense, where we can still do it. As you know, all states are not created equal here, and Arizona was very strong in this regard. We're trying to see how Arizona goes. As I said that we're actually encouraged by the initial results from what we see in Arizona, and we do believe this is a trend we're on top of and we're very well positioned. Yes, you asked a question about Theranos, they continue to be a regional lab that's getting a lot of attention, as you know. Probably it's important for me to mention that part of the attention they have received is around Capital Blue in Pennsylvania. And I just wanted to reiterate for the people on this call that actually Capital Blue is a very strong partner of ours. And actually interesting enough, despite that news, we actually extended our long-standing relationship with Capital Blue with a new contract in January of this year. And we are their only national laboratory and its preferred provider. And actually, we have recently spoken with the CEO there, and he did note that the arrangement that they have with Theranos does not change in any aspect the agreement that they have with Quest. As a matter of fact, what we went on to talk about is the difficult challenges we faced in health care and what we can do together to help with the challenges of health care costs and help with his membership. And what we offered to him were the great quality and our great cost is an important part of the solution he sees for his marketplace. So we're very well positioned with Capital Blue, and we're, again, one of their laboratories, but we're their only national laboratory and the preferred provider. So I wanted to share that with you. We obviously didn't share that publicly, but to give you some color of, in fact, what we have for our presence in many of our marketplaces despite the news you might hear from others."

It is in the states that have expanded Medicaid, that's your question. As you mentioned, you can read and what we've heard is those states have seen an increase in those lives entering the systems through hospitals, so there's some growth in volumes there. And also, we -- you probably have seen in the last half, we published a study where we looked at diagnosis of diabetes in those states have expanded Medicaid versus those states that did not, we actually saw an increase in the diagnosis of diabetes with those states that have expanded Medicaid. So the data is out there, that expansion for the low-income portion of our population continues to gain momentum. For all intents and purposes, it's -- the lives increase that we have seen and for all intents and purposes, it's hard to track because, as you know, it is the reduction we see at some portion of our uninsured patient volumes. So we think the momentum is building. The momentum is building for more insured lives. And as we said back 3 years ago, we believe when people have insurance, they need what we do, we're at the core of health care, where we're 70% of the health care decision-making at 2% a cost. So it's a very important part, getting a good baseline, understanding what's happening with someone's life, and therefore, as they enter the system, we're going to see those volumes.

So we're certainly expecting to get our fair share. But I think, to this point, we're not there yet. And as I said, they need to figure out how to find the primary care physician, navigate the very complicated health care system and then we'll see certainly more growth down the road.

The second part of your question, Amanda, has to do with the work we're going to do together now to tease out, if you will, the value we can create for drug discovery. The first part of this is we have this incredible capability in clinical chemistry, and that our data is very strong. And so on the testing side, we believe by working proactively with pharma, we could be -- have an earlier birdseye access to what we could do with Diagnostics [indiscernible] and have that access to help us be well positioned as the companion diagnostic partner, with some of the new drugs that are launched to the market in years to come. That's one area that we're going to put some work into now, that the initial JV has closed. And the second is just the data that we've talked about. We have data, they have data, pharma has data and how do we collaborate together to use that data in a smart way to improve drug discovery, and one idea that people have talked about, we already have done some of this with our data already, is with better patient selection. And anything they could do to be more targeted and more precise and help with making drug discovery more efficient is a very good thing for our pharma partners. So that's what we're going to spend some time in. As I said in my remarks, we're going to take some time now to work with demands for team of Quintiles to see if we can find exactly what we will do.

And what I'll share with you on the back half, you'll see some more. We have not broken it out, because typically what we do, Bill, is we take these opportunities and we fold those into our regions, and that's how we can get synergies so we can have advantages for Hospital systems working with us. In some cases, we offload some of the hospital, thus manually move into our closely located laboratories, which allows them to benefit from our effectiveness and our cost structure within the hospital environment. So it's more difficult to tease it out, but we're encouraged by the trend, and we think this is something that we've invested in as part of our growth strategy.

And -- so we're in that envelope. So I feel good about our visibility on that. So we've delivered to them what we said it would be to you all. So you should have confidence we've got a good handle on this. As far as pricing is concerned for 2016, what we shared is we see less pressure on the government side, this is what we know about the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule, Physician Fee Schedule. So that's encouraging. And then we already got the question on PAMA and what's happening in 2017 and beyond. We'll keep you abreast in what happens there. As far as visibility of pricing in the marketplace, as you know, the way patients and consumers engage with the marketplace, the question is, when do they actually have the out-of-pocket cost? And yes, we have published our own prices in Arizona, and we think those prices are very competitive. When you look at our average price per requisition, if you just go through our 10-K and you just make an assumption around test per requisition. You'll see a very strong value proposition from Quest Diagnostics in the marketplace. And, as you know, most people in this country have insurance. That's a growing percentage over time. So therefore, for diagnostic testing and, as you also know, there's a portion of the Affordable Care Act that was related to screening and diagnostic testing. Some portion of what we do does not have out-of-pocket cost to consumers. So how this all pans out as far as what the consumer will actually pay and/or prices affect general visibility and transparency of pricing in the marketplace, we'll see. The other -- the last part of this, I just want to reiterate, if you look at prices in this industry, this wide disparities prices, hospital outreach organization are sometimes in the neighborhood of 2x to 5x more expensive than our prices. We think transparency around all that for consumers and for health plans to provide to their membership is very important, and we're right back on all that, because we think that serves us very well as our quality and our price of that quality is really unsurpassed in our marketplace. And so the more volume we get around that, the better for us, we believe."

We'd like to see more transparency. Our largest natural -- national provider has a tool where people who are part of their plan can go to their site and can actually shop, and we think that's a real positive thing.

So those 2 large losses combined with the volumes that we've walked away from, we have made volume certainly a headwind for the last 12 months. But those comps get a lot easier in the back half."

And that 3% growth has allowed us to grow earnings to the level that we have, and it's real earnings. If you look at our operating income, it's up nicely versus last year. We're proud of that. And also we've got an expansion, margin expansion. So we think we've got the right formula here that we're working, and we'll continue that formula.

And then also how does this go over to pricing? I mean, obviously, that should be positive for average revenue per requisition. But just did we get a sense because pricing was positive for the first time in a very long time. I know you talked about is it the tariff's positive trend, but if you could just help us kind of like to think about a number of tests per requisition versus tests mix?"

And on your question about the revenue per requisition growth, just keep in mind that's a combination of both the pricing and reimbursement pressure that we're seeing as well as the benefits of some of the tests and business mix shift. So when you think about pure pricing, the reimbursement pressure, it's a little bit less than 1% for the quarter. And so how we got to that favorable revenue per requisition overall is really being driven by favorable tests and business mix shifts. Steve and Mark both mentioned gene-based and esoteric testing had grew very nicely in the second quarter, grew in the first quarter as well. And so some of the benefits of those additional tests on requisitions as well as a richer tests in some of the things that we are selling has benefited that revenue per requisition calculation."

This morning, I'll provide you with the highlights of the quarter, share a few comments on the industry dynamics and review progress on our 5-point strategy, and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.
We grew revenues, margins and earnings in the third quarter. Revenues grew 1% on an equivalent basis to $1.9 billion. Adjusted operating income grew approximately 7%, and operating margin expanded by 130 basis points compared to the prior year, once again reflecting improved operational efficiency. And adjusted diluted EPS increased approximately 7% to $1.28.
Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to talk to you about industry dynamics, starting with the recent CMS proposal related to PAMA. We are currently reviewing the draft and are sharing our perspective with the trade association. As you're well aware, this is an important issue for every lab because it will result in a refresh of CMS's Clinical Lab Fee Schedule, which will apply to independent physician and hospital laboratories for their fee-for-service Medicare payments. We have said all along that PAMA needs to be built on an accurate representative view of the market. We were disappointed that the draft provided as many limitations as it did to the definition of applicable lab.
In a recent study, the Office of Inspector General reported that the 2 largest independent labs represented only approximately 17% of the total Medicare spending from the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule, while hospitals and physician offices represented nearly half of the total Medicare spend. PAMA stands for protecting access to Medicare Act. It would be a terrible irony if the data collection process demanded by PAMA had the unintended consequence of reducing access to critical laboratory services that could cause some labs to close their doors to Medicare beneficiaries. Additionally, the coding and payment proposals recently released by CMS jeopardized the advancement of personalized medicine. These proposals failed to take into consideration the value provided from clinically validated information that further advances more targeted and sophisticated approaches to patient care. That said, we remain optimistic that the proposed rulemaking will result in an outcome that the industry can live with, even if it takes a bit more time to finalize.
Now let me shift to the progress we're making on our 5-point strategy. To remind you, it's to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on the core diagnostic information service business and deliver disciplined capital deployment.
Well, let's start with growth. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth on a consolidated equivalent basis. Let me share with you some key elements of our strategy. First, revenues from our gene-based and esoteric testing revenues continue to grow. We also saw significant growth from the infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and our industry-leading wellness business. Our science and innovation team continues to work with our clinical franchises to bring new solutions to the market. In October, we announced the launch of 2 companion diagnostic solutions for non-small cell lung cancer based on the recent FDA-approved Merck therapy called [indiscernible] as well as Bristol-Myers Squibb's therapy called OPDIVO. Both diagnostic tests are from Dako, an [indiscernible] company. Second, over the past few years, we've outlined our strategy to partner more effectively with hospital systems. We have shared our view that hospitals will look to partner with us in running their inpatient laboratories as well as their outreach service models, and we expect to announce additional agreements by the end of the year. Finally, over the past few quarters, we've shared additional proof points on our 3 information solutions that help customers with population health, data analytics and decision support tools. Specifically, our Interactive Insights for physicians are IntelliTest Analytics Solutions for hospitals and health systems and, finally, our Quest Analytics platform. In late September, we announced our partnership with Inovalon to deliver our data diagnostic solution. Our data diagnostic solution will provide a real-time point-of-service suite of analysis to physicians at the patient level. The solution will help physicians improve care through a better understanding of the patient's medical history and review that history against relevant quality metrics through the use of Big Data and real-time connectivity solutions. These solutions will help deliver valuable insights precisely when and where clinicians need them most. We believe this value-added information will help drive the transformation from volume to value-based health care.
The second element of our strategy is driving operational excellence. We continue to make progress with our focus on building enabling services, standardizing our processes data and systems and approving cash collections. We continue to move closer to achieving our Invigorate goal of $1.3 billion in cumulative run rate savings by the end of 2017. We continue to simplify and strengthen our [indiscernible] as the third element of our strategy. We are proud of the professionalism and commitment of our employees, which has enabled us to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the past 12 years. Quest Diagnostics was one of only 8 health care equipment and services companies listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index and 1 of only 11 companies listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index in the same category.
The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our core business. In July, we finalized the joint venture transaction with Quintiles. The new entity, now call -- known as Q Squared Solutions, is off to a great start, with strong culture built on collaborative strengths of both JV partners.
We continue to review our portfolio, look at options for noncore assets and are focused on building value for shareholders.
And then finally, we remain focused on the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $330 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividend and share buybacks. Additionally, we continue to invest in our business and announced 2 acquisitions. Looking forward, we continue to have a strong M&A pipeline.
Now Mark will provide an overview of our third quarter financial performance and walk you through the details of our 2015 outlook, which is based on our strong operational performance. Mark?"

Consolidated revenues of $1.88 billion increased by 0.9% versus the prior year on an equivalent revenue basis. That is, excluding the third quarter 2014 clinical trials revenue.

That is, excluding the third quarter 2014 clinical trials revenue. On a GAAP or reported basis, revenues were lower by 1.3%. Revenues per diagnostic information services were flat to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, declined by 0.2% versus the prior year. Revenue per requisition was 0.2% better than the prior year, marking the second consecutive quarter that revenue per requisition grew compared to the prior year. While reimbursement pressure continued to be a moderate headwind, we were able to more than offset that pressure through test and business mix. This reflects our strategy to grow our esoteric testing business and drive profitable growth.
Moving to our Diagnostic Solutions business, which now includes risk assessment, health care IT and our remaining products businesses. Revenues grew by approximately 18% on an equivalent basis compared to the prior year. That is again excluding the third quarter 2014 clinical trials testing revenue. On a reported basis, Diagnostic Solutions revenues were lower by approximately 17% from a year ago. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $325 million or 17.3% of revenues compared to $304 million or 16% of revenues a year ago. The improvement of 130 [ph] basis points can be primarily attributed to efficiencies from our Invigorate program. In the quarter, adjusted net income grew by approximately 7% compared to a year ago. For the quarter, adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $1.28, 6.7% better than a year ago. In the quarter, reported operating income benefited from the $334 million pretax gain on our contribution to the clinical trials testing joint venture. This benefit was partially offset by net charges related primarily to restructuring and integration costs totaling $28 million. Overall, net adjustments benefited reported diluted EPS by $1.17. Last year's third quarter reported operating income was reduced by $48 million or $0.22 per diluted share, principally due to restructuring and integration costs.
Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenues, was 3.9%, 20 basis points better than last quarter and 10 basis points better than a year ago. Our DSOs were 44 days, 2 days lower than the prior year and flat to last quarter. As Steve mentioned, we continue to improve our cash collections at a time when there is a growing portion for the health care bill paid by patients.
Reported cash provided by operations was $212 million in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted cash provided by operations was $188 million in the quarter, excluding cash tax benefits realized during the quarter related to the recent debt retirement. In the third quarter of 2014, reported cash provided by operations was $271 million. Cash provided by operations was lower than a year ago, largely due to a payment against certain tax reserves in the third quarter of 2015. Capital expenditures were $52 million in the quarter compared to $102 million a year ago.
Before moving to guidance, let me share a few comments to help you frame our guidance for the remainder of the year. First, we delivered strong results for the quarter that are in line with our expectations for the full year. Second, through the first 3 quarters of this year, we have shown steady growth in operating income and will continue to see improvement in Q4. However, this improvement will be largely offset by a higher effective tax rate in Q4. As a result, we anticipate a slower earnings growth rate in the fourth quarter than we have seen throughout the first 9 months of the year.
Moving to guidance. We now expect full year 2015 results, before special items, as follows: Revenues are now expected to be approximately $7.49 billion; adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization, to be between $4.75 and $4.80, basically unchanged from previous guidance with a tightening on both ends of the range; adjusted cash provided by operations to exceed $850 million; and capital expenditures are now expected to approximate $275 million.
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

Well, first of all, let me go back and refresh ourselves on where we've come from and the progress we've made, and then we'll talk about specifically what we're seeing in Q3. And Mark and I will tagteam this. First of all, if you",376,"Yes. Well, thanks, Ricky. Well, first of all, let me go back and refresh ourselves on where we've come from and the progress we've made, and then we'll talk about specifically what we're seeing in Q3. And Mark and I will tagteam this. First of all, if you recall back in 2017, we said in our first Investor Day that this had been a company that had declining volumes, and we needed to, first, slow down the rate of decline, flatten that out and start to show improvement and continue to show progressive improvement, and then it would take time. So if you think about the past few years, if you go back to 2013, our organic revenue declined by about 4%. And if you go back to 2013, our organic revenues shrank by about 2%. As you know, what we just said is in the last 4 consecutive quarters, we've seen organic revenue growing by about 1%. So we are making progress. And then if you look at it, what we're doing to grow our business and also grow our margins is to focus on the larger direct portion of the business and the retro portion of our business, which is the more sophisticated esoteric and genetic piece of our business, which is growing faster. And what you've seen for the last 2 quarters is nice progress in our revenue per requisition, which is helping us both on revenue as well as profit growth for the quarter. And then also our growth strategy, as you know, is not just related to organic growth but also grow through acquisitions. We do plan our strategy 1% to 2% or growth through acquisitions, with the exception of Memorial Care and what we just announced last night, which is a smaller acquisition in our ExamOne business. We haven't had a material acquisition as soon in the year as we expected. However, what you did here in my commentary is we do have a strong M&A pipeline, and we do expect to be seeing some of that come out in the months ahead. So let me turn now to Mark on what we saw in the third quarter in terms of our volumes and in the general environment we're seeing."

Ricky, as Steve mentioned, we are making progress. We certainly would have liked to have seen even stronger volume in the third quarter. We did see a couple of things, a couple of trends I'll mention. And as we've also talked about",287,"Yes. So thanks, Steve. Ricky, as Steve mentioned, we are making progress. We certainly would have liked to have seen even stronger volume in the third quarter. We did see a couple of things, a couple of trends I'll mention. And as we've also talked about in the past, we don't have any sort of independent market data. So our sense is that the market softened a bit in the third quarter based on the utilization basis. And I would point to is there was some softness broadly across all of our regions, which would suggest it's more market versus class performance, more pronounced in July and August, and it rebounded a little bit in September. Well, certainly stronger in September. And we've also looked -- share that we have what we call the same account analysis, which is our way of trying to assess utilization. And versus the trend we saw in the first half of the year, we definitely saw a bit of softness in that analysis. We also had been working closely with a couple of potential M&A targets. We saw softness in their volumes as well, which has also slowed down some of those deals to make sure that we understood how much of that was market and how much of that was unique to those potential targets. So just a couple of data points that definitely make us feel that there was some market softness in Q3. So yes, we would have liked to have made stronger volume progress. We do think it was largely market-based, certainly expecting to be somewhat temporary. But as Steve pointed out, we -- despite that, we still are continuing to progress [indiscernible] and restoring our growth."

And as I said in my commentary, we're not accepting those guidance -- those guidelines, and we now are in the comment period. We'll actually meet with CMS in November. When I say us, it's myself, Chairman of the trade association, American Clinical Lab Association, with some of my colleagues. We'll meet with CMS to talk through the glaring flaws in their collection of the data. As I said in my commentary, this is supposed to be a representative view of the marketplace to exclude a large portion of the marketplace, which based upon what we understand there are applicable lab definition will exclude a large piece of the physician's offices as well as some portion of the hospital marketplace. And as I said, that's a large piece of who's providing Medicare laboratory services. So that's a big problem. Second is, if you look to the timing they're going to receive feedback from a number of people, not just the trade association, but independent insurance parties in the fourth quarter. They need to then finalize the guidelines and then start collecting the data. Another inconsistency of what they sent out is a view that we can start providing the data in the first quarter of 2016. Well, we can't provide the data until we have a final rule. So that's a contradiction in what they've sent out, so we're going to talk to them about that. So as we all know, this has been pushed out. It's already been late. And again, this is supposed to be in a place where we're going to collect all the data in 2016 and refresh the clinical lab schedule by 2017. What I'm sharing with you is it's already late, and my sense is that we're going to have more delays in 2016 with finalizing the rules and then collecting the data and understanding how that does affect the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. As far as the potential reductions of Clinical Lab Fee Schedule, until we collect the data, I've said this all along, we don't know what the results are going to be. Frankly, when we looked at the data we've gathered, we shared the study from the trade association. There weren't notable differences when you do a fair representative view of the marketplace, and so we need to gather data to see what the results are. Now in their guidance that they sent out, they did speak to a couple estimates of what they think the range to be. And we've shared before that it's about 12% of our revenues for Quest Diagnostics. We're not going to speculate of what any reductions there could be because we're not certain about those, but it's 12% of our revenues. So whatever reduction there may be would have an effect on that 12%. So hopefully, that's clear."

It was very strongly felt by Congress that the right way to do it is to take a market-based approach, look at the market, understand what the people are paying on the commercial side and then reflect that in the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. To exclude 50% of who's providing Medicare laboratory testing is a glaring flaw in the definition of the relevant market. So we're going to be all over this. We have been all over this, and we'll continue to work it. And again, it has been delayed. It's hard for us to understand how they're going to be able to collect the data in the early part of '16 to be able to adjust this fee schedule in 2017, but that remains to be their goal. And we'll see how this evolves. But I'm sharing you with you exactly where we stand right on, and we have a huge issue as a trade association, but also in reflecting the access comments I've made.

And earnings growth, not earnings per share, but earnings growth of 8% to 10%. And that was going to be fueled by 3 drivers. One was going to be some of the continued synergies and leverage we would get out of the transactions we executed in the 2014 carrying into 2015. The second driver was our Invigorate program, which moving our goal from $700 million in run rate savings to $1.3 billion. And we didn't lay out how that would drop through by year. But given the size of that growth in savings and efficiencies, we talked about the fact that contrary to the past several years, it would be large enough to not just offset the headwinds that Invigorate had paid for in the earlier years of the annual wage inflation and some sort of price erosion but actually would contribute to the bottom line, and that would be significant. And then yes, the third lever was, as we returned to organic growth, if there's a fairly high drop through that would help as deleverage our earnings growth faster than revenue as well. So those are the 3 levers. And while we're a little bit disappointed in the softness of Q3, we have grown. As Steve pointed out, revenue was minus 400 basis points in 2013, minus 200 last year and plus 100 this year. So we are growing, and we are getting some leverage. And we expect to continue that progress. So a long-winded answer, but while we haven't given any guidance for 2016 yet, the outlook I laid out, it's just -- yes, we are confident that we will continue to grow our earnings faster than our top line."

When this goes well, we are their lab partner going forward. We've demonstrated this already with a number of joint ventures we had with a number of the outreach businesses we've acquired. We're clearly their lab partner going forward, and I think this is a direction that we'll see more of in the future as the health care system in this country continues to evolve. Now with these potential deals around what we call laboratory professional services and also outreach, they do affect our earnings and growth rate differently. And I think you're referring or asking the question about return in invested capital. So Mark, can you give some perspective on both sides of the growth with hospitals?"

What we talked about in the past is this is really organic. It's not a significant capital outlay. There might be a little bit of capital upfront as we transition some of the volumes into our labs and out of their labs, but it's not anything of significance. It is lower margin versus buying someone's outreach business. We're recapturing all the margin on a go-forward basis. The way these deals work is, given our economies of scale and our efficiencies, we can save them significant enough money to get them to sign a multiyear contract with us to perform that service for them, and we basically split that savings with them as part of the negotiation, but we don't have a large capital outlay. So from a roll-up perspective, these deals, while lower margin than our current business, are very attractive on a ROIC basis. And again, as I said, it's a source of organic growth that largely was unaddressable previously. So it's getting into a market in an area that inpatient, outpatient that is a new source of growth for us on the top line. On the outreach, we certainly expect to continue to pursue such deals. We've talked about how the economics work very well. They're basically paid out through cost synergies. We've demonstrated the ability to do that successfully. We know how to do that. And we think it's excellent for our shareholders. And it's part of the 2% to 5%. So when we talk 1% to 2% of M&A, it's really, those outreach businesses, small, tuck-in, fold outreach or small labs. But portion of that can be outreach. And we can fund that with our operating cash flow and still maintain our commitment to deliver a majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. So I wouldn't anticipate a significant shift in capital intensity to drive that strategy. Certainly, the professional laboratory services business is not going to require a ton of capital. And finally, on the outreach and around our M&A, we talked about the 3 metrics to use. One of them is that these need to be accretive to our ROIC plan of record by year 3, so we're very focused to make sure that even in the acquisitions, that we're growing our ROIC."

First of all, if you look at the market, there is a bunch of puts and takes, as you described it. First of all, we believe the Affordable Care Act and the number of uninsured decreasing will add more lives to the system. What we've said consistently, when people have insurance, we believe they mean what we do. And therefore, that would be good for us. Albeit what we have seen so far for lives in the system for the Affordable Care Act are much less than what we anticipated back 3 years ago, as we all know. But we said in the past 2 quarters that we are starting to see some of those Medicaid lives enter the system. So that is providing some volumes. And most people would agree that there will be increasingly uninsured in this country in the years ahead. And that's what we have modeled in our expectations going forward. So that's number one. Number two is, there is -- there continues to be a push for higher-deductible insurance programs offered to employee base health care offerings in this country. We believe it's about 40% of the [indiscernible] health care is high deductible, and that clearly has put pressure on utilization. I've said before that those of us that are blessed with being reasonably healthy are paying for the majority of our health care out of our own pocket. And so people have thought twice about using the system. And most people that agree that over the past 7 years or so that some portion of the utilization softness has been caused by this affect. And we believe actually that, that will continue. There will be more and more pressure on employers. They'll be pushing more responsibly to employees. Employees will consider when and where they use their health care system, and that will have an effect on utilization. Now with all that said, we think that's actually a good thing for our business because we offer such a strong value proposition, and we believe price transparency and the visibility of the wide variation of pricing and the synergies is actually a good fact for us, given our value and prices in this industry are so attractive. So that's the second effect. The third effect is we do have an aging population, us baby boomers. We already see that in our results. We talked about infectious disease growing. We're seeing some nice growth in hepatitis C as an example, where all baby boomers are encouraged to get tested, given the new drugs in the marketplace to cure that. The age of that baby boomers slug of our marketplace will continue to grow. The population grows. So you put all that math together, and we continue to believe that in the mid- to long term, this industry that we're in should be growing in value 2% to 3%. We believe there will be more value per test going forward, given the advancements and the introduction of new genetic-based services that we have demonstrated in our results as well. We believe that there are some submarkets that are growing faster than that, but some of that 2% to 3% is from the dynamics of what's happening overall in health care as well based upon more people with insurance, higher deductibles for those of us that get our health care from our employers, the aging population and the growth of the population. So hopefully, that provides a perspective you're looking for, for what we see in the macro market overall."

So if you think about our presence, particularly in the work lower health care, we have over 200,000 placements of our order entry results reporting system, called Care360. We interface with all the EMRs you can think of on the planet. The large EMR companies like Epic and Cerner and McKesson and also the smaller home-grown activities. We sell to 50% of physicians in this country. We sell to 50% of hospitals. So we're right in the center of the ecosystem of health care. So therefore, we have a large presence. And the nice thing about that is what we will do with Inovalon is attach their capability into the workflow physician. So it's not something they have to disrupt their workflow to get access to. And so we're working on the actual integration of their applications into our applications so the physician or the administration when they're working through the workup on the patient and the completion of gathering all information of the patient will be able to access all of the information. As far as good market, like so much of health care, it's obviously complicated. We have people that call on physicians, both primary care physicians and specialists. Those -- that portion of our sales force will be informed, and we are talking to their customers about this prospect. We also have an information sales force. These are highly specialized people that can get into more of the content associated with this. And Inovalon as well is providing some capabilities on the ground level as well as broadly to support the sale as well from a real specialist perspective. So it's a hybrid sales approach, but we are encouraged about the prospects for us and Inovalon going forward. And we have launched this in the fall to get off to a good running start in June -- going into 2016."

This morning, I'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share a few comments on the industry dynamics and review progress on our 5-point strategy, and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.
We grew revenues, margins and earnings in the third quarter. Revenues grew 1% on an equivalent basis to $1.9 billion. Adjusted operating income grew approximately 7%, and operating margin expanded by 130 basis points compared to the prior year, once again reflecting improved operational efficiency. And adjusted diluted EPS increased approximately 7% to $1.28.
Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to talk to you about industry dynamics, starting with the recent CMS proposal related to PAMA. We are currently reviewing the draft and are sharing our perspective with the trade association.
As you're well aware, this is an important issue for every lab because it will result in a refresh of CMS's Clinical Lab Fee Schedule, which will apply to independent physician and hospital laboratories for their fee-for-service Medicare payments. We have said all along that PAMA needs to be built on an accurate representative view of the market. We were disappointed that the draft provided as many limitations as it did to the definition of applicable lab.
In a recent study, the Office of Inspector General reported that the 2 largest independent labs represented only approximately 17% of the total Medicare spending from the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule, while hospitals and physician offices represented nearly half of the total Medicare spend.
PAMA stands for Protecting Access to Medicare Act. It would be a terrible irony if the data collection process demanded by PAMA had the unintended consequence of reducing access to critical laboratory services that could cause some labs to close their doors to Medicare beneficiaries.
Additionally, the coding and payment proposals recently released by CMS jeopardized the advancement of personalized medicine. These proposals failed to take into consideration the value provided from clinically validated information that further advances more targeted and sophisticated approaches to patient care. That said, we remain optimistic that the proposed rule-making will result in an outcome that the industry can live with, even if it takes a bit more time to finalize.
Now let me shift to the progress we're making on our 5-point strategy. To remind you, it's to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on the core diagnostic information service business and deliver disciplined capital deployment.
Now let's start with growth. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth on a consolidated-equivalent basis. Let me share with you some key elements of our strategy. First, revenues from our gene-based and esoteric testing revenues continue to grow. We also saw significant growth from infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and our industry-leading wellness business.
Our science and innovation team continues to work with our clinical franchises to bring new solutions to the market. In October, we announced the launch of 2 companion diagnostic solutions for non-small cell lung cancer, based on the recent FDA-approved Merck therapy called KEYTRUDA as well as Bristol-Myers Squibb's therapy called OPDIVO. Both diagnostic tests are from Dako, an Agilent company.
Second, over the past few years, we've outlined our strategy to partner more effectively with hospital systems. We have shared our view that hospitals will look to partner with us in running their inpatient laboratories as well as their outreach service models, and we expect to announce additional agreements by the end of the year.
Finally, over the past few quarters, we've shared additional proof points on our 3 information solutions that help customers with population health, data analytics and decision support tools. Specifically, our Interactive Insights for physicians, our IntelliTest Analytics Solutions for hospitals and health systems and, finally, our Quest Analytics platform.
In late September, we announced our partnership with Inovalon to deliver our data diagnostic solution. Our data diagnostic solution will provide a real-time point-of-service suite of analysis to physicians at the patient level. The solution will help physicians improve care through a better understanding of the patient's medical history and review that history against relevant quality metrics through the use of big data and real-time connectivity solutions. These solutions will help deliver valuable insights precisely, when and where clinicians need them most. We believe this value-added information will help drive the transformation from volume- to value-based health care.
The second element of our strategy is driving operational excellence. We continue to make progress with our focus on building eEnabling services, standardizing our processes, data and systems, and approving cash collections. We continue to move closer to achieving our Invigorate goal of $1.3 billion in cumulative run rate savings by the end of 2017.
We continue to simplify and strengthen our organization, which is the third element of our strategy. We are proud of the professionalism and commitment of our employees, which has enabled us to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the past 12 years. Quest Diagnostics was one of only 8 health care equipment and services companies listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index, and one of only 11 companies listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index in the same category.
The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our core business. In July, we finalized the joint venture transaction with Quintiles. The new entity, now known as Q2 Solutions, is off to a great start, with strong culture built on the collaborative strengths of both JV partners.
We continue to review our portfolio, look at options for noncore assets and are focused on building value for our shareholders.
And then, finally, we remain focused on the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $330 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividend and share buybacks. Additionally, we continue to invest in our business and announced 2 acquisitions. Looking forward, we continue to have a strong M&A pipeline.
Now Mark will provide an overview of our third quarter financial performance and walk you through the details of our 2015 outlook, which is based on our strong operational performance. Mark?"

On a GAAP or reported basis, revenues were lower by 1.3%. Revenues per diagnostic information services were flat to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, declined by 0.2% versus the prior year. Revenue per requisition was 0.2% better than the prior year, marking the second consecutive quarter that revenue per requisition grew compared to the prior year. While reimbursement pressure continued to be a moderate headwind, we were able to more than offset that pressure through test and business mix. This reflects our strategy to grow our esoteric testing business and drive profitable growth.
Moving to our Diagnostic Solutions business, which now includes risk assessment, health care IT and our remaining products businesses. Revenues grew by approximately 18% on an equivalent basis compared to the prior year. That is again excluding the third quarter 2014 Clinical Trials testing revenue. On a reported basis, Diagnostic Solutions revenues were lower by approximately 17% from a year ago.
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $325 million or 17.3% of revenues, compared to $304 million or 16% of revenues a year ago. The improvement of 130 basis points can be primarily attributed to efficiencies from our Invigorate program.
In the quarter, adjusted net income grew by approximately 7% compared to a year ago. For the quarter, adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $1.28, 6.7% better than a year ago. In the quarter, reported operating income benefited from the $334 million pretax gain on our contribution to the Clinical Trials testing joint venture. This benefit was partially offset by net charges related primarily to restructuring and integration costs totaling $28 million. Overall, net adjustments benefited reported diluted EPS by $1.17. Last year's third quarter reported operating income was reduced by $48 million or $0.22 per diluted share, principally due to restructuring and integration costs.
Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues, was 3.9%, 20 basis points better than last quarter and 10 basis points better than a year ago. Our DSOs were 44 days, 2 days lower than the prior year and flat to last quarter. As Steve mentioned, we continue to improve our cash collections at a time when there is a growing portion for the health care bill paid by patients.
Reported cash provided by operations was $212 million in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted cash provided by operations was $188 million in the quarter, excluding cash tax benefits realized during the quarter related to the recent debt retirement. In the third quarter of 2014, reported cash provided by operations was $271 million. Cash provided by operations was lower than the year ago, largely due to a payment against certain tax reserves in the third quarter of 2015. Capital expenditures were $52 million in the quarter, compared to $102 million a year ago.
Before moving to guidance, let me share a few comments to help you frame our guidance for the remainder of the year. First, we delivered strong results for the quarter that are in line with our expectations for the full year. Second, through the first 3 quarters of this year, we have shown steady growth in operating income and will continue to see improvement in Q4. However, this improvement will be largely offset by a higher effective tax rate in Q4. As a result, we anticipate a slower earnings growth rate in the fourth quarter than we have seen throughout the first 9 months of the year.
Moving to guidance. We now expect full year 2015 results, before special items, as follows: revenues are now expected to be approximately $7.49 billion; adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization, to be between $4.75 and $4.80, basically unchanged from previous guidance with a tightening on both ends of the range; adjusted cash provided by operations to exceed $850 million; and capital expenditures are now expected to approximate $275 million.
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

And Mark and I will tag team this. First of all, if yo",373,"Yes. Well, thanks, Ricky. Well, first of all, let me go back and refresh ourselves on where we've come from and the progress we've made, and then we'll talk about specifically what we're seeing in Q3. And Mark and I will tag team this. First of all, if you recall back in 2017, we said at our first Investor Day that this had been a company that had declining volumes, and we needed to, first, slow down the rate of decline, flatten that out and start to show improvement and continue to show progressive improvement, and that it would take time. So if you think about the past few years, if you go back to 2013, our organic revenue declined by about 4%. And if you go back to 2013, our organic revenues shrank by about 2%. As you know, what we just said is in the last 4 consecutive quarters, we've seen organic revenue growing by about 1%. So we are making progress. And then if you look at it, what we're doing to grow our business and also grow our margins is to focus on the larger rep portion of our business and the richer rep portion of our business, which is the more sophisticated esoteric and genetic piece of our business, which is growing faster. And what you've seen for the last 2 quarters is nice progress in our revenue per requisition, which is helping us both in revenue as well as profit growth for the quarter. And then also our growth strategy, as you know, is not just related to organic growth but also growth through acquisitions. We do plan our strategy 1% to 2% growth through acquisitions, with the exception of MemorialCare and what we just announced last night, which is a smaller acquisition, in our ExamOne business. We haven't had a material acquisition as soon in the year as we expected. However, what you did hear in my commentary, we do have a strong M&A pipeline, and we do expect to be seeing some of that come out in the months ahead. So let me turn now to Mark, what we saw in the third quarter in terms of our volumes and the general environment we're seeing."

We certainly would have liked to have seen even stronger volume in the third quarter. We did see a couple of things, a couple of trends I'll mention. And as we've also talked about in the past, we don't have any sort of independent market data. So our sense is that the market softened a bit in the third quarter based on utilization basis. And what I would point to is there was some softness, broadly, across all of our regions, which would suggest it's more market versus class performance, more pronounced in July and August, and it rebounded a little bit in September, well certainly stronger in September. And we've also looked and shared that we have what we call the same-account analysis, which is our way of trying to assess utilization. And versus the trend we saw in the first half of the year, we definitely saw a bit of softness in that analysis. We also had been working closely with a couple of potential M&A targets. We saw softness in their volumes as well, which has also slowed down some of those deals to make sure that we understood how much of that was market and how much of that was unique to those potential targets. So just a couple of data points that definitely make us feel that there was some market softness in Q3. So yes, we would have liked to have made stronger volume progress. We do think it was largely market-based, certainly expecting to be somewhat temporary. But as Steve pointed out, despite that, we still are continuing to progress and improve and restoring our growth."

And as I said in my commentary, we're not accepting those guidance -- those guidelines, and we now are in the comment period. We'll actually meet with CMS in November. When I say us, it's myself as chairman of the trade association, American Clinical Lab Association, with some of my colleagues. We'll meet with CMS to talk through the glaring flaws in their collection of the data. As I said in my commentary, this is supposed to be a representative view of the marketplace to exclude a large portion of the marketplace, which based upon what we understand, their applicable lab definition will exclude a large piece of the physician's offices as well as some portion of the hospital marketplace. And as I said, that's a large piece of who's providing Medicare laboratory services. So that's a big problem. Second is, if you look to the timing, they're going to receive feedback from a number of people, not just the trade association, but independent insurance parties in the fourth quarter. They need to then finalize the guideline and then start collecting the data. Another inconsistency of what they sent out is a view that we could start providing the data in the first quarter of 2016. Well, we can't provide the data until we have the final rule, so that's a contradiction in what they've sent out, so we're going to talk to them about that. So as we all know, this has been pushed out. It's already been late. And again, this is supposed to be in a place where we're going to collect all the data in 2016 and refresh the clinical lab schedule by 2017. What I'm sharing with you is it's already late, and my sense is that we're going to have more delays in 2016 with finalizing the rules and then collecting the data and understanding how that does affect the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. As far as the potential reductions of our Clinical Lab Fee Schedule, until we collect the data, and I've said this all along, we don't know what the results are going to be. Frankly, when we looked at the data we've gathered, we shared the Avalere study from the trade association, there weren't notable differences when you do a fair representative view of the marketplace, and so we need to gather data to see what the results are. Now in their guidance that they sent out, they did speak to a couple estimates of what they think the range to be. And we've shared before that it's about 12% of revenues for Quest Diagnostics. We're not going to speculate of what any reductions there could be because we're not certain about those, but it's 12% of our revenues. So whatever reduction there may be, would have an effect on that 12%. So hopefully, that's clear."

There was a bill passed by Congress, it's going called Protect Access to Medicare Act. It was attended to refresh our Clinical Lab Fee Schedule, which hasn't been updated since the '80s. It was very strongly felt by Congress that the right way to do it is to take a market-based approach, look at the market, understand what the people are paying on the commercial side and then reflect that in the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. To exclude 50% of who's providing Medicare laboratory testing is a glaring flaw in the definition of the relevant market. So we're going to be all over this. We have been all over this, and we'll continue to work it. And again, it has been delayed. It's hard for us to understand how they're going to be able to collect the data in the early part of '16 to be able to adjust this fee schedule in 2017, but that remains to be their goal. And we'll see how this evolves. But I'm sharing you with you exactly where we stand right now, and we have a huge issue as a trade association, but also in reflecting the access comments I made. When you look at the large part of this marketplace being provided for by small independent laboratories, and when you think about those rates not being included in the market, we know that, that could create an issue for many of them, and therefore, Medicare beneficiaries are not going to get their lab test, and that's going to be a huge issue for Congress.

We can build a nice business case related to cost synergies associated with those acquisitions. So it's been a deliver part of our strategy. It's key to what we believe will happen in this marketplace, that is more hospitals relying on us for their laboratory services. And the second part of our working with hospitals, our hospital outreach opportunities, where we help them with their inpatient laboratory, we are working on a number of very large opportunities there, and we hope to share some of that with you in the next few months and going into 2016.

Those are not large enough at this point and were not done early enough to contribute significantly in 2015. So therefore, a combination of a little bit of the unexpected volume softness in Q3 and then not getting a deal done -- a large-enough deal in a timely fashion is really the key drivers."

And I'm trying to understand, as you look forward, whether you think that kind of leverage, either through cost savings or other factors, is sustainable into 2016 and beyond. Do you think, if you don't see an uptick in sort of volume or pricing, that it would be -- you would have to revert back to sort of lower operating income growth? Or is there enough on the cost savings side that you can drive growth, even if the macro environment sort of doesn't improve? And then I do have a follow-up after that."

I'm sure you recall that at the Investor Day in November, I talked about and Steve talked about the fact that we foresaw 2% to 5% revenue growth through 2017. 1% to 2% of that coming from M&A, so an organic level of growth of 1% to 3% and earnings growth, not earnings per share, but earnings growth of 8% to 10%. And that was going to be fueled by 3 drivers. One was going to be some of the continued synergies and leverage we would get out of the transactions we executed in the 2014, carrying into 2015. The second driver was our Invigorate program, which moving our goal from $700 million in run rate savings to $1.3 billion. And we didn't lay out how that would drop through by year. But given the size of that growth in savings and efficiencies, we talked about the fact that, contrary to the past several years, it would be large enough to not just offset the headwinds that Invigorate had paid for in the earlier years of the annual wage inflation and some sort of price erosion but actually would contribute to the bottom line, and that would be significant. And then yes, the third lever was, as we returned to organic growth, and there's a fairly high drop through and that would help us to leverage our earnings growth faster than revenue as well. So those were the 3 levers. And while we're a little bit disappointed in the softness of Q3, we have grown. As Steve pointed out, revenue was minus 400 basis points in 2013, minus 200 last year and plus 100 this year. So we are growing, and we are getting some leverage, and we expect to continue that progress. So a long-winded answer, but while we haven't given any guidance for 2016 yet, the outlook I laid out, it's just -- yes, we are confident that we will continue to grow our earnings faster than our top line."

I've said in my introductory comments, we continue to believe that we can deliver on that goal we set out, which is the additional savings opportunity. We exited 2014 with $700 million run rate savings. We said there's another $600 million. The goal is now $1.3 billion. We are nicely on our way. You see that reflected in the results. But I'd like to also underscore another thing that you've seen in the last couple quarters, and that is the emphasis we have in our strategy is to continue to focus our energy and our investments on higher growth portion of our portfolio, the richer portion of our portfolio, which is more the advanced esoteric genetic-based services. We have said that that's growing nicely. You see that reflected in our revenue per req. So that headwinds that we've seen before, last 2 quarters we haven't seen. So we feel good about the progress we're making on that as well to make sure we get a better yield in our portfolio than what we've seen in the past. So you put all that together, coupled with the M&A, to just underscore what Mark said, we believe that the 2% to 5% growth of this business over a 3-year period is solid. And we believe the 18 -- 8% to 10% growth in earnings, real earnings, operating income, is achievable. So we're confident we can continue to do that as we go forward."

First of all, it's both, and it's both managing hospitals' inpatient laboratories in some form. In some cases, it might not be entirely, but some portion of it. And then finally, it's helping them with their outreach business. In some cases, we would acquire their outreach business, which we have done for the last 3 years. And as so much in health care goes, you see one strategy, you see one strategy. So we've engaged with the C-Suite around their lab strategy. When this goes well, we are their lab partner going forward. We've demonstrated this already with a number of our joint ventures we had, with a number of the outreach businesses we've acquired. We're clearly their lab partner going forward, and I think this is a direction that we'll see more of in the future as this health care system in this country continues to evolve. Now with these potential deals around what we call laboratory professional services and also outreach, they do affect our earnings and growth rate differently. And I think you're referring or asking the question about return on invested capital. So Mark, could you give us some perspective on both sides of the growth with hospitals?"

What we've talked about in the past is this is really organic, there's not a significant capital outlay. There might be a little bit of capital upfront as we transition some of the volumes into our labs and out of their labs, but it's not anything of significance. It is lower margin versus buying someone's outreach business, where we're recapturing all the margin on a go-forward basis. The way these deals work is, given our economies of scale and our efficiencies, we can save them significant enough money to get them to sign a multiyear contract with us to perform that service for them, and we basically split that savings with them as part of the negotiation, but we don't have a large capital outlay. So from a roll-up perspective, these deals, while lower margin than our current business, are very attractive on a roll-up basis. And again, as I said, it's a source of organic growth that largely was unaddressable previously. So it's getting into a market in an area, inpatient, outpatient, that is a new source of growth for us on the top line. On the outreach, we certainly expect to continue to pursue such deals. We've talked about how the economics work very well. They're basically paid out through cost synergies. We've demonstrated the ability to do that successfully. We know how to do that, and we think it's excellent for our shareholders. And it is part of the 2% to 5%, so when we talk 1% to 2% of M&A, it's really those outreach businesses, small tuck-in, fold-in outreach or small labs for that matter. But a portion of that is going to be outreach. And we can fund that within our operating cash flow and still maintain our commitment to deliver a majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. So I wouldn't anticipate a significant shift in capital intensity to drive that strategy. Certainly, the professional laboratory services business is not going to require a ton of capital. And finally, on the outreach and any other M&A, we've talked about the 3 metrics to use. One of them is that these need to be accretive to our ROIC plan of record by year 3, so we're very focused to make sure, even in the acquisitions, that they're growing our ROIC."

First of all, if you look at the market, there is a bunch of puts and takes, as you described it. First of all, we believe the Affordable Care Act and the number of uninsured decreasing will add more lives to the system. What we've said consistently, when people have insurance, we believe in, I mean, what we do. Therefore, that would be good for us. Albeit what we have seen so far for lives in the system for the Affordable Care Act are much less than what we anticipated back 3 years ago, as we all know. But we said in the past 2 quarters that we are starting to see some of those Medicaid lives enter the system, so that is providing some volumes. And most people would agree that there will be increasingly less uninsured in this country in the years ahead. And that's what we have modeled in our expectations going forward. So that's number one. Number two is there is -- there continues to be a push for higher-deductible insurance programs offered to employer-based health care offerings in this country. We believe it's about 40% of employer-sponsored health care is high deductible, and that clearly has put pressure on utilization. I've said before that those of us that are blessed with being reasonably healthy are paying for the majority of our health care out of our own pocket. And so people have thought twice about using the system. And most people would agree, over the past 7 years or so that some portion of the utilization softness has been caused by this affect. And we believe, actually, that, that will continue. There will be more and more pressure on employers. They'll be pushing more responsibly to employees. Employees will consider when and where they use their health care system, and that will have an effect on utilization. Now with all that said, we think that's actually a good thing for our business because we offer such a strong value proposition, and we believe price transparency and the visibility of the wide variation on pricing and the synergy is actually a good fact for us, given our value and our prices in this industry are so attractive. So that's the second effect. The third effect is we do have an aging population, baby boomers. We already see that in our results. We talked about infectious disease growing. We're seeing some nice growth in hepatitis C, as an example, where all baby boomers are encouraged to get tested, given the new drugs in the marketplace to cure that. The age of that baby boomers slug of our marketplace will continue to grow. The population grows. So you put all that math together, and we continue to believe that in the mid to long term, this industry that we're in should be growing in value, 2% to 3%. We believe there will be more value per test going forward, given the advancements and the introduction of new genetic-based services that we have demonstrated in our results as well. We believe that there are some submarkets that are growing faster than that, but some of that 2% to 3% is from the dynamics of what's happening overall in health care as well, based upon more people with insurance, higher deductibles for those of us that get our health care from our employers, the aging population and the growth of the population. So hopefully, that provides a perspective you're looking for, for what we see in the macro market overall."

First of all, we're very encouraged about the prospects, the opportunity with Inovalon. The reason why we think this is so encouraging and why Inovalon thinks it's so encouraging is our presence in health care. So if you think about our presence, particularly in the workflow of health care, we have over 200,000 placements of our order entry results reporting system called Care360. We interface with all the EMRs you can think of on the planet. The large EMR companies like Epic and Cerner and McKesson, and also the small home-grown activities. We sell to 50% of physicians in this country. We sell to 50% of hospitals. So we're right in the center of the ecosystem of health care. So therefore, we have a large presence. And the nice thing about that is what we will do with Inovalon is attach their capability into the workflow physician. So it's not something they have to disrupt their workflow to get access to. And so we're working on the actual integration of their applications into our applications, so the physician or the administrator, when they're working through the workup on the patient and the completion of gathering all the information of the patient, will be able to access all of that information. As far as go to market, like so much at health care, it's obviously complicated. We have people that call on physicians, both primary care physicians and all specialists. Those -- that portion of our sales force will be informed, and we are talking to their customers about this prospect. We also have an information sales force. These are highly specialized people that can get into more of the content associated with this. And Inovalon as well is providing some capabilities on the ground level as well as broadly to support the sale as well from a real specialist perspective. So it's a hybrid sales approach, but we are encouraged about the prospects for us and Inovalon going forward. And we have launched this in the fall to get off to a good running start going into 2016."

This morning, I'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share a few comments on the industry dynamics and review progress on our 5-point strategy, and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance.
We grew revenues, margins and earnings in the third quarter. Revenues grew 1% on an equivalent basis to $1.9 billion. Adjusted operating income grew approximately 7%, and operating margin expanded by 130 basis points compared to the prior year, once again reflecting improved operational efficiency. And adjusted diluted EPS increased approximately 7% to $1.28.
Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to talk to you about industry dynamics, starting with the recent CMS proposal related to PAMA. We are currently reviewing the draft and are sharing our perspective with the trade association.
As you're well aware, this is an important issue for every lab because it will result in a refresh of CMS's Clinical Lab Fee Schedule, which will apply to independent physician and hospital laboratories for their fee-for-service Medicare payments. We have said all along that PAMA needs to be built on an accurate representative view of the market. We were disappointed that the draft provided as many limitations as it did to the definition of applicable lab.
In a recent study, the Office of Inspector General reported that the 2 largest independent labs represented only approximately 17% of the total Medicare spending from the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule, while hospitals and physician offices represented nearly half of the total Medicare spend.
PAMA stands for Protecting Access to Medicare Act. It would be a terrible irony if the data collection process demanded by PAMA had the unintended consequence of reducing access to critical laboratory services that could cause some labs to close their doors to Medicare beneficiaries.
Additionally, the coding and payment proposals recently released by CMS jeopardized the advancement of personalized medicine. These proposals failed to take into consideration the value provided from clinically validated information that further advances more targeted and sophisticated approaches to patient care. That said, we remain optimistic that the proposed rule-making will result in an outcome that the industry can live with, even if it takes a bit more time to finalize.
Now let me shift to the progress we're making on our 5-point strategy. To remind you, it's to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on the core diagnostic information service business and deliver disciplined capital deployment.
Well, let's start with growth. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth on a consolidated-equivalent basis. Let me share with you some key elements of our strategy. First, revenues from our gene-based and esoteric testing revenues continue to grow. We also saw significant growth from infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and our industry-leading wellness business.
Our science and innovation team continues to work with our clinical franchises to bring new solutions to the market. In October, we announced the launch of 2 companion diagnostic solutions for non-small cell lung cancer, based on the recent FDA-approved Merck therapy called KEYTRUDA as well as Bristol-Myers Squibb's therapy called OPDIVO. Both diagnostic tests are from Dako, an Agilent company.
Second, over the past few years, we've outlined our strategy to partner more effectively with hospital systems. We have shared our view that hospitals will look to partner with us in running their inpatient laboratories as well as their outreach service models, and we expect to announce additional agreements by the end of the year.
Finally, over the past few quarters, we've shared additional proof points on our 3 information solutions that help customers with population health, data analytics and decision support tools. Specifically, our Interactive Insights for physicians, our IntelliTest Analytics Solutions for hospitals and health systems and, finally, our Quest Analytics platform.
In late September, we announced our partnership with Inovalon to deliver our data diagnostic solution. Our data diagnostic solution will provide a real-time point-of-service suite of analysis to physicians at the patient level. The solution will help physicians improve care through a better understanding of the patient's medical history and review that history against relevant quality metrics through the use of Big Data and real-time connectivity solutions. These solutions will help deliver valuable insights precisely, when and where clinicians need them most. We believe this value-added information will help drive the transformation from volume- to value-based health care.
The second element of our strategy is driving operational excellence. We continue to make progress with our focus on building eEnabling services, standardizing our processes, data and systems, and approving cash collections. We continue to move closer to achieving our Invigorate goal of $1.3 billion in cumulative run rate savings by the end of 2017.
We continue to simplify and strengthen our organization, which is the third element of our strategy. We are proud of the professionalism and commitment of our employees, which has enabled us to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the past 12 years. Quest Diagnostics was one of only 8 health care equipment and services companies listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index, and one of only 11 companies listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index in the same category.
The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our core business. In July, we finalized a joint venture transaction with Quintiles. The new entity, now known as Q2 Solutions, is off to a great start, with strong culture built on the collaborative strengths of both JV partners.
We continue to review our portfolio, look at options for noncore assets and are focused on building value for our shareholders.
And then, finally, we remain focused on the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $330 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividend and share buybacks. Additionally, we continue to invest in our business and announced 2 acquisitions. Looking forward, we continue to have a strong M&A pipeline.
Now Mark will provide an overview of our third quarter financial performance and walk you through the details of our 2015 outlook, which is based on our strong operational performance. Mark?"

Consolidated revenues of $1.88 billion increased by 0.9% versus the prior year on an equivalent-revenue basis, that is excluding the third quarter 2014 Clinical Trials revenue. On a GAAP or reported basis, revenues were lower by 1.3%. Revenues per diagnostic information services were flat to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, declined by 0.2% versus the prior year. Revenue per requisition was 0.2% better than the prior year, marking the second consecutive quarter that revenue per requisition grew compared to the prior year. While reimbursement pressure continued to be a moderate headwind, we were able to more than offset that pressure through test and business mix. This reflects our strategy to grow our esoteric testing business and drive profitable growth.
Moving to our Diagnostic Solutions business, which now includes risk assessment, health care IT and our remaining products businesses. Revenues grew by approximately 18% on an equivalent basis compared to the prior year. That is again excluding the third quarter 2014 Clinical Trials testing revenue. On a reported basis, Diagnostic Solutions revenues were lower by approximately 17% from a year ago.
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $325 million or 17.3% of revenues, compared to $304 million or 16% of revenues a year ago. The improvement of 130 basis points can be primarily attributed to efficiencies from our Invigorate program.
In the quarter, adjusted net income grew by approximately 7% compared to a year ago. For the quarter, adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $1.28, 6.7% better than a year ago. In the quarter, reported operating income benefited from the $334 million pretax gain on our contribution to the Clinical Trials testing joint venture. This benefit was partially offset by net charges related primarily to restructuring and integration costs totaling $28 million. Overall, net adjustments benefited reported diluted EPS by $1.17. Last year's third quarter reported operating income was reduced by $48 million or $0.22 per diluted share, principally due to restructuring and integration costs.
Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.9%, 20 basis points better than last quarter and 10 basis points better than a year ago. Our DSOs were 44 days, 2 days lower than the prior year and flat to last quarter. As Steve mentioned, we continue to improve our cash collections at a time when there is a growing portion for the health care bill paid by patients.
Reported cash provided by operations was $212 million in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted cash provided by operations was $188 million in the quarter, excluding cash tax benefits realized during the quarter related to the recent debt retirement. In the third quarter of 2014, reported cash provided by operations was $271 million. Cash provided by operations was lower than the year ago, largely due to a payment against certain tax reserves in the third quarter of 2015. Capital expenditures were $52 million in the quarter, compared to $102 million a year ago.
Before moving to guidance, let me share a few comments to help you frame our guidance for the remainder of the year. First, we delivered strong results for the quarter that are in line with our expectations for the full year. Second, through the first 3 quarters of this year, we have shown steady growth in operating income and will continue to see improvement in Q4. However, this improvement will be largely offset by a higher effective tax rate in Q4. As a result, we anticipate a slower earnings growth rate in the fourth quarter than we have seen throughout the first 9 months of the year.
Moving to guidance. We now expect full year 2015 results, before special items, as follows: revenues are now expected to be approximately $7.49 billion; adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization, to be between $4.75 and $4.80, basically unchanged from previous guidance with a tightening on both ends of the range; adjusted cash provided by operations to exceed $850 million; and capital expenditures are now expected to approximate $275 million.
Now let me turn it back to Steve."

Well, first of all, let me go back and refresh ourselves on where we've come from and the progress we've made, and then we'll talk about specifically what we're seeing in Q3. And Mark and I will tag team this. First of all, if you recall back in 2017, we said at our first Investor Day that this had been a company that had declining volumes, and we needed to, first, slow down the rate of decline, flatten that out and start to show improvement and continue to show progressive improvement, and that it would take time. So if you think about the past few years, if you go back to 2013, our organic revenue declined by about 4%. And if you go back to 2013, our organic revenues shrank by about 2%. As you know, what we just said is in the last 4 consecutive quarters, we've seen our organic revenue growing by about 1%. So we are making progress. And then if you look at it, what we're doing to grow our business and also grow our margins is to focus on the larger rep portion of our business and the richer rep portion of our business, which is the more sophisticated esoteric and genetic piece of our business, which is growing faster. And what you've seen for the last 2 quarters is nice progress in our revenue per requisition, which is helping us both in revenue as well as profit growth for the quarter. And then also our growth strategy, as you know, is not just related to organic growth but also growth through acquisitions. We do plan our strategy 1% to 2% growth through acquisitions, with the exception of MemorialCare and what we just announced last night, which is a smaller acquisition, in our ExamOne business. We haven't had a material acquisition as soon in the year as we expected. However, what you did hear in my commentary, we do have a strong M&A pipeline, and we do expect to be seeing some of that come out in the months ahead. So let me turn now to Mark, of what we saw in the third quarter in terms of our volumes and the general environment we're seeing."

We certainly would have liked to have seen even stronger volume in the third quarter. We did see a couple of things, a couple of trends I'll mention. And as we've also talked about in the past, we don't have any sort of independent market data. So our sense is that the market softened a bit in the third quarter based on a utilization basis. And what I would point to is there was some softness, broadly, across all of our regions, which would suggest it's more market versus class performance, more pronounced in July and August, and it rebounded a little bit in September, it was certainly stronger in September. And we've also looked and shared that we have what we call the same-account analysis, which is our way of trying to assess utilization. And versus the trend we saw in the first half of the year, we definitely saw a bit of softness in that analysis. We also had been working closely with a couple of potential M&A targets. We saw softness in their volumes as well, which has also slowed down some of those deals to make sure that we understood how much of that was market and how much of that was unique to those potential targets. So just a couple of data points that definitely make us feel that there was some market softness in Q3. So yes, we would have liked to have made stronger volume progress. We do think it was largely market-based, certainly expecting to be somewhat temporary. But as Steve pointed out, despite that, we still are continuing to progress and improve in restoring our growth."

And as I said in my commentary, we're not accepting those guidance -- those guidelines, and we now are in the comment period. We'll actually meet with CMS in November. When I say us, it's myself as chairman of the trade association, American Clinical Lab Association, with some of my colleagues. We'll meet with CMS to talk through the glaring flaws in their collection of the data. As I said in my commentary, this is supposed to be a representative view of the marketplace to exclude a large portion of the marketplace, which based upon what we understand, their applicable lab definition will exclude a large piece of the physician's offices as well as some portion of the hospital marketplace. And as I said, that's a large piece of who's providing Medicare laboratory services. So that's a big problem. Second is, if you look to the timing, they're going to receive feedback from a number of people, not just the trade association, but independent concerned parties in the fourth quarter. They need to then finalize the guideline and then start collecting the data. Another inconsistency of what they sent out is a view that we could start providing the data in the first quarter of 2016. Well, we can't provide the data until we have a final rule, so that's a contradiction in what they've sent out, so we're going to talk to them about that. So as we all know, this has been pushed out. It's already been late. And again, this is supposed to be in a place where we're going to collect all the data in 2016 and refresh the clinical lab schedule by 2017. What I'm sharing with you is it's already late, and my sense is that we're going to have more delays in 2016 with finalizing the rules and then collecting the data and understanding how that does affect the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. As far as the potential reductions of our Clinical Lab Fee Schedule, until we collect the data, and I've said this all along, we don't know what the results are going to be. Frankly, when we looked at the data we've gathered, we shared the Avalere study from the trade association, there weren't notable differences when you do a fair representative view of the marketplace, and so we need to gather data to see what the results are. Now in their guidance that they sent out, they did speak to a couple estimates of what they think the range to be. And we've shared before that it's about 12% of revenues for Quest Diagnostics. We're not going to speculate of what any reductions there could be because we're not certain about those, but it's 12% of our revenues. So whatever reduction there may be, would have an effect on that 12%. So hopefully, that's clear."

To exclude 50% of who's providing Medicare laboratory testing is a glaring flaw in the definition of the relevant market. So we're going to be all over this. We have been all over this, and we'll continue to work it. And again, it has been delayed. It's hard for us to understand how they're going to be able to collect the data in the early part of '16 to be able to adjust this fee schedule in 2017, but that remains to be their goal. And we'll see how this evolves. But I'm sharing with you exactly where we stand right now, and we have a huge issue as a trade association, but also in reflecting the access comments I made. When you look at the large part of this marketplace being provided for by small independent laboratories, and you think about those rates not being included in the market, we know that, that could create an issue for many of them, and therefore, Medicare beneficiaries are not going to get their lab test, and that's going to be a huge issue for Congress. So we're going to work our way through this, but we're going to do this in due course of the process that we have with them within CMS."

But the other one is, if you recall, after the first quarter, when we had a little more impact from weather than we had anticipated, at that point, I shared that, for us to get towards the upper end of the range, we would have had to execute some meaningful M&A.

That -- it was going to take some M&A. So as you've seen, that we have announced 2 deals this year. One of them, just last night, Superior and then MemorialCare. Those are not large enough at this point and were not done early enough to contribute significantly in 2015.

Do you think, if you don't see an uptick in sort of volume or pricing, that it would be -- you would have to revert back to sort of lower operating income growth? Or is there enough on the cost savings side that you can drive growth, even if the macro environment sort of doesn't improve? And then I do have a follow-up after that."

I'm sure you recall that at the Investor Day in November, I talked about and Steve talked about the fact that we foresaw 2% to 5% revenue growth through 2017. 1% to 2% of that coming from M&A, so an organic level of growth of 1% to 3% and earnings growth, not earnings per share, but earnings growth of 8% to 10%. And that was going to be fueled by 3 drivers. One was going to be some of the continued synergies and leverage we would get out of the transactions we executed into 2014, carrying into 2015. The second driver was our Invigorate program, which moving our goal from $700 million in run rate savings to $1.3 billion. And we didn't lay out how that would drop through by year. But given the size of that growth in savings and efficiencies, we talked about the fact that, contrary to the past several years, it would be large enough to not just offset the headwinds that Invigorate had paid for in the earlier years of the annual wage inflation and some sort of price erosion but actually would contribute to the bottom line, and that would be significant. And then yes, the third lever was, as we returned to organic growth, and there's a fairly high drop through and that would help us to leverage our earnings growth faster than revenue as well. So those are the 3 levers. And while we're a little bit disappointed in the softness of Q3, we have grown. As Steve pointed out, revenue was minus 400 basis points in 2013, minus 200 last year and plus 100 this year. So we are growing, and we are getting some leverage, and we expect to continue that progress. So a long-winded answer, but while we haven't given any guidance for 2016 yet, the outlook I laid out, it's just -- yes, we are confident that we will continue to grow our earnings faster than our top line."

We exited 2014 with $700 million run rate savings. We said there's another $600 million. The goal is now $1.3 billion. We are nicely on our way. You see that reflected in the results. But I'd like to also underscore another thing that you've seen in the last couple quarters, and that is the emphasis we have in our strategy is to continue to focus our energy and our investments on higher growth portion of our portfolio, the richer portion of our portfolio, which is more the advanced esoteric genetic-based services. We have said that that's growing nicely. You see that reflected in our revenue per req. So that headwinds that we've seen before, last 2 quarters we haven't seen. So we feel good about the progress we're making on that as well to make sure we get a better yield in our portfolio than what we've seen in the past.

First of all, it's both, and it's both managing hospitals' inpatient laboratories in some form. In some cases, it might not be entirely, but some portion of it. And then finally is helping them with their outreach business. In some cases, we would acquire their outreach business, which we have done for the last 3 years. And as so much in health care goes, you see one strategy, you see one strategy. So we've engaged with the C-Suite around their lab strategy. When this goes well, we are their lab partner going forward. We've demonstrated this already with a number of our joint ventures we have, with a number of the outreach businesses we've acquired. We're clearly their lab partner going forward, and I think this is a direction that we'll see more of in the future as this health care system in this country continues to evolve. Now with these potential deals around what we call laboratory professional services and also outreach, they do affect our earnings and growth rate differently. And I think you're referring or asking the question about return on invested capital. So Mark, could you give us some perspective on both sides of the growth with hospitals?"

What we've talked about in the past is this is really organic, there's not a significant capital outlay. There might be a little bit of capital upfront as we transition some of the volumes into our labs and out of their labs, but it's not anything of significance. It is lower margin versus buying someone's outreach business, where we're capturing all the margin on a go-forward basis. The way these deals work is, given our economies of scale and our efficiencies, we can save them significant enough money to get them to sign a multiyear contract with us to perform that service for them, and we basically split that savings with them as part of the negotiation, but we don't have a large capital outlay. So from a ROIC perspective, these deals, while lower margin than our current business, are very attractive on a ROIC basis. And again, as I said, it's a source of organic growth that largely was unaddressable previously. So it's getting into a market in an area, inpatient, outpatient, that is a new source of growth for us on the top line. On the outreach, we certainly expect to continue to pursue such deals. We've talked about how the economics work very well. They're basically paid out through cost synergies. We've demonstrated the ability to do that successfully. We know how to do that, and we think it's excellent for our shareholders. And it is part of the 2% to 5%, so when we talk 1% to 2% of M&A, it's really those outreach businesses, small tuck-in, fold-in outreach or small labs for that matter. But a portion of that is going to be outreach. And we can fund that within our operating cash flow and still maintain our commitment to deliver a majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. So I wouldn't anticipate a significant shift in capital intensity to drive that strategy. Certainly, the professional laboratory services business is not going to require a ton of capital. And finally, on the outreach and any other M&A, we've talked about the 3 metrics to use. One of them is that these need to be accretive to our ROIC plan of record by year 3, so we're very focused to make sure, even in the acquisitions, that they're growing our ROIC."

First of all, we believe the Affordable Care Act and the number of uninsured decre",607,"Yes. Sure, Dave. I'll take this to start, and I'm sure Mark will add to it. First of all, if you look at the market, there is a bunch of puts and takes, as you describe it. First of all, we believe the Affordable Care Act and the number of uninsured decreasing will add more lives to the system. What we've said consistently, when people have insurance, we believe they need what we do. And therefore, that would be good for us. Albeit what we have seen so far for lives in the system for the Affordable Care Act are much less than what we anticipated back 3 years ago, as we all know. But we said in the past few quarters that we are starting to see some of those Medicaid lives enter the system, so that is providing some volumes. And most people would agree that there will be increasingly less uninsured in this country in the years ahead. And that's what we have modeled in our expectations going forward. So that's number one. Number two is there is -- there continues to be a push for higher-deductible insurance programs offered to employer-based health care offerings in this country. We believe it's about 40% of employer-sponsored health care is high deductible, and that clearly has put pressure on utilization. I've said before that those of us that are blessed with being reasonably healthy are paying for the majority of our health care out of our own pocket. And so people have thought twice about using the system. And most people would agree, over the past 7 years or so that some portion of the utilization softness has been caused by this affect. And we believe, actually, that, that will continue. There will be more and more pressure on employers. They'll be pushing more responsibility to employees. Employees will consider when and where they use the health care system, and that will have an effect on utilization. Now with all that said, we think that's actually a good thing for our business because we offer such a strong value proposition, and we believe price transparency and the visibility of the wide variation on pricing and the synergy is actually a good fact for us, given our value and our prices in this industry are so attractive. So that's the second effect. The third effect is we do have an aging population, us baby boomers. We already see that in our results. We talked about infectious disease growing. We're seeing some nice growth in hepatitis C, as an example, where all baby boomers are encouraged to get tested, given the new drugs in the marketplace to cure that. The age of that baby boomer slug of our marketplace will continue to grow. The population grows. So you put all that math together, and we continue to believe that in the mid- to long term, this industry that we're in should be growing in value, 2% to 3%. We believe there will be more value per test going forward, given the advancements and the introduction of new genetic-based services that we have demonstrated in our results as well. We believe that there are some submarkets that are growing faster than that, but some of that 2% to 3% is from the dynamics of what's happening overall in health care as well, based upon more people with insurance, higher deductibles for those of us that get our health care from our employers, the aging population and the growth in the population. So hopefully, that provides the perspective you're looking for, for what we see in the macro market overall."

And the nice thing about that is what we will do with Inovalon is attach their capability into the workflow physician. So it's not something they have to disrupt their workflow to get access to. And so we're working on the actual integration of their applications into our applications, so the physician or the administrator, when they're working through the workup on the patient and the completion of gathering all the information on the patient, we'll be able to access all that information. As far as go to market, like so much in health care, it's obviously complicated. We have people that call on physicians, both primary care physicians and all specialists. Those -- that portion of our sales force will be informed, and we are talking to their customers about this prospect. We also have an information sales force. These are highly specialized people that can get into more of the content associated with this. And Inovalon as well is providing some capabilities on the ground level as well as broadly to support the sale as well from a real specialist perspective. So it's a hybrid sales approach, but we are encouraged about the prospects for us and Inovalon going forward. And we have launched this in the fall to get off to a good running start going into 2016."

So we think the 50-50 split fairly recognizes the value we deliver and the value they deliver, and that's a good partnership. So we're -- we think that's a fair split, but we are happy about the value we think we bring to the table because we think it's a good opportunity for us."
